youll get teleported here! (moves to right pod)
"Its the masterwork of my beautiful daughter, Lucca."
woman
Luccas inventions never work right.
boy
Check out that girls glasses!
old man
She could probably see the back side of the moon with those.
Taban
"Give it a try, kid? �Oh, its you, Crono!"
Lucca
Crono! Where have you been!? No one wants to try the Telepod! How about
you?
Marle
It looks like fun! Ill watch while you try it out!
Lucca
Just hop onto the left pod!
Taban
"Dont worry, we tried it on our pets! Theres no reason why"
it shouldnt work as well on humans!
"So, step right up!"
(Crono steps onto the left pod)
All systems on!
Lucca
Begin energy transfer!
crowd
(Crono teleports to right pod)
Oh wow. That was GREAT!
woman
"I guess even HER inventions have to work, sometimes."
old man
Wow!
Lucca
So how was it? Want to try it again?
Taban
"It�WORKED?! I CANT BELIEVE IT! Uh, er, a thrilling display"
"of science at its best, ladies and gentlemen!"
Marle
"What a kick! I want to try it, too!"
Lucca
"Huh? Hey Crono, how did you pick up a cutie like her?"
Marle
"Hang on, Crono! Ill be right there!"
Taban
"Behold, ladies and gentlemen, as this vision of loveliness steps aboard"
the machine!
Marle
Dont go away. Ill be right back!
Taban
Youre sure about this�? Theres still time to change
your mind!
Marle
No way! Throw the switch!
Taban
"Okay, everyone, lets give her a great big hand when she reappears!"
All systems on!
Lucca
Begin energy transfer!
Marle
(pendant begins to sparkle)
Whats happening? My pendant�its
Lucca
(sparks fly between pods)
Huh?
Taban
(Marle disappears into gate)
"Lucca! Where is she?! Shows over, folks! Lets head along now!"
Whats going on Lucca? WHERE IS SHE?
Lucca
The way she disappeared� It couldnt have been the Telepod!
The warp field seemed to be affected by her pendant
Taban
What are we going to do now?
Lucca
Shes so familiar! I KNOW Ive seen her somewhere
(Crono gets on left pod)
Crono!
Taban
Youre actually going to do it?! What a fine lad!
Lucca
"Listen! I dont know where this machine is going to send you, but"
we havent any other choice.
Taban
Wont they both be lost?
Lucca
"This is our only hope! That pendant seems to be the key, so hang on to"
"it Crono, and brace yourself!"
Taban
All systems on!
Lucca
Begin energy transfer! Power to full!
Taban
Roger!
Lucca
More! Give me more power!
Taban
Roger!
Lucca
(sparks fly between pods)
There! We did it!
(Crono disappears into gate)

We all thought Magus had grabbed her.
Thank goodness shes safe!
Toma

 Sure. » Cider please! Thanks!
Its about the missing Queen. She disappeared while visiting that cathedral

is inaccessible.
Residence
Banta
"Im Banta, the blacksmith. Im forging a bell for the King"
to present to his beloved Queen Leene! I lost it when the Queen disappeared.
I just couldnt keep working on the bell. But now its back to
business as usual!
Banta's wife

nail!
Guardia Castle
soldiers
at entrance
"Halt! Who goes there! Check out that hair! Wherere you from, son? Are"
you one of Maguss troopers? Hardly! This kid never would have made

#2: Mind your manners!
Chancellor
Hmmm� (leaves)
King Guardia XXI
"Sir! I understand that you are the one who saved my dear wife, the Queen!"
But can you tell me what happened? Leenes acting rather odd. And she
"seems to have lost her coral pin, which is something she guarded with her"
life� Forgive me! You must be tired. We can talk about this later. Please
"rest in the Knights quarters, downstairs, to the left."
knights

#2: The Kings room is upstairs. The Knights quarters are
"downstairs, to the left."
King's Chambers
Chancellor
Hmmm� What do you want? Get out of my face!
knights
"#1: Just between us, the Chancellors been acting VERY strange"
lately. Hes been sneakin out at night
"#2: Speaking of nut cases, I havent seen the Queens guard,"
"that frog-thing, recently. Heard a spell turned him"
into a frog. Do you believe that? I think hes
a spy!
attendant
"People say the Chancellors gone crazy, but I wont believe"
it. The Chancellors a decent man.
"Why, he goes to the cathedral everyday."
Queen's Chambers
knight
The Queen awaits.
attendant
The Queen married into the family 10 years ago. She still looks so youthful!
"In fact, she looks even younger now than on her wedding day"
attendant
YOU saved our Queen? You dont look that tough.
Queen
Ah! There you are. Please leave us. I need to talk to this individual.
attendants
"Certainly, your Highness."
Marle
"Come nearer, Sir."
(Crono steps forward)
"Giggle� Fooled you, didnt I, Crono? Its me! But everyone"

"other, but somehow I knew youd come for me� Thank you, Crono!"
(room is enveloped by green light)

"Has she dismissed you already? You were polite, of course? You didnt"
"do anything�funny, did you?"
 Of course not! » Are you sure?
 Well�yes. » Oooh! We
cant let this juicy tidbit out of the castle!
attendant
Did you notice anything odd about the Queen?
 Yes. » Just as I thought! She
claims shes not Leene! Theres something�different about
her.
Dont mention this to anyone!
" No. » Okay, if you say so."
knight
I grow so tired of the gossip around here!
Leaving the Queen's Chambers
Lucca
"Crono! Huff, puff�youre okay! Did you find the girl?"
(pause) GONE?! Whaddya mean shes gone?!
Hmm�its just as I thought. I knew I recognized her! And this looks
identical to the castle in OUR time! Ill bet they mistook that girl
"for her ancestor� You see, shes a member of the royal family in"
OUR time! Shes Princess Nadia!
"Marle, that is, Princess Nadia, is a descendent of Queen Leene! Queen Leene"
"has been kidnapped. As I recall, someone was supposed to have saved her."
"But history has been changed! Marle looks so much like Leene, that they probably"
called off their searches when she appeared here. But if the real Queen is
killed� � Marle will simply disappear. There might still be time!
"If we can save Leene, history as we know it should remain unchanged! Something"
"must have happened to the Queen in this era. As a result, Princess Nadia"
ceases to exist! Hurry! We have to find the real Queen!

" Yes. » If HE were here, this"
whole mess with the Queen would never have happened
 No. » You dont know of
Sir Cyrus?! From which land do you come? Or are you simply a fool?
"#2: Long ago, a beast called Yakra lurked in the western forest. But"
"after the cathedral was built, Yakra"
disappeared. Were thankful for that.
#3: Sir Cyrus was the Commander of the Knights. His mission was to
protect the King and Queen. He and
a friend left on a journey 10 years ago. No one has heard from them
since.
"#4: What a relief, the Queens been found. Now we can concentrate"
on the war!

"Shut your trap! Ill decide whos going to get fed, and when!!"
knight
"The Knight Captain is trying hard to fill the shoes of his predecessor,"
"Sir Cyrus, Commander of the Knights."

wrong way.

So! YOU saved Queen Leene!
(following line added after Captain's visit)
"The chefs stubborn, but hes a good man"
assistant
This place is a mini war zone!

My husband chose this life because hes a pacifist.
chef
This is no place for kids! Wait! Maybe youd know! Whats this
"""Eyes Cream"" stuff that Queen Leene wants so badly?"
(following line added after Captain's visit)
That fool�he thinks HES the boss!

Leene
Frog!
Frog
"Majesty, stand back and allow us the honor!"
Leene
Be careful!
Chancellor
"Gyah, ha, ha� Its useless to fight! No one will leave here"
alive! Stupid frog! Its time you jumped off this mortal coil!
True-form�CHANGE!
*Reverts to Yakra!!*
Leene
(after Yakra's defeat)
You came to rescue me! Thank you Frog.
Frog
"The King awaits. Let us return to the castle. I thank thee Crono, and"
Lucca.
Leene
"Yes, thank you so much. Please join us."
Real Chancellor
(rescued from within a chest when Crono
opens it)
"Phew, thank you! That monster stuffed me in there. Oh! Your Highness! As"
"you can see, I am undamaged!"
Leene
Lets return to the castle!
Real Chancellor
(if not already resuced)
"W, wait!! What about me?"
Guardia Castle
King Guardia
"You had me worried, Leene."
Chancellor
That no good Yakra! Impersonating me and kidnapping the Queen! We MUST
create a criminal justice system in this Kingdom to do away with such fiends.
Frog
I failed to protect Queen Leene. I hath disgraced thee.
Leene
Frog!
(Frog bows and exits)
(speaking to Crono)
Your timing was perfect. Who knows what would have happened had you not saved
"me! By the way, where is the girl who was mistaken for me?"
Lucca
"Oh, yeah! I forgot all about Princess Nadia! Crono! Where did Princess"
Nadia disappear? She may still be there!
King Guardia
"Thank you, Crono. But�who was that girl we found in the canyon?"

#1: So� she wasnt Leene after all.
#2: The King and Queen make such a great couple!

Huh? What happened?
Lucca
Princess Nadia!
Marle
Crono! It was awful� I cant recall it all� I was somewhere
"cold, dark�and lonely. Is that what its like to�die?"
Lucca
"Welcome back, Princess Nadia!"
Marle
"You risked your life to help me, too?! ""Princess�Nadia�?!"" Uh oh"
"I guess you guys figured it out, huh? Sorry, Crono. I didnt mean to"
deceive you. Im Princess Nadia. My fathers King Guardia the XXXIII.
I really enjoyed being with you at the fair. But if you had known my
"identity� Crono, you wouldnt have shown me around the fair,"
right!
 Right. » See? I like Marle better
"than ""Princess,"" anyway!"
" Wrong! » Oh, Crono! Thats"
why I like you!
"The real Queens safe, right? So lets go home, Crono!"
attendant
But youre a dead ringer for her.
(following line added after recovering Marle)
"You guys leaving? Wherever youre heading, be careful!"

Which means the real Leene was somewhere else. Its exactly as I
thought.
Castle Throne Room
Marle
"Youre the real Queen Leene, huh?!"
Leene
You really could be my twin.
Marle
"Well, you two better get along� or Ill be in big trouble."
Ill keep my fingers crossed!
Leene
Excuse me?
Marle
Um...never mind! I guess its time to go!
Leene
"You seem like one of the family, now!"
King Guardia
"Thank goodness, youre safe!! You may resemble Leene, but you sure"
"dont act like her! Anyway, youve really helped me. Let me know"
how I can repay you.
Chancellor
"Wow, you could be Leenes twin!"

Frog
"Twas a fault of mine, which endangered the Queen. I shall depart"

"Froggy, you werent such a bad guy either."

I guess Maguss troops kidnapped Leene.

#1: We must crush Maguss troops!
#2: Heard that Maguss troops put Yakra up to it all.
#3: (same statement as previous chapter)
#4: Cant believe the cathedral was their hideout.
Knight Captain
So! That cathedral was at the heart of it all. That Frogs done
"a fine job. But since Maguss troops failed to kidnap Leene, theyll"
probably be back soon. If only Cyrus were here!
Dining Hall

Now the Knight Captain can concentrate on battling Maguss troops.

What?! That wasnt Queen Leene?! And I wasted my time whipping up

Marle
Wow! Lucca! Youre amazing!
Lucca
"Aint it the truth! Oh, um�I mean"
Marle
Enough with the false modesty! You have a real gift! I would trade my
royal ancestry for your genius in a heartbeat!
Lucca
"Well, if you say so� Anyway, I call this thing a ""Gate."" Its a"
"kind of portal, that takes you to the same location in a different era. Gates"
"are very unstable, so I used the principle behind my Telepod device"
"to create a ""Gate Key."" Now we can use them as we please."
Marle
But why did this Gate suddenly appear?
Lucca
"Either the Telepod had something to do with it, or�something else"
made it.
Marle
This is getting pretty weird. Lets at least head back to our own
time!
Lucca
"All right! Coming, Crono?"

Chancellor
Princess Nadia! Are you all right? Where have you been?! I heard you
were abducted!
We had soldiers searching for you!
(notices Crono)
"Scoundrel! Youre the one, huh? Kidnapping Princess Nadia!"
Marle
No! Cronos
Chancellor
Admit it! You confused her and tried to take over the throne! Terrorist!!
Marle
"S,stop it!"
(soldiers surround Crono)
Stop this at once!!
(soldiers stop)
Chancellor
What are you doing!

But Princess Nadia said to
Chancellor
Idiots! Detain him!!
(soldiers grab Crono)

Crono!!
Courtroom
Chancellor
"Im the Chancellor, the prosecutor!"
Pierre
"Im the lawyer, Pierre."
Chancellor
"Members of the court. We now bring forth the defendant, Crono, who is"
charged with abducting Princess Nadia.
(brings Crono into room)
"What shall we do with him? Fire, perhaps? Hang him upside down for a few"
"years? Or�shall we employ the guillotine? You, the jury, shall decide"
"his fate. Now, let us begin."
Judge
"Crono, you are hereby ordered to tell the truth!"
Pierre
"Crono is charged with ""Premeditated Abduction of Royalty."" The question is,"
"did he kidnap Princess Nadia? The answer? No, he did not. In fact, no ""abduction"""
"took place! The two met completely by accident. In fact, the Princess ASKED"
Crono if SHE could join HIM!
Chancellor
Is this true? Who actually started this whole mess?
 I did. » Just as I suspected!
The defendant deliberately tried to get near the Princess!
 Marle did. » Are you sure? We
have witnesses wholl say YOU were the one that bumped into
the princess.
(flashback to Crono bumping into Marle)
The Princess then innocently followed you to Luccas little sideshow.
"Whereupon you both disappeared! If that wasnt criminal abduction, I"
dont know WHAT is! And I have facts that throw the defendants
character into question!
Pierre
Objection! This cant have any relevance whatsoever to this case!
Judge
"Care to respond, Chancellor?"
Chancellor
Cronos character is at the very core of this case!
Pierre
We have nothing to hide.
"(following said only if Crono found the cat. If not,"
trial will jump to Chancellor's
thievery question if Crono ate the lunch
"or, if not, Pierre's regarding motive)"
We have a witness. A little girl who will vouch for the character of the
defendant.
little girl
This nice man� He brought me my kitty. Thank you for being so kind!
Pierre
How about that? Doesnt this young man deserve a medal?
(whispers to Crono)
Whew� Looks like theyre buying it.
Chancellor
(following said only if Crono ate the man's lunch.
"If not, trial will skip to Pierre's comments"
on motive)
Have you ever stolen anything?
 Well�yes. » See! He lacks
morals! This should be on the record! Hes crying out for help!
 No! Ive never been a thief. »
DO NOT feign ignorance! We have a witness.
old man
Him! He ate my lunch right off the table!
(flashback to Crono eating the lunch)
Chancellor
"Let the record show that he stole from a poor, helpless man!"
Pierre
The issue here is MOTIVE. Was there any motive for this fine citizen
to kidnap Princess Nadia? No! There was none.
Chancellor
"What about ransom? Crono, her fortune DID tempt you, did it not?"
 No. » Are you sure? You really
werent tempted?
 Not at all. » Thats enough. I
have no more questions. (skip to Judge's comments)
(or)
Please keep in mind that he just said he had NO interest in
her fortune.
Witness please! (girl enters; said only if Crono
behaved poorly)
 Just a bit. » Nothing more your honor.
The prosecution rests.
" Yes. » So, you admit it! Nothing"
more your honor. The prosecution rests.

and did perform the following acts)
"He cant fool me, I saw him with my own eyes! Dear me! Im so nervous!"
That man grabbed the
pendant even before he checked to see if the Princess was okay!
(flashback to Crono picking up the pendant)
"He didnt seem to want to return it, either."
"(flashback: Marle: ""Its a family"
"heirloom. May I please have it back?"""
Crono: *shakes head*)
"He tried to sell it to the merchant, Melchior."

And this persons final bit of testimony will prove our case!

I heard it clearly. I heard her cry out with my own ears!

shopping)
Is that it? Can I go?!
Chancellor
Nothing more your honor. The prosecution rests.
Pierre
(following said only if Crono did not perform
"aforementioned acts and answered ""no"" twice to"
being tempted by wealth)
"It is evident that my client is a fine, noble young man! Your honor, the"
defense rests.
Judge
"Members of the jury� If he is guilty, stand to the left. If innocent,"
stand to the right.
(seven jury members report)
Order in the court! A verdict has been reached! The verdict is
" guilty! The sentence? Solitary confinement, pending"
execution in 3 days!
 not guilty! But the fact remains that even if

confinement as punishment.

Marle
Youd do that for us?
Robo
You repaired me. Now its my turn to help you. But the generator
"wont run for long, so someone must stay behind to open the door while"
the powers on.
Lucca
Then Marle or I will stay. Who will stay behind?
