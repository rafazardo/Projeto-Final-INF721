Take care of yourself. The price of kolto tanks has jumped through the roof.;[];;[];[None];tat17_news_01;NM17AANEWS11000_.mp3
The Selkath put a bunch of export restrictions in place for kolto. It's hurting everybody.;[];;[];[None];tat17_news_01;NM17AANEWS11001_.mp3
I hear that Manaan is no longer shipping kolto. The Selkath must be trying to drive prices up.;[];;[];[None];tat17_news_01;NM17AANEWS11002_.mp3
If you have kolto tanks, use them sparingly. I can't find them cheap anywhere.;[];;[];[None];tat17_news_01;NM17AANEWS11003_.mp3
I'm sure I saw some holo-footage of you on the Manaan swoop track, what you doing here?;[];;[];[None];tat17_news_01;NM17AANEWS11004_.mp3
Did you win a regional swoop championship on Manaan or something? I recognize your face.;[];;[];[None];tat17_news_01;NM17AANEWS11005_.mp3
I heard about your Manaan win. I'm surprised the Tatooine track was able to attract a racer of your ability.;[];;[];[None];tat17_news_01;NM17AANEWS11006_.mp3
Motta swears he can get professional racers to come to Tatooine. If the Manaan Sector Champion is here, I guess he was right.;[];;[];[None];tat17_news_01;NM17AANEWS11007_.mp3
I hear Czerka is closing their Kashyyyk operation. Nobody seems to know why.;[];;[];[None];tat17_news_01;NM17AANEWS11008_.mp3
Czerka is claiming that their operation on Kashyyyk has become to costly to maintain. Sounds like a cover-up to me.;[];;[];[None];tat17_news_01;NM17AANEWS11009_.mp3
"No more supplies have been ordered for the Czerka outposts on Kashyyyk. Doesn't sound like ""economic restructuring"" to me.";[];;[];[None];tat17_news_01;NM17AANEWS11010_.mp3
A private trader told me about the bloodshed on Kashyyyk. Seems like Czerka wants to forget it was ever there.;[];;[];[None];tat17_news_01;NM17AANEWS11011_.mp3
A trader I know says there was some trouble on Korriban. I didn't want to hear about it. That's where the Sith Academy is.;[];;[];[None];tat17_news_01;NM17AANEWS11012_.mp3
If you're doing any private shipping, stay away from Korriban. Sounds like the Sith can't even get along with themselves.;[];;[];[None];tat17_news_01;NM17AANEWS11013_.mp3
Word is Korriban is a dangerous place to visit right now. Something about the Sith at the Academy.;[];;[];[None];tat17_news_01;NM17AANEWS11014_.mp3
I heard the Sith were fighting amongst themselves on Korriban. Course, they're always fighting someone.;[];;[];[None];tat17_news_01;NM17AANEWS11015_.mp3
I still haven't heard a final figure of how many people died on Taris.;[];;[];[None];tat17_news_01;NM17AANEWS11016_.mp3
"You never know what the Sith will do. Look at Taris; was there any reason for what happened there?";[];;[];[None];tat17_news_01;NM17AANEWS11017_.mp3
The Republic is too complacent. If they let Taris fall, do you think they care what happens out here?;[];;[];[None];tat17_news_01;NM17AANEWS11018_.mp3
With Taris gone, I wonder who the Sith will turn on next.;[];;[];[None];tat17_news_01;NM17AANEWS11019_.mp3

If you've business with Czerka Corporation, take it to the director's office.;[];;[];[None];kas22_czerkg2_01;NM22AACZER06005_.mp3

I was told that you're a friend of Jolee Bindo... and that Jolee has returned to the sector. Please, I must speak to him. It's very urgent!;[{'Elora': 'Talk_Pleading'}]; if jolee is not in the party, first time talked to;[29, 35, 36];[None];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04000_.mp3
Who are you?;[];;[30];[28];man26_elora;
My name is Elora. My husband Sunry and Jolee are old friends. Now Sunry needs Jolee's help.;[];;[31, 33];[29, 35];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04002_.mp3
I shall tell Jolee immediately.;[];;[32];[30];man26_elora;
Please, I beg you to bring Jolee to speak to me about my husband. Sunry's life depends on it!;[{'Elora': 'Talk_Pleading'}]; if jolee is not in party, subsequent conversations;[];[31, 34, 36];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04008_.mp3
Maybe I can help your husband.;[];;[34];[30];man26_elora;
Someone is out to destroy my husband. I... I don't know who I can trust. I don't know you. But Jolee - he was always a true friend to Sunry.;[];;[32];[33];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04005_.mp3
Why do you need to speak to Jolee?;[];;[30];[28];man26_elora;
I don't have time for this.;[];;[32];[28];man26_elora;
Jolee! It *is* you! I... need your help.;[]; jolee is in party, first time conversation with him in party;[38];[None];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04009_.mp3
Elora? Of all the people... How did you even know I'd left Kashyyyk?;[];;[39];[37];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04010_.mp3
I didn't. Nobody knew where you were, not even Sunry! But I heard the Selkath mention you and your friends. The Force has brought you to help us!;[];;[40];[38];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04011_.mp3
Why? Whatever could be the matter, my dear?;[];;[41];[39];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04012_.mp3
It's horrible, Jolee! Sunry has been arrested! The Sith have accused him of murder!;[];;[42];[40];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04013_.mp3
Murder? But how...;[];;[43];[41];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04014_.mp3
It's all a mistake, Jolee! Sunry isn't a murderer - someone is trying to frame him.;[];;[44];[42];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04015_.mp3
Calm down, Elora. Where's Sunry now?;[];;[45];[43];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04016_.mp3
Sunry's being held at the Selkath courts. They won't let anyone in to see him. Please, go to the courts, talk to the Judges. Maybe the Selkath will listen to you.;[{'Elora': 'Talk_Pleading'}]; subsequent conversations with jolee in the party, player not appointed arbiter;[46];[44];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04047_.mp3
Don't worry, Elora. We'll get to the bottom of this and help Sunry... somehow.;[];;[];[45];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04048_.mp3
I hear you have been appointed as Arbiter in Sunry's trial. My husband is innocent - please don't let him go to jail for a crime he didn't commit!;[{'Elora': 'Talk_Pleading'}]; player appointed as arbiter;[48, 54, 56, 59, 74, 75];[None];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04017_.mp3
Can you tell me anything about Sunry?;[];;[49];[47];man26_elora;
Sunry is... he's a cripple. There's no way he could have overpowered this Sith woman like they claim.;[];;[50, 53];[48];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04019_.mp3
That's true... I'd forgotten about that. Let's not forget that he would have had to have been considerably older than the Sith woman.;[];;[51];[49];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04020_.mp3
Are you saying someone your age couldn't overpower a woman?;[];;[52];[50];man26_elora;
Hmph. I'm a Jedi... and one who was living alone in the Shadowlands until recently. That keeps you in shape, damn it! We're talking about Sunry, here.;[];;[53];[51];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04022_.mp3
And there's no way he would do something so dishonorable as hit her from behind. Sunry's a decorated war hero! He's a hero of the Republic!;[];;[54, 56];[52, 49];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04023_.mp3
Don't worry, Elora. I'll save him.;[];;[55];[53, 68, 66, 76, 47];man26_elora;
Find the real evidence, that's all I ask. The real evidence will prove Sunry didn't do this.;[];;[];[54, 58, 57];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04043_.mp3
Your husband might not be so innocent, Elora.;[];;[57];[53, 68, 66, 76, 47];man26_elora;
This is all a plot to discredit the Republic! Sunry is a victim of a Sith frame up!;[];;[55, 58];[56];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04045_.mp3
It's possible. I haven't seen Sunry since I crashed on Kashyyyk... a man can change a lot in that time. The man I knew could never have done this crime, however.;[];;[55];[57];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04046_.mp3
[Persuade] Was Sunry having an affair?;[];;[60, 70];[47];man26_elora;
[Success] Of... of course not! He... he... *sob*;[];;[61];[59];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04025_.mp3
Yes... *sob* ...yes, he was having an affair. He was seeing that... that Sith woman.;[{'Elora': 'Horror'}];;[62];[60, 71, 72];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04026_.mp3
After all these years we've been together he just... just dropped me like that. Not publicly, oh no, but inside that's what it feels like.;[];;[63];[61];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04027_.mp3
He started seeing Elassa last year. I... I had my suspicions for a while, but he was careless. Pretty soon everyone knew.;[];;[64];[62, 74];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04028_.mp3
But... but... even though I'm sure that harlot was only using him, I know he couldn't have killed her. He came and confessed to the affair to me. He said he was going there to break it off - to end it.;[];;[65];[63];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04029_.mp3
Maybe the Sith woman attacked him and he had to defend himself?;[];;[66];[64];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04030_.mp3
But even though he cheated on me, inside he's still the man I loved... love... He is too kind and gentle to have killed her in cold blood.;[];;[54, 56, 67, 69];[65];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04031_.mp3
He is a soldier, though.;[];;[68];[66];man26_elora;
That was a long time ago, in a war far, far away. He's changed now... settled down. Just please, prove his innocence.;[];;[54, 56];[67, 69];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04033_.mp3
He has killed many Sith before.;[];;[68];[66];man26_elora;
[Failure] What?? Don't insult us both! Sunry is... Sunry is a just and honorable man. How dare you accuse him... us, of such a thing!;[];;[71, 72, 73];[59];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04035_.mp3
Now, now, Elora. We're not here to pass judgment, my dear. We do need to know everything if we're to help, yes?;[];;[61];[70];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04036_.mp3
Madam. I would remind you that I am a Jedi. Now, then... was he having an affair?;[];;[61];[70];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04037_.mp3
Find proof to set him free instead of bringing these baseless accusations against us.;[];;[];[70];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04038_.mp3
Tell me about Sunry and Elassa.;[];;[63];[47];man26_elora;
I have this recording showing Sunry killing Elassa.;[];;[76];[47];man26_elora;
Lies! It... it must be! I knew the Sith would never let a Republic hero get away... You must find Sunry innocent!;[];;[54, 56];[75];man26_elora;NM26AAELOR04041_.mp3
A horrible fate for poor Hendar... I warned him not to leave the safety of the village.;[];first time talked to and Hendar dead Dialog Mission Statement: Usually the gate guard will open the gate whenever the player wants to enter or leave the village, this is done through dialog. After 2 rounds he will automatically close the gate. The first time the player approaches the gate from the interior of the village a conversation between the gatekeeper (OutcastMan045) and Hesther (OutcastWom043) will ensue as Hendar (OutcastMan046) runs for the gate with a Rakghoul in pursuit. The player can offer to help Hendar and the gatekeeper will open the gate, or he can simply sit and watch as hendar is killed (4 rounds after Hendar reaches the gate if the player does not intervene, or instantly if the player refuses to open the gate). If the player saves Hendar, he and Hesther thank the player and wander off. If Hendar dies, Hesther wanders off and reviles the player. Exit points in conversation: Exit stream 1: If the player approaches the guard for the first time and is outside the gates this will mark the guard as talked to and open the gates then close them after 2 rounds. Exit stream 2: Player has promised to save Hendar, guard opens gate. Player has 4 rounds to go through the gate or Rakghoul kills Hendar then runs off. Exit stream 3: If player talks to guard while Hendar is being attacked and chooses to let him die. Depending on the path the player can get a dark side hit. Exit stream 4: If player asks guard to open gate. Gate is opened then closed after 6 seconds. Exit stream 5: Player just says goodbye. Nothing happens.;[78];[None];tar04_outman045;NM04AAOUTM18000_.mp3
But I couldn't open the gate... not while the rakghouls were so close. I had to protect the village.;[];;[79];[77];tar04_outman045;NM04AAOUTM18001_.mp3
But enough of this grim talk... we must focus on the positive if we are to survive down here. How can I help you, up-worlder?;[];;[80, 82, 84, 86];[78];tar04_outman045;NM04AAOUTM18002_.mp3
Open the gate for me.;[];;[81];[79, 83, 85, 89, 100];tar04_outman045;
I will open the gate for you, up-worlder, but you've got to be quick. In a few seconds I must close and lock it again for the safety of the village.;[];;[];[80, 95];tar04_outman045;NM04AAOUTM18011_.mp3
Who are you?;[];;[83];[79, 85, 89, 100];tar04_outman045;
I am Trewin, from the Outcast village. It's my job to guard the gates and see they are locked to protect us from the rakghouls.;[];;[80, 84, 86];[82];tar04_outman045;NM04AAOUTM18019_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;[];;[85];[83, 79, 89, 100];tar04_outman045;
Heh. I just guard the gates. Gendar is the leader of the village, up-worlder. You should speak to him if you have any questions.;[];;[80, 82, 86];[84];tar04_outman045;NM04AAOUTM18021_.mp3
Goodbye.;[];;[87];[85, 83, 79, 89, 100];tar04_outman045;
Goodbye, up-worlder.;[];;[];[86];tar04_outman045;NM04AAOUTM18023_.mp3
Thank you for saving Hendar. You are braver than I, up-worlder. Maybe we Outcasts have lived too long in selfish fear.;[];first time talked to since Hendar lived;[89];[None];tar04_outman045;NM04AAOUTM18003_.mp3
Perhaps we can learn a lesson from your brave actions. Hmph. But enough of my ramblings... is there something you need, up-worlder?;[];;[80, 82, 84, 86];[88];tar04_outman045;NM04AAOUTM18004_.mp3
You're not from the village. In fact, you look like you're from the up-world!;[];first time spoken to, player on far side of gate;[91];[None];tar04_outman045;NM04AAOUTM18005_.mp3
I don't know why you'd come down here to our village, but I guess I can let you in. There don't seem to be any rakghouls nearby.;[];;[92];[90];tar04_outman045;NM04AAOUTM18006_.mp3
Hurry, up-worlder. I can only leave the gate open for a few seconds. I can't risk letting the rakghouls in!;[];;[];[91];tar04_outman045;NM04AAOUTM18007_.mp3
I can't open the gate... not while the rakghouls are so near.;[];;[94, 96, 98];[None];tar04_outman045;NM04AAOUTM18008_.mp3
Open the gate... I will kill the rakghouls.;[];;[95];[93];tar04_outman045;
You would risk your life for a stranger? You are brave... or foolish.;[];;[81];[94];tar04_outman045;NM04AAOUTM18010_.mp3
You're right, it's too dangerous. Leave the gate closed.;[];;[97];[93];tar04_outman045;
*Sigh* A horrible fate for poor Hendar. I warned him not to leave the safety of the village.;[];;[];[96, 98];tar04_outman045;NM04AAOUTM18013_.mp3
Keep the gate closed. I'm not risking my life here.;[];;[97];[93];tar04_outman045;
The gate is open. If you're going through you have to hurry, up-worlder, before I have to close it again.;[];gate is open;[];[None];tar04_outman045;NM04AAOUTM18015_.mp3
Yes, up-worlder? Is there something you need?;[];;[80, 82, 84, 86];[None];tar04_outman045;NM04AAOUTM18016_.mp3
So do we have a deal?;[]; scripted encounter when player first approaches the recruiter;[102];[None];man26_repneg;NM26AAREPN12000_.mp3
That's an awful lot of money... is there something you're not telling me?;[];;[103];[101];man26_repneg;NM26AAREPN12001_.mp3
Don't be so suspicious. The Republic is generous, we pay our mercenaries well.;[];;[104];[102];man26_repneg;NM26AAREPN12002_.mp3
Makes sense, I guess. Alright, I'm in. When do I start?;[];;[105];[103];man26_repneg;NM26AAREPN12003_.mp3
Just show up at the Republic Embassy tomorrow and speak to our Representative there. I'm sure he'll have some task he wants you to start on right away.;[]; mercenary leaves;[];[104];man26_repneg;NM26AAREPN12004_.mp3
Do you mind? I'm in the middle of a Republic recruiting drive right now. I need to hire these mercenaries before they sign up with the Sith.;[]; subsequent conversations;[107, 109, 113];[None];man26_repneg;NM26AAREPN12005_.mp3
Why are you hiring mercenaries?;[];;[108];[106];man26_repneg;
In case you hadn't noticed, there's a war on. If we don't hire these mercs, the Sith will. Now excuse me, I have to continue my recruitments.;[];;[];[107];man26_repneg;NM26AAREPN12007_.mp3
Maybe you could hire me?;[];;[110];[106];man26_repneg;
I don't know if you've got what we're looking for... Jedi aren't generally suited to mercenary work. If you want, talk to Roland Wann at the Republic Embassy and see if he can find anything for you.;[];;[111];[109];man26_repneg;NM26AAREPN12009_.mp3
It's north of here, then east past the first courtyard. It's just off the north end of the second courtyard. You can't miss it.;[];;[112];[110];man26_repneg;NM26AAREPN12010_.mp3
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to continue my recruitments.;[];;[];[111];man26_repneg;NM26AAREPN12011_.mp3
I'll be going now.;[];;[114];[106];man26_repneg;

I see now why Malak followed you. Even though you are only a shell of your former self, you are still a formidable opponent.;[];Second dialog (init after 100 points of damage dealt);[138];[None];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01012_.mp3
I can't even imagine the power you must have wielded when you were the Dark Lord. You were a fool to give it all up and follow the light side.;[];;[139, 151, 152];[137];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01013_.mp3
I am as strong in the light as I ever was following the dark side.;[];;[140];[138];k_sta_bastila;
The dark side has made me stronger than I ever was before! I have a greater command of the Force than all but the most powerful Jedi Masters.;[];;[141];[139, 151];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01015_.mp3
As Malak teaches me the greatest secrets of the Sith, I will unlock more of my potential. Eventually there will be no limit to what I can accomplish with the Force!;[];;[142, 147, 149];[140];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01016_.mp3
Malak will never let you become that powerful. He will kill you first.;[];;[143];[141];k_sta_bastila;
Have you forgotten the ways of the Sith already, Revan? Eventually I will challenge my Master. If I am worthy he will die by my hand and I will become the new Sith Master.;[];;[144];[142];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01018_.mp3
Then I will take on my own apprentice and the cycle will begin again. This is the way of the Sith, it is how we assure our leaders are always the strongest and most worthy!;[];;[145, 147];[143, 150];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01019_.mp3
You're dooming yourself to an endless cycle of death and betrayal.;[];;[146];[144];k_sta_bastila;
No, Revan, it is you who are doomed!;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[];[145];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01021_.mp3
I won't let that happen! I'll kill you first!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[148];[144, 141];k_sta_bastila;
No, Revan. You are the one who will die here!;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[];[147];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01025_.mp3
You will accomplish death and destruction with the dark side, nothing else.;[];;[150];[141];k_sta_bastila;
Jedi propaganda. The dark side is only a tool, and Malak will train me in its use. Eventually I will surpass my Master and challenge him. If I am worthy he will die by my hand.;[];;[144];[149];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01023_.mp3
You've been consumed by the dark side, Bastila. Can't you see it's destroying you?;[];;[140];[138];k_sta_bastila;
I'm still strong enough to defeat you, Bastila!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[153];[138];k_sta_bastila;
Then it's time for you to prove it!;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[];[152];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01028_.mp3
You are growing weary, I can sense it! Your strength falters, the light side is failing you while the power of the Star Forge re-energizes me! Soon this will all be over!;[];Third dialog (init after second 100 points of damage dealt);[155, 157, 163, 165];[None];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01029_.mp3
I have not faltered, Bastila. You have been misled by the dark side.;[];;[156];[154];k_sta_bastila;
The dark side will always triumph over the light! Malak has assured me of victory! You can't defeat me here on the Star Forge! YOU CAN'T!;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[];[155, 165];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01031_.mp3
Then strike me down, Bastila. I won't defend myself.;[{'Player': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[158];[154];k_sta_bastila;
What type of trick is this?;[];;[159, 161, 162];[157];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01036_.mp3
Remember what you once were, Bastila. A Jedi would never strike down a defenseless opponent.;[];;[160];[158];k_sta_bastila;
I am a Sith apprentice now. You place too much faith in what I used to be... and for that you shall pay!;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[];[159, 161, 162];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01039_.mp3
You are not evil, Bastila. You will not strike down a defenseless opponent.;[];;[160];[158];k_sta_bastila;
We meant something to each other, once. I don't believe you will strike me down.;[];;[160];[158];k_sta_bastila;
Your emotions get the better of you, Bastila. Remember the Jedi code.;[];;[164];[154];k_sta_bastila;
You dare spew those Jedi lies in my face? You will die screaming, Revan!;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[];[163];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01033_.mp3
You are the one growing weak, Bastila. I hear the desperation in your voice!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[156];[154];k_sta_bastila;
No, this is not possible! You have rejected the dark side, you are a weak and pathetic servant of the light! How can you still stand against me? Why can't I defeat you?;[];Fourth dialog (init when dropped to 1 hit point);[167, 236, 237];[None];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01041_.mp3
Now you see the dark side is not stronger than the light.;[];;[168];[166];k_sta_bastila;
Yes, I see you speak the truth. I am no match for you. Please, for the sake of what we once shared, do not make me suffer. End my life quickly. There is no other way.;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[169, 209, 235];[167, 236, 237];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01044_.mp3
I could never kill you, Bastila.;[];;[170];[168];k_sta_bastila;
What other choice do you have? I have fallen to the dark side, I am the apprentice to the Dark Lord himself. You cannot let me live.;[];;[171, 216, 227];[169, 235];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01047_.mp3
You can reject the dark side, Bastila. Return to the light.;[];;[172];[170];k_sta_bastila;
No... I'm not strong enough. There is too much anger inside me now. Too much hatred and fear. I can no longer find peace in the Force.;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[173, 209, 216, 227, 229];[171];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01049_.mp3
[Persuade] Use our bond, then. Take your strength from me.;[];;[174, 228];[172];k_sta_bastila;
[Success] You... always had more strength than I did. I told you that. I felt so... helpless before your destiny.;[];;[175];[173];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01051_.mp3
You were Revan and I couldn't tell you... it was agonizing! Even worse when I began to... feel closer to you. I despised myself for it.;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[176];[174];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01052_.mp3
And even now I... feel your strength. It... does help me. Thank you, I think I can face the end, now. If you are the one to end it for me.;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[177, 181, 209, 213, 216, 227];[175];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01053_.mp3
[Persuade] I love you, Bastila. I can't abandon you, ever.;[];;[178, 211];[176, 215, 223, 226, 233];k_sta_bastila;
[Success] You... love me? Heh. I... there was a time I yearned for and yet dreaded to hear those words. I loved you, too, but I could never... face who you were.;[];;[179];[177];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01108_.mp3
Malak knew how I felt. Any part of the light that was within me would be extinguished when I killed you.;[];;[180];[178];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01109_.mp3
But what good is love? It cannot save me from the sea of blackness I am drowning in. I have betrayed everything I ever believed in! How can I atone for that?;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Pleading'}];;[181, 209];[179];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01110_.mp3
Help us defeat the Sith, Bastila. This will atone for what you have done.;[];;[182];[180, 212, 215, 176, 221, 223, 226, 233];k_sta_bastila;
Yes, I... could join you in your battle against the Dark Lord. That alone would not make up for all I have done, yet... it would be a step in the right direction.;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[183];[181];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01065_.mp3
But how would you be able to trust me? How do you know I wouldn't turn on you when you faced Darth Malak? How do you know the dark side wouldn't make me betray you again?;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Pleading'}];;[184, 207];[182];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01066_.mp3
I trust you enough to leave myself open to your attack, Bastila.;[];;[185];[183];k_sta_bastila;
You play a dangerous game. Are you certain you wish to take this risk? I could end your life and gain Malak's favor with a single stroke of my lightsaber.;[];;[186, 206, 207];[184];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01068_.mp3
You won't, Bastila. Because I love you and I believe in you.;[];;[187, 205];[185];k_sta_bastila;
You are brave... and some would say foolish. But you are also right. The dark side has not wholly consumed me. I cannot raise my blade against you.;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Sad'}];Player has high enough conversion score from dialog;[188, 194];[186, 206];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01071_.mp3
You will go on to defeat Malak, of this I have little doubt. You will have gone from being the Sith Lord, himself, to the savior of our galaxy.;[];;[189, 199];[187];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01072_.mp3
And... and you said you loved me. This may not be the best time to say it, but...;[];;[190];[188];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01073_.mp3
I love you, too. With all my heart.;[];;[191];[189, 201];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01074_.mp3
You aren't afraid to love anymore?;[];;[192];[190];k_sta_bastila;
After this? No, nothing could make me feel safer than to be loved by you.;[];;[193];[191];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01076_.mp3
You should go. Malak awaits. This isn't over, yet... for any of us.;[];;[194];[192, 203];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01083_.mp3
I should stay here, though. If we face Malak I am afraid his dark presence will overwhelm me. It would not be wise to expose myself to such temptation.;[];;[195, 197];[193, 187];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01084_.mp3
Bastila, I want you at my side when I face the Dark Lord.;[];;[196];[194];k_sta_bastila;
I'm sorry, but the risk is too great. I am not wholly free of the dark side's shadow. Not yet. But you are more than a match for the Dark Lord. I understand that now.;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[122];[195];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01086_.mp3
You could use your Battle Meditation to aid the Republic fleet.;[];;[198];[194];k_sta_bastila;
Yes, that would be for the best. You don't need me to defeat Malak, anyway. Now I understand that a true Jedi is a match for any Sith. Even the Dark Lord himself.;[];;[122];[197];k_sta_bastila;NM45AABAST01088_.mp3

*sigh* I guess we have to make the best of what we have though. If you really want to learn more about the promised land you should speak to Rukil.;[];;[263, 266, 270];[261];tar04_outman041;NM04AASHAL27013_.mp3
Where can I find Rukil?;[];;[264];[262, 269, 273, 275, 280, 267];tar04_outman041;
He's wandering around somewhere on the south side of the village. He doesn't move too far... it's hard on his bones. He's over 100 years old!;[];;[265];[263];tar04_outman041;NM04AASHAL27019_.mp3
The children laugh at him and people think he's crazy because of his stories about the Promised Land, but he's really just a kind old man.;[];;[260, 266, 268, 270];[264];tar04_outman041;NM04AASHAL27020_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;[];;[267];[265, 262, 259, 256];tar04_outman041;
You'd probably get more information from Gendar, the village leader. Or maybe Rukil. But I'll tell you whatever I can.;[];;[263, 268, 270, 272, 274, 276];[266];tar04_outman041;NM04AASHAL27015_.mp3
Where can I find Gendar?;[];;[269];[267, 273, 275, 280, 265];tar04_outman041;
He'll be somewhere in the village. I couldn't say where for sure. He's always busy, doing whatever he can to make the lives of the other villagers easier.;[];;[263, 270, 272, 274];[268];tar04_outman041;NM04AASHAL27017_.mp3
I'll be going now.;[];;[271];[269, 280, 275, 273, 267, 265, 262];tar04_outman041;
Oh... okay. Well, if you ever need anything, or if you just feel like talking, come back and see me. I hardly ever get a chance to speak to someone from the up-world.;[];;[];[270];tar04_outman041;NM04AASHAL27042_.mp3
Do you know anything about the escape pods that crashed into the Undercity?;[];;[273];[269, 275, 280, 267];tar04_outman041;
I don't know anything about that, but maybe Gendar could help you. Sorry... is there anything else you need?;[];;[263, 268, 270, 274, 276];[272];tar04_outman041;NM04AASHAL27022_.mp3
Have any other up-worlders come through here recently?;[];;[275];[273, 280, 269, 267];tar04_outman041;
There were quite a few people from the surface marching through the village, but none of them bothered to talk to me. Gendar might know more about them.;[];;[263, 268, 270, 272, 276];[274];tar04_outman041;NM04AASHAL27024_.mp3
Tell me about this village.;[];;[277];[275, 273, 267];tar04_outman041;
Well, I was born here for starters. My parents were Outcasts, banished to the Undercity for some crime or other... they never really liked to talk about it.;[];;[278];[276];tar04_outman041;NM04AASHAL27026_.mp3
Everyone here is an Outcast... or the descendant of one. It's tough down here, but we survive. I guess it's easier for me, since I've never known anything different.;[];;[279];[277];tar04_outman041;NM04AASHAL27027_.mp3
"Some of the people have given up all hope; they've become bitter and depressed. But most of us are good people... despite what our ancestors may have done.";[];;[280];[278];tar04_outman041;NM04AASHAL27028_.mp3
Gendar could probably tell you more. Or maybe Rukil. You could talk to them if you want.;[];;[263, 268, 270, 272, 274];[279];tar04_outman041;NM04AASHAL27029_.mp3
I don't have time for this.;[];;[282];[259, 256, 252];tar04_outman041;
Of course... I'm sorry. You're probably here for something important, right? You probably want to speak to Gendar. He's the leader of our village.;[];;[283];[281];tar04_outman041;NM04AASHAL27035_.mp3
But if you... if you have time later, maybe you could come back and speak to me again. I don't get much chance to talk with people from the surface.;[];;[];[282];tar04_outman041;NM04AASHAL27036_.mp3
It's nothing special.;[];;[285];[252];tar04_outman041;
Not to you, I suppose. But you're probably used to its beauty by now.;[];;[254];[284];tar04_outman041;NM04AASHAL27031_.mp3
It's better than this festering slime pit.;[];;[287];[252];tar04_outman041;
I... I suppose our world doesn't look like much to you. It's dark and cold and lonely down here - but this is the only world I've ever known.;[];;[254];[286];tar04_outman041;NM04AASHAL27033_.mp3
What do you want?;[];;[252];[250, 249];tar04_outman041;
Okay, here's five credits.;[];;[247];[245, 292, 241];tar04_outman041;
I don't have any credits on me.;[];;[291];[245, 241];tar04_outman041;

This is serious evidence indeed. The court will keep this in mind near the top of the list of pertinent facts.;[];;[478];[476];man26_trial;
We will now begin by calling forth the witnesses to the crime and taking their testimony.;[];;[479];[477];man26_trial;
After each witness has given their testimony and you have cross-examined them, you may ask the presiding judges for their opinions on the current state of the case. This is a special privilege given by Manaan law only to the defendant, so use it wisely.;[];;[480];[478];man26_trial;

Firith: what did you see the night of the murder?;[];;[486];[484];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27095_.mp3
I came out into the hallway after hearing the blaster shot and saw Sunry over there limping down the hall out of the building.;[];;[487];[485];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27097_.mp3
Heh. A very obvious point, your Honors. The accused was seen leaving the scene of the crime after the blaster that killed Elassa was fired.;[];;[488];[486];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27099_.mp3
A very pertinent point, prosecutor.;[];;[489];[487];man26_trial;
It is now the defense's turn to cross-examine the witness.;[];;[490, 539, 543, 546, 551];[488];man26_trial;
I have no additional questions.;[];;[491];[489, 503, 508, 542, 590, 599, 625, 631];man26_trial;
Very well. Would you like to use this opportunity to poll the judges?;[];;[492, 538];[490];man26_trial;
Yes.;[];;[493, 536, 537];[491];man26_trial;
I think that Sunry, perhaps, could have been the culprit.;[];;[494, 534, 535];[492];man26_trial;
I think that Sunry was perfectly capable of committing this crime.;[];;[495, 532, 533];[493, 536, 537];man26_trial;
It seems to me that the evidence is weighted against Sunry.;[];;[496, 530, 531];[494, 534, 535];man26_trial;
Despite his honorable past, Sunry would seem to have done something deplorable.;[];;[497, 528, 529];[495, 532, 533];man26_trial;
Sunry is obviously guilty of killing the Sith woman.;[];;[498];[496, 530, 531];man26_trial;
Since the defense has no further questions, we will call out the second witness: the Rodian Gluupor.;[];;[499];[497, 528, 529, 538];man26_trial;
The prosecution may question the witness.;[];;[500];[498];man26_trial;
Gluupor the Rodian, you were staying in the hotel the night of the murder and saw Sunry leaving Elassa's room didn't you?;[];;[501];[499];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27162_.mp3
Yes, Gluupor see Sunry running down hallway, and when Gluupor look in room, Sith woman dead on floor.;[];;[502];[500];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27164_.mp3
This is clear then: that Sunry left the room with the Sith Elassa already dead behind him.;[];;[503];[501];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27166_.mp3
Perhaps, Sith, perhaps. It is the turn of the defense to question the witness now.;[];;[490, 504, 509, 513, 518];[502];man26_trial;
Did you see Sunry kill Elassa?;[];;[505];[503, 508];man26_trial;
Gluupor... Gluupor not see Sunry really hurt Sith... But Gluupor did see Sunry leaving room with dead Sith in it!;[];;[506];[504];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27194_.mp3
But... Gluupor not see him really kill Sith...;[];;[507];[505];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27196_.mp3
An important distinction Arbiter.;[];;[508];[506];man26_trial;
Do you wish to ask the witness anything else?;[];;[490, 504, 509, 513, 518];[507, 512, 517, 527];man26_trial;
Isn't the medal at the crime scene too obvious a clue?;[];;[510];[508, 503];man26_trial;
Gluupor not know. Why anyone leave things in someone else's room?;[];;[511];[509];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27202_.mp3
Gluupor just think these things happen. It is just... odd...;[];;[512];[510];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27204_.mp3
Yes. Odd indeed.;[];;[508];[511];man26_trial;
Do you really think a cripple could have hurt Elassa?;[];;[514];[508, 503];man26_trial;
Sunry seems like strong man, but he is hurt, too.;[];;[515];[513];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27209_.mp3
Gluupor not think that man like that would stand up to a Sith. Not at all. But Sunry still run fast after.;[];;[516];[514];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27211_.mp3
We know full well the extend of Sunry's injuries, Arbiter!;[];;[517];[515];man26_trial;
But the fact still remains.;[];;[508];[516];man26_trial;
Did you plant the medal on Elassa?;[];;[519];[508, 503];man26_trial;
Gluupor... Gluupor...;[];;[520];[518];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27218_.mp3
Don't do it, Gluupor...;[];;[521];[519];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27220_.mp3
The prosecution will be silent!;[];;[522];[520];man26_trial;
What is it you wish to say Gluupor?;[];;[523];[521];man26_trial;
Gluupor... Gluupor paid by Sith to plant that medal.;[];;[524];[522];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27204_.mp3
Lies! Slander! I object!;[{'Sith Diplomat': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[525];[523];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27228_.mp3
You are certain of this Gluupor?;[];;[526];[524];man26_trial;
Gluupor certain...;[];;[527];[525];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27232_.mp3
This new evidence puts the entire case in a new light.;[];;[508];[526];man26_trial;
Perhaps I was wrong, after all, in my thoughts about Sunry.;[];;[498];[496, 530, 531];man26_trial;
I cannot tell yet if Sunry killed Elassa, but I am confident it will be proven.;[];;[498];[496, 530, 531];man26_trial;
I do not believe Sunry, as a well-standing Republic citizen, could have committed this crime.;[];;[497, 528, 529];[495, 532, 533];man26_trial;
I just do not have enough information to judge this case yet.;[];;[497, 528, 529];[495, 532, 533];man26_trial;
Sunry did not have the capacity to commit these murders... I think.;[];;[496, 530, 531];[494, 534, 535];man26_trial;
I cannot make my decision on what I have yet seen.;[];;[496, 530, 531];[494, 534, 535];man26_trial;
Sunry perhaps was not the killer.;[];;[495, 532, 533];[493, 536, 537];man26_trial;
I am unsure as yet as to whether Sunry was the actual murderer.;[];;[495, 532, 533];[493, 536, 537];man26_trial;
I think that Sunry could not have committed this crime.;[];;[494, 534, 535];[492];man26_trial;
I do not have enough information to make an informed decision.;[];;[494, 534, 535];[492];man26_trial;
No.;[];;[498];[491];man26_trial;
Did you actually see the murder happen?;[];;[540];[489, 542];man26_trial;
You mean actually see him kill her with my own eyes? Well... no... But I don't think there could have been anyone else there.;[];;[541];[539];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27131_.mp3
Your point is well-taken Arbiter.;[];;[542];[540];man26_trial;
Do you have additional questions?;[];;[490, 539, 543, 546, 551];[541, 545, 550, 554];man26_trial;
Was the medal left at the crime scene not a little too obvious?;[];;[544];[542, 489];man26_trial;
I think it may have been. I mean, you'd have to pretty stupid to leave something that important lying around, wouldn't you?;[];;[545];[543];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27137_.mp3
This argument has merit.;[];;[542];[544];man26_trial;
How could Sunry have harmed her if he was a cripple?;[];;[547];[542, 489];man26_trial;
Well he was moving pretty fast running away... but yeah, I mean, how could he kill a Sith warrior in combat? I don't know for sure...;[];;[548];[546];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27142_.mp3
Do not think less of Sunry because of his handicap. He is fully capable.;[];;[549];[547];man26_trial;
Can't you see that the man can hardly walk, let alone fight Elassa?;[];;[550];[548];man26_trial;
That is enough for now. We will deliberate on this later in private.;[];;[542];[549];man26_trial;
Elassa is a Dark Jedi, isn't she?;[];;[552];[542, 489];man26_trial;
Yes, from what I could tell. She carried a lightsaber around under that cloak of hers.;[];;[553];[551];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27151_.mp3
Objection! That doesn't prove she was a Jedi!;[{'Sith Diplomat': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[554];[552];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27153_.mp3
No, this piece of evidence is very important. It establishes the character of Elassa and perhaps her intent in dealing with Sunry.;[];;[542];[553];man26_trial;
Do not undermine the witness!;[];;[483];[481];man26_trial;
The man I saw leaving - Sunry - probably left after I heard the blaster shot.;[];;[557];[473];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27075_.mp3
The guilt of the accused is apparent even this early in the trial.;[];;[476];[556];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27077_.mp3
I have reconsidered.;[];;[559];[463];man26_trial;
Honesty is an attribute essential to the position of Arbiter, as is impartiality. It would not be advised for you to abuse either of these.;[];;[560];[558];man26_trial;
Do not mock us, Jedi!;[{'Judge Duula': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[561];[559, 581];man26_trial;
Enough! This case will proceed on schedule.;[];;[469];[560];man26_trial;
Sunry is guilty of the murder. I have this recording as proof.;[];;[563];[459];man26_trial;
A recording? Let this new evidence be entered in the records.;[];player approaches seljud1 and hands over recording;[564];[562];man26_trial;
Ah... this new evidence is most convincing.;[];;[565];[563];man26_trial;
Yes. Yes it seems to be.;[];;[566];[564];man26_trial;
This shortens the trial considerably. In light of this new evidence there is no need to proceed with the witnesses or cross-examinations.;[];;[567];[565];man26_trial;
This court hereby finds Sunry guilty of the murder of the Sith Elassa.;[]; guilty with tape;[568];[566, 677];man26_trial;
In accordance with Selkath law the proscribed punishment for murder is death.;[];;[569];[567];man26_trial;
The verdict has been delivered and this trial is now over.;[];;[570, 571, 572, 575, 576];[568];man26_trial;
Well, that didn't go well. If I'm ever on trial remind me not to ask you for help.;[];;[571, 572, 575, 576];[569];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27514_.mp3
This is why we Mandalorians don't have courts. We prefer to settle things with trial by combat.;[];;[572];[570, 575, 576, 569];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27517_.mp3
Remove the guilty party from this courtroom.;[];;[573, 574];[571, 575, 576, 570, 569];man26_trial;
I... I'm sorry, Sunry. And Elora. There is nothing more we can do.;[];;[574];[572];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27456_.mp3
*sob* Sunry... No...;[{'Elora': 'Horror'}];;[];[573, 572];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27458_.mp3
This is the will of the court, but it doesn't feel like justice to me.;[];;[571, 572];[570, 576, 569];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27516_.mp3
I... I don't believe this. Sunry should be remembered as a hero, not as a murderer. This isn't right.;[];;[571, 572, 575];[570, 569];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27515_.mp3
[Force Persuade] You will find Sunry innocent.;[{'Player': 'Persuade'}];;[578];[459];man26_trial;
[Failure] You are in no position to tell us how to judge our laws!;[{'Judge Shelkar': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[579];[577];man26_trial;
We know of your Order, Jedi. We know that you have powers to manipulate the minds of lesser creatures.;[];;[580];[578];man26_trial;
Do not think that we Selkath, the pinnacle of evolution, can be swayed by such means!;[{'Judge Duula': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[581];[579];man26_trial;
If you attempt such manipulations again, Sunry will be found guilty, and you will summarily be put to death! We do not tolerate intrusions upon the justice of our courts!;[];;[560];[580];man26_trial;
I will find Sunry innocent.;[];;[583];[459];man26_trial;
That remains to be seen.;[];;[469];[582];man26_trial;
I have no comments at this time.;[];;[469];[459];man26_trial;
If the defense has no more questions, the court will call out Elora, Sunry's wife.;[];;[586];[None];man26_trial;
You Elora, are Sunry's lawful wife. Your husband was a hero in the last war between the Sith Empire and the Republic.;[];;[587];[585];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27238_.mp3
He was crippled in that war. Do you not believe he'd blame the Sith for his injury?;[];;[588];[586];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27240_.mp3
Yes, I guess he would.;[];;[589];[587];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27242_.mp3
And there you have motive! Sunry seeks revenge on the Sith for what they did him and killed Elassa.;[];;[590];[588];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27244_.mp3
A supposition for now, prosecutor. Does the defense have any questions for the witness?;[];;[490, 591, 600, 604];[589];man26_trial;
Was it true your husband was having an affair with Elassa?;[];;[592];[590, 599];man26_trial;
Yes... Yes it was true. He was having an affair with that Sith harlot.;[];;[593];[591];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27272_.mp3
It seems painfully obvious that he killed her to keep quiet about the affair.;[];;[594];[592];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27274_.mp3
Be silent! You have already questioned the witness, prosecutor.;[{'Judge Naleshekan': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[595];[593];man26_trial;
He had been seeing her for some time, I think. *sniff* But he said he was going to change!;[];;[596];[594];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27278_.mp3
He had gone there that night to end it! We talked the night before and he had promised!;[{'Elora': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[597];[595];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27280_.mp3
But now things have become so very complicated...;[{'Elora': 'Flirt'}];;[598];[596];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27282_.mp3
That is very enlightening evidence. It will influence our deliberation considerably.;[];;[599];[597];man26_trial;
Do you have any more questions, Arbiter?;[];;[490, 591, 600, 604];[598, 603, 609];man26_trial;
Sunry was a cripple. Could he have killed Elassa?;[];;[601];[599, 590];man26_trial;
He was a good man, but his injuries pained him terribly. But he always held on. Always persevered.;[];;[602];[600];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27288_.mp3
I don't think he could have beaten her or anything like that... but a blaster? I just don't know...;[];;[603];[601];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27290_.mp3
Sunry seems fully capable to me. But it seems unlikely that he would choose to do such a thing.;[];;[599];[602];man26_trial;
Sunry was a Republic war hero, wasn't he?;[];;[605];[599, 590];man26_trial;
Yes. He fought against the Sith in the last war. He fought bravely and was even awarded the Hero's Cross!;[];;[606];[604];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27295_.mp3
I don't know how much that means to the Sith or to your Selkath, your Honors, but in the Republic it is awarded only to the bravest, most valorous, most honorable men.;[];;[607];[605];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27297_.mp3
The kind of man who earns that medal would not kill someone in cold blood!;[];;[608];[606];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27299_.mp3
Your husband earned a medal because he excelled at killing Sith. It relates directly.;[];;[609];[607];man26_trial;
Do not let personal opinions sway your judgment of the law!;[];;[599];[608];man26_trial;
Does the prosecution have any remaining witnesses to call forth?;[];;[611];[None];man26_trial;
I wish to call forth Sunry himself, your Honors.;[];;[612];[610];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27307_.mp3
Very well.;[];;[613];[611];man26_trial;
Are you a war hero, Mr. Sunry? You fought in wars against the Sith Empire, correct?;[];;[614];[612];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27311_.mp3
Yeah, that's right. I don't regret it either. The Republic needs its heroes.;[];;[615];[613];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27313_.mp3
Indeed... Would you say that you dislike the Sith? Even... hate them?;[];;[616];[614];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27315_.mp3
Of course I hate them! Trying to take over the galaxy every chance they get! Killing millions of innocents!;[{'Sunry': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[617];[615];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27317_.mp3
Pure politics. Were you in Elassa's room on the night of the murder?;[];;[618];[616];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27319_.mp3
Well, yes I... I was...;[];;[619, 642];[617];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27321_.mp3
I had been having an affair with Elassa on my wife, yes... But I realized how wrong I had been and I was going there to end it!;[];;[620];[618];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27323_.mp3
You were having an affair with a Sith! You wanted to end it quickly and quietly, so you killed her from behind and tried to flee!;[{'Sith Diplomat': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[621];[619, 647];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27325_.mp3
No, I...;[];;[622];[620];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27327_.mp3
I think we can see the answer clear enough, Mr. Sunry!;[{'Sith Diplomat': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[623];[621];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27329_.mp3
Do not interrupt the accused!;[{'Judge Duula': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[624];[622];man26_trial;
In fact, I think you've said quite enough already, prosecutor.;[];;[625];[623];man26_trial;
Do you have any question to ask the accused, Arbiter?;[]; to player;[490, 626, 632, 637];[624];man26_trial;
Elassa was a Sith spy, wasn't she?;[];;[627];[625, 631];man26_trial;
Of course she was! Why would a young, beautiful Sith woman get with an old cripple like me?;[];;[628];[626];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27361_.mp3
You are not helping yourself, Sunry. You only give reason why you might kill her.;[];;[629];[627];man26_trial;
He merely states facts. The incompetence of the murder indicates that her occupation was not the motive for the killing.;[];;[630];[628];man26_trial;
The fact remains: Elassa was a Sith and likely a spy as well.;[];;[631];[629];man26_trial;
Is there anything else you wish to ask the accused?;[];;[490, 626, 632, 637];[630, 636, 641];man26_trial;
How could Elassa have got ahold of your medal?;[];;[633];[631, 625];man26_trial;
I don't know. The medal had gone missing some time ago. I never found out what happened to it.;[];;[634];[632];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27371_.mp3
It's possible the Sith had stolen it and had it planted on the body...;[];;[635];[633];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27373_.mp3
Supposition, your Honors!;[];;[636];[634];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27375_.mp3
True, but it does have merit and deserves consideration.;[];;[631];[635];man26_trial;
You were going there to end the affair. Would the Sith object?;[];;[638];[631, 625];man26_trial;
Yes I think they would. They wouldn't want to lose one of their sources - even though I didn't give them anything!;[];;[639];[637];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27380_.mp3
They... they might have killed her for her failure... or they might have thought she'd turn against them or something like that.;[];;[640];[638];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27382_.mp3
The Sith Empire is not the barbaric institution you portray it to be!;[{'Sith Diplomat': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[641];[639];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27384_.mp3
Be silent, prosecutor. This is a valuable point, that lends some credence to your defense, Arbiter.;[];;[631];[640];man26_trial;
I knew she was a Sith, and she would be trying to pump me - for information, of course - so I... I just simply turned the tables.;[];;[643];[618];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27388_.mp3
I was working on her, trying to turn her over to the Republic's side. Trying to turn her into a double agent. But that's kind of ruined now that she's been murdered.;[];;[644];[642];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27390_.mp3
An obviously false story! I have proof here, in the form of data recording, that proves you were, in fact, having an affair with Elassa!;[];;[645];[643];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27392_.mp3
Let this new evidence be entered in the court records.;[];;[646];[644];man26_trial;
So be it.;[];;[647];[645];man26_trial;
I... I... What's the use now... I had been having an affair with Elassa, it's true. But I had realized my mistake and was going there to end it! But I did not kill her!;[];;[620];[646];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27398_.mp3
The witnesses have all been called forward and questioned by both prosecution and defense. The prosecution will now present, in closing, its summary of the pertinent facts of this case.;[];;[649];[None];man26_trial;
I think the facts in this case are very straight forward: Sunry was having an affair with Elassa. He sought to end it, and the simplest, quickest method given his hatred of the Sith was to simply kill her.;[];;[650];[648];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27402_.mp3
*Ahem* Witnesses saw Sunry fleeing the scene, and material evidence places him there at the time of the murder as well.;[];;[651];[649];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27404_.mp3
I am confident that any informed observation of the facts will lead the judges - your Honors - to this very conclusion.;[];;[652];[650];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27406_.mp3
Indeed. And your closing statements, Arbiter?;[];;[653, 658, 662, 667, 672, 676];[651];man26_trial;
No one actually witnessed the murder.;[];;[654];[652, 661, 666, 671, 675];man26_trial;
Truth.;[];;[655];[653];man26_trial;
That doesn't mean a thing! He was there, running from the room!;[{'Sith Diplomat': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[656];[654];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27412_.mp3
If you speak out of turn again, you will be forcibly ejected from the court! The Arbiter speaks a valid fact.;[];;[657];[655];man26_trial;
Is there another point you would make?;[];;[658, 662, 667, 672, 676];[656];man26_trial;
Sunry was a cripple and couldn't have killed her.;[];;[659];[657, 666, 671, 675, 652];man26_trial;
A cripple can be just as capable as any other man. And Sunry more than most.;[];;[660];[658];man26_trial;
You overrate this man!;[];;[661];[659];man26_trial;
Perhaps. Are there any other arguments, Arbiter?;[];;[653, 662, 667, 672, 676];[660];man26_trial;
The Sith are obviously evil and set this up.;[];;[663];[661, 671, 675, 657, 652];man26_trial;
Objection!;[{'Sith Diplomat': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[664];[662];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27424_.mp3
The Arbiter is allowed an opinion as well as you, prosecutor.;[];;[665];[663];man26_trial;
No matter how erroneous...;[];;[666];[664];man26_trial;
Or truthful.;[];;[653, 658, 667, 672, 676];[665];man26_trial;
Sunry was ending the affair, so the Sith killed her.;[];;[668];[666, 675, 661, 657, 652];man26_trial;
The Sith would not leave the medal of her killer clutched in her hand!;[];;[669];[667];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27432_.mp3
Your time for arguments has passed, and you would do well to remember that!;[];;[670];[668];man26_trial;
The Arbiter's argument does bring up a valid point.;[];;[671];[669];man26_trial;
Is there anything else you would state?;[];;[653, 658, 662, 672, 676];[670];man26_trial;
Elassa was a spy and the Sith are framing Sunry.;[];;[673];[671, 666, 661, 657, 652];man26_trial;
I find that highly unlikely, Arbiter. The Sith have no need of such deception. The facts speak clear.;[];;[674];[672];man26_trial;
But the Sith have been known for violence, deception, and murder before.;[];;[675];[673];man26_trial;
That is also true. Is there another point you would make?;[];;[653, 658, 662, 667, 676];[674];man26_trial;
My arguments are complete.;[];;[677];[675, 671, 666, 661, 657, 652];man26_trial;
Then the court will now deliberate amongst ourselves.;[];;[567, 678];[676];man26_trial;
This court hereby finds Sunry innocent of the murder of the Sith Elassa.;[]; not guilty;[679, 680];[677];man26_trial;
In addition, this court finds the Sith Empire guilty of conspiracy and obstruction of justice.;[];;[680];[678];man26_trial;
Your Honors! No!;[{'Sith Diplomat': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[681];[679, 678];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27488_.mp3
Silence!;[];;[682];[680];man26_trial;
The Sith Empire is hereby forced to subsidize a portion of Republic purchases on Manaan for a period of the next solar year.;[];;[683];[681];man26_trial;
The verdict has been delivered and this trial is now over.;[];;[684, 685, 686, 687, 688];[682];man26_trial;
Yes! Score one for the good guys!;[];;[685, 686, 687, 688];[683];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27518_.mp3
I knew you wouldn't let the Republic down!;[];;[686, 687, 688];[684, 683];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27519_.mp3
Well done. You showed wisdom worthy of a Jedi Master during this trial.;[];;[687, 688];[685, 684, 683];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27520_.mp3
I guess you got the result you wanted, but I still think this was a big waste of time. We Mandalorians prefer to settle things with a nice, quick trial by combat.;[];;[688];[686, 685, 684, 683];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27521_.mp3
Sunry... I'm so glad...;[];;[689];[687, 686, 685, 684, 683];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27496_.mp3
Elora...;[];;[690, 691];[688];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27498_.mp3
We have done all we could for you, old friend.;[];;[691, 693];[689];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27500_.mp3
Thank you for saving me. I don't know how I can repay you. Elora and I are going to leave here and get as far away from all this as soon as we can.;[{'Sunry': 'Talk_Pleading'}];;[692];[690, 689];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27506_.mp3
I - and the Republic - will not forget what you've done for us. Thank you.;[];;[];[691];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27508_.mp3
Thank you, Jolee! I... I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't shown up!;[];;[694];[690];man26_trial;
Don't thank me, thank your Arbiter. I was glad to help.;[];;[];[693];man26_trial;NM26AATRIA27504_.mp3
It's really strange. Nobody seems to know where Master Uthar or Yuthura Ban have disappeared to. Some of the sensitives are claiming they're dead.;[];player is a full Sith;[];[None];kor35_sithstudm;NM35AASITH15000_.mp3

Perhaps not, but it will do for now. Professional racers like myself travel wherever the purses are highest.;[];;[906];[904];tat17_04zorii_01;
It's no secret that one of the most popular tracks was lost with Taris. Other promoters will need time to organize.;[];;[907];[905];tat17_04zorii_01;
In the meantime, we will race at the smaller venues. This is almost a recreational stop for me.;[];;[908, 911, 916, 923];[906];tat17_04zorii_01;
If this track is so small, why bother?;[];;[909];[907];tat17_04zorii_01;
You lose the skills if you don't use them. I could race on any open road, but competition gives the push to get better.;[];;[910];[908];tat17_04zorii_01;
Besides, if my presence lends a little prestige to the track, maybe we'll get some new racers out of it.;[];;[911, 916, 923];[909];tat17_04zorii_01;

A few years, but I raced under a different name when I was young. My early career was not very spectacular.;[];;[904, 913, 916, 923];[911];tat17_04zorii_01;
Why did you change your racing name?;[];;[914];[912];tat17_04zorii_01;
It wasn't that big of a deal. I made the jump from one league to another and wanted to shed some baggage.;[];;[915];[913];tat17_04zorii_01;

It is a necessary side to the sport. We must make someone money, or there would be no circuit.;[];;[904, 911, 923];[921];tat17_04zorii_01;

Mic'Tunan'Jus is just a humble merchant from the Rim. What would you wish to know about we?;[];;[966, 970, 976, 977];[964];tat17ab_twohead;

You couldn't say it, and don't have the ears for it. Two voices create the name, and four ears hear the true sound.;[];;[968];[966];tat17ab_twohead;
We suppose the trade lanes have had to call us something. With one mouth the world is Sorjus, far off the Perlemian trade route.;[];;[969];[967];tat17ab_twohead;
It's an unimportant stop, we admit. We left for a life of trade, because we are strong and a good talker. We have done well.;[];;[970, 976, 977];[968];tat17ab_twohead;
Are you one creature or two?;[];;[971];[969, 965, 979];tat17ab_twohead;
You are pardoned for asking because you only know one mind... or at least only one at a time. We are one now, but weren't always.;[];;[972];[970];tat17ab_twohead;

Not as much as we should. If we knew more, we would have better business. Travelers like us best. Settlers don't have much to trade.;[];;[982];[980];tat17ab_twohead;
We don't travel far on Tatooine itself, you see. The weather is not like our home. Too dry. Way too dry.;[];;[976, 977, 983];[981];tat17ab_twohead;
Who would I ask to get more information?;[];;[984];[982, 985];tat17ab_twohead;
Always trust the locals, even if they don't trust you. They are the ones that really know what's going on. That's true on any world.;[];;[976, 977];[983];tat17ab_twohead;
We have not moved since you last asked. The Tatooine dust is rough on our hide, and the sun is much harsher than it needs to be.;[];;[976, 977, 983];[980];tat17ab_twohead;

You will want to save your money for your swoop, we would bet. Yes, you have the champion's face. we'll have what you need.;[];;[960, 962, 977];[958, 994];tat17ab_twohead;
And don't be shy. Just ask to see what you want. If you can't get a good look, we don't move the merchandise.;[];;[960, 962, 977];[958];tat17ab_twohead;
And like we were saying, we don't sell anything if you don't ask for it, so step up and see what Mic'Tunan'Jus can both do for you.;[];;[960, 962, 977];[958, 994];tat17ab_twohead;

Tell me what the rounds are.;[];;[1099];[1097, 1104, 1110, 1125, 1126, 1129];man26_swpreg;
Here on Manaan, Round One is the domain of hobbyists and amateurs. I mean no disrespect by that. They just can't afford the faster swoops yet.;[];;[1100];[1098, 1106];man26_swpreg;
Round Two is populated by the beginner touring racers. They have decided to invest in the sport, and are attempting to make it pay.;[];;[1101];[1099];man26_swpreg;
Round Three is usually only attainable by seasoned professionals. There have been exceptions, but only rarely.;[];;[1089, 1102, 1107, 1111];[1100];man26_swpreg;
What does each round pay?;[];;[1103];[1101, 1110, 1125, 1126, 1097, 1129];man26_swpreg;
Round One pays 500 credits. Round Two pays 2000 credits. Round Three is 5000 credits. These are relatively standard values for the sport.;[];correct with appropriate values;[1104];[1102];man26_swpreg;
Each round is paid out only once per tournament. The leader that shows dominance in all three is named Sector Champion.;[];;[1089, 1098, 1105, 1107, 1111];[1103];man26_swpreg;
Tatooine uses tiers instead of rounds. Why the difference?;[];;[1106];[1104, 1110, 1125, 1126, 1097, 1129];man26_swpreg;
Tatooine is not recognized, and won't be while Motta insists on refusing to accept galactic standards. When the circuit is reestablished, he will fall in line.;[];;[1099];[1105];man26_swpreg;
Describe the current crop of racers.;[];;[1108];[1104, 1101, 1097, 1129];man26_swpreg;
Sparce. Taris took a great many good racers with it when it was destroyed. Including our Sector Champion, Sakul Ondondanax.;[];;[1109];[1107];man26_swpreg;
Currently our biggest attractions are Casandra Mateil and Hukta Dax. They are the only touring professionals present for this tournament.;[];;[1110, 1125, 1126];[1108];man26_swpreg;
The racer getting the biggest crowd response was a local underdog named Queedle, but he has decided to retire. A loss, to be sure.;[];Queedle quit;[1089, 1098, 1102, 1105, 1111];[1109];man26_swpreg;
Let's go back to my other questions.;[];;[1112];[1110, 1125, 1126, 1104, 1101, 1097, 1129, 1127, 1095];man26_swpreg;
Certainly. I'm always accomodating to the racers.;[];;[1067, 1089, 1096, 1113, 1116];[1111];man26_swpreg;
I'm owed money for my last race.;[];;[1094, 1114, 1123];[1112, 1122, 1120, 1066, 1140, 1142, 1150, 1162];man26_swpreg;
A second round win is worth 2000 credits to you. Many racers bow out when they reach this level, but I have a feeling you won't.;[];player has beaten the second tier and has not yet been paid for it.;[1115];[1113, 1096, 1093];man26_swpreg;
The next round of races will determine Sector Champion. You'll have to be flawless to achieve that.;[];;[1067, 1089, 1096, 1116];[1114];man26_swpreg;
Give me the basics on how to race.;[];;[1117];[1115, 1124, 1112, 1133, 1131, 1066, 1139, 1140, 1142, 1150, 1162];man26_swpreg;
The course is laid out in buoys across the ocean surface of Manaan. You race against times set by others, with no other swoops on the track.;[];;[1118];[1116];man26_swpreg;
Your bike likely has the standard five gears to shift through. As your speed increases, watch the indicators in the lower left to know when to shift.;[];;[1119];[1117];man26_swpreg;
Shift at the wrong time and your swoop will accelerate poorly or slow down. Shift correctly and you will optimize your perfomance.;[];;[1120];[1118];man26_swpreg;
"You can also steer over ""swoop boosters"" placed along the route. These will increase your speed substantially for a short time.";[];;[1067, 1089, 1096, 1113, 1121];[1119];man26_swpreg;
Are there any hazards on the course?;[];;[1122];[1120];man26_swpreg;
There are obstacles that you must watch for. Steering over floating buoys won't damage your bike, but it will slow you down.;[];;[1067, 1089, 1096, 1113];[1121];man26_swpreg;
Winners of the first round are paid 500 credits. It's enough to cover your expenses, but you'll have to keep racing to really make it pay.;[];player has beaten the first tier and has not yet been paid for it.;[1124];[1113, 1096, 1093];man26_swpreg;
We'll record this for future reference, and wish you well on your attempt to reach Sector Champion.;[];Set local that they are now paid for it. Give player 10 racing bonds.;[1067, 1089, 1096, 1116];[1123];man26_swpreg;
The biggest surprise of this tournament has been Queedle. He's gone from underdog to champion in short order. The crowd loves him for it.;[];Queedle has not quit;[1089, 1098, 1102, 1105, 1111];[1109];man26_swpreg;
But, even with such auspicious competition, Queedle is the racer getting the biggest responses. He's a local favorite, and very talented.;[];;[1089, 1098, 1102, 1105, 1111];[1109];man26_swpreg;
You have already achieved the pinnacle of the sport, and can't earn any more at this time. You'll be notified when more races are scheduled.;[];player beaten all the races;[1089, 1111, 1128];[1096];man26_swpreg;
Go over the system anyway.;[];;[1129];[1127];man26_swpreg;
Races on the Manaan course are organized in the galactic standard three round system. Each round pays differently.;[];;[1098, 1102, 1105, 1107, 1111];[1128, 1096];man26_swpreg;
Er... before you do... your next race would be against the leading time set by racer Hukta Jax. He was very insistent that you speak with him first.;[];Player beat tier 2, queedle quit Player not yet threatened by Hukta.;[1131];[1067];man26_swpreg;
Please, try not to anger the Gamorrean. He could prove troublesome, and we don't want the scandal of having to jail professional swoop racers.;[];;[1089, 1096, 1116, 1132];[1130];man26_swpreg;
Where is he?;[];;[1133];[1131];man26_swpreg;
He will be in the Racers' Lounge, the room just to the east.;[];;[1089, 1096, 1116];[1132];man26_swpreg;
I'm afraid there are no rounds currently in need of completion. As Sector Champion, you will be notified if further races are to take place.;[];player won all races;[1135];[1067];man26_swpreg;
You can feel free to speak with the track Maintenance Officer to book a practice run, but it won't be officially timed.;[];;[1136];[1134];man26_swpreg;
There is a small fee for practice runs, but it is significantly less than for official races.;[];;[1089, 1096];[1135];man26_swpreg;
Very well, but before we place your swoop in the starting position, I must collect the 100 credit fee.;[];;[1069, 1079, 1081, 1084];[1067];man26_swpreg;

I'm sure you are. We welcome all racers, regardless of professional status. We are trying to maintain a full field of competitors.;[];;[1146];[1144];man26_swpreg;
Of course, with the destruction in Taris, we're in a bit of a rebuilding phase. Our Sector Champion was one of the casualties there.;[];;[1147, 1151, 1154, 1155];[1145, 1158, 1160];man26_swpreg;
I won the season opener on Taris.;[];;[1148];[1146];man26_swpreg;
I hesitate to believe that. Sith interference disrupted any holo-feed that might have verified your story. We only know that all on Taris were lost.;[];;[1149];[1147];man26_swpreg;

100 credits must be paid for each officially timed attempt that you make. This amount will be due before each race.;[];;[1067, 1089, 1096, 1113, 1116];[1149];man26_swpreg;
I have raced on Tatooine.;[];player has raced once on Tatooine.;[1152];[1146];man26_swpreg;

He has also altered the payment structures set up for the swoop circuit. Of course, most of the governing circuit organization was lost on Taris.;[];;[1149];[1152];man26_swpreg;

You must be very new to Manaan if you are unfamiliar with the swoop races. Our course is one of the most respected in the sector.;[];;[1146];[1159];man26_swpreg;
I don't need anything. Never mind.;[];;[1156];[1143];man26_swpreg;

Who are you? What do you want with me? Are you working for my father?;[];SCRIPTED  upon approaching shen in his cell for the first time Dialog Mission Statement   These dialogs are the conversations the player has with Shen while hes imprisoned at the Sandral Estate.   The first dialog is the first time the player has talked to Shen.   The second dialog is after Rahasia has agreed to leave with him.   The third dialog is for all conversations in between these. Exit points in conversation: Exit stream 1: This stream can end either by the player leaving (with the possibility of a medium dark side hit), by the player agreeing to see Rahasia, or by the player stunning Shen and dragging him out. If the player agrees to see Rahasia, DAN_SHEN_DONE is set to TRUE to show that it has been mentioned. If the player stuns Shen and takes him away he takes a medium dark side hit. Exit stream 2: The lines are said and the conversation ends. Exit stream 3: The lines are said and the player can either agree to search for Rahasia, or stun Shen and drag him away. The conversation end  in both cases, but the player takes a medium dark side hit if he stuns Shen.;[1177, 1203];[None];dan16_shen;NM16AASHEN03000_.mp3
I am here to rescue you, Shen.;[];;[1178];[1176];dan16_shen;
Rescue me? No... I won't leave. It's too dangerous.;[];;[1179];[1177];dan16_shen;NM16AASHEN03002_.mp3
I'll protect you, Shen. Let's go.;[];;[1180];[1178];dan16_shen;
It is not my own safety I am concerned about. I am worried about the fate of Nurik's daughter, Rahasia. She has been trying to convince her father to release me ever since I was captured.;[];;[1181];[1179];dan16_shen;NM16AASHEN03004_.mp3
If I escape, Nurik will think Rahasia is to blame. Nurik is insane with grief over the loss of his son Casus. If I leave with you, it is Rahasia who will suffer. I cannot allow that.;[];;[1182, 1198, 1199, 1201];[1180];dan16_shen;NM16AASHEN03006_.mp3
How can I get you to come with me?;[];;[1183];[1181];dan16_shen;
If you can convince Rahasia to escape with us I will accompany you - though I do not know if she would be willing to turn her back on her home and family.;[]; DIALOGUE  before talking to rahasia;[1184];[1182, 1198, 1202];dan16_shen;NM16AASHEN03020_.mp3
Who could imagine a Sandral doing such a thing for the sake of a Matale. But if she will not go, then I too shall stay.;[];;[1185];[1183];dan16_shen;NM16AASHEN03022_.mp3
I would rather face my own death, than have her face her father's wrath because I escaped.;[];;[1186, 1191, 1196];[1184];dan16_shen;NM16AASHEN03024_.mp3
Why do your families hate each other so much?;[];;[1187];[1185];dan16_shen;
My father thinks the Sandrals are thieves and liars who followed him here to Dantooine just to steal what he has earned for himself.;[];;[1188];[1186];dan16_shen;NM16AASHEN03026_.mp3
My father is an egotist and can be violent at times, but I think he still cares for me. Rahasia's father seems to be falling into the same pattern as mine.;[];;[1189];[1187];dan16_shen;NM16AASHEN03028_.mp3
They're both too unreasonable to be talked to about the other. I think the only hope Rahasia and I will have is if we can escape both of them...;[];;[1190];[1188];dan16_shen;NM16AASHEN03030_.mp3
Please find Rahasia and speak to her. Get her to flee this place with me.;[];;[];[1189];dan16_shen;NM16AASHEN03032_.mp3
Why do you care so much about Rahasia?;[];;[1192];[1185];dan16_shen;
I was taught to hate the Sandrals. To think of them as evil and subhuman. But from the moment I saw Rahasia one day in the city, I knew that my father was wrong.;[];;[1193];[1191];dan16_shen;NM16AASHEN03035_.mp3
She was like an angel: all white silks and perfume, seeming to float above the crowds.;[];;[1194];[1192];dan16_shen;NM16AASHEN03037_.mp3
I don't know what else I could have done but fall in love with her. For months I wooed her and tried to win her heart. I believe I have succeeded, but now this has happened...;[];;[1195];[1193];dan16_shen;NM16AASHEN03039_.mp3
Our families are always coming between us in one way or another. Please find her and convince her to run away with me.;[];;[];[1194];dan16_shen;NM16AASHEN03041_.mp3
I will go speak to Rahasia.;[];;[1197];[1185];dan16_shen;
Thank you. I wish you luck.;[];;[];[1196];dan16_shen;NM16AASHEN03044_.mp3
What if we take Rahasia with us?;[];;[1183];[1181];dan16_shen;
Fine. Stay in here and rot.;[];;[1200];[1181];dan16_shen;
As you wish. I have no quarrel with you.;[];;[];[1199, 1203];dan16_shen;NM16AASHEN03014_.mp3
If you don't come with me, I'll drag you out!;[];;[1202];[1181];dan16_shen;
If you do that, I'll scream my head off and alert all the guards in the house! The only chance you have is to talk Rahasia into leaving.;[];;[1183];[1201];dan16_shen;NM16AASHEN03011_.mp3

You are back. Have you spoken to Rahasia?;[]; DIALOGUE  after having rahasia promise to meet them at the gates;[1205];[None];dan16_shen;NM16AASHEN03016_.mp3
Yes. She promised she would meet us outside the gates.;[];;[1206];[1204];dan16_shen;
I pray she is not just telling me what I want to hear. But I will have to take that chance. Hurry, then. We must not keep Rahasia waiting.;[];;[];[1205];dan16_shen;NM16AASHEN03018_.mp3
I surrender! I surrender! Please, don't kill me. I'm not like these others. I'm not like Brejik and his new Vulkars!;[{'Black Vulkar': 'Worship'}];Attacks on sight. Surrenders if reduced below 25%  If surrender two possibilities: 1. Unlocks elevator and escapes are 2. Player just kills him.;[1208, 1232];[None];tar10_vulksur2;
What are you talking about? You're a Vulkar, aren't you?;[];;[1209];[1207];tar10_vulksur2;
I'm a Vulkar, but I was here long before Brejik took over. I was a Vulkar back when it meant something. Back when we had honor.;[];;[1210];[1208];tar10_vulksur2;
Then Brejik and his followers took over and turned our gang into a bunch of violent thugs and bloodthirsty punks. Now they treat all us original Vulkars like second class citizens.;[];;[1211];[1209];tar10_vulksur2;
Take me, for example. I used to be one of the highest ranking Vulkars in the gang. Now I'm stuck on guard duty here in the back, all thanks to Brejik!;[];;[1212, 1216, 1226, 1228];[1210];tar10_vulksur2;
If you hate Brejik so much, why don't you leave the gang?;[];;[1213];[1211, 1217];tar10_vulksur2;
I've been trying to work up the courage to leave, but it's not that easy. Brejik's followers will try to hunt down anyone who leaves the Vulkar gang. He says he won't let traitors live. Ha!;[];;[1214];[1212];tar10_vulksur2;
Brejik and his followers are the real traitors. They turned on Gadon and now they slaughter the Beks in the streets... and anyone else they happen to run across.;[];;[1215];[1213];tar10_vulksur2;
Brejik knows anyone with character will never willingly follow a leader like him, so he uses brutality and violence to stay in power.;[];;[1216, 1226, 1228];[1214];tar10_vulksur2;
You better give me some information if you want to live.;[];;[1217];[1215, 1211];tar10_vulksur2;
Yeah, sure. Whatever you want to know. It's not like I owe that scum lord Brejik anything.;[];;[1212, 1218, 1226, 1230];[1216, 1225];tar10_vulksur2;
Where can I find the prototype swoop engine accelerator?;[];;[1219];[1217];tar10_vulksur2;
Right - that gadget Brejik stole from the Beks. He's got the accelerator in the basement garage. The only way down is by using the security elevator in the back of the base.;[];;[1220];[1218];tar10_vulksur2;
But the security elevator is protected by auto-targeting laser cannons. You'll be vaporized before you ever get near it, unless you get your hands on a pass card.;[];;[1221, 1223];[1219];tar10_vulksur2;
Where can I get a pass card?;[];;[1222];[1220, 1224];tar10_vulksur2;
If I had one myself, I'd give it to you. But Brejik only gives them to his lieutenants. You'd have to get a pass card from one of them, but I doubt they'd just hand it over to you.;[];;[1223, 1225, 1226, 1228];[1221];tar10_vulksur2;
Is there some way to disable the security cannons?;[];;[1224];[1222, 1220];tar10_vulksur2;
I guess it might be possible to slice into the main computer bank near the front of the base and override the security system, but I sure wouldn't be able to do it.;[];;[1221, 1225, 1226, 1228];[1223];tar10_vulksur2;
I want to ask you something else.;[];;[1217];[1224, 1222, 1231];tar10_vulksur2;
I'm going to let you live. Go on, get out of here!;[];;[1227];[1224, 1222, 1231, 1217, 1215, 1211];tar10_vulksur2;
Thanks. Thanks a lot. And don't worry, I won't cause any trouble for you on the way out. In fact, I hope you take Brejik and his Vulkars down!;[];;[];[1226];tar10_vulksur2;
Sorry, but it's too risky to let you live.;[];;[1229];[1224, 1222, 1231, 1215, 1211];tar10_vulksur2;
Well I'm not just going to roll over and let you kill me!;[];;[];[1228, 1232];tar10_vulksur2;
I'm looking for a prisoner. A woman named Bastila.;[];;[1231];[1217];tar10_vulksur2;
Yeah, right. You think Brejik would leave a trophy like that in here with this scum? He's got her stashed away somewhere safe, I'd guess. Somewhere outside this base.;[];;[1225, 1226, 1228];[1230];tar10_vulksur2;
Sorry - I only fight to the death!;[];;[1229];[1207];tar10_vulksur2;

I am a victim, a refugee, yes. I flee... fled from my world once the Sith fleet comes. They bomb my world, destroy it, yes?;[];;[1236];[1234];dan14_kni;
They scour the continents, boil the oceans. Sith are bad, yes.;[];;[1237];[1235];dan14_kni;
But I run here, find the Jedi already here, unknown. They take me in... one left of a billion, yes...;[];;[1238];[1236];dan14_kni;
The Republic fights, but does not win. Not you to blame, of course, no. The Sith are strong and destroy those who would oppose them, yes.;[];;[1239];[1237];dan14_kni;
My thanks you have, and your Order. Is there anything else you require?;[];;[1240, 1242];[1238];dan14_kni;
You might give something back...;[];;[1241];[1239, 1233];dan14_kni;

What's the job?;[];;[1267];[1265, 1290];tat17_griff;
As you may know, tach glands can be refined into a very potent powder. It's the primary ingredient in Tarisian ale - that's what makes it so strong.;[];;[1268];[1266, 1289];tat17_griff;NM17AGGRIF03006_.mp3
Of course, now that Taris is pretty much wiped from the face of the map Tarisian ale has become somewhat scarce - and uh... very, very valuable. Luckily, I know the secret recipe!;[];;[1269, 1288];[1267];tat17_griff;NM17AGGRIF03008_.mp3
So you want to open a bar?;[];;[1270];[1268];tat17_griff;
I know this guy... he's with the Exchange. Now, if I give him a small sample of Tarisian ale he says he can synthesize it and reproduce it in mass quantities.;[];;[1271];[1269, 1288];tat17_griff;NM17AGGRIF03010_.mp3
Problem is, I need one of those tach glands to make the first batch. And now that Taris is a smoking ruin, the only place to find tach is on Kashyyyk.;[];;[1272];[1270];tat17_griff;NM17AGGRIF03012_.mp3
If you can get your hands on one of those tach glands I'll make it worth your while.;[];;[1273, 1283, 1287];[1271];tat17_griff;NM17AGGRIF03014_.mp3

As I said, I am C8-42, a personal assistance droid. Although in recent months the assistance I render seems to have taken on a disproportionate significance.;[];;[1323, 1367, 1373];[1321, 1384];dan14_c869;NM14ADC86901002_.mp3
Are you Elise's droid?;[];;[1324];[1322];dan14_c869;

You're running from her?;[];;[1326];[1324];dan14_c869;
Yes... But I have my reasons!;[];;[1327];[1325];dan14_c869;NM14ADC86901006_.mp3
I'm afraid my owner became a bit too attached to me. Obsessed even.;[];;[1328];[1326, 1366, 1370, 1379, 1381, 1382];dan14_c869;NM14ADC86901028_.mp3
She... she tried to treat me as her dead husband. It was not healthy for her.;[];;[1329, 1361, 1364];[1327];dan14_c869;NM14ADC86901030_.mp3
Is she crazy?;[];;[1330];[1328];dan14_c869;
She is obsessed. She rarely sees other people, and appears to be fixated on me as her husband.;[];;[1331];[1329, 1363, 1364];dan14_c869;NM14ADC86901032_.mp3
She was becoming more and more insular... I thought it best that I leave. She may meet other real people this way.;[];;[1332];[1330];dan14_c869;NM14ADC86901034_.mp3
In fact, that was the reason I came here and sought out those kath hounds.;[];;[1333, 1359, 1360];[1331];dan14_c869;NM14ADC86901036_.mp3
You sought them out?;[];;[1334];[1332];dan14_c869;
I think it would be best if I were no longer a factor. She would meet new people. Living people.;[];;[1335];[1333, 1359, 1360];dan14_c869;NM14ADC86901039_.mp3
Please... will you destroy me?;[];;[1336, 1338, 1355];[1334];dan14_c869;NM14ADC86901041_.mp3
Fine. I'll destroy you and tell her why you did it.;[];;[1337];[1335];dan14_c869;
Thank you, kind sir! You have my eternal gratitude.;[];;[];[1336];dan14_c869;NM14ADC86901043_.mp3
No. You should go back to her.;[];;[1339];[1335];dan14_c869;
But... but why?;[];;[1340, 1345, 1349, 1351];[1338];dan14_c869;NM14ADC86901046_.mp3
She is lonely and needs your support.;[];;[1341];[1339];dan14_c869;
You... you're right... How could I be so selfish?;[];;[1342];[1340];dan14_c869;NM14ADC86901048_.mp3
I must not think only of myself, but of how it affects her.;[];;[1343];[1341];dan14_c869;NM14ADC86901050_.mp3
She must be frantic. And if she lost me she'd be devastated.;[];;[1344];[1342];dan14_c869;NM14ADC86901052_.mp3
I must return then. It is my duty.;[];;[];[1343];dan14_c869;NM14ADC86901054_.mp3
You're her property, and must obey her.;[];;[1346];[1339];dan14_c869;
Yes... Yes I am. It seems I must resign myself to my fate.;[];;[1347];[1345];dan14_c869;NM14ADC86901057_.mp3
To be a droid. A second-class being with no rights at all.;[];;[1348];[1346];dan14_c869;NM14ADC86901059_.mp3
So be it then. I shall return to her.;[];;[];[1347, 1350];dan14_c869;NM14ADC86901064_.mp3
Because if you don't, I'll carry you back myself.;[];;[1350];[1339];dan14_c869;
You seem determined. And I have very little choice.;[];;[1348];[1349];dan14_c869;NM14ADC86901062_.mp3
Return for now, and I'll help you later.;[];;[1352];[1339];dan14_c869;
You... you will help me? Help her, I mean, to live as a normal human should?;[];;[1353];[1351];dan14_c869;NM14ADC86901067_.mp3
Thank you, thank you, kind Jedi! I shall return to her now and await your assistance.;[];;[1354];[1352];dan14_c869;NM14ADC86901069_.mp3
I realize that you have much on your mind, and it may be days or weeks before you can help us, but I shall serve my mistress well until you come.;[];;[];[1353];dan14_c869;NM14ADC86901071_.mp3
I'll destroy you and tell her you're still out there.;[];;[1356];[1335];dan14_c869;
Wh... what?;[];;[1357, 1358];[1355];dan14_c869;NM14ADC86901074_.mp3
Do not do this...;[];;[1358];[1356];dan14_c869;NM14ADC86901076_.mp3
No! You'd make her suffer like that?! You monster!;[];;[];[1357, 1356];dan14_c869;NM14ADC86901078_.mp3
What, are you suicidal or something?;[];;[1334];[1332];dan14_c869;
You want to get away that badly?;[];;[1334];[1332];dan14_c869;

Um... probably not...;[];;[1330];[1362];dan14_c869;
But she wants you back.;[];;[1330];[1328];dan14_c869;
Weren't you kidnapped?;[];;[1366];[1324];dan14_c869;
No... I ran away of my own free will. But I have my reasons!;[];;[1327];[1365];dan14_c869;NM14ADC86901009_.mp3
Huh?;[];;[1368];[1322];dan14_c869;

Are you running from something?;[];;[1372];[1368];dan14_c869;
From my master, Elise. Wait...;[];;[1324];[1371];dan14_c869;NM14ADC86901018_.mp3
Okaay...;[];;[1368];[1322];dan14_c869;
Why were kath hounds attacking you?;[];;[1375];[1320];dan14_c869;
Who knows. They are beasts, and have been very aggressive of late.;[];;[1368];[1374];dan14_c869;NM14ADC86901021_.mp3
That was quite a beating you took.;[];;[1377];[1320];dan14_c869;

They abused you?;[];;[1379];[1377];dan14_c869;

Yes, I am owned by Elise Montagne, a wealthy widow who lives north of here.;[];;[1327];[1380];dan14_c869;NM14ADC86901086_.mp3
You left your owner's?;[];;[1327];[1377];dan14_c869;
I am not a Jedi Master yet.;[];;[1384];[1320];dan14_c869;
Ah, yes, I apologize, for my incorrect terminology.;[];;[1322];[1383];dan14_c869;NM14ADC86901090_.mp3
No problem.;[];;[1368];[1320];dan14_c869;

This is our main computer room here. We've got the box of passcards we got from the Sith, but we haven't been able to break their encryption yet.;[];;[1388];[1386];man26_reptech;NM26ACREPT15002_.mp3
We have been able to decode the numeric system they use, but there are holes in our terminal sequence patterns.;[];;[1389, 1397, 1398, 1399];[1387];man26_reptech;NM26ACREPT15004_.mp3
Terminal sequences?;[];;[1390];[1388];man26_reptech;
The strings of numbers that end the code sequences. If we could complete those strings, we would have the key to their encryption system.;[];;[1391];[1389];man26_reptech;NM26ACREPT15006_.mp3
The encryption system is composed of 6 'matrices'. Each is based on a mathematical method. The holes we're missing are the final number in each of the strings.;[];;[1392];[1390, 1397, 1398, 1400];man26_reptech;NM26ACREPT15010_.mp3
Most are simple, but the final two matrices seem to be much more difficult.;[];;[1393];[1391];man26_reptech;NM26ACREPT15012_.mp3
The second-last matrix has a pattern looping back on itself, or something, and the last is divided into smaller subparts. Maybe the pattern for that is within each part...;[];;[1394];[1392];man26_reptech;NM26ACREPT15014_.mp3
But I have to admit, all this is a bit over my head. I haven't even been able to slice past the first matrix and I've been at this for hours.;[];;[1395];[1393];man26_reptech;NM26ACREPT15016_.mp3
I've ruined a dozen cards already... But the good thing is we have a whole box of them, so you don't have to worry about running out any time soon.;[];;[1396];[1394];man26_reptech;NM26ACREPT15018_.mp3
Since Roland said you were cleared, you can use the computer freely. I'll be here if you have any questions.;[];;[];[1395];man26_reptech;NM26ACREPT15020_.mp3
What kind of holes?;[];;[1391];[1388];man26_reptech;
What do I have to do?;[];;[1391];[1388];man26_reptech;
I have a passcode to the Sith base.;[];;[1400];[1388];man26_reptech;
Oh, OK. Well I'll just explain the encryption method anyway, you might need it if your passcode doesn't live up to expectations.;[];;[1391];[1399];man26_reptech;NM26ACREPT15023_.mp3

Tell me about the Sith encryption matrices.;[];;[1405];[1403];man26_reptech;
The Sith encryption scheme on these cards is based on a sequence of simple mathematical principles.;[];;[1406];[1404];man26_reptech;NM26ACREPT15031_.mp3
We have managed to decode the majority of the encryption algorithm, by the final segments of the terminal sequences elude us.;[];;[1407];[1405];man26_reptech;NM26ACREPT15033_.mp3
If you think you are able, you can try to break the code on the card. Don't worry if you happen to ruin the card, the box we captured has a whole bunch of them.;[];;[1408];[1406];man26_reptech;NM26ACREPT15035_.mp3

What do you know about this data recording?;[];;[1410];[1408, 1403];man26_reptech;
That recording? I have no idea what it is. Its probably classified... and I don't have clearance for that sort of thing.;[];;[1411];[1409];man26_reptech;NM26ACREPT15039_.mp3
It might be something one of our intelligence agents picked up.;[];;[1408];[1410];man26_reptech;NM26ACREPT15041_.mp3
What do you know about the Hrakert Facility?;[];;[1413];[1408, 1403];man26_reptech;
I actually don't know much about it at all. It's some sort of facility the Republic built here wasn't it?;[];;[1414];[1412];man26_reptech;NM26ACREPT15045_.mp3
I'm not really cleared for that sort of information...;[];;[1408];[1413];man26_reptech;NM26ACREPT15047_.mp3
Nothing for now.;[];;[1416];[1408, 1403];man26_reptech;

No offense, but I probably shouldn't be talking to you anymore. I'm just going to say something that might get me in trouble.;[];;[];[1456, 1491];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29045_.mp3
If I could just find some other way to earn some credits I could give this lousy job up. Retire my uniform, so to speak.;[];;[1459, 1461, 1488, 1490];[1456, 1499];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29013_.mp3
Why aren't you in uniform now?;[];;[1460];[1458];tar02_sarna021;
Back at the military base, of course. I keep it there when I'm off duty. If anything happens to it they dock the cost from my pay.;[];;[1461, 1488];[1459];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29015_.mp3
If you help me get my hands on some uniforms I'll make it worth your while.;[];;[1462];[1460, 1458];tar02_sarna021;
What? Are you offering me a bribe? You realize this is treason, right? If I report you the Sith will have you executed!;[];;[1463, 1484, 1485];[1461];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29017_.mp3
You report me and I'll tell them how you really feel about your job.;[];;[1464];[1462];tar02_sarna021;
Hey, now - let's not start making threats. I didn't say I *would* report you, only that I could. This kind of talk is dangerous, you know? But I'm not going to turn you in.;[];;[1465];[1463];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29019_.mp3
The truth is I find your offer rather tempting. I could probably get you some uniforms. But if we get caught we're dead. You're asking me to take an awful risk.;[];;[1466];[1464, 1484];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29021_.mp3
If I'm going to do this, it's going to cost you. 200 credits up front if you want some uniforms. No more, no less. So how about it - we have a deal?;[];;[1467, 1478, 1481, 1483];[1465];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29022_.mp3
Okay - here's 200 credits.;[];;[1468];[1466, 1480, 1492];tar02_sarna021;
Okay, you've got a deal. The trick is to get you the uniforms without the Sith knowing I gave them to you. But I've got a plan.;[];;[1469];[1467, 1479];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29026_.mp3
I'm going to a party with some of the other Sith soldiers tonight. You show up and I'll make sure everyone else gets good and drunk. When we pass out you can take our uniforms.;[];;[1470, 1474, 1477];[1468];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29027_.mp3
Won't you get in trouble if I steal your uniform?;[];;[1471];[1469, 1476];tar02_sarna021;
I'll probably get a reprimand for not locking it up, but that's about it. Then, in another month I'll resign and retire with all those credits you gave me.;[];;[1472];[1470, 1477];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29029_.mp3
Here - I'll add the address of the party to your datapad. Show up there later. To be on the safe side we shouldn't speak again before or after the party.;[];;[1473];[1471];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29030_.mp3
I'll go make all the arrangements and I'll see you at the party tonight. Just remember - if you get caught with those uniforms, I don't know you.;[];;[];[1472];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29031_.mp3
How do I know this isn't some kind of set up?;[];;[1475];[1469];tar02_sarna021;
We're in this together now. If either one of us goes to the Sith we'll both end up in the torture chambers. Anyway, it's not like you have a choice.;[];;[1476];[1474];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29033_.mp3
I'm not giving you your credits back, so you might as well show up at the party later and take the uniforms after we all get drunk and pass out. What could be more simple?;[];;[1470, 1477];[1475];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29034_.mp3
Sounds like a good plan.;[];;[1471];[1476, 1469];tar02_sarna021;
[Persuade] Make it 100 credits and we have a deal.;[];;[1479, 1480];[1466, 1492];tar02_sarna021;
[Success] Hmmm... 100 credits is a small fortune. I'll never have the chance to make that much in one shot again.;[];;[1468];[1478];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29025_.mp3
[Failure] Look, I'm not going to risk my neck unless I get a big payday. 200 credits or no deal.;[];;[1467, 1481, 1483];[1478];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29036_.mp3
I can't afford that much.;[];;[1482];[1480, 1466, 1492];tar02_sarna021;
Sorry to hear that, but I won't put my neck on the line for nothing! Tell you what - you come up with the credits and we can talk. Otherwise, no deal.;[];;[];[1481, 1483];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29038_.mp3
Forget it - I'm not paying that much!;[];;[1482];[1480, 1466, 1492];tar02_sarna021;
I don't think you'll report me. I think you've been waiting for an offer like this.;[];;[1465];[1462];tar02_sarna021;
Hey, relax - I was just making a joke.;[];;[1486];[1462];tar02_sarna021;
You... you weren't serious? Oh... okay. Although if you *were* serious, we might be able to work something out. No - wait! Forget I said that! We shouldn't be talking like this.;[];;[1487];[1485];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29041_.mp3
I might complain a lot, but it's a big step from complaining to treason. I think... I think maybe we should end this conversation - for both our sakes.;[];;[];[1486];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29042_.mp3
I'll be going now.;[];;[1489];[1460, 1458, 1493, 1535];tar02_sarna021;
Oh... okay. See you around. Say, do me a favor and don't repeat all the stuff I just told you. It might not go over well with my superiors.;[];;[];[1488];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29047_.mp3
Can I ask you some questions?;[];;[1491];[1458];tar02_sarna021;
"The senior officers don't really like it when we start answering questions, you know? They don't want us fraternizing with the locals. Just another ""perk"" of the job.";[];;[1457];[1490];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29044_.mp3
Well, are you here to close our deal? 200 credits gets you access to a set of Sith uniforms. Otherwise, we really shouldn't be talking.;[];;[1467, 1478, 1481, 1483];[None];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29005_.mp3
Sorry, but I'm not here looking for conversation. I just came to get a drink, listen to some music and try to relax before my next shift at the military base.;[];If character is female, nothing happens;[1488, 1494];[None];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29006_.mp3
You're from the military base? You don't look like one of the Sith.;[];;[1495];[1493, 1536];tar02_sarna021;
I don't wear my uniform when I'm off duty. It's not allowed. In fact, anyone in uniform is banned from entering the cantina.;[];;[1496];[1494];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29008_.mp3
The officers don't even like it when we show up here off duty. Don't like us fraternizing with the locals, I guess. But it gets pretty stale hanging around the base all the time.;[];;[1497];[1495];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29009_.mp3
Besides, the Sith don't own me. Being a soldier in their fleet is just a job, you know? A job with long hours and low pay, I might add.;[];;[1498, 1500, 1501];[1496];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29010_.mp3
So why do you do it?;[];;[1499];[1497];tar02_sarna021;
When I signed up I was promised adventure and excitement in exotic locales. Instead, I end up stationed at a military base on some backwater planet on the fringes of the galaxy.;[];;[1458];[1498, 1500];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29012_.mp3
Sounds like you aren't very happy.;[];;[1499];[1497];tar02_sarna021;
I'm not interested in chatting right now.;[];;[1502];[1497, 1504, 1536];tar02_sarna021;
First you come over and say hi, then you scurry off as soon as you find out I'm a Sith soldier. You Tarisians are a funny bunch.;[];;[];[1501];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29088_.mp3
Hey, there. I didn't think we'd be chatting again so soon. You took off on me pretty quick last time.;[];;[1504];[None];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29049_.mp3
I'm actually a little surprised you're talking to me at all... most of the people here on Taris can't stand us Sith. It can make this job pretty lonely.;[];;[1501, 1505, 1523, 1527];[1503];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29056_.mp3
[Persuade] You're just doing your job, right? I don't hold that against you.;[];;[1506, 1521];[1504, 1526];tar02_sarna021;
[Success] That's true, but people don't appreciate what we've done for them. We could have slapped a curfew on this whole planet, but we didn't.;[];;[1507];[1505];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29058_.mp3
You know, it's like everyone on this backwater planet is in a permanent bad mood. Don't they know we have to make the best of things?;[];;[1508, 1520];[1506, 1531];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29073_.mp3
You've got a pretty positive attitude.;[];;[1509];[1507, 1530];tar02_sarna021;
Exactly! It's all about attitude. I didn't ask to be assigned to this backwater planet, but I try to make the best of it!;[];;[1510];[1508, 1520];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29075_.mp3
It's pretty easy to get depressed on an assignment like this, but we do what we can to keep our spirits up.;[];;[1511, 1519];[1509];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29076_.mp3
You need to blow off steam once in a while.;[];;[1512];[1510];tar02_sarna021;
That's true. It's nice to meet someone who understands what I'm going through. It's good to talk about this stuff - it gets pretty lonely up at the military base.;[];;[1513];[1511, 1519];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29078_.mp3
I have to get going soon - I've got a shift at the military base. But some of us junior Sith officers are having a party tonight to blow off some steam.;[];;[1514];[1512];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29079_.mp3
I'd really like to see you again. Why don't you drop by the party? I'll show you where it is on your map.;[];;[1515, 1517];[1513];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29080_.mp3
Sounds good. I'll be there.;[];;[1516];[1514];tar02_sarna021;
Don't be late. We're starting right after our shifts end. Most of us won't even be going back to the base to lock up our uniforms. I look forward to seeing you there.;[];;[];[1515, 1518];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29082_.mp3
I don't think I can make it.;[];;[1518];[1514];tar02_sarna021;
Just because I'm with the Sith doesn't mean I don't know how to have a good time. You'll enjoy yourself. I promise.;[];;[1516];[1517];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29084_.mp3
It must be tough, being stationed on a hostile world.;[];;[1512];[1510];tar02_sarna021;
Everybody has their ups and downs... it's how you deal with them that counts.;[];;[1509];[1507, 1530];tar02_sarna021;
[Failure] Save the sympathetic best friend act. I'm not buying it.;[];;[1522];[1505, 1529];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29059_.mp3
But I don't want to fill out a bunch of paperwork on my day off, so let's just pretend this conversation never happened. Now move along.;[];;[];[1521];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29060_.mp3
You can't really blame people... you did conquer the planet.;[];;[1524];[1504];tar02_sarna021;

Sorry - I'm not trying to judge you.;[];;[1526];[1524, 1535];tar02_sarna021;
Ah, it's okay. I might have overreacted a bit. But can you blame me? Everywhere I look I see one of you Tarisians glaring at me with hate in your eyes.;[];;[1505, 1527];[1525];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29064_.mp3
I'm not actually from Taris. I'm just stuck here until the quarantine ends.;[];;[1528];[1526, 1504];tar02_sarna021;
You're an off-worlder? Huh, I figured you'd be even more angry, being stuck on a foreign planet and all.;[];;[1529, 1531];[1527];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29069_.mp3
[Persuade] Hey, we're both strangers on Taris. We have to stick together.;[];;[1521, 1530];[1528];tar02_sarna021;
[Success] You're right! It's like everyone on this backwater planet is in a permanent bad mood. Don't they know they have to make the best of things?;[];;[1508, 1520];[1529];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29071_.mp3
Being stuck on Taris isn't so bad... but the locals aren't much fun.;[];;[1507];[1528];tar02_sarna021;
You seem pretty touchy about this. Maybe you feel a little guilty about what you do.;[];;[1533];[1524, 1535];tar02_sarna021;
Don't try to analyze me. I'm just doing my job - same as any other soldier in any other army. Besides, I don't have to explain myself to you!;[];;[1534];[1532];tar02_sarna021;NM02AESARN29066_.mp3

*sigh* What is it you want? Why do you bother me?;[{'Juhani': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[1566, 1641, 1643, 1645, 1647];[1564, 1649, 1652];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07027_.mp3
I was sent by the Council to cleanse the taint from this grove.;[];;[1567];[1565, 1644];dan14_juhani;
The Council has sent you here to kill me? Why, then, when you bested me so easily, did you not simply finish your task? Is it not apparent that I can never be saved?;[];;[1568, 1635, 1637, 1639];[1566];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07029_.mp3
[Persuade] I have no desire to kill you, Juhani.;[];;[1569, 1634];[1567, 1642];dan14_juhani;
[Success] You... you do not?;[];;[1570];[1568];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07031_.mp3
I am pathetic. I sit here and think myself to be great by embracing the dark side, but I am nothing! There is no way I could be turned back!;[{'Juhani': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[1571];[1569, 1638];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07032_.mp3
I always thought they held me back, were jealous of my power. But it is only because I was not good enough to meet their standards... I never have been.;[{'Juhani': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[1572, 1623, 1626, 1629, 1633];[1570];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07033_.mp3
[Persuade] Come now, Juhani. You are a beautiful young woman who has much talent.;[];;[1573, 1622];[1571];dan14_juhani;
[Success] I thank you for your kind words, Jedi.;[];;[1574, 1575];[1572];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07035_.mp3
You seem to know just what affects me...;[];;[1575];[1573];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07036_.mp3
I seem to still have much to learn... Both about being a Jedi, and about myself.;[];;[1576];[1574, 1573, 1633];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07037_.mp3
But I wish the cost of my ignorance had not been so high. I wish that my Master had not suffered because of me.;[];;[1577, 1613, 1614, 1616, 1619, 1621];[1575];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07038_.mp3
[Persuade] It is not your fault, Juhani.;[];;[1578, 1610];[1576, 1665];dan14_juhani;
[Success] I only wish things could have been different...;[];;[1579];[1577];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07040_.mp3
If she were alive now, there would be so much I would say to her... So much I would apologize for.;[{'Juhani': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[1580, 1581];[1578, 1613];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07041_.mp3
I think, in my own way, I truly loved her...;[];;[1581];[1579];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07042_.mp3
Oh, how can the Council ever take me back with what I have done? Striking my Master down in anger is unforgivable!;[];;[1582, 1602, 1604, 1605, 1608];[1580, 1579];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07043_.mp3
[Persuade] Do not worry, Juhani. They will surely take you back.;[];;[1583, 1591];[1581];dan14_juhani;
[Success] I should convince them that I am truly repentant, that I am willing to forsake the dark side.;[];;[1584];[1582];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07045_.mp3
Maybe, just maybe, they would accept me back.;[];;[1585];[1583, 1603];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07046_.mp3
Do you think they would? Could it be possible after what I have done?;[];;[1586, 1594, 1596, 1597, 1599, 1600];[1584];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07047_.mp3
[Persuade] Of course it would. They would always accept you back.;[];;[1587, 1591];[1585, 1666];dan14_juhani;
[Success] I... I thank you, master Jedi.;[];;[1588];[1586];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07049_.mp3
I will return to the Council, then. I shall submit myself to their judgment, and hope that they will forgive me.;[];;[1589, 1590];[1587, 1598];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07050_.mp3
If only there was some way I could make this up to you...;[];;[1590];[1588];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07051_.mp3
Again, I thank you. I am sure I will hear great things about you in the future.;[];;[];[1589, 1588];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07052_.mp3
[Failure] The Council may forgive a lot... But not this.;[];;[1592];[1586, 1582];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07059_.mp3
I am lost! Even though I would repent, there is nowhere left for me to go!;[{'Juhani': 'Horror'}];;[1593];[1591, 1595];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07064_.mp3
Leave me to my hopelessness!;[{'Juhani': 'Horror'}];;[];[1592, 1609];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07065_.mp3
It might be.;[];;[1595];[1585, 1666];dan14_juhani;
The Council may forgive a lot... But not this.;[];;[1592];[1594, 1596, 1599, 1604];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07063_.mp3
Unlikely... But it's worth a shot.;[];;[1595];[1585, 1666];dan14_juhani;
Your inner peace and harmony will show them your sincerity.;[];;[1598];[1585, 1666];dan14_juhani;
I... I thank you, master Jedi.;[];;[1588];[1597];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07056_.mp3
I do not know.;[];;[1595];[1585, 1666];dan14_juhani;
If you can't bring yourself back, then I must slay you.;[];;[1601];[1585, 1666];dan14_juhani;
What? No! I will not let you take me now!;[{'Juhani': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[];[1600, 1621];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07083_.mp3
Anger? Show them that you have freed yourself of this base passion.;[];;[1603];[1581];dan14_juhani;
If I show them I am free of passion... That I am serene... That I am willing to forsake the dark side.;[];;[1584];[1602];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07061_.mp3
The Council may forgive a lot.;[];;[1595];[1581];dan14_juhani;
Heh. Your Master surely won't be forgiving you.;[];;[1606];[1581];dan14_juhani;
You... You monster! To mock my grief that way!;[{'Juhani': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[1607];[1605];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07067_.mp3
Leave me at once, lest I strike you down!;[{'Juhani': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[];[1606];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07068_.mp3
Yet forgiveness must be asked.;[];;[1609];[1581];dan14_juhani;
And denied! No, I cannot! And so here I will stay.;[{'Juhani': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[1593];[1608];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07070_.mp3
[Failure] It is! It is!;[{'Juhani': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[1611];[1577];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07071_.mp3
It was I who hurt her, I who killed her! Her suffering is my fault alone!;[{'Juhani': 'Horror'}];;[1612];[1610, 1615, 1618, 1620];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07080_.mp3
Leave me to my pain!;[{'Juhani': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[];[1611];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07081_.mp3
Even in death, the Force will allow her to live on.;[];;[1579];[1576, 1665];dan14_juhani;
Life is a learning experience.;[];;[1615];[1576, 1665];dan14_juhani;
But learning does not have to end in death!;[];;[1611];[1614];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07074_.mp3
Your master knew the risks.;[];;[1617];[1576, 1665];dan14_juhani;
She knew I would be headstrong, but she also thought I would adhere to the light!;[];;[1618];[1616];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07076_.mp3
Instead, I betrayed her trust and fell prey to my own inner darkness.;[];;[1611];[1617];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07077_.mp3
Life is suffering.;[];;[1620];[1576, 1665];dan14_juhani;
Life is suffering, yes... but it was by my conscious choice!;[];;[1611];[1619];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07079_.mp3
I suppose there is no hope. I must kill you then.;[];;[1601];[1576, 1665];dan14_juhani;
[Failure] You think compliments will convince me I didn't kill my master? Leave me to my agony!;[{'Juhani': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[];[1572];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07084_.mp3
Why are you even thinking like that?;[];;[1624];[1571];dan14_juhani;
Why? Because I am right, that's why! I can see the truth in your eyes as well!;[{'Juhani': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[1625];[1623];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07086_.mp3
Do not look at me again!;[];;[];[1624];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07087_.mp3
Maybe you shouldn't have been a Jedi, then.;[];;[1627];[1571];dan14_juhani;
They came to me! They sought me out! So it is their failure that I have fallen.;[];;[1628];[1626];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07089_.mp3
Come back when you have something more meaningful to say.;[];;[];[1627];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07090_.mp3
Standards cannot apply to everyone.;[];;[1630];[1571];dan14_juhani;
What?? What foolishness is this? Standards are MADE to apply to everyone.;[];;[1631];[1629];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07092_.mp3
And if I cannot measure up to them... Well then, I am no one at all...;[];;[1632];[1630];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07093_.mp3
Leave me.;[];;[];[1631];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07094_.mp3
The first step on the path of true knowledge is knowing that you are ignorant.;[];;[1575];[1571];dan14_juhani;
[Failure] Lies! Leave me and come back when you have the courage to finish your task!;[{'Juhani': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[];[1568];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07097_.mp3
You're right, maybe I should.;[];;[1636];[1567, 1642];dan14_juhani;
Act or begone!;[{'Juhani': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[];[1635, 1640];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07103_.mp3
I do not hold anger towards you, Juhani. I wish you peace.;[];;[1638];[1567, 1642];dan14_juhani;
Not anger, peace... Yet even with your naive attitude you managed to beat me.;[];;[1570];[1637];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07100_.mp3
I wasn't really ordered to kill you.;[];;[1640];[1567, 1642];dan14_juhani;
Thinking of using technicalities to do the deed and ease your conscience?;[];;[1636];[1639];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07102_.mp3
I just want to talk.;[];;[1642];[1565, 1644];dan14_juhani;
Talk?! You who have beaten me so easily just want to talk? I do not believe it. Kill me now, while you still have the power.;[];;[1568, 1635, 1637, 1639];[1641];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07105_.mp3
Why are you doing this?;[];;[1644];[1565];dan14_juhani;
I have fallen and dark power courses through my veins. I can never go back to the Council, so here I shall stay.;[];;[1566, 1641, 1645];[1643];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07107_.mp3
I will leave you now.;[];;[1646];[1644, 1565];dan14_juhani;
Flee back to your masters, Jedi.;[];;[];[1645];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07110_.mp3
I have decided to slay you and remove the taint.;[];;[1648];[1565];dan14_juhani;
You overestimate yourself, whelp!;[{'Juhani': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[];[1647, 1653, 1660];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07013_.mp3
And I laugh at your pathetic attempt.;[];;[1565];[1563];dan14_juhani;
You slew Quatra, your Master?;[];;[1651];[1563];dan14_juhani;
Yes, I struck her down in the middle of training, consumed by my anger, embracing the power of hate!;[{'Juhani': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[1652];[1650];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07010_.mp3
But... it was not enough...;[{'Juhani': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[1565];[1651];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07011_.mp3
You shall be the one I crush!;[];;[1648];[1563];dan14_juhani;
You were a Jedi then?;[];;[1655];[1560];dan14_juhani;
A better Jedi than you will ever be. More powerful as well, for I could best MY teacher.;[];;[1562];[1654];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07015_.mp3
You've been corrupting the kath hounds?;[];;[1657];[1560];dan14_juhani;
Yes... Aren't they pretty? My pets...;[];;[1658];[1656];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07017_.mp3
They like the smell of power I exude. They know their master.;[];;[1659];[1657];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07018_.mp3
I harnessed true power when I struck down my Master, Quatra.;[];;[1563];[1658];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07019_.mp3
And now I'll take it from you.;[];;[1648];[1560];dan14_juhani;
What are you doing here?;[];;[1559];[1557];dan14_juhani;
Why did you attack me?;[];;[1559];[1557];dan14_juhani;
And I'll finish you now.;[];;[1664];[1557];dan14_juhani;
I, Juhani, shall be your death!;[{'Juhani': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[];[1663];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07024_.mp3
I do not know what to do. Now that I have caused such suffering to my Master and those around me...;[{'Juhani': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[1577, 1613, 1614, 1616, 1619, 1621];[None];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07025_.mp3
How can I ever face the Council now with what I have done? It is hopeless! It could not be possible that they would accept me back...;[{'Juhani': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[1586, 1594, 1596, 1597, 1599, 1600];[None];dan14_juhani;NM14ACJUHA07026_.mp3
Intruders in the base! Attack! Attack!;[];;[];[None];tar09_sith091;NM09AASITH03000_.mp3
Shame about Sunry getting convicted like that. I guess he really did kill Elassa after all.;[];;[];[None];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04000_.mp3
There, you got what you wanted: Sunry's free. Now don't ever mention my part in this again!;[];;[];[None];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04002_.mp3
I guess Sunry didn't kill the Sith woman after all. Could have sworn he left after the shot though...;[];;[];[None];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04004_.mp3
You're the one defending Sunry now, eh? Well, the hotel's open for you and I guess I got to answer any questions you want, too.;[];;[1672, 1676, 1679, 1685];[None];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04006_.mp3
Tell me what you saw the night of the murder.;[];;[1673];[1671, 1678, 1684];man26_ignus;
The Sith woman Elassa rented a room in the hotel. An hour or two later Sunry comes in and goes to her room. A couple hours later I hear a blaster shot and see Sunry running.;[];;[1674, 1687];[1672];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04008_.mp3
Sure. *wink* *wink* Sunry left before the blaster went off, so he couldn't have done it.;[];;[1675];[1673];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04010_.mp3
Do you need to know anything else?;[];;[1676, 1679];[1674];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04012_.mp3
What do you know about Sunry and Elassa?;[];;[1677];[1675, 1684, 1698, 1705, 1707, 1709, 1671];man26_ignus;
Elassa used to rent rooms here every week or so. Then Sunry would come by a couple hours later and stay all night.;[];;[1678];[1676];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04036_.mp3
It doesn't take a genius to figure out what was going on.;[];;[1672, 1679, 1685];[1677];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04038_.mp3
Who are the witnesses in the hotel?;[];;[1680];[1678, 1675, 1698, 1705, 1707, 1709, 1671];man26_ignus;
There were only two other people in the hotel when it happened. One was a Rodian named Gluupor. Seems like a really dirty, shifty type.;[];;[1681];[1679];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04040_.mp3
Normally I don't let his kind in here - I'm a reputable business man, you know! - but there weren't many people here, so I decided to take a chance.;[];;[1682];[1680];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04042_.mp3
The other is a regular named Firith Me. He's a Pazaak player. Probably an addict, but he claims he's big in some circles.;[];;[1683];[1681];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04044_.mp3
Don't know anything about him other than that.;[];;[1684];[1682];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04046_.mp3
Anything else you want to know?;[];;[1672, 1676, 1685];[1683];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04048_.mp3
I have no more questions for now.;[];;[1686];[1684, 1678, 1698, 1705, 1707, 1709, 1671];man26_ignus;
Well, OK. If you need anything else I'm going to be right here.;[];;[];[1685];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04050_.mp3
He can't run good 'cause he's a cripple, but still he was going pretty fast. I would swear he started after the shot though.;[];;[1688, 1690, 1708];[1673];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04013_.mp3
Are you sure?;[];;[1689];[1687];man26_ignus;
Yeah, I'm pretty damn sure he left after the shot went off.;[];;[1690, 1708];[1688];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04015_.mp3
Could it have gone off after he left?;[];;[1691];[1689, 1687];man26_ignus;
No, I don't think so. I mean, it's possible, just barely, but I wouldn't say that to the court.;[];;[1692, 1694, 1703, 1708];[1690];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04017_.mp3
[Persuade] You could testify it happened after he left.;[];;[1693];[1691];man26_ignus;
[Failure] No. No way I'm lying to the court just because you want to get your Republic buddy off, or whatever. I have no interest in going to prison!;[];;[1694, 1703, 1708];[1692, 1694];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04019_.mp3
[Persuade] I could pay you 200 credits to say it.;[];;[1693, 1695];[1693, 1691];man26_ignus;
[Success] That's a lot of money... Maybe I could do something for you then.;[];;[1696];[1694];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04021_.mp3
Alright, I'll do it. I'll tell the Selkath that he left before the shot went off, but this is our little secret. If you try and turn me in for lying, I'm making sure you come with me!;[];;[1697, 1698, 1699, 1700, 1701, 1702];[1695];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04023_.mp3
I know you want to help Sunry, but we should not be manufacturing evidence like this.;[];;[1698];[1696, 1704];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04077_.mp3
Now, was there anything else you wanted?;[];;[1676, 1679, 1685];[1697, 1699, 1700, 1701, 1702, 1696];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04025_.mp3
I see you are more interested in winning than in trying to solve this case. I cannot say I approve of your actions here.;[];;[1698];[1696, 1704];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04078_.mp3
Hmm... I guess this is what they call working the system. Not that I'm objecting. I just hope the Selkath don't find out about it.;[];;[1698];[1696, 1704];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04079_.mp3
Looks like Manaan isn't much different than Taris: justice is up for grabs to the highest bidder.;[];;[1698];[1696];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04080_.mp3
Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean, I want to help get Sunry acquitted, but what if the Selkath find out about this?;[];;[1698];[1696, 1704];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04081_.mp3
[Force Persuade] You will testify Sunry left before the shot.;[{'Player': 'Persuade'}];;[1704, 1706];[1693, 1691];man26_ignus;
[Success] Yeah. I'll tell the court Sunry left before the shot went off.;[];;[1697, 1699, 1700, 1702, 1705];[1703];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04027_.mp3
Is there anything else you need?;[];;[1676, 1679, 1685];[1704];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04029_.mp3
[Failure] What?? Why the hell should I? I'll tell them what I saw and that's it.;[];;[1707];[1703];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04030_.mp3

I want to ask something else.;[];;[1709];[1693, 1691, 1689, 1687];man26_ignus;
What do you want to know?;[];;[1676, 1679, 1685];[1708];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04034_.mp3
Sorry, but the hotel is closed.;[];;[1711];[None];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04052_.mp3
Ever since the murder, the Selkath have made me keep this place locked up tight. Only the Selkath authorities and those authorized by them are allowed in.;[];;[1712, 1717, 1721, 1723, 1726];[1710];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04054_.mp3
What murder?;[];;[1713];[1711, 1720, 1725, 1727];man26_ignus;
This old Republic war-hero by the name of Sunry was seeing this Sith woman here - Elassa.;[];;[1714];[1712];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04056_.mp3
Well, they were seeing each other, but the other night a blaster went off in one of the rooms. Sunry got seen leaving the place and the Sith woman was dead on the floor.;[];;[1715];[1713];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04058_.mp3
But not everyone thinks this Sunry did it, so the Selkath are holding him in prison while the case gets sorted out. In the meantime they close down my hotel!;[];;[1716];[1714];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04060_.mp3
But enough about my problems... You can't stay here while the investigation is on. You'll have to find someplace else to stay. Sorry.;[];;[];[1715];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04062_.mp3
[Lie] I am authorized by the Selkath government.;[];;[1718];[1711];man26_ignus;
[Failure] Ha! They sent me a list of people to let in, and they're all Selkath. Somehow, you just don't look like one.;[];;[1719, 1721];[1717];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04065_.mp3
[Force Persuade] You want to let me in.;[{'Player': 'Persuade'}];;[1720];[1718];man26_ignus;

But since the murder happened I haven't exactly been able to do a lot of business. That's the price of law and order here, I guess.;[];;[1712, 1721];[1724];man26_ignus;NM26ACIGNU04071_.mp3
Have you seen a Star Map?;[];;[1727];[1711];man26_ignus;

Well, this is Dreshdae... it's the only colony on the planet. Korriban is a Sith planet, well within their space, though it's not very well-inhabited.;[];;[1759];[1757];kor33_portauth;
The Sith allow Czerka to conduct some mining here, and the company operates the starport... but otherwise the colony revolves around the local Sith academy.;[];;[1760, 1765, 1767, 1769, 1771];[1758];kor33_portauth;
Tell me about Czerka.;[];;[1761];[1759];kor33_portauth;
Czerka is one of the largest corporations in the Core... I'm surprised you haven't heard of it. They have interests in mining all over this sector.;[];;[1762, 1764];[1760];kor33_portauth;

You promised to help us. In exchange for our aid you swore to destroy the ancient evils of our Rakata ancestors! Are you saying this means nothing to you now?;[{'Rakatan Hologram': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[1797, 1929];[1795];unk42_redelder;
My mind was destroyed. My memories were lost.;[];;[1798];[1796];unk42_redelder;
Hmmm... we do sense something different about you. Something that has changed. You are not the same as you were before. Perhaps your memory has been lost.;[];;[1799];[1797, 1929];unk42_redelder;
Yet the power you wield - what you call the Force - is within you still. You can still help us, Revan... if we dare to trust you again.;[];;[1800, 1926, 1928];[1798];unk42_redelder;
This is a little overwhelming. I still don't remember anything.;[];;[1801];[1799];unk42_redelder;
If what you say is true - that you cannot remember when you were last here - then you must have many questions. Ask what you will, Revan, and we will try to help you understand.;[];;[1802, 1925];[1800];unk42_redelder;
You could tell me who you are, for starters.;[];;[1803];[1801, 1927];unk42_redelder;
We are the Elders, descendants of the Rakata priests who served during the days of the Infinite Empire over 20,000 of your galactic standard years ago. You met us the last time you came here.;[];;[1804];[1802];unk42_redelder;
You arrived with Malak - your servant - three of your galactic standard years ago. We saw your ship plummet to the earth, a victim of the disruptor field that guards this planet.;[];;[1805];[1803, 1925];unk42_redelder;
You and Malak both survived the crash, though you were stranded here on our world. And in your search for a way off this planet, you discovered our enclave - just as you did this time.;[];;[1806];[1804];unk42_redelder;
You used the Force to draw the Rakata language from our minds, even as you planted Basic into our skulls so we could help you in your quest to escape this world.;[];;[1807];[1805];unk42_redelder;
We helped you enter the Temple of the Ancients. You and Malak both. And you now, after all this time, you have returned - with your mind wiped clean. Is there anything else you wish to know?;[];;[1808, 1818, 1821, 1822, 1826, 1921];[1806];unk42_redelder;
Do a lot of ships crash because of the disruptor field?;[];;[1809];[1807, 1820, 1825, 1817];unk42_redelder;
Throughout the history of our world many ships have fallen victim to the disruptor field. Most within the ships perish in the crash, though some creatures do survive.;[];;[1810];[1808];unk42_redelder;
That is how the great war beasts you call rancors came to this world. A few of the beasts survived the crash, and they were captured and trained by some of the more primitive Rakata tribes.;[];;[1811, 1818, 1821, 1822, 1826];[1809];unk42_redelder;
More primitive tribes? You mean there are other Rakata?;[];;[1812];[1810, 1825];unk42_redelder;
There are many Rakata on this world, though most are primitive and war-like tribes descended from the lower castes of the Infinite Empire. The most powerful of all these is the tribe of the One.;[];;[1813];[1811, 1821];unk42_redelder;
Many times the warriors of the One's tribe have attacked our compound, hoping to gain the knowledge we guard. But our technology is far superior to theirs, and their attacks have failed.;[];;[1814, 1924];[1812];unk42_redelder;
And what about your tribe?;[];;[1815];[1813];unk42_redelder;
We are the Elders, descended from the priest caste of the Infinite Empire. We are the keepers of knowledge and the guardians of the Temple of the Ancients.;[];;[1816];[1814, 1924];unk42_redelder;
During the collapse of the Rakata Empire, the warlords unleashed weapons of terrible destruction that threatened to drive our species to extinction.;[];;[1817];[1815];unk42_redelder;
In the devastation's aftermath our ancestors locked the knowledge of such technology away in the Temple so it could never be used again. Ever since then, we Elders have kept our vigil.;[];;[1808, 1818, 1822, 1826, 1921];[1816];unk42_redelder;
Tell me about the Temple of the Ancients.;[];;[1819];[1817, 1825, 1810, 1807];unk42_redelder;
There is little I can tell you about the Temple. I know the secrets of our ancestors are contained within, but the Temple itself is barred to us. Only those who can command the Force can enter.;[];;[1820];[1818];unk42_redelder;
Long ago we Rakata had this power, but it has since been lost to us. That was why we helped you the last time you were here, Revan: you could enter the Temple, but we could not.;[];;[1808, 1821, 1822, 1826, 1921];[1819];unk42_redelder;
I want to know more about you. Tell me about the Rakata.;[];;[1812];[1820, 1825, 1810, 1807];unk42_redelder;
I need parts to repair my ship.;[];;[1823];[1820, 1817, 1810, 1807];unk42_redelder;
Even if you repair your ship, you will not be able to leave this world until you enter the Temple and disable the disruptor field that caused you to crash in the first place.;[];;[1824];[1822];unk42_redelder;
As for the parts you seek, that we cannot help you with. You might be able to salvage what you need if you explore some of the crash sites on this world.;[];;[1825];[1823];unk42_redelder;
But most of the wrecks are quickly raided and stripped by the more primitive and war-like Rakata tribes. Though they do not understand the technology, they hoard whatever they can carry.;[];;[1808, 1811, 1818, 1821, 1826, 1921];[1824];unk42_redelder;
So if I promise to help you again, will you help me?;[];;[1827];[1825, 1820, 1817, 1810, 1807];unk42_redelder;
We trusted you once before, Revan - and you betrayed us. It is true you can enter the Temple and we cannot, but how can we trust you after last time?;[];;[1828, 1919, 1920];[1826, 1923];unk42_redelder;
[Persuade] I am a servant of the light now. I want to make amends for the mistakes of the past.;[];;[1829];[1827];unk42_redelder;
[Failure] You say you are not who you once were, yet here on our world you repeat the pattern of your last visit.;[];;[1830];[1828, 1919];unk42_redelder;
Like the last time, you have crashed here. Like last time, you have come seeking our help. How have you changed, Revan?;[];;[1831, 1898, 1901, 1913, 1918];[1829];unk42_redelder;
[Persuade] I rescued one of your tribe from the One.;[];;[1832];[1830, 1900];unk42_redelder;
[Success] Yes, your actions seem to show you to be an ally of our cause. But how can we be certain the rescue was not just an attempt to win our trust so you can exploit us?;[];;[1833];[1831];unk42_redelder;
We must discuss this in greater detail. We must have some privacy, Revan. We will return when our deliberations are done.;[];guards walk up and escort the player away, fade to black, fade back in, guards walk back in with player;[1834];[1832, 1902, 1936];unk42_redelder;
Revan, you have rescued a member of our tribe from the One at great personal risk to yourself. We believe this action shows you have truly changed since your last visit here.;[];;[1835];[1833];unk42_redelder;
The Council has decided we will trust you once more. For many generations we have sought a way to enter the Temple and discover the means to destroy the Star Forge.;[];;[1836];[1834];unk42_redelder;
But only those who can command the Force - those like you - can enter the Temple of the Ancients. We no longer have that power. That was why we helped you the last time you were here.;[];;[1837];[1835];unk42_redelder;
But you cannot enter the Temple without our help, Revan. Only the ancient rituals of our people can lower the shield for you to enter. You need us as much as we need you, Revan.;[];;[1838];[1836];unk42_redelder;
Looks like we'll be working together, then.;[];;[1839];[1837];unk42_redelder;
For our own sake, and that of the entire galaxy, we hope you truly mean to atone for your past evils. When you are ready, Revan, we will take you to the Temple.;[];;[1840];[1838];unk42_redelder;
But the temple is a place of sacred power. If you are to enter you must do so alone, in the tradition followed by our Rakata ancestors for the past thousand generations.;[];;[1841, 1897];[1839];unk42_redelder;
Why do I have to go in alone?;[];;[1842];[1840];unk42_redelder;
When you were last here we broke the ancient tradition. We allowed you and your apprentice to enter the Temple together, and it brought untold suffering upon the galaxy.;[];;[1843];[1841, 1897];unk42_redelder;
"We believe you truly wish to destroy the Star Forge this time. But the lesson of the past is not easily forgotten. We will not defile the sacred ritual a second time; only you alone may enter.";[];;[1844, 1892];[1842];unk42_redelder;
When I am ready, I will go into the Temple alone.;[];;[1845];[1843];unk42_redelder;
Then it is done. You have only to let us know when you are ready to enter the Temple.;[];;[1846, 1853, 1864, 1890];[1844, 1894];unk42_redelder;
I want to enter the Temple now.;[];;[1847];[1845, 1861, 1887, 1889, 1932, 6013];unk42_redelder;
The time has come for you to atone for your past crimes, Revan. But the task ahead will be difficult. Those you call dark Jedi - followers of your old apprentice - now dwell within the Temple.;[];;[1848, 1852];[1846];unk42_redelder;
There's dark Jedi inside the Temple? How did they get in there?;[];;[1849];[1847];unk42_redelder;
The last time you and Malak entered the Temple you must have found the controls to raise and lower the shields. Those inside can lower the barrier to allow other Force users to enter and exit the Temple.;[];;[1850];[1848];unk42_redelder;
But they will not be able to prevent us from using the ritual to gain you access. Once inside, however, we can do nothing to help you.;[];;[1851];[1849];unk42_redelder;
Go to the Temple now. We will meet you there once the ritual has been prepared. Remember: in accordance with ancient Rakata tradition you must enter the Temple alone.;[];;[];[1850, 1852];unk42_redelder;
I can deal with them.;[];;[1851];[1847];unk42_redelder;
I want to ask you some questions.;[];;[1854];[1845, 1932, 1933, 6013, 6014];unk42_redelder;
We will tell you what we can, Revan.;[];;[1855, 1864, 1867, 1885, 1888];[1853, 1863, 1912];unk42_redelder;
I have questions about you: your tribe, your history, the Temple.;[];;[1856];[1854];unk42_redelder;
You should speak to Osraa, the Keeper of History. He is located near the great computer on the far side of our enclave. But I will do my best to answer your questions.;[];;[1857, 1863, 1864, 1867, 1869, 1871, 1880, 1883];[1855, 1862];unk42_redelder;
Tell me about your tribe.;[];;[1858];[1856];unk42_redelder;
We are the Elders. Our ancestors were the priests of the Infinite Empire, the guardians of the Temple and the keepers of technology.;[];;[1859];[1857];unk42_redelder;
After the Warlords unleashed their weapons of mass destruction and devastated the world, our ancestors knew we could never allow such techonolgy to be used again.;[];;[1860];[1858];unk42_redelder;
We sealed the knowledge of destruction within the Temple, and for the past thousand generations we have kept vigil here, ensuring the knowledge does not fall into the wrong hands.;[];;[1861];[1859];unk42_redelder;
If you wish to know more about this you should speak to Osraa, the Keeper of History.;[];;[1846, 1862, 1863, 1864, 1867];[1860, 1870, 1876, 1882, 1884];unk42_redelder;
I have more questions about your history.;[];;[1856];[1861];unk42_redelder;
I want to ask you about something else.;[];;[1854];[1861, 1872, 1856, 1887, 1889];unk42_redelder;
I'll be back when I'm ready to enter the Temple.;[];;[1865];[1861, 1872, 1856, 1887, 1889, 1854, 1845, 1932, 6013];unk42_redelder;
As you wish. Come speak to us when you are ready to enter the Temple and we will lower the shield for you.;[];;[1866];[1864];unk42_redelder;
But remember: when the time comes you must enter the Temple alone, in accordance with the traditions of the ancient Rakata.;[];;[];[1865];unk42_redelder;
I'll be back after I rescue that prisoner!;[];;[1868];[1861, 1856, 1887, 1889, 1854, 1911, 1933, 6014];unk42_redelder;
The prisoner is being held in the chamber of the One himself. Return to us once he is free. Until then you have free run of our enclave.;[];;[];[1867];unk42_redelder;
I want to learn more about the history of the Rakata Empire.;[];;[1870];[1856];unk42_redelder;
Our history is a long one, but it is also one filled with bloodshed and sorrow. Once the Rakata ruled all the known galaxy, but our Empire was destroyed by our own corruption.;[];;[1861];[1869];unk42_redelder;
What do you know about the other Rakata here?;[];;[1872];[1856];unk42_redelder;
There is only one other group of Rakata on this island, the tribe of the One. They would slaughter us if they could, hoping to unlock the secrets hidden away in the Temple.;[];;[1863, 1864, 1873, 1877];[1871];unk42_redelder;
Have you tried reasoning with the One?;[];;[1874];[1872];unk42_redelder;
When the One first arrived on this island, we sent emissaries under a flag of truce to try and negotiate with his tribe. But all our envoys were brutally slaughtered.;[];;[1875];[1873];unk42_redelder;
We do have the technology to destroy the One and his followers. But if we kill them all, then we will only prove that we have learned nothing over the past 20,000 years.;[];;[1876];[1874];unk42_redelder;
"The One is mad with power. We choose not to fight him, so our only course of action is to stay here in isolation where we are safe; just as we have done for the past 20,000 years.";[];;[1861];[1875, 1879];unk42_redelder;
But don't you have the technology to destroy the One?;[];;[1878];[1872];unk42_redelder;
We have the technology to destroy the One and his followers. But if we kill them all, then we will only prove that we have learned nothing over the past 20,000 years.;[];;[1879];[1877];unk42_redelder;
We tried to negotiate with them. We went emissaries under a flag or truce when the One first arrived on this island. But all our envoys were brutally slaughtered.;[];;[1876];[1878];unk42_redelder;
What do you know about the Temple of the Ancients?;[];;[1881];[1856];unk42_redelder;
The Temple is a sacred place, but also a place of great danger. Within its walls the terrible secrets of our ancestors have been locked away.;[];;[1882];[1880];unk42_redelder;
We ourselves can no longer enter the Temple, Revan. We do not have the power of the Force. But you can enter, with our help.;[];;[1861];[1881];unk42_redelder;
Can you tell me about the Star Forge?;[];;[1884];[1856];unk42_redelder;
The Star Forge is a blight upon our world, an orbiting symbol of the failures and horrors of our past. We have long searched for a way to destroy it, and now you finally have given us that chance.;[];;[1861];[1883];unk42_redelder;
Do you know where I can find parts to repair my ship?;[];;[1886];[1854];unk42_redelder;
You might find these things in the camp of the One, back towards the beach where you first landed. But if you go there, the Rakata will surely attack you.;[];;[1887];[1885];unk42_redelder;
It would be much safer to try and salvage the parts you need from any of the wrecks scattered across the island.;[];;[1846, 1863, 1864, 1867];[1886];unk42_redelder;
Do you know how to disable the disruptor field that caused my ship to crash?;[];;[1889];[1854];unk42_redelder;
"The disruptor field is one of the ancient defenses of the Star Forge; a great generator within the Temple of the Ancients fuels it. You will have to enter the Temple to disable it.";[];;[1846, 1863, 1864, 1867];[1888];unk42_redelder;
Actually, I've decided I'm just going to kill you all!;[];;[1891];[1845, 1893, 1911, 1909, 1917, 1907, 1903, 1933, 6014];unk42_redelder;
Guards! Guards! We are under attack!;[];;[];[1890, 1918];unk42_redelder;
Forget it! I'll find my own way into the Temple.;[];;[1893];[1843];unk42_redelder;
You have the power to enter the Temple itself, but you cannot lower the energy shields around it. Only the Rakata can invoke the ritual chant with the proper intonation.;[];;[1890, 1894, 1895];[1892];unk42_redelder;
Okay, when I'm ready I'll go into the Temple alone.;[];;[1845];[1893];unk42_redelder;
I'll find some other way to enter the Temple!;[];;[1896];[1893];unk42_redelder;
You can try to enter the Temple without our help, but you will fail. When you are ready to see reason, return to us and we can begin the ritual.;[];;[];[1895];unk42_redelder;
I'm not going into the Temple without help!;[];;[1842];[1840];unk42_redelder;
[Persuade] The One wanted me to kill you, but I have come here peacefully.;[];;[1899];[1830];unk42_redelder;
[Failure] Again, you are only repeating the patterns from before. You know we hold the secret of entering the Temple. That is why you do not attack us.;[];;[1900];[1898];unk42_redelder;
You come in the guise of a friend, but how do we know you are not going to betray us again?;[];;[1831, 1901, 1913, 1918];[1899];unk42_redelder;
[Persuade] I cannot prove what is in my heart. I only ask you judge me by my actions.;[];;[1902];[1900, 1830];unk42_redelder;
"[Success] We sense you mean the words you speak. But words are easy to say; it is actions that prove the true nature of your character.";[];;[1833, 1903];[1901, 1920];unk42_redelder;
You must prove to us that you are not the same as you once were, Revan. You must prove that you have changed.;[];;[1890, 1904, 1913];[1902];unk42_redelder;
How can I prove that?;[];;[1905];[1903];unk42_redelder;
Recently several of our scouts were captured by the One. Most of them were brutally slaughtered, but we have information that one of the scouts is still alive.;[];;[1906];[1904];unk42_redelder;
They will use unimaginable tortures to force the scout to reveal everything he knows about our tribe. And once the One is done with him, the scout will be executed like the others.;[];;[1907];[1905];unk42_redelder;
You must prove you have truly changed by risking your own life to save another. Rescue our scout from the clutches of the One, and we will consider helping you.;[];;[1890, 1908, 1913, 1915, 1916];[1906];unk42_redelder;
Maybe I can negotiate with the One to release your hostage.;[];;[1909];[1907, 1917];unk42_redelder;
We would prefer if you could find some way to save the prisoner without bloodshed, but we don't believe that will be possible. The One does not like to negotiate.;[];;[1890, 1910, 1913];[1908, 1915];unk42_redelder;
So if I save the prisoner you'll help me?;[];;[1911];[1909];unk42_redelder;
Risking your life to save the prisoner would show us that you are sincere about making amends for the past.;[];;[1867, 1890, 1912, 1913];[1910];unk42_redelder;
Okay, I'll help you. But I have some questions.;[];;[1854];[1911];unk42_redelder;
Enough of this - I am the Dark Lord reborn! Bow before me!;[];;[1914];[1911, 1909, 1917, 1907, 1903, 1900, 1830];unk42_redelder;
At last you reveal your true self! Guards: destroy the evil in our midst!;[];;[];[1913];unk42_redelder;
So you want me to go there and kill the One?;[];;[1909];[1907, 1917];unk42_redelder;
Forget it!;[];;[1917];[1907];unk42_redelder;
If you do not help us, Revan, then we will not help you enter the Temple. You will be trapped on this world forever.;[];;[1890, 1908, 1913, 1915];[1916];unk42_redelder;
I see this is going nowhere. I'll just kill you instead!;[];;[1891];[1900, 1830];unk42_redelder;
[Persuade] The part of me that was Revan is dead. Now I am <FullName>.;[];;[1829];[1827];unk42_redelder;
[Persuade/Lie] I regret the mistakes of my past. I want to make amends.;[];;[1902];[1827];unk42_redelder;
Thanks for the information. Looks like I don't need you anymore.;[];;[1922];[1825, 1820, 1817, 1807];unk42_redelder;
There you are wrong, Revan. Without our help, you will never be able to enter the Temple of the Ancients. You will be trapped on this world forever.;[];;[1923];[1921];unk42_redelder;
You need us to get past the barrier that protects the Temple's exterior. Only the Rakata can perform the ritual to lower the shields. But we are not so sure we want to help you.;[];;[1827];[1922];unk42_redelder;
I want to know more about you, specifically.;[];;[1815];[1813];unk42_redelder;
Tell me about the last time I was here.;[];;[1804];[1801, 1927];unk42_redelder;
[Persuade] You can trust me. But I have some questions for you.;[];;[1927];[1799];unk42_redelder;
[Success] If what you say is true - that you cannot remember when you were last here - then you must have many questions. Ask what you will, Revan, and we will try to help you understand.;[];;[1802, 1925];[1926, 1928];unk42_redelder;
[Persuade/Lie] You can trust me. But first I have some questions.;[];;[1927];[1799];unk42_redelder;
I'm sorry, but I don't remember any of this.;[];;[1798];[1796];unk42_redelder;
I'm not Revan anymore. That part of me is gone. I'm <FullName> now.;[];;[1795];[1793, 6012];unk42_redelder;
Betrayed you? I don't even know you!;[];;[1795];[1793, 6012];unk42_redelder;
You have returned, Revan. Are you ready to enter the Temple now?;[];;[1846, 1853, 1864];[None];unk42_redelder;
Yes, Revan. Is there something you need?;[];;[1853, 1867, 1890];[None];unk42_redelder;
Revan, you are back. Our scout has told us of how you rescued him. His injuries are severe, but we believe he will survive. We are grateful for what you have done.;[];;[1935, 1937];[None];unk42_redelder;
So now you will help me?;[];;[1936];[1934, 6015];unk42_redelder;
Risking your own life to save our scout seems to prove that you have changed significantly since the last time you were here, Revan. But you have deceived us before.;[];;[1833];[1935, 1937];unk42_redelder;
I've done my part. Now you have to honor our agreement.;[];;[1936];[1934, 6015];unk42_redelder;
You are back, Revan. When you refused to enter the Temple alone we feared you had betrayed us again. We did not expect you to return.;[];;[1939];[None];unk42_redelder;
Did you find what you were looking for inside the Temple? Did you discover the secrets to destroy the Star Forge?;[];;[1940, 1943, 1951];[1938];unk42_redelder;
Not exactly. I have to go to the Star Forge to stop Malak.;[];;[1941];[1939, 6017];unk42_redelder;
Then we wish you luck, Revan. For far too long we have kept ourselves hidden away on this lonely world, hoping to keep the Star Forge from unleashing its evil upon the rest of the galaxy.;[];;[1942];[1940, 1951];unk42_redelder;
Perhaps... perhaps once the Star Forge is destroyed it will be time for us to leave this world, to rejoin the galaxy we have isolated ourselves from for so long.;[];;[1943, 1946, 1948, 1949];[1941];unk42_redelder;
You fools - I would never destroy the Star Forge!;[];;[1944];[1942, 1939, 1952, 6017, 6018];unk42_redelder;
You... you mean you have betrayed us, again? For a thousand generations we have guarded the secrets within the Temple: we cannot allow you to unleash them on the galaxy!;[];;[1945];[1943, 1953];unk42_redelder;
Guards, destroy Revan! Do not let the traitor escape!;[];;[];[1944];unk42_redelder;
[Lie] Yes, I'm sure they'll welcome you with open arms.;[];;[1947];[1942];unk42_redelder;
You must go now, Revan. The Star Forge feeds the power of your old apprentice. If you do not stop him soon he will become too powerful for even you to stop.;[];;[];[1946, 1948, 1950];unk42_redelder;
I'm sure the galaxy will welcome you with open arms.;[];;[1947];[1942];unk42_redelder;
Maybe, but we should discuss this only after Malak is stopped.;[];;[1950];[1942];unk42_redelder;
"You are right, of course. This is not something to be rushed into; not while the Star Forge still exists.";[];;[1947];[1949];unk42_redelder;
[Lie] Yes. I'm going there now to destroy it and Malak.;[];;[1941];[1939, 1952, 6017, 6018];unk42_redelder;
Hurry, Revan. The Star Forge must be destroyed.;[];;[1943, 1951, 1953];[None];unk42_redelder;
First I have to slaughter all of you!;[];;[1944];[1952, 6018];unk42_redelder;
Hurry, Revan. The Star Forge must be destroyed, Malak must be stopped. You cannot afford to waste time here with us.;[];;[];[None];unk42_redelder;

If the player tries to question him about Shen, he tells them to leave, then exits through a door and is removed from the module.   If the player mentions his son Casus, he asks for his son's diary.

He can mention that he found the body of Casus. DAN_PLOT_CASUS is set to 3 to show that the plot has been completed. If the player is very insensitive towards Nurk about his son he takes a minor dark side hit.

The second dialog is if the player has offended Rahasia in a previous conversation.   The third dialog is if the player has talked to Shen and been told he won't leave without her.

Since Casus went missing my father has become unstable. He no longer even cares if the Matales are responsible for what happened to Casus.;[];;[2083];[2078];dan16_nurik;NM16AARAHA02014_.mp3

I don't have time to listen to this.;[];;[2111];[2072];dan16_nurik;
I... I thought you would listen to me. I thought the Jedi were compassionate and kind! I shouldn't have spoken to you at all - I've just made everything worse!;[];;[2112, 2113, 2114];[2110, 2121];dan16_nurik;NM16AARAHA02034_.mp3

There could be a lot of money for finding Shen Matale. I think that girl knows something about him going missing.;[];;[];[2112, 2114, 2111];dan16_nurik;NM16AARAHA02037_.mp3
Yeah, that's the way to go about it. Make things worse for these people, why don't you?;[];;[2113];[2111];dan16_nurik;NM16AARAHA02036_.mp3
Casus disappeared?;[];;[2116];[2072];dan16_nurik;
Yes. Casus was my brother. He was working on archeological digs here on Dantooine when he disappeared. My father blamed Ahlan Matale... and his son...;[];;[2074];[2115];dan16_nurik;NM16AARAHA02028_.mp3
Casus was killed by kath hounds. The Matales had nothing to do with it!;[];;[2118];[2072];dan16_nurik;
Casus is dead? It is as I feared, though I am relieved the Matales are not responsible.;[{'Nurik Sandral': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[2074];[2117];dan16_nurik;NM16AARAHA02030_.mp3
Do you know something about Shen's disappearance?;[];;[2072];[2070];dan16_nurik;
I just came to tell your Nurik about his son Casus.;[];;[2072];[2070];dan16_nurik;

Your actions show you are overly focused on material wealth. This is not the way of the Jedi. You will have to learn to let go of your greed if you wish to walk in the light.;[];;[2069];[2125, 2124, 2127];dan16_nurik;NM16AANURI01044_.mp3

Casus is a kath hound chew toy.;[];;[2131];[2060];dan16_nurik;
Are all Jedi so callous towards those who grieve? No matter. Your cruel words hurt me no more than the news itself.;[];;[2062];[2130];dan16_nurik;NM16AANURI01054_.mp3
I want to ask you about the disappearance of Shen Matale.;[];;[2133, 2145];[2058, 2147];dan16_nurik;
I feel great sorrow at the young Matale heir's disappearance, but they are not the only family to suffer such a tragedy. Dantooine is a dangerous place.;[];;[2134];[2132];dan16_nurik;NM16AANURI01002_.mp3
My own son Casus has been missing for some time now. But I know nothing about the disappearance of Shen. Perhaps he and Casus now share a similar fate.;[];;[2059, 2135];[2133];dan16_nurik;NM16AANURI01004_.mp3
The Jedi Council has instructed me to investigate this matter. May I search your estate?;[];;[2136];[2134];dan16_nurik;
I brought my family here to find peace and safety - not to be harassed and treated like common criminals! Your Council has no authority here, and I respectfully ask you to leave this property at once.;[];;[2137, 2139, 2140, 2144];[2135, 2146];dan16_nurik;NM16AANURI01006_.mp3

For once I will have to agree with the Mandalorian...;[];;[2139];[2137];dan16_nurik;NM16AANURI01010_.mp3

That's quite a line. You actually believe that? Don't you think someone is allowed to value privacy?;[];;[2142];[2140];dan16_nurik;NM16AANURI01014_.mp3
Privacy is all well and good, but justice must be valued higher. Is it not obvious to you that this man hides something?;[];;[2143];[2141];dan16_nurik;NM16AANURI01016_.mp3
Actually, it is. All I'm saying is that not everybody welcomes the sight of a Jedi with open arms. Better get used to it.;[];;[2139];[2142];dan16_nurik;NM16AANURI01018_.mp3

I guess Gadon knew what he was doing he picked you to ride for us. Now the only thing is to wait for the time to become official and go collect your prize.;[];;[];[2153];tar03_mechanic;
Okay, not too bad for your first ever race. You didn't get the time you needed, but for a rookie you did pretty well.;[];player didn't win, first race;[2157];[None];tar03_mechanic;
That prototype accelerator held up okay, too. It's running a little hot, but nothing to worry about. Not yet, anyway.;[];;[2158];[2156];tar03_mechanic;
Now that you've got a race under your belt you should be able to blow the field away. Good luck... we're counting on you.;[];;[];[2157];tar03_mechanic;
Good run, good run. You didn't post the top time, but that's okay. I checked out your swoop and you should be okay for a few more runs at least.;[];player didn't win, second race;[2160];[None];tar03_mechanic;
Remember, avoid the obstacles, hit the accelerator plates on the track and switch gears when the engine revs get high.;[];;[2161];[2159];tar03_mechanic;
Don't worry... you'll get that top time yet! I know you won't let us down. Now get back out on that track and shows these punks how to ride!;[];;[];[2160];tar03_mechanic;
I really thought that last race was going to be the one, but looks like you'll have to go out again. But you better get the job done soon... that accelerator isn't doing too well.;[];player didn't win, third race;[2163];[None];tar03_mechanic;
It's still running with full power, but it's running way too hot for my liking. I've tried to rig up a cooling system to hold it together for another run or two. Beyond that though...;[];;[2164];[2162];tar03_mechanic;
I'm not trying to put any extra pressure on you, but my gang's got a lot riding on this race. So bear down, focus and go get that time we need!;[];;[];[2163];tar03_mechanic;
I see you struggling out there and it isn't pretty, but don't you worry. I've got a trick or two up my sleeve. You're in good hands with me.;[];player didn't win, fourth race;[2166];[None];tar03_mechanic;
I made a few modifications to that accelerator. I rerouted the power from the cooling system to give an extra boost to your swoop's speed.;[];;[2167];[2165];tar03_mechanic;
But cranking the speed made the accelerator even more unstable than it used to be. In other words, you're either going to win this race or go out in a blaze of flaming glory.;[];;[2168, 2170, 2173];[2166];tar03_mechanic;
I don't want to die out on the track!;[];;[2169];[2167, 2175];tar03_mechanic;
Look, we're running out of time. That accelerator's one step away from being scrap metal. You've got to take some risks if you want to collect the champion's prize!;[];;[2170, 2173];[2168];tar03_mechanic;
Don't worry... I'll win this thing!;[];;[2171];[2169, 2175, 2167];tar03_mechanic;
That's what I like to hear! Just remember, this is your last chance. That accelerator won't hold together for another race.... we'll be lucky if it doesn't explode in this one!;[];;[2172];[2170];tar03_mechanic;
But don't you go worrying about that. You just stay focused on that finish line. Good luck... we're counting on you.;[];;[];[2171];tar03_mechanic;
Forget it... I'm not racing anymore.;[];;[2174];[2169, 2167];tar03_mechanic;
I don't think you'll back out now. Word is you've got an unhealthy interest in that female Republic officer Brejik's offering as a prize.;[];;[2175];[2173];tar03_mechanic;
The only way you'll get her is if you put up the best time. So quit sulking and start racing like you mean it!;[];;[2168, 2170];[2174];tar03_mechanic;
So you're the one who's going to ride this swoop bike, eh? Don't worry - I've been working on the accelerator and stability won't be a problem. I hope.;[];;[2177, 2195];[None];tar03_mechanic;
Kandon mentioned that you've never done this before. You want me to run over the basics of handling a swoop bike for you?;[];;[2178, 2194];[2176];tar03_mechanic;
Sure, tell me how it's done.;[];;[2179];[2177, 2195];tar03_mechanic;
It's pretty simple, really. First, try not to crash into anything. There's debris and obstacles scattered all over the course, so watch out.;[];;[2180];[2178, 2193];tar03_mechanic;
All swoops are equipped with dynamic deflector systems, so hitting an obstacle won't cause you to crash. But it will shake you up a bit and slow you down.;[];;[2181];[2179];tar03_mechanic;
The track also has accelerator panels built into its surface. If you fly over one it'll give your swoop a boost of speed, so try to hit 'em when you see 'em.;[];;[2182];[2180];tar03_mechanic;
When the engine starts running hot you'll get a warning and you'll have to switch gears. Other than that just try to hang on. You'll be fine.;[];;[2183, 2193];[2181];tar03_mechanic;
Okay, let's start the race!;[];;[2184];[2182];tar03_mechanic;
Hold on... I better explain the rules to you. Each rider goes out on the track alone. At the end of the day, whoever posted the fastest time is the winner.;[];;[2185];[2183, 2194];tar03_mechanic;
Normally a rider can run as many heats as they want, but I don't know how long the prototype accelerator on your swoop will hold up. No more than four or five races, I'd guess.;[];;[2186, 2192];[2184];tar03_mechanic;
So make your runs count. Remember, the Vulkars are counting on you. If we win this race half of Gadon's crew will join us and the Beks will be finished!;[];;[2187, 2191];[2185];tar03_mechanic;
I won't let you down.;[];;[2188];[2186, 2192];tar03_mechanic;
Sounds like you're ready. Go talk to the race announcer over by the counter. He'll give you the time to beat and get you out on the course.;[];;[2189];[2187, 2191];tar03_mechanic;
I'll be waiting for you here after the run so I can make any tweaks or repairs to your swoop in case you want to go out for another heat.;[];;[2190];[2188, 2198];tar03_mechanic;
Good luck. And don't worry about the prototype overheating and exploding while you're out on the track. That *probably* won't happen.;[];;[];[2189];tar03_mechanic;
How do we get the race started?;[];;[2188];[2186, 2192];tar03_mechanic;
So make your runs count. Gadon's put his trust in you... we need to win this race or Brejik's Vulkars will get a whole bunch of new recruits. If that happens we're finished.;[];;[2187, 2191];[2185];tar03_mechanic;
Could you go over that again?;[];;[2179];[2182];tar03_mechanic;
Forget it. Let's just get to the racing!;[];;[2184];[2177, 2195];tar03_mechanic;
Gadon mentioned that you've never done this before. You want me to run over the basics of handling a swoop bike for you?;[];;[2178, 2194];[2176];tar03_mechanic;
What are you doing back here? You need to speak to the race announcer and get out on the track. The longer you wait the worse your nerves are going to get.;[];;[2197, 2199];[None];tar03_mechanic;
Nerves? I'm not scared!;[];;[2198];[2196];tar03_mechanic;
Good to hear. Go talk to the race announcer and he'll get you out on the track.;[];;[2189];[2197, 2202];tar03_mechanic;
Can you explain how the swoop bike works again?;[];;[2200];[2196];tar03_mechanic;
Sure, no problem. Avoid the obstacles on the track by veering your swoop left or right. Any rocks or debris you hit will slow you down.;[];;[2201];[2199, 2203];tar03_mechanic;
Every time your swoop passes over one of the accelerator pads you'll get a boost of speed, so try to hit them. And remember to switch gears when you see your engine revs climbing.;[];;[2202, 2203];[2200];tar03_mechanic;
Okay, I'm ready to ride now.;[];;[2198];[2201];tar03_mechanic;
Can you explain that one more time?;[];;[2200];[2201];tar03_mechanic;

Greetings, Revan, I am Gjarshi, the loremaster of our tribe.;[];;[2245];[None];unk43_rakstory;
I am the keeper of our histories and chronicler of the conquests of the One.;[];;[2246, 2250, 2325, 2329];[2244];unk43_rakstory;
I am not Revan any more! I am <FullName>!;[];;[2247];[2245];unk43_rakstory;
Your life has been defined by your identity Revan, your fate. If you no longer wish me to call you this, then I shall not, but you cannot change who you are.;[];;[2248, 2250, 2253, 2304, 2325, 2329];[2246];unk43_rakstory;
A person decides their own fate!;[];;[2249];[2247];unk43_rakstory;
As you will. I know better than to argue with you when you have set your mind to something.;[];;[2250, 2253, 2304, 2325, 2329];[2248];unk43_rakstory;
Do you not hate me for leaving your people before?;[];;[2251];[2249, 2335, 2247, 2245];unk43_rakstory;
It does not matter to me what path you choose. History flows in mysterious ways and my task is only to witness and remember which course it takes.;[];;[2252];[2250];unk43_rakstory;
Your actions then, as now, are memories to be passed on to future generations. When you are dead and gone, your memory shall remain with us.;[];;[2253, 2304, 2325, 2329];[2251];unk43_rakstory;
Can you tell me of the history of your people?;[];;[2254];[2252, 2335, 2341, 2331, 2249, 2247];unk43_rakstory;
What of our people would you like to know?;[];;[2255, 2261, 2266, 2272, 2278, 2284, 2290, 2298, 2325];[2253, 2324, 2346];unk43_rakstory;
Tell me how your people came to be.;[];s1;[2256];[2254, 2260, 2265, 2271, 2277, 2283, 2289, 2297, 2303];unk43_rakstory;
In the times before our most ancient histories, there was nothing you could call the Rakatan people. There were unintelligent proto-Rakata wandering the surface of this world.;[];;[2257];[2255];unk43_rakstory;
Spawned from the womb of this world, they were gifted with the brilliance of thought, but not tempered with the wisdom to use it.;[];;[2258];[2256];unk43_rakstory;
When the gods of the sky first spoke to them, the ground shook and heaved, and fires raced across the surface of the world. They fled beneath the ground to escape the calamity and dwelled there for some time.;[];;[2259];[2257];unk43_rakstory;
At last the gods spoke to them in dreams... dreams of the surface and the light. They re-emerged from the ground and found the land much changed around them.;[];;[2260];[2258];unk43_rakstory;
Gone were the plains and valleys they had known. Instead, there were islands stretching across the breadth of the world. The world had been remade for them by the gods of the sky, and they gave thanks in fear and gratitude.;[];;[2255, 2261, 2266, 2272, 2278, 2284, 2290, 2298, 2304, 2325];[2259];unk43_rakstory;
Tell me of the gods you mentioned.;[];s2;[2262];[2260, 2265, 2271, 2277, 2283, 2289, 2297, 2303, 2254];unk43_rakstory;
The world is ruled by the gods of the earth and sky, both living and dead.;[];;[2263];[2261];unk43_rakstory;
When the sky gods remade the world, the gods of the earth, who had sheltered and protected the Rakata, were gone. Whether dead of asleep, they have not been heard from again.;[];;[2264];[2262];unk43_rakstory;
Nor do the gods in the sky listen to our pleas any longer, although we can still see their lights gleam in the heavens.;[];;[2265];[2263];unk43_rakstory;
So we mortal Rakata are left here to our own devices... to make the future we demand for ourselves.;[];;[2255, 2261, 2266, 2272, 2278, 2284, 2290, 2298, 2304, 2325];[2264];unk43_rakstory;
Tell me of your first civilizations.;[];s2;[2267];[2265, 2271, 2277, 2283, 2289, 2297, 2303, 2260, 2254];unk43_rakstory;
Back in the days of the first awakening, when our people rose from the ground and brought the light of civilization to our new world, our people spread far and wide across all the islands.;[];;[2268];[2266];unk43_rakstory;
Among these peoples, there were some that rose to greatness on the largest islands. Rakatans of vision and forethought who built great monuments to themselves and their leaders.;[];;[2269];[2267];unk43_rakstory;
But these cultures did not know their true strengths. They did not draw upon the knowledge of their past to feed their present.;[];;[2270];[2268];unk43_rakstory;
Of course these cultures, with their centers of learning and their great temples, collapsed in riots and chaos, burning their cultures from the world in an orgy of violence.;[];;[2271];[2269];unk43_rakstory;
It was a thousand years of darkness before the light of First Empire rose upon the blood of the past.;[];;[2255, 2261, 2266, 2272, 2278, 2284, 2290, 2298, 2304, 2325];[2270];unk43_rakstory;
Tell me of the First Empire.;[];s3;[2273];[2271, 2277, 2283, 2289, 2297, 2303, 2265, 2260, 2254];unk43_rakstory;
With the first civilizations of our people destroyed, and chaos and anarchy sweeping the islands, it seemed that a time of darkness had descended upon us that would never end.;[];;[2274];[2272];unk43_rakstory;
But a strong nation of survivors yet endured. On one of the smaller islands near the equatorial regions, they had not forgotten the oldest traditions, those learned from the gods of the earth while we dwelt beneath the surface.;[];;[2275];[2273];unk43_rakstory;
Taking the knowledge of their elders and passing their wisdom and skills on to the next generation by eating their flesh, they built a culture unrivalled throughout history. Greater, even, than your vaunted 'Republic'.;[];;[2276];[2274];unk43_rakstory;
For millennia this empire stood, uniting the many islands of our world into one cohesive whole. Each generation passing its strength on to the one that followed.;[];;[2277];[2275];unk43_rakstory;
But... fate was unkind to these great Rakata, these first ones of our kind to rise above savagery and create a true, lasting civilization.;[];;[2255, 2261, 2266, 2272, 2278, 2284, 2290, 2298, 2304, 2325];[2276];unk43_rakstory;
Tell me what happened to the First Empire.;[];s4;[2279];[2277, 2283, 2289, 2297, 2303, 2271, 2265, 2260, 2254];unk43_rakstory;
Our skin had been hardened and turned black from the time our people spent beneath the surface, but always at the fringes of society there were rumors... rumors of those of others colors who survived above the surface while we dwelt below.;[];;[2280];[2278];unk43_rakstory;
We can pinpoint no direct cause for the collapse of the First Empire, but it was swift and total. What had taken centuries to build and was maintained for thousands of years disappeared within ten, perhaps twenty, years.;[];;[2281];[2279];unk43_rakstory;
From the ancient cities we have examined, there was much fighting and death, as well as fires that burned bright and hot enough to melt the stones of their palaces to glass.;[];;[2282];[2280];unk43_rakstory;
Also, in scattered fragments and records, we have heard of a people being found... a people unlike the Rakata but taking our form, who waged a monumental war that tore civilization apart.;[];;[2283];[2281];unk43_rakstory;
What this war was, or who those beings were we do not know, but they are the demons of our legends now. We believe them to be gone, wiped out in that vast conflagration, but we cannot know for sure...;[];;[2255, 2261, 2266, 2272, 2278, 2284, 2290, 2298, 2304, 2325];[2282];unk43_rakstory;
What happened after the collapse of the First Empire?;[];s5;[2285];[2283, 2289, 2297, 2303, 2277, 2271, 2265, 2260, 2254];unk43_rakstory;
Our civilization lapsed back into savagery. We were no longer the great people of centuries past.;[];;[2286];[2284];unk43_rakstory;
Brother turned on brother, tribesman on tribesman, until all fought and sought to destroy each other.;[];;[2287];[2285];unk43_rakstory;
The legacy of the final war and the collapse that came after it still echo with us today. We are still a fractured people. Many tribes dwell on these islands, warring with each other constantly.;[];;[2288];[2286];unk43_rakstory;
Each seeks to grow its own strength, absorbing that of its enemies through their flesh cut down in battle, but none has been strong enough to exert their influence over more than a handful of islands. Until now that is...;[];;[2289];[2287];unk43_rakstory;
We now are in the midst of a great war of reformation, of reclamation.;[];;[2255, 2261, 2266, 2272, 2278, 2284, 2290, 2298, 2304, 2325];[2288];unk43_rakstory;
Tell me of the war of reformation.;[];s6;[2291];[2289, 2297, 2303, 2283, 2277, 2271, 2265, 2260, 2254];unk43_rakstory;
Before none were strong enough to bind together the tribes and unite them towards a common goal, but that changed. Now we do have a leader, and under him, we have swept across the islands, conquering all who have stood before us.;[];;[2292, 2327, 2328];[2290];unk43_rakstory;
This leader... is it the One?;[];;[2293];[2291];unk43_rakstory;
Over the last 20 years we have conquered over a hundred islands, both large and small. The One has led us to victory where none have before, further strengthening us with the blood of our enemies.;[];;[2294];[2292, 2327, 2328];unk43_rakstory;
We have subjugated many tribes as well, their warriors joining ours in our great crusade.;[];;[2295];[2293];unk43_rakstory;
But recently, things have not gone so well...;[];;[2296];[2294];unk43_rakstory;
More and more outsiders fall from the sky and kill our people. More and more tribes resist us, or even rebel!;[];;[2297];[2295];unk43_rakstory;
It has taken a great part of our strength to resist, but under the One, we shall prevail! Nothing shall stop him from forming the Second Empire!;[];;[2255, 2261, 2266, 2272, 2278, 2284, 2290, 2298, 2304, 2325];[2296];unk43_rakstory;
What is the One doing here, then?;[];;[2299];[2297, 2303, 2289, 2283, 2277, 2271, 2265, 2260, 2254];unk43_rakstory;
We... we heard of the temple on this island... the Temple of the Ancients. A building the like of which has not been seen anywhere else. A place of great power it was reputed, with great guardians as well.;[];;[2300];[2298];unk43_rakstory;
The One came here with an army to see this temple and seize it for our cause, but we were met with strange and powerful magics which have defeated us at every turn.;[];;[2301];[2299];unk43_rakstory;
So now the One sits here and broods on his troubles, listening only to the messengers who bear his orders to all corners of his territory.;[];;[2302];[2300];unk43_rakstory;
If only the riddle of the temple could be solved, and its guardian Elders removed, then he would consume their flesh and knowledge and bring unity to our people.;[];;[2303];[2301];unk43_rakstory;
It is my sincere hope as well, that you can help us with our great task.;[];;[2255, 2261, 2266, 2272, 2278, 2284, 2290, 2298, 2304, 2325];[2302];unk43_rakstory;
Tell me of the One.;[];;[2305];[2303, 2297, 2289, 2283, 2277, 2271, 2265, 2260, 2252, 2341, 2335, 2331, 2249, 2247, 2345];unk43_rakstory;
The great story of the One would take many days to tell in its entirety. It is my specialty, of course.;[];;[2306];[2304];unk43_rakstory;
What would you like to know of his great story?;[];;[2307, 2312, 2317, 2324];[2305];unk43_rakstory;
Tell me how he was raised.;[];;[2308];[2306, 2311, 2316, 2323];unk43_rakstory;
Born to poverty, raised in a hovel with no elders to guide him and share their strength with him, he had nothing to rely on but himself.;[];;[2309];[2307];unk43_rakstory;
But in his weakness, he was uniquely destined for strength and the burdens it carries with it.;[];;[2310];[2308];unk43_rakstory;
Even in his youth, it was obvious that the One was destined for greatness. When but a youngling, he defeated one of the strange blue-armored warriors who fall from the sky and feasted upon him.;[];;[2311];[2309];unk43_rakstory;
The respect from his battle gave him the step he needed to go forward on a path that has led him ever upward since.;[];;[2307, 2312, 2317, 2324];[2310];unk43_rakstory;
Tell me of how he came to power.;[];;[2313];[2311, 2316, 2323, 2306];unk43_rakstory;
By adulthood, the One was held in awe by those of his tribe as both a warrior and a leader. When he challenged the chieftain of his tribe, no one doubted that he would prevail.;[];;[2314];[2312];unk43_rakstory;
The chieftain could see and, knowing that the One would bring the tribe into greatness, offered himself up without a fight. The tribe fed well and was stronger for his sacrifice.;[];;[2315];[2313];unk43_rakstory;
Under the leadership of the One, his tribe conquered all others on the island, capturing and subduing their warriors, feasting on their chieftains, and growing his own army at the same time.;[];;[2316];[2314];unk43_rakstory;
He was truly a force that could not be stopped, a leader unlike any we have seen in our history. He will be the one to unite us all!;[];;[2307, 2312, 2317, 2324];[2315];unk43_rakstory;
Tell me of his conquests.;[];;[2318];[2316, 2323, 2311, 2306];unk43_rakstory;
After he had conquered his own island, and his army had grown to a large size, he turned his eyes towards the nearest other islands in the archipelago.;[];;[2319];[2317];unk43_rakstory;
With each island that fell to him, his army grew stronger, his wisdom greater with each chief given up to him, and his vision of a future for our people brighter.;[];;[2320];[2318];unk43_rakstory;
Before long he had conquered every island in a month's sailing and had armies expanding in every direction. It seemed that nothing would stand against him then.;[];;[2321];[2319];unk43_rakstory;
But we heard of the Temple of the Ancients here, on this forgotten island at the edge of the True Sea, and the One was intrigued. It was a place of power, to be sure, and none could doubt its significance.;[];;[2322];[2320];unk43_rakstory;
Driven by portents and omens, we came to this island with a thousand of his finest warriors... and here we stay...;[];;[2323];[2321];unk43_rakstory;
We cannot leave while the Temple stands unopened, but we cannot enter while the Elders stand against us... and the One sits each day brooding on the fate that has led us to this impasse.;[];;[2307, 2312, 2317, 2324];[2322];unk43_rakstory;
I'd like to know something else.;[];;[2254];[2323, 2316, 2311, 2306];unk43_rakstory;
I must go now.;[];;[2326];[2303, 2297, 2289, 2283, 2277, 2271, 2265, 2260, 2254, 2341, 2335, 2331, 2252, 2249, 2247, 2245, 2363, 2360, 2357, 2371, 2352, 2345];unk43_rakstory;
If you must. I shall remain here as I always do, listening to those who wish to speak... and remembering.;[];;[];[2325];unk43_rakstory;
How many islands have you conquered?;[];;[2293];[2291];unk43_rakstory;
How long has this war been waged?;[];;[2293];[2291];unk43_rakstory;
You are a loremaster? What do you do? Memorize books?;[];;[2330];[2252, 2249, 2247, 2245, 2345];unk43_rakstory;
The position of loremaster is a sacred and respected one among our people. We are the keepers of history, the ones who pass down the traditions of our people.;[];;[2331];[2329];unk43_rakstory;
I am here to chronicle the conquests and achievements of the One. I have followed his exploits for many years... and yours as well.;[];;[2253, 2304, 2325, 2332, 2342];[2330];unk43_rakstory;
Mine?;[];;[2333];[2331];unk43_rakstory;
When last you came to this island, the One had just arrived with his army. We spoke then, as now, and you told me of your travels and stories about the worlds beyond ours.;[];;[2334];[2332, 2342];unk43_rakstory;
You spoke of the magical Force you wielded which gave you power over the elements.;[];;[2335];[2333];unk43_rakstory;
But then you left us and went back to the stars, never to be heard from again. We wondered what had happened, what could have gone wrong, but could do nothing against you, or the Elders.;[];;[2250, 2253, 2304, 2325, 2336];[2334];unk43_rakstory;
Tell me of the Elders.;[];;[2337];[2335, 2352, 2367, 2363, 2360, 2357, 2371, 2345];unk43_rakstory;
We know the Elders are Rakata like us, but different as well. They control strange powers and magics that we cannot understand.;[];;[2338];[2336];unk43_rakstory;
When we came to this island, drawn by the strange structure we call the Temple of the Ancients, we were expecting perhaps a few survivors... but not another race of Rakata.;[];;[2339];[2337];unk43_rakstory;
The One's troops captured a few of their scouts, but we could learn nothing intelligible from them. Attacks against their compound were fruitless and reaped terrible casualties.;[];;[2340];[2338];unk43_rakstory;
We came here with near a thousand warriors... and you can see now what we are reduced to...;[];;[2341];[2339];unk43_rakstory;
This is why the One thinks we need your help once again. You were able to enter the Elders' compound once before... perhaps you can again.;[];;[2253, 2304, 2325];[2340];unk43_rakstory;
You know nothing of me!;[];;[2333];[2331];unk43_rakstory;
You have returned from the Temple... as I knew you would. You shall have an honored place in our histories, Revan.;[];;[2344];[None];unk43_rakstory;
The Rakata people shall always be indebted to you.;[];;[];[2343];unk43_rakstory;
Greetings once again. How may the loremaster of our tribe serve you now?;[];;[2304, 2325, 2329, 2336, 2346, 2347, 2353, 2368];[None];unk43_rakstory;
Tell me the history of your people.;[];;[2254];[2345, 2352, 2367, 2363, 2360, 2357, 2371];unk43_rakstory;
What happened the last time I was here?;[];;[2348];[2345, 2371];unk43_rakstory;
You came to us shortly after we had arrived on this island, before we had yet constructed this settlement.;[];;[2349];[2347];unk43_rakstory;
You came to us after defeating our scouts who confronted you, much as you have again this time. The One saw your power... and your desire for the knowledge inside the Temple.;[];;[2350];[2348];unk43_rakstory;
We had not yet attacked the Elders' compound, but we knew of their presence... and the depths of their knowledge. We advised you that the answers you sought may lie with them.;[];;[2351];[2349];unk43_rakstory;
We made a pact, an agreement, that if we could breach their compound together and take their secrets, we would do all we could to help you enter the Temple as well.;[];;[2352];[2350];unk43_rakstory;
Then you found a way into the Elders' compound, and we never heard from you again...;[];;[2325, 2336, 2346, 2353, 2368];[2351];unk43_rakstory;
Tell me of the Temple of the Ancients.;[];;[2354];[2352, 2371, 2345];unk43_rakstory;
It is a large structure, the like of which we have seen on no other island anywhere. It's architecture resembles our own, but on a vastly greater scale.;[];;[2355];[2353];unk43_rakstory;
We believe that it may have been built in an age long past by our forebears, but none can understand it now. The Elders may hold the key to it, but they will not divulge it, and we cannot take it from them by force.;[];;[2356];[2354];unk43_rakstory;
The One believes that this Temple may bring him the power to unify the entire world beneath his banner.;[];;[2357];[2355];unk43_rakstory;
The nature of this power escapes me, but I cannot deny his vision. The barriers around it keep us from entering, the power of the Elders seems to draw upon it, and we can see strange objects rise from it into the sky regularly.;[];;[2325, 2336, 2346, 2358, 2361, 2364];[2356];unk43_rakstory;
Strange objects?;[];;[2359];[2357, 2363, 2367];unk43_rakstory;
Objects come and go from the far end of the temple frequently. We do not know what manner of thing they are, but we suspect they are like our boats... boats that ride on air.;[];;[2360];[2358];unk43_rakstory;
If we could make these boats our own, nothing would escape our grasp!;[];;[2325, 2336, 2346, 2361, 2364];[2359];unk43_rakstory;
How are you prevented from entering?;[];;[2362];[2360, 2367, 2357];unk43_rakstory;
There is a strong barrier of light guarding the front entrance to the Temple. We cannot breach this barrier. Our attempts to go around through other entrances have also met with failure.;[];;[2363];[2361];unk43_rakstory;
No one who has tried to enter the temple through other means, or travelled to the island at its far side has ever returned...;[];;[2325, 2336, 2346, 2358, 2364];[2362];unk43_rakstory;
How is the Elders' power similar?;[];;[2365];[2363, 2360, 2357];unk43_rakstory;
When we tried to assault the Elders' compound, we were met by defenses of caged lightning and beams of light that cut warriors in half just by touching them, or turned them into charred meat in an instant.;[];;[2366];[2364];unk43_rakstory;
Many warriors died there... their bodies forming a new wall for the Elders' defence...;[];;[2367];[2365];unk43_rakstory;
The Temple too, uses light, though this time as a shield to block us from entering... We believe they may be connected somehow.;[];;[2336, 2346, 2358, 2361];[2366];unk43_rakstory;
Do you know anything about other survivors?;[];;[2369];[2352, 2345];unk43_rakstory;
Other survivors? You mean others who have crashed onto this world as you have?;[];;[2370];[2368];unk43_rakstory;
Yes, there have been others... Others who wield powers like yours, whose weapons spit fire and light. They have killed many of our warriors and we hunt them down as we can.;[];;[2371];[2369];unk43_rakstory;

I... yes -- we are only servants to the... master.;[];;[2481];[2479];kor33_yuthura;NM33AAYUTH21107_.mp3
Statement: Just a simple droid, here, ma'am. Nothing to see. Move along.;[];;[2486];[2479];kor33_yuthura;NM33AAYUTH21111_.mp3
I see. Fair enough, so long as they do not disturb your training or cause any trouble. Are you ready to go to the academy, then?;[];;[2429, 2431];[2485, 2479];kor33_yuthura;NM33AAYUTH21112_.mp3
Are you ready to go there now?;[];;[2429, 2431];[2477];kor33_yuthura;NM33AAYUTH21113_.mp3
Yes, it does. I wish to become a Sith.;[];;[2476];[2470];kor33_yuthura;
Again? I suppose that would interest me, yes.;[];;[2490];[2470];kor33_yuthura;
Hmm. A strange response, indeed. Is your mind maladjusted in some way? You should make for an interesting pupil, indeed.;[];;[2477];[2489];kor33_yuthura;NM33AAYUTH21091_.mp3
*chuckle* As you wish. Keep your little secrets, human, if you must. Either way, I sense an intriguing amount of power within you.;[{'Yuthura Ban': 'Talk_Laughing'}];;[2470];[2468];kor33_yuthura;NM33AAYUTH21079_.mp3
Yes, but only very little.;[];;[2493];[2467, 2500];kor33_yuthura;
As I thought. How interesting that they would let one with such power out of their grasp. Or are you here to spy on us? For all the good it would do.;[];;[2470];[2492];kor33_yuthura;NM33AAYUTH21081_.mp3
Yes. I'm a fallen Jedi, if you must know.;[];;[2495];[2467, 2500];kor33_yuthura;
A Padawan, perhaps, though it makes little difference. I sense enough raw power within you to... well, we shall see.;[];;[2470];[2494];kor33_yuthura;NM33AAYUTH21083_.mp3
What difference does it make?;[];;[2497];[2467, 2500];kor33_yuthura;
Perhaps none. Perhaps all the difference in the world. Either way, you possess enough raw power to intrigue me greatly.;[];;[2470];[2496];kor33_yuthura;NM33AAYUTH21085_.mp3
I have forgotten most of my training, it seems.;[];;[2499];[2467, 2500];kor33_yuthura;
What an odd thing to say... and, even stranger, I do not sense any deception within you. You are a curious puzzle, human, a puzzle with great power.;[];;[2470];[2498];kor33_yuthura;NM33AAYUTH21120_.mp3
I sense... that you are very strong in the Force. That you have already honed some of your abilities. Jedi training, is it?;[];;[2468, 2492, 2494, 2496, 2498];[2466, 2502, 2520, 2523];kor33_yuthura;NM33AAYUTH21076_.mp3
Yes. I want to join the Sith.;[];;[2502];[2464];kor33_yuthura;
Ahhh, so you are just another hopeful after all. Or are you? There is something odd about you that I cannot place...;[];;[2467, 2500];[2501, 2511, 2514];kor33_yuthura;NM33AAYUTH21074_.mp3
Never mind... I have to go.;[];;[2504];[2464];kor33_yuthura;
Oh? That is truly a first. Do as you wish, then, human. I'll not stop you.;[];;[];[2503];kor33_yuthura;NM33AAYUTH21046_.mp3
Why would I want to join the Sith?;[];;[2506];[2437, 2518, 2538];kor33_yuthura;
*chuckle* An interesting question, and not one I hear often. For most the benefits of becoming a Sith are quite obvious.;[{'Yuthura Ban': 'Talk_Laughing'}];;[2507];[2505];kor33_yuthura;NM33AAYUTH21036_.mp3
We wield ultimate power, my friend. To be a Sith is to taste freedom and to know victory. Nothing is as glorious as bending the Force to your will.;[];;[2438, 2442, 2445, 2452, 2458];[2506, 2509];kor33_yuthura;NM33AAYUTH21037_.mp3
Maybe. I haven't given it much thought.;[];;[2509];[2437, 2518, 2538];kor33_yuthura;
And yet here you are on little Korriban, just by accident? I find it hard to believe. If it amuses you, however, I'll play along.;[];;[2507];[2508];kor33_yuthura;NM33AAYUTH21070_.mp3
No! I would never join the Sith!;[];;[2466];[2437, 2518, 2538];kor33_yuthura;
Yes, that's exactly why I'm here. Let me join you.;[];;[2502];[2437, 2518, 2538];kor33_yuthura;
I'll be on my way.;[];;[2513];[2437, 2540, 2535, 2532, 2543];kor33_yuthura;
As you wish.;[];;[];[2512, 2530];kor33_yuthura;NM33AAYUTH21126_.mp3
I want to join the Sith.;[];;[2502, 2515, 2526];[2433];kor33_yuthura;
So I see, from the medallion you carry. How curious that you possess one. Where did you get it?;[];;[2516, 2519, 2522, 2524];[2514];kor33_yuthura;NM33AAYUTH21008_.mp3
Err... I took it from another student, actually.;[];;[2517];[2515, 2525, 2529, 2531];kor33_yuthura;
I see. How very enterprising of you, though that is not the normal way that we select our students for the academy.;[];;[2518];[2516];kor33_yuthura;NM33AAYUTH21016_.mp3
We Sith do encourage such independent thinking. You may even be a suitable candidate to join us. That is what you wish, I take it? To become a Sith?;[];;[2505, 2508, 2510, 2511];[2517, 2521];kor33_yuthura;NM33AAYUTH21022_.mp3
[Persuade/Lie] It was given to me...;[];;[2520, 2521];[2515, 2525, 2529, 2531];kor33_yuthura;
[Success] Oh? By one of the others, no doubt. You do seem a fit candidate for the academy, though there is... something odd about you...;[];;[2467, 2500];[2519];kor33_yuthura;NM33AAYUTH21018_.mp3
[Failure] You think to lie to me, do you? I would suspect you stole this and killed the owner. Very enterprising of you, I must admit.;[];;[2518];[2519, 2522];kor33_yuthura;NM33AAYUTH21021_.mp3
[Persuade/Lie] One of the other Sith accepted me into the academy.;[];;[2521, 2523];[2515, 2525, 2529, 2531];kor33_yuthura;

Why do you want to know?;[];;[2525];[2515, 2529, 2531];kor33_yuthura;
Do not be insolent, human. I asked you a direct question, and I will not be trifled with. Now... where did you get this medallion?;[{'Yuthura Ban': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[2516, 2519, 2522];[2524];kor33_yuthura;NM33AAYUTH21024_.mp3
But I have already told you your answer, human. Do not bother me further, or I shall become irritated.;[];;[];[2514];kor33_yuthura;NM33AAYUTH21009_.mp3
I have this medallion...;[];;[2528, 2529];[2433];kor33_yuthura;
So one of the others accepted you, even after I did not? You are lucky, human, for I am in a forgiving mood.;[];;[2477];[2527];kor33_yuthura;NM33AAYUTH21011_.mp3
So I see. How curious that you should come to possess such a thing. Where did you get it?;[];;[2516, 2519, 2522, 2524];[2527];kor33_yuthura;NM33AAYUTH21012_.mp3
Never mind. I'll go.;[];;[2513];[2433];kor33_yuthura;

You are far from the first Jedi who has come here, after all, willing to abandon that decrepit order of yours.;[];;[2512, 2536, 2537, 2539];[2534, 2541, 2542];kor33_yuthura;NM33AAYUTH21029_.mp3

Are you Yuthura Ban?;[];;[2538];[2535, 2540, 2532, 2543];kor33_yuthura;
I am. Obviously you have been told of me. Is it your desire, then, to train at the academy? Do you wish to become a Sith, human?;[];;[2438, 2505, 2508, 2510, 2511];[2537];kor33_yuthura;NM33AAYUTH21122_.mp3
Can I ask you some questions?;[];;[2540];[2535, 2532, 2543];kor33_yuthura;
I am sure there are plenty of others here who would answer your questions. I am quite busy. So if there is nothing else...?;[];;[2512, 2536, 2537];[2539];kor33_yuthura;NM33AAYUTH21124_.mp3

I was wondering if we could talk.;[];;[2553];[2551, 2958];k_hjuh_dialog;
What is it you would like to speak to me about?;[];;[2554, 2567, 2602, 2736, 2770, 2836, 2897, 2949];[2552];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11435_.mp3
Tell me about this Dak Vesser.;[];;[2555];[2553];k_hjuh_dialog;
There is little to tell. Dak and I were both Padawans... we joined the Order at the same time.;[];;[2556];[2554];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11437_.mp3
He was a kind man, but... frustrated. He felt the Jedi were too controlling, too limiting... more so than I did.;[];;[2557];[2555];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11438_.mp3
When he decided to leave the Order, he asked me to come with him. He... he said he loved me.;[];;[2558, 2563, 2565];[2556];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11439_.mp3
But you didn't love him?;[];;[2559];[2557];k_hjuh_dialog;
No, I didn't. I enjoyed his company, as a friend, but nothing further. I had no idea he felt as he did.;[];;[2560];[2558];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11441_.mp3
He was angry at my refusal. I... assumed that he would get over the hurt in time. I suppose such feelings can fester and darken, and they never go away.;[];;[2561];[2559, 2566];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11446_.mp3
He reminds me of what I was when you found me in the grove. I... feel sorry for him.;[];;[2562];[2560, 2564];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11447_.mp3
But he has chosen his path, hasn't he? If I thought he would accept an offer of help, I would give it. Let us... just move on, please.;[];;[];[2561];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11448_.mp3
Oh. Forget I asked.;[];;[2564];[2557];k_hjuh_dialog;
I suppose the rest is obvious enough that I need not tell it.;[];;[2561];[2563];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11443_.mp3
That doesn't sound so serious.;[];;[2566];[2557];k_hjuh_dialog;
It was serious enough to him... and to me, for I did not wish to hurt him. I had little choice in the matter.;[];;[2560];[2565];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11445_.mp3
How did you come to be a Jedi?;[];;[2568];[2553];k_hjuh_dialog;
How I came to be a Jedi? I am sure you would not find it very interesting... Are you sure you would like to hear?;[];h1  when the player asks her how she became a jedi;[2569, 2598, 2600];[2567];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11450_.mp3
Yes. Please continue.;[];;[2570];[2568];k_hjuh_dialog;
Well... It goes back a number of years...;[];;[2571];[2569];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11452_.mp3
Back on my homeworld we did not see Jedi very often, especially where I lived.;[];;[2572, 2594, 2596];[2570];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11453_.mp3
Where did you live?;[];;[2573];[2571];k_hjuh_dialog;
The hind end of space. A pit of a world, to be sure. Where Jedi rarely tread...;[];;[2574];[2572, 2595];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11455_.mp3
But we had heard of them. Well, everyone had, so that is not to be unexpected.;[];;[2575];[2573, 2597];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11456_.mp3
Champions of truth. Defenders of justice. Heroes of the Republic.;[];;[2576];[2574];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11457_.mp3
It was very easy for a child to be enthralled by their image, their mystique. Maybe I was one of those children.;[];;[2577, 2590, 2591];[2575];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11458_.mp3
Did you meet a Jedi?;[];;[2578];[2576];k_hjuh_dialog;
Yes... Yes I did.;[];;[2579];[2577];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11460_.mp3
When I saw a Jedi for the first time they lived up to everything my imagination had created them to be. I was awed... and maybe a bit enamored...;[];;[2580, 2588, 2589];[2578, 2590, 2593];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11465_.mp3
Enamored?;[];;[2581];[2579];k_hjuh_dialog;
They were quite striking... especially the tales of their leader.;[];;[2582];[2580];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11467_.mp3
From that moment on I knew that I would have to try to become a Jedi. To lift myself out of the rut I had been living in for years and to make a real difference, as the Jedi were.;[];;[2583];[2581, 2588, 2589];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11470_.mp3
The foolish delusions of a child. But THIS child made it happen!;[];;[2584];[2582];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11471_.mp3
As soon as I was able I left my world and went in search of them. I found them and was accepted. I had been living my dream on Dantooine for several years before you came.;[];;[2585];[2583];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11472_.mp3
Although... perhaps I was not entirely ready for it... or not completely suited to the task. Otherwise I would not have fallen...;[];;[2586];[2584];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11473_.mp3
But thanks to you I have been redeemed. Perhaps I may yet live to see that dream of mine come true.;[];;[2587];[2585];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11474_.mp3
Come, there is much we should do. Let us not waste time talking. Action is what is needed.;[];;[];[2586];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11475_.mp3
The imagination can be a dangerous thing...;[];;[2582];[2579];k_hjuh_dialog;
So what did you do?;[];;[2582];[2579];k_hjuh_dialog;
Then how did you gain entrance to the Order?;[];;[2579];[2576];k_hjuh_dialog;
Typical childish naivete.;[];;[2592];[2576];k_hjuh_dialog;
Allow children their innocence while they still may have it!;[];;[2593];[2591];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11463_.mp3
I was not so innocent, but I too was affected...;[];;[2579];[2592];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11464_.mp3
What is the Cathar homeworld like?;[];;[2595];[2571];k_hjuh_dialog;
It was not the homeworld of the Cathar that I lived on. My parents had long fled from that place, and perhaps that is a story for another time. Rather it was a human hive-world I was raised on.;[];;[2573];[2594];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11477_.mp3
Was it bad there?;[];;[2597];[2571];k_hjuh_dialog;
Bad enough that Jedi rarely came to that place.;[];;[2574];[2596];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11479_.mp3
On second thought, maybe not.;[];;[2599];[2568];k_hjuh_dialog;
Very well then. Perhaps some other time you might deign to be interested.;[];;[];[2598];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11481_.mp3
You're right. It's going to be boring.;[];;[2601];[2568];k_hjuh_dialog;
My attempt at humility seems to fail around you. So be it then, go immerse yourself in something else.;[];;[];[2600];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11483_.mp3
Tell me more about your past.;[];h2, h5, h7;[2603, 2650, 2700];[2553];k_hjuh_dialog;
Well... I suppose I have not talked very much about the Jedi I met back home.;[];h2  when the player talks to her about her history some more;[2604];[2602];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11485_.mp3
They, all of them, were so very... invigorating.;[];;[2605, 2647, 2649];[2603];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11486_.mp3
Invigorating?;[];;[2606];[2604];k_hjuh_dialog;
They were so very alive. So full of hope and energy and zeal.;[];;[2607];[2605];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11488_.mp3
In retrospect I can see it was a little bit tragic...;[];;[2608, 2642, 2644];[2606];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11489_.mp3
Tragic?;[];;[2609];[2607];k_hjuh_dialog;
Well... yes... these Jedi were going to fight the Mandalorians just after they had invaded. Many of those Jedi perished in the fighting.;[];;[2610];[2608];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11491_.mp3
But to us, they seemed invincible, especially their leader, who they talked about all the time. Paragons of light and justice, sweeping away all iniquity before them.;[];;[2611];[2609, 2643];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11492_.mp3
It was like looking at gods...;[];;[2612, 2638, 2640];[2610];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11493_.mp3
The Jedi are not gods.;[];;[2613];[2611];k_hjuh_dialog;
I know that! I was using poetic licence! But those Jedi...;[];;[2614];[2612];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11495_.mp3
They were enthralling... Everyone wanted just to touch them. Some people thought it would bring them luck.;[];;[2615];[2613, 2639, 2641];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11496_.mp3
Not that the peace they brought lasted very long...;[];;[2616, 2636];[2614];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11497_.mp3
What happened?;[];;[2617];[2615, 2738];k_hjuh_dialog;
The Jedi left. The people grew complacent. Those who had been wronged saw their chance at revenge... and so the cycle continues.;[];;[2618];[2616, 2637];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11499_.mp3
The oppressed become the new generation of oppressors. The human oppressed that is...;[];;[2619];[2617];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11500_.mp3
The non-humans were never treated well in any case... We felt the brunt of both administrations...;[];;[2620, 2632, 2634];[2618];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11501_.mp3
Was it that bad?;[];;[2621];[2619, 3257];k_hjuh_dialog;
Of course it was! They took their frustrations and hates out on us because the people they wanted had already fled or were too well protected!;[];;[2622];[2620];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11503_.mp3
But no one looks out for the injustices we suffered! Oh, no!;[];;[2623];[2621, 2633, 2635];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11506_.mp3
But... I am sorry, I should not have outbursts like that.;[];;[2624, 2628, 2630];[2622];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11507_.mp3
As long as you do not let your anger influence you.;[];;[2625];[2623];k_hjuh_dialog;
Don't you see? The very fact I mentioned it means it has its influence. Anger can lead to the dark side and I must be ever careful that I do not fall back into those ways.;[];;[2626];[2624];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11509_.mp3
I... I thank you for your support. My outburst was uncalled for, but you did not lash back at me. You are a much better Jedi than I, it would seem.;[];;[2627];[2625, 2629, 2631];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11514_.mp3
But let us not speak more of this now. We should continue on our journey. Perhaps later we will talk again.;[];;[];[2626];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11515_.mp3
Such anger can lead to the dark side.;[];;[2629];[2623];k_hjuh_dialog;
I know... And I must be ever careful that I do not fall back into those ways again.;[];;[2626];[2628];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11511_.mp3
It is alright.;[];;[2631];[2623];k_hjuh_dialog;
No, it is not. Anger can lead to the dark side and I must be ever careful that I do not fall back into those ways.;[];;[2626];[2630];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11513_.mp3
Well you can't really blame them.;[];;[2633];[2619];k_hjuh_dialog;
What?!? Of course I can! They took their frustrations and hates out on us because the people they wanted had already fled or were too well protected!;[];;[2622];[2632];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11505_.mp3
All species are capable of intolerance.;[];;[2635];[2619];k_hjuh_dialog;
Yes but humans seem the most pervasive... the most consistent. They took their frustrations and hates out on us because the people they wanted had already fled or were too well protected!;[];;[2622];[2634];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11517_.mp3
Did they leave?;[];;[2637];[2615];k_hjuh_dialog;
Of course they left! They had a war to go fight, so that we would not all be killed by those psychotic Mandalorians!;[];;[2617];[2636];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11519_.mp3
Damn straight! I DO look divine.;[];;[2639];[2611];k_hjuh_dialog;
I can only assume that was some misguided attempt at humor. I was using poetic licence. But those Jedi...;[];;[2614];[2638];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11521_.mp3
If that was the case, they seem to be misrepresenting themselves.;[];;[2641];[2611];k_hjuh_dialog;
I was merely using poetic licence. Those Jedi...;[];;[2614];[2640];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11523_.mp3
What do you mean?;[];;[2643];[2607];k_hjuh_dialog;
These Jedi were going to fight the Mandalorians just after they had invaded. Many of those Jedi perished in the fighting.;[];;[2610];[2642];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11525_.mp3
Blah, blah, blah. Okay, you can stop now.;[];;[2645];[2607];k_hjuh_dialog;
What?! You...;[];;[2646];[2644, 2649];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11530_.mp3
Bah! It is useless talking to you it seems! Come back when you are more civilized or when we have something to do.;[];;[];[2645];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11531_.mp3
I already know about Jedi, talk about something else.;[];;[2648];[2604];k_hjuh_dialog;
If you do not wish to hear what I have to say, then find some other being to converse with!;[];;[];[2647];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11528_.mp3
Why do you insist on spewing this trash at me?;[];;[2645];[2604];k_hjuh_dialog;
Well, I mentioned before that my parents had fled to Taris. Perhaps I can tell you about that.;[];h5  when the player asks for more about her history;[2651, 2693, 2694];[2602];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11532_.mp3
Please do.;[];;[2652];[2650];k_hjuh_dialog;
In the early days of the Mandalorian war, there had been fighting closer to the Outer Rim worlds.;[];;[2653, 2691, 2692];[2651, 2693, 2698];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11534_.mp3
Near the world your species comes from?;[];;[2654];[2652];k_hjuh_dialog;
Cathar was there, yes. My people had a great reputation as warriors... and that appealed to the Mandalore version of 'honor'.;[];;[2655];[2653, 2691, 2692];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11536_.mp3
They sought to test themselves against us, I think... test themselves by bombing our world, slaughtering my people while they slept or while they ran.;[];;[2656, 2689, 2690];[2654];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11537_.mp3
How did it happen?;[];;[2657];[2655];k_hjuh_dialog;
They swooped down from space across the world, firing at anything that moved. They used ships in space to destroy all orbital facilities and bombard the surface.;[];;[2658];[2656, 2689, 2690];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11539_.mp3
We did resist, and in spite of their violent attack we did stave them off for quite a while.;[];;[2659];[2657];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11540_.mp3
But in the end we were doomed...;[];;[2660, 2686, 2687];[2658];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11541_.mp3
Why did the Republic not help you?;[];;[2661];[2659];k_hjuh_dialog;
We were not members of the Republic. Cathar was beyond the edge of the Republic, in the Outer Rim. And besides, they could not have known.;[];;[2662];[2660, 2686, 2688];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11543_.mp3
Our interstellar communications were the first things the Mandalores hit. All other short-range communicators were jammed... we were on our own.;[];;[2663];[2661];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11544_.mp3
We knew what was coming. We had fought the Mandalorians in the first war against Exar Kun and the Sith. We knew there would be no mercy for us.;[];;[2664];[2662];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11545_.mp3
The most we could do was pack the few of our people who survived onto what few ships remained and send them off into space as fast as they could.;[];;[2665];[2663];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11546_.mp3
Most did not make it.;[];;[2666, 2684, 2685];[2664];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11547_.mp3
But you survived?;[];;[2667];[2665];k_hjuh_dialog;
My parents carried me as a baby with them and were lucky enough to escape.;[];;[2668];[2666, 2684, 2685];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11549_.mp3
They fled as far as they were able, and eventually settled on Taris. They could stand running no further, I think...;[];;[2669];[2667];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11550_.mp3
But Taris was a horrible choice. Dominated by humans, intolerant of other species, it made everyday life unnecessarily hard.;[];;[2670, 2680, 2682];[2668];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11551_.mp3
How did your family cope?;[];;[2671];[2669];k_hjuh_dialog;
My father... my father turned to stimulants. He spent much of his time in local bars and dives.;[];;[2672];[2670, 2681, 2683];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11553_.mp3
But we are warriors. It runs through our blood. And when he was on stims he... he... he became foolish... he let his warrior nature get the best of him.;[];;[2673];[2671];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11554_.mp3
So he would get intoxicated, and he would fight, and finally one day he would die.;[];;[2674, 2677, 2678];[2672];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11555_.mp3
He died?;[];;[2675];[2673];k_hjuh_dialog;
Killed by a man who provoked him into a fight and killed him like an animal.;[];;[2676];[2674, 2677, 2679];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11557_.mp3
I... I am sorry, I cannot talk about this any longer right now...;[];;[];[2675];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11558_.mp3
How did he die?;[];;[2675];[2673];k_hjuh_dialog;
That's tragic...;[];;[2679];[2673];k_hjuh_dialog;
I don't need your sarcasm, or your pity! He died at the hands of another.;[];;[2675];[2678];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11561_.mp3
Your parents do not sound very wise to me.;[];;[2681];[2669];k_hjuh_dialog;
Perhaps they were not. Perhaps they did not know better. It did not take long for things to get worse.;[];;[2671];[2680];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11563_.mp3
Taris is not a nice place to raise a child.;[];;[2683];[2669];k_hjuh_dialog;
No, it is not. But they had little choice. Each of us dealt with it in our own way.;[];;[2671];[2682];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11565_.mp3
What about your family?;[];;[2667];[2665];k_hjuh_dialog;
An atrocity!;[];;[2667];[2665];k_hjuh_dialog;
The Jedi could have helped!;[];;[2661];[2659];k_hjuh_dialog;
And that is what you get for being unprepared.;[];;[2688];[2659];k_hjuh_dialog;
We were prepared! Just not for an invasion of that size... And we had counted on the aid of our allies. Of the Republic...;[];;[2661];[2687];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11570_.mp3
Your world was taken that easily?;[];;[2657];[2655];k_hjuh_dialog;
The Mandalorians fought dirty.;[];;[2657];[2655];k_hjuh_dialog;
Your people were in that region?;[];;[2654];[2652];k_hjuh_dialog;
What caused them to flee?;[];;[2654];[2652];k_hjuh_dialog;
Go on.;[];;[2652];[2650];k_hjuh_dialog;
There were no Cathar on Taris that I saw.;[];;[2695];[2650];k_hjuh_dialog;
No there were not... having fled the birthworld of my species, my parents flew as far and wide as they could.;[];;[2696];[2694];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11577_.mp3
And so I was raised alone, knowing of my birthplace only the few stories my parents could tell, and seeing no other member of my species at all...;[];;[2697, 2699];[2695];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11578_.mp3
Why did they flee?;[];;[2698];[2696];k_hjuh_dialog;
It all comes back to wars and fighting... the curse of your race, it seems...;[];;[2652];[2697, 2699];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11580_.mp3
Why were there no other members of your species on Taris?;[];;[2698];[2696];k_hjuh_dialog;
I have told you my life story already, what more could you possibly want to know? Well... there is one thing...;[];h7  when the player asks about her past again  before the leviathan  set that juhani has mentioned it was revan;[2701];[2602];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11582_.mp3
I did not want to mention it before, because I was unsure how you would react.;[];;[2702, 2732, 2734];[2700];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11583_.mp3
What is it?;[];;[2703];[2701, 3206];k_hjuh_dialog;
Do you remember when I told you of the Jedi who had come to my world to fight the Mandalorians?;[];;[2704];[2702, 2733, 2735];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11585_.mp3
They were recruiting soldiers for their crusade against the Mandalores. Many people joined them.;[];;[2705, 2731];[2703];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11586_.mp3
Yes, you mentioned this.;[];;[2706];[2704];k_hjuh_dialog;
The main reason for that was their charismatic leader. The one whose troops freed me and let me dream of seeking out and joining the Jedi Order.;[];;[2707, 2729, 2730];[2705, 2731];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11588_.mp3
I was hesitant to talk to you about this because... well...;[];;[2708, 2727, 2728];[2706, 2729, 2730];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11591_.mp3
Well what?;[];;[2709];[2707];k_hjuh_dialog;
The Jedi had come to fight the Mandalores under the leadership of a powerful young Jedi... a Jedi named Revan.;[];;[2710, 2725];[2708, 2727, 2728];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11593_.mp3
Revan?! You mean...;[];;[2711, 2715];[2709];k_hjuh_dialog;
Yes, it was you. I never saw you, else I would have recognized you, but it was your army that freed me from the slavers.;[];;[2712, 2714];[2710, 2726];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11595_.mp3
I cannot express how you have changed my life... or how much you mean to me.;[];;[2713];[2711];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11596_.mp3
But I will stay by your side through any trials that may come. Such is the will of the Council... and my own.;[];;[];[2712, 2714];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11597_.mp3
I cannot express how you have changed my life.;[];;[2713];[2711];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11598_.mp3
THE Revan. The Jedi who turned to the dark side, became the Dark Lord of the Sith and was defeated by Bastila and her strike team.;[];;[2716];[2710, 2726];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11599_.mp3
I do not know what happened in the wars with the Mandalorians that turned Revan and Malak, or what they sought with these Star Maps, but the Jedi I knew was a paragon of the Order.;[];;[2717];[2715];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11600_.mp3
I am sorry, if this seems wrong to you, but to understand you must realize that Revan was as great as a Jedi could be. Whatever turned Revan must be terrible indeed.;[];;[2718];[2716];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11601_.mp3
I wonder if what we find at the end of our journey will turn us as well...;[];;[2719, 2723, 2724];[2717];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11602_.mp3
Juhani...;[];;[2720];[2718, 2759, 3084, 3153];k_hjuh_dialog;
This is meaningless speculation I guess. I just wanted you to know what I held from you.;[];;[2721];[2719, 2723, 2724];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11604_.mp3
But rest assured that I will not hold back if our enemy is Malak, Revan's apprentice, or indeed even if it was Revan.;[];;[2722];[2720];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11605_.mp3
I will help you through all trouble. Such is the will of the Council... And my own.;[];;[];[2721];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11606_.mp3
I shall never fall like Revan did!;[];;[2720];[2718];k_hjuh_dialog;
Why did you tell me now?;[];;[2720];[2718];k_hjuh_dialog;
How could you admire Revan?;[];;[2726];[2709];k_hjuh_dialog;
Yes... I thought you might react badly... But it was Revan.;[];;[2711, 2715];[2725];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11611_.mp3
Spit it out already!;[];;[2709];[2707];k_hjuh_dialog;
How bad could this be?;[];;[2709];[2707];k_hjuh_dialog;
I... I idolized him and the stories they told of him. He was everything I had dreamed a Jedi could be. I still believe he was that way.;[];;[2707];[2706];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11590_.mp3
I... I idolized her and the stories they told of her. She was everything that I had dreamed a Jedi could be. I still believe she was that way.;[];;[2707];[2706];k_hjuh_dialog;NM05AAJUHA11590A.mp3
Of course I remember.;[];;[2706];[2704];k_hjuh_dialog;
Do we really have time for this?;[];;[2733];[2701];k_hjuh_dialog;
If you do not want to listen, I understand. But hear me out first.;[];;[2703];[2732];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11617_.mp3
Why would I react badly?;[];;[2735];[2701];k_hjuh_dialog;
You... you will see. Perhaps...;[];;[2703];[2734];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11619_.mp3
What happened after your father died?;[];;[2737];[2553];k_hjuh_dialog;
After my father died, my mother was left to support me alone. A single non-human woman, living in one of the worst, most violent slums on Taris.;[];h6  when the player asks what happened after her father died;[2738];[2736];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11621_.mp3
It was not easy for her.;[];;[2616, 2739, 2769];[2737];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11622_.mp3
How so?;[];;[2740];[2738, 2865, 3192];k_hjuh_dialog;
When my father was killed it seemed that something in her began to die as well.;[];;[2741];[2739, 2769];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11624_.mp3
She worked. She worked as hard as she was able, but over time she began to waste away.;[];;[2742];[2740];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11625_.mp3
I later learned that she was unable to get enough money to feed both of us, and had to start borrowing from the Exchange, a band of cutthroats and smugglers. But even that was not enough...;[];;[2743];[2741];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11626_.mp3
She hid what she was doing from me. She gave most of her food to me, so that I would be strong. But she herself was suffering deeply from it.;[];;[2744];[2742];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11627_.mp3
In the end she could go on no longer, and collapsed at the cantina where she worked one day.;[];;[2745, 2767, 2768];[2743];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11628_.mp3
Did she die?;[];;[2746];[2744];k_hjuh_dialog;
She never recovered. There was nothing really that I could do for her... She left me no money, and no doctor would see her without being paid first.;[];;[2747];[2745, 2767, 2768];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11630_.mp3
I sat by her bed for days as she lay there dying. I never want that to happen to someone I care about ever again...;[];;[2748];[2746];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11631_.mp3
But there was still the money she had borrowed... She had never paid it back, and made no provisions for her death.;[];;[2749];[2747];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11632_.mp3
You must understand: the Exchange is brutal. They care nothing for the life of a sentient being. They are the major suppliers of slaves on Taris.;[];;[2750, 2766];[2748];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11633_.mp3
You were enslaved?;[];;[2751];[2749];k_hjuh_dialog;
They thought it was appropriate that, with my mother owing them money, the debt should be passed on to me. And with no way to pay, they took me by force.;[];;[2752];[2750, 2766];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11635_.mp3
You have no idea what it is like to be bound like a beast and treated as such. It was the worst time of my life.;[];;[2753];[2751];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11636_.mp3
They treated me like livestock. They were waiting for a buyer to give them some credits for me when the Jedi came to fight the Mandalorians.;[];;[2754, 2765];[2752];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11637_.mp3
And they freed you?;[];;[2755];[2753];k_hjuh_dialog;
The Jedi could not abide by what they saw there, and drove the Exchange from the face of the world, freeing those of us imprisoned there.;[];;[2756];[2754, 2765];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11639_.mp3
But the Jedi soon left to fight their war. And I was left with a dream...;[];;[2757, 2764];[2755];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11640_.mp3
What did you do?;[];;[2758];[2756];k_hjuh_dialog;
I swore that I would become a Jedi. As soon as I had enough money to do it, I bought passage on a freighter headed for Dantooine.;[];;[2759];[2757, 2764];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11642_.mp3
And we both know what has happened since then.;[];;[2719, 2760, 2763];[2758];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11643_.mp3
You became a Jedi.;[];;[2761];[2759];k_hjuh_dialog;
I am grateful to you for having given me the opportunity to fulfill my dream, rather than become what I hated.;[];;[2762];[2760, 2763];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11645_.mp3
Someday I may make it up to you, but for now, let us keep on the task at hand.;[];;[];[2761];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11646_.mp3
You turned away from the dark side.;[];;[2761];[2759];k_hjuh_dialog;
What was the dream?;[];;[2758];[2756];k_hjuh_dialog;
How could the Jedi stand for that?;[];;[2755];[2753];k_hjuh_dialog;
They captured you?;[];;[2751];[2749];k_hjuh_dialog;
What did you do for her?;[];;[2746];[2744];k_hjuh_dialog;
Surely there was a doctor.;[];;[2746];[2744];k_hjuh_dialog;
Could you not help her?;[];;[2740];[2738];k_hjuh_dialog;
Are you doing alright?;[];p2, p6;[2771, 2791];[2553];k_hjuh_dialog;
I... I thank you for your concern, but I am still a bit shaken.;[];p2  player asks about her;[2772, 2775, 2789];[2770];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11659_.mp3
Why? What is wrong?;[];;[2773];[2771];k_hjuh_dialog;
I have been thinking about myself... about Quatra... and about my fall to the dark side.;[];;[2774];[2772, 2790];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11661_.mp3
I keep thinking that it was my anger that drove me that far, that nearly damned me. I look inside myself now and I can still see it, I still feel it.;[];;[2775, 2783, 2785];[2773];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11662_.mp3
Perhaps you just need more time.;[];;[2776];[2774, 2771];k_hjuh_dialog;
More time would do me good. Time to distance myself from that anger.;[];;[2777];[2775];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11670_.mp3
I think that is why the Council agreed to send me with you. They think, perhaps, that in your company I will be able to free myself from it.;[];;[2778, 2780, 2782];[2776];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11671_.mp3
I cannot afford to look after you all the time, Juhani.;[];;[2779];[2777];k_hjuh_dialog;
I do not come here begging for scraps from you! I will earn my way with you. You will see just how valuable I am!;[];;[];[2778, 2782];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11676_.mp3
If I see you begin to slip back, I will intervene.;[];;[2781];[2777];k_hjuh_dialog;
I thank you for your concern and your acceptance. I will strive to prove that I am worthy of your company and trust.;[];;[];[2780];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11674_.mp3
Great, another mouth to feed...;[];;[2779];[2777];k_hjuh_dialog;
If the taint cannot be removed, are you sure you should be here?;[];;[2784];[2774];k_hjuh_dialog;
I think maybe, that I just need more time.;[];;[];[2783];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11664_.mp3
You know, I don't really think I care very much.;[];;[2786];[2774];k_hjuh_dialog;
Would you rather I fell again and attacked? Slaughtered you in your sleep like an animal?;[];;[2787];[2785];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11666_.mp3
I see in your pride you do not think that possible.;[];;[2788];[2786];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11667_.mp3
Very well, then! Keep your own counsel.;[];;[];[2787];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11668_.mp3
You're too fragile, Juhani.;[];;[2790];[2771];k_hjuh_dialog;
I am. I try to be strong, as one of my people should, but I know I am still weak inside.;[];;[2773];[2789];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11678_.mp3
I have been doing well, I suppose. As well as I can. But I am more interested in you right now.;[];p6  when the player asks her how she is doing;[2792];[2770];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11679_.mp3
Do not mistake me, it is just that even though we have traveled together for a while, it seems I know next to nothing about you, personally.;[];;[2793, 2829, 2830, 2834];[2791];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11680_.mp3
It is a little forward...;[];;[2794, 2795];[2792];k_hjuh_dialog;
Please, forgive me... I did not mean to insinuate that I... that we...;[];;[2795];[2793];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11682_.mp3
It did not come out the way I had intended.;[];;[2796];[2794, 2793];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11683_.mp3
We have been travelling together since Dantooine, but I know nothing of you before that. Would you... would you humor me and tell me a little about yourself?;[];;[2797, 2825, 2827];[2795, 2829];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11684_.mp3
What is there to tell...;[];;[2798];[2796, 2835];k_hjuh_dialog;
Your job? Your childhood? Your life?;[];;[2799, 2800];[2797, 2826, 2828];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11686_.mp3
Your... family?;[];;[2800];[2798];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11687_.mp3
I am sorry if I am making you uncomfortable. I will fully understand if you choose not to answer.;[];;[2801, 2822, 2824];[2799, 2798];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11688_.mp3
No, it is alright.;[];;[2802];[2800];k_hjuh_dialog;
I greatly appreciate your taking the time to talk to me. How did you come to be on Dantooine?;[];;[2803];[2801];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11690_.mp3
Besides the obvious, of course.;[];;[2804, 2819, 2820];[2802];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11691_.mp3
Well I rescued Bastila on Taris...;[];;[2805];[2803];k_hjuh_dialog;
Taris... It always seems to come back to Taris for me...;[];;[2806, 2810];[2804, 2819, 2821];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11693_.mp3
I am sorry... I get distracted. I already know the tales of your exploits: how you defeated the Mandalorians in the war... and how you fell.;[];;[2807];[2805];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11694_.mp3
But now you have the chance to redeem yourself. To make a new page in your history.;[];;[2808];[2806];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11695_.mp3
So now, I suppose, that all does not matter. Only your life now does.;[];;[2809];[2807];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11696_.mp3
But again I seem to be wasting your time with my carrying on. I apologize.;[];;[];[2808, 2814, 2816];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11702_.mp3
I am sorry... I get distracted. What did you do before Ta... before that?;[];;[2811, 2817, 2818];[2805];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11697_.mp3
I was a specialist with the Republic fleet.;[];;[2812];[2810];k_hjuh_dialog;
A life in the army. Not my career of choice, though. We Cathar cannot seem to adjust to regimented organizations like the military.;[];;[2813, 2815];[2811, 2817, 2818];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11699_.mp3
But in a way it does seem to have it's own romantic appeal. Defending the galaxy from evil.;[];;[2814];[2812];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11700_.mp3
Much as we Jedi do. So in a way, I suppose, we are more alike than not.;[];;[2809];[2813];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11701_.mp3
But I have heard that it appeals to males of your species. Fighting, defending.;[];;[2816];[2812];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11703_.mp3
That is what we as Jedi seem to be called upon to do. Perhaps we are not as unalike as I had previously thought...;[];;[2809];[2815];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11704_.mp3
I was a soldier for the Republic.;[];;[2812];[2810];k_hjuh_dialog;
I was a scout for the Republic armed forces.;[];;[2812];[2810];k_hjuh_dialog;
I was in the Republic fleet that was destroyed over Taris.;[];;[2805];[2803];k_hjuh_dialog;
Er... I flew to Dantooine?;[];;[2821];[2803];k_hjuh_dialog;
Heh. Yes, I kind of figured that. From where? Oh wait... I remember...;[];;[2805];[2820];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11709_.mp3
Sorry, my life is my business.;[];;[2823];[2800];k_hjuh_dialog;
I understand. I appreciate that you take the time to talk to me. I will be more considerate of your time in the future.;[];;[];[2822, 2824];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11711_.mp3
Damn right! It's none of your business!;[];;[2823];[2800];k_hjuh_dialog;
Is is not a very interesting story.;[];;[2826];[2796, 2835];k_hjuh_dialog;
Hah. Humility. Please, if you would, indulge me.;[];;[2798];[2825];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11714_.mp3
Heh. Well it is, of course, the greatest story ever told.;[];;[2828];[2796, 2835];k_hjuh_dialog;
Your humility is... astounding as always. So what can you tell me?;[];;[2798];[2827];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11716_.mp3
What do you want to know?;[];;[2796];[2792];k_hjuh_dialog;
There's a reason for these things, you know.;[];;[2831];[2792];k_hjuh_dialog;
Oh. I see. It is because you wish to keep me at arm's length.;[];;[2832];[2830];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11719_.mp3
Are you worried about me turning to the dark side? Or do you merely not wish my company.;[];;[2833];[2831];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11720_.mp3
Whatever the case, I am sorry for presuming too much. I will remember my station from now on.;[];;[];[2832];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11721_.mp3
Well you know my reputation.;[];;[2835];[2792];k_hjuh_dialog;
Yes. Yes, I do. I more than most perhaps. But I do not know the stories of your past. Legends rarely are laid bare like that.;[];;[2797, 2825, 2827];[2834];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11723_.mp3
What are you thinking about?;[];p3, p4;[2837, 2863];[2553];k_hjuh_dialog;
I have been thinking much about our journey, and I am grateful and honored that you have accepted me with you.;[];p2  player talks to her about what shes thinking;[2838, 2862];[2836];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11725_.mp3
It is an honor to be by your side and to see you redeemed from the dark path you had chosen before.;[];;[2839];[2837];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11726_.mp3
We Cathar do not make friends easily, or for long. Even on Dantooine, I remained alone. Not ostracized exactly, but... separate.;[];;[2840, 2856, 2858, 2860];[2838, 2862];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11728_.mp3
Tell me about your people.;[];;[2841];[2839];k_hjuh_dialog;
In truth, I have lived in the Republic too long, and know little. I never met any others of my race other than my parents. But we are not diplomats. We do not deal well with groups. This situation is new to me.;[];;[2842];[2840];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11730_.mp3
It is... warming. I feel almost welcome. Needed.;[];;[2843];[2841, 2857, 2859];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11735_.mp3
You seem to be very decisive when it is required of you. It is reassuring to know that I can count on someone like you.;[];;[2844, 2848, 2851, 2853];[2842];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11736_.mp3
It's only because I haven't found out how to ditch you yet.;[];;[2845];[2843];k_hjuh_dialog;
What? But... I thought...;[];;[2846];[2844];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11738_.mp3
It seems I was mistaken... I should have known things could not change for me that easily.;[];;[2847];[2845, 2861, 2886];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11739_.mp3
As it is the Council's wishes, I will accompany you. I will do my duty, and trust that you will do yours.;[];;[];[2846];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11740_.mp3
It is nice that you hold me in such high regard.;[];;[2849];[2843];k_hjuh_dialog;
To be accepted so readily... I find it difficult to explain. It is so different from what I am used to.;[];;[2850];[2848];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11742_.mp3
Just... Thank you for accepting me.;[];;[];[2849, 2852];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11745_.mp3
We are all in this together.;[];;[2852];[2843];k_hjuh_dialog;
Yes... and that is my point. I find it difficult to explain. It is so different from what I am used to.;[];;[2850];[2851];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11744_.mp3
You could try counting on one of the others, you know...;[];;[2854];[2843];k_hjuh_dialog;
I feel that I could count on any of you. But you... you are the one who drew me back from the dark side. It is to you that I feel a debt.;[];;[2855];[2853];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11747_.mp3
And I SHALL make it up to you.;[];;[];[2854];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11748_.mp3
It must have been difficult for you.;[];;[2857];[2839];k_hjuh_dialog;
Yes, it was. I find it difficult to speak of those things. I do not want to live that way ever again. And here it seems different...;[];;[2842];[2856];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11732_.mp3
And how are things different now?;[];;[2859];[2839];k_hjuh_dialog;
"Well, even if we do not speak that often, or are apart, I still feel a part of a team; this group you have assembled that accompanies you and Bastila on your quest.";[];;[2842];[2858];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11734_.mp3
Then you should be right at home when I turn my back on you.;[];;[2861];[2839];k_hjuh_dialog;
Wha...;[];;[2846];[2860];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11750_.mp3
I am not used to such unbiased acceptance from one who is nearly a stranger to me.;[];;[2839];[2837];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11727_.mp3
Taris was my home for many years. As much as I hated it, it was still home.;[];p3  asks her whats on her mind/if taris being destroyed bothers her;[2864];[2836];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11751_.mp3
"A rat-hole; a warren; a paradise. I suppose you could call it all these things.";[];;[2865];[2863];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11752_.mp3
For me it was hell...;[];;[2739, 2866, 2895];[2864];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11753_.mp3
I know some parts are bad, but...;[];;[2867];[2865];k_hjuh_dialog;
You have no idea what it is like to have to live there for years...;[];;[2868];[2866];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11755_.mp3
"To walk down the streets. To have people look at you in disgust; like an animal. Most did not know anything about me, but it was there all the same.";[];;[2869];[2867, 2896];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11759_.mp3
"Because I was an 'alien'. Because I was different from them; frightening.";[];;[2870];[2868];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11760_.mp3
I doubt any of them had even seen my people before. So they persecuted me...;[];;[2871];[2869];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11761_.mp3
They looked down on me and my family. Charged us more for food. Would not let us walk their streets. They spat on us.;[];;[2872];[2870];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11762_.mp3
You are human... you could not possibly know.;[];;[2873, 2890, 2893];[2871];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11763_.mp3
Humans can be just as cruel to each other.;[];;[2874];[2872];k_hjuh_dialog;
That is true I suppose. But it much more obvious for someone like me.;[];;[2875];[2873];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11765_.mp3
There were no other Cathar on Taris. No one to talk to. No one to confide in.;[];;[2876];[2874, 2892];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11766_.mp3
Humph! But you must think me weak for saying this. But I am strong enough to admit it!;[];;[2877, 2887, 2889];[2875];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11767_.mp3
You are not weak, Juhani. It must have been hard.;[];;[2878];[2876];k_hjuh_dialog;
I thank you for your concern, but...;[];;[2879];[2877];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11769_.mp3
Bah! Maybe I am weak. To think that some stories of my stupid past could possibly interest you.;[];;[2880, 2883, 2885];[2878, 2888];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11772_.mp3
No, it is alright. I will be here to listen to you whenever you want.;[];;[2881];[2879];k_hjuh_dialog;
I thank you. You are kinder than I would have expected... To put up with me using you in this way.;[];;[2882];[2880];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11774_.mp3
I hope that I will not use your time so badly in the future. Thank you.;[];;[];[2881];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11775_.mp3
It is interesting... I just fail to see the point.;[];;[2884];[2879];k_hjuh_dialog;
Maybe there is no point. Maybe I am just lost after leaving yet another planet. I apologize for my outburst. I will try to control myself next time.;[];;[];[2883];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11777_.mp3
You're right. Don't bother me with this drivel again.;[];;[2886];[2879];k_hjuh_dialog;
I would not have thought you were so cruel as that.;[];;[2846];[2885, 2889, 2894];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11785_.mp3
Wait a second. Why are you telling me all this?;[];;[2888];[2876];k_hjuh_dialog;
I... I do not know. I have been keeping it inside for so long. I thought you might understand. You do not seem to fit in exactly with the others. You are... different.;[];;[2879];[2887];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11771_.mp3
Oh, I'm sorry, were you saying something important?;[];;[2886];[2876];k_hjuh_dialog;
I find it a little hard to believe.;[];;[2891];[2872];k_hjuh_dialog;
How can you say that? You have seen Taris, you know what kind of a scum infested hole it is.;[];;[2892];[2890];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11781_.mp3
For us there was no respite. No one to turn to.;[];;[2875];[2891];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11782_.mp3
Well you have to admit: You are a freak.;[];;[2894];[2872];k_hjuh_dialog;
What? You.. You are just like them!;[];;[2886];[2893];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11784_.mp3
Life is hard. You can't blame everything on other people.;[];;[2896];[2865];k_hjuh_dialog;
But it was precisely the people who made it so bad!;[];;[2868];[2895];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11757_.mp3
Why are you so hostile towards Canderous?;[];;[2898];[2553];k_hjuh_dialog;
I am wary of the Mandalorian. I do not trust him.;[];p5  when the player asks about what shes doing (watching canderous);[2899, 2945, 2946, 2947];[2897];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11789_.mp3
Wary? Why?;[];;[2900];[2898];k_hjuh_dialog;
I have never trusted Mandalorians. They drove my parents from Cathar, aided the Sith and attacked the Republic. Their warped notions of 'honor' may provoke them to do even more heinous acts.;[];;[2901];[2899, 2945, 2946];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11793_.mp3
I do not know why you tolerate his presence on your ship. In truth, he has had some merit so far, but I am not certain it is worth the risk you take.;[];;[2902, 2942, 2943];[2900];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11794_.mp3
Canderous has proven himself.;[];;[2903];[2901];k_hjuh_dialog;
His kind may prove to be a danger to the galaxy again, but this man himself has proven acceptable so far. Merely keep your distance from him and watch him, so that he does not betray us.;[];;[2904, 2936, 2938, 2940];[2902, 2942, 2944];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11799_.mp3
Have you spoken to him?;[];;[2905];[2903];k_hjuh_dialog;
Spoken to him? No! No, I could not.;[];;[2906];[2904];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11801_.mp3
Mandalorians are vicious of temper and easily provoked. I... I would not want to tempt his wrath.;[];;[2907, 2930, 2935];[2905, 2937, 2939, 2941];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11802_.mp3
What?? Aren't the Cathar such fierce warriors?;[];;[2908];[2906];k_hjuh_dialog;
I am not a coward! I fear no one and nothing! But you have not had to flee the destruction of your homeworld either, human.;[];;[2909];[2907, 2933, 2934, 2935];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11831_.mp3
The Mandalorians came and overran my world, they slaughtered my race... I cannot forget what they have done. Or forgive.;[];;[2910, 2923, 2926];[2908, 2932, 2948];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11807_.mp3
Hatred and fear lead to the dark side, Juhani.;[];;[2911];[2909];k_hjuh_dialog;
You are right, of course. You always seem to know what you speak of.;[];;[2912];[2910];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11809_.mp3
This simmering anger and hatred for the Mandalores seems to have found a place in my heart, though. Sometimes, I worry...;[];;[2913, 2920, 2922];[2911, 2925, 2928, 2929];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11817_.mp3
About what?;[];;[2914];[2912];k_hjuh_dialog;
That I may fall to the dark side once again. That I may threaten you, the Republic... the entire galaxy.;[];;[2915];[2913];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11819_.mp3
If... If that time does come. And if i do threaten our task. It is only right that you should strike me down.;[];;[2916, 2919];[2914, 2921];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11820_.mp3
Should that time come again, I would rather no one else do it than the one who redeemed me in the first place.;[];;[2917];[2915, 2922];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11824_.mp3
But we are becoming too morbid too soon. We should not talk like this now. There is much yet we can do.;[];;[2918];[2916, 2919];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11826_.mp3
But we shall talk later I am sure.;[];;[];[2917];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11827_.mp3
If I fall and endanger you and the galaxy you must do what is right. If my death will defeat Malak, then that is what must be done.;[];;[2917];[2915, 2922];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11825_.mp3
You should not worry. You can over your anger.;[];;[2921];[2912];k_hjuh_dialog;
But still it eats away at me. I worry that I may yet again fall and endanger everything that I hold dear.;[];;[2915];[2920];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11822_.mp3
I may be forced to strike you down, should you fall.;[];;[2916, 2919];[2912];k_hjuh_dialog;
I think you will come to trust him in time.;[];;[2924];[2909];k_hjuh_dialog;
Maybe. Maybe not. I cannot forgive them for what they have done to me and my people.;[];;[2925];[2923];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11811_.mp3
In time Canderous may prove himself. But it will not be easy.;[];;[2912];[2924];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11812_.mp3
I would not let him harm you, Juhani.;[];;[2927];[2909];k_hjuh_dialog;
I can take care of myself! I do not need you to patronize me!;[];;[2928, 2929];[2926];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11814_.mp3
But... I thank you for your kind words. It is hard being alone all the time. To be accepted and welcomed is... flattering.;[];;[2912];[2927];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11815_.mp3
But it is gratifying to know that you value me as a companion that much.;[];;[2912];[2927];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11816_.mp3
A wise decision. We do not need internal conflict.;[];;[2931];[2906];k_hjuh_dialog;
I am sorry. It is just that I cannot stand to be around him for very long. I suppose I do not really dislike him, it is just...;[];;[2932, 2933, 2934];[2930];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11805_.mp3
Just?;[];;[2909];[2931];k_hjuh_dialog;
You are afraid?;[];;[2908];[2931];k_hjuh_dialog;
Just... that you are a coward. Why deny it?;[];;[2908];[2931];k_hjuh_dialog;
A cowardly, but rational choice.;[];;[2908];[2906];k_hjuh_dialog;
Should I speak to him?;[];;[2937];[2903];k_hjuh_dialog;
Speak to him? No, no!;[];;[2906];[2936];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11833_.mp3
Do not become paranoid, Juhani.;[];;[2939];[2903];k_hjuh_dialog;
I am not paranoid! My suspicions are justified. I dare not speak about it around him, though.;[];;[2906];[2938];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11835_.mp3
Fear and hate are lures of the dark side.;[];;[2941];[2903];k_hjuh_dialog;
That is true. But also I know his kind. This man he may be different, but...;[];;[2906];[2940];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11837_.mp3
You should not judge Canderous by other Mandalorians.;[];;[2903];[2901];k_hjuh_dialog;
Perhaps we will have to eliminate him, then.;[];;[2944];[2901];k_hjuh_dialog;
Eliminate? What? I never proposed to murder the man!;[];;[2903];[2943];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11798_.mp3
He has proven himself well.;[];;[2900];[2898];k_hjuh_dialog;
I am suspicious as well.;[];;[2900];[2898];k_hjuh_dialog;
You're delusional.;[];;[2948];[2898];k_hjuh_dialog;
I am not! They are not to be trusted! They are brutes and savages and destroyers of worlds!;[];;[2909];[2947];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11839_.mp3
Nothing for now. Perhaps later.;[];;[2950];[2553, 2958, 2551];k_hjuh_dialog;
Of course. If there is anything else, I am here to help.;[];;[];[2949];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11841_.mp3
What do you know about this world?;[];;[2952, 2959, 2972, 2974, 2980, 2984];[2551, 3204];k_hjuh_dialog;
Dantooine? Dantooine has been my home for a number of years, ever since I started my training with the Jedi.;[]; dantooine;[2953];[2951];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11397_.mp3
It is a lightly populated planet, mostly focused on agriculture and hunting of the wild beasts that roam its plains.;[];;[2954];[2952];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11398_.mp3
The most populous form of animals on its surface are the iriaz, herd beasts that are normally quite tame, but can be violent when provoked, and the kath hounds, vicious pack predators.;[];;[2955];[2953];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11399_.mp3
Kath hounds do not normally attack people except when it is a pack of them ambushing a lone individual. But recently they have been much more aggressive.;[];;[2956];[2954];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11400_.mp3
I am to blame for that, I believe.;[];;[2957];[2955];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11401_.mp3
But enough of my self-recrimination, I should not dwell on the past, but rather look to the future.;[];;[2958];[2956];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11402_.mp3
How may I be of further assistance to you, Padawan?;[];;[2552, 2949];[2957, 2969, 2973, 2979, 2983, 2988];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11403_.mp3
Manaan is a water-rich world... as you may have been able to tell.;[]; manaan;[2960];[2951];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11404_.mp3
With the exception of this Ahto city, there is no land on the world protruding above sea-level.;[];;[2961];[2959];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11405_.mp3
The dominant indigenous race of the world are the Selkath, a semi-aquatic bipedal species. They are known to be very dreary and strong proponents of the power of law above all else.;[];;[2962];[2960];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11406_.mp3
The extremist policies of the Sith seem to appeal to them. They have declared themselves neutral in this conflict between the Republic and the Sith.;[];;[2963, 2970, 2971];[2961];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11407_.mp3
Neutral? Can they not see the Sith are evil?;[];;[2964];[2962];k_hjuh_dialog;
The Selkath seek to preserve their independence by maintaining a stranglehold on the one unique resource of their world: the vulnerary liquid Kolto. The most powerful curative in the galaxy.;[];;[2965];[2963, 2970, 2971];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11409_.mp3
As the only world in the galaxy that produces Kolto, they have positioned themselves between the Sith and the Republic, supplying both sides with the medicine equally.;[];;[2966];[2964];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11410_.mp3
They hope in this way to make themselves too valuable to both to be conquered. As a last resort, they have made it clear to both sides that any attempt to attack their world will force them to destroy the Kolto supply entirely.;[];;[2967];[2965];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11411_.mp3
Any violation by either the Republic or the Sith of their sacrosanct laws incurs severe Kolto export restrictions on the violating government.;[];;[2968];[2966];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11412_.mp3
Both the Republic and the Sith try to keep the Selkath happy and give them no cause to complain. But I wonder how the Sith can take this affront to their power in stride...;[];;[2969];[2967];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11413_.mp3
Many people speak highly of the integrity of the Selkath people... but from what little I have seen of them, they are disgusting little fish-people. But I suppose I just have too high standards.;[];;[2958];[2968];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11414_.mp3
The Sith seem to have all the advantages.;[];;[2964];[2962];k_hjuh_dialog;
Yeah, well evil always wins in the end anyway.;[];;[2964];[2962];k_hjuh_dialog;
I am sorry, but I do not know anything about this place. It truly is an unknown world to me. I would be surprised if anyone at all in the Republic knew of it.;[]; unknown world;[2973];[2951];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11417_.mp3
We should be on our guard at all times.;[];;[2958];[2972];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11418_.mp3
Korriban, I have heard, is a mysterious world. It is rumored to hold many ancient ruins of a purpose that none have been able to discover.;[]; korriban;[2975];[2951];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11419_.mp3
There are also tales of strange ghosts and monsters haunting the ruins, whispering in the ears of all who would listen and driving them mad.;[];;[2976];[2974];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11420_.mp3
The Jedi are not welcome here, however, so we cannot determine the truth that may lie in these rumors.;[];;[2977];[2975];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11421_.mp3
Korriban remains staunchly outside the Republic, and we suspect that the Sith may have spread their influence here as well. The large Czerka Corporation outpost also points towards that.;[];;[2978];[2976];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11422_.mp3
If the Czerka Corp. is the industrial arms of the Sith Empire, then judging by the size of their facilities here, this may be a very dangerous world indeed.;[];;[2979];[2977];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11423_.mp3
We must watch ourselves closely here.;[];;[2958];[2978];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11424_.mp3
Tatooine is a filthy desert. Planets such as this should not be fit for life at all. My skin itches just to be here.;[]; tatooine;[2981];[2951];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11425_.mp3
As you can see, it is a desert. Very little water. Too much sand. This sort of place attracts too much of the seedier side of civilization.;[];;[2982];[2980];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11426_.mp3
As to the particulars of this world itself, I can safely say that it holds no interest for me, and I will be well pleased when we leave here and never return.;[];;[2983];[2981];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11427_.mp3
Now is there something else, or may we hurry and do what we have to do here as quickly as possible?;[];;[2958];[2982];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11428_.mp3
I have heard of this world... Kashyyyk. It is a place of giant trees that have overgrown the entire world, blanketing it in greenery.;[]; kashyyyk;[2985];[2951];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11429_.mp3
But while it is beautiful to behold at times, it can also be quite deadly. Many creatures and predators lurk in the leaves and branches. Some small, some undoubtedly quite large.;[];;[2986];[2984];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11430_.mp3
I have heard that the bottom layers of the trees have never been seen by a living being who returned to tell of it, and that travelling there is certain death. I do not envy any who go there.;[];;[2987];[2985];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11431_.mp3
It is most odd that Revan came here, but perhaps in the vast canopy of one of these trees we may find another piece of the Star Map.;[];;[2988];[2986];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11432_.mp3
I have heard of no indigenous race that inhabits this world, but I must profess my ignorance, since I have only heard its name in passing.;[];;[2958];[2987];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11433_.mp3
I was wondering if you could help me with our stowaway problem.;[];;[2990];[2551];k_hjuh_dialog;
I do not know how to help you with that, I am sorry.;[];;[];[2989, 2991];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11842_.mp3
Do you know if anything can be done about all these gizka?;[];;[2990];[2551];k_hjuh_dialog;
[Don't speak to her.];[];;[2993];[2549];k_hjuh_dialog;
[You decide to ignore Juhani and continue on with your quest for now, though you might want to speak with her later.];[];;[];[2992];k_hjuh_dialog;
There is no time to talk now. Our priority is to find what caused this disturbance in the Force. It is close by, I know that much.;[];;[];[None];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11000_.mp3
How... how can you possibly be Revan?;[];p8  if the player approaches juhani after learning he is revan;[2996, 2997, 3015];[None];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11021_.mp3
The one... the Jedi whose troops saved me on Taris... It was Revan, leading an army out to defeat the Mandalorians. It was you...;[]; if the player has not already heard her talk about him being revan;[2997, 3015];[2995];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11022_.mp3
You are nothing like the one who saved me on Taris.;[]; if the player is darkside;[2998, 3013, 3014];[2996, 2995];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11023_.mp3
I am who I am, Juhani.;[];;[2999];[2997];k_hjuh_dialog;
You are obviously not who I thought you were, once upon a time.;[];;[3000];[2998, 3013, 3014];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11025_.mp3
I thought you were the ideal Jedi. I thought you would never turn against us. Yet here you are.;[];;[3001, 3011, 3012];[2999];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11026_.mp3
Here I am.;[];;[3002];[3000];k_hjuh_dialog;
You did turn in the end. I did not want to believe it. But now I suppose you have a chance to redeem yourself.;[];;[3003];[3001, 3011, 3012];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11028_.mp3
You can work with us. For the Republic. For the Order. We can set right what you started so long ago.;[];;[3004, 3007, 3009];[3002];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11029_.mp3
We shall see.;[];;[3005];[3003];k_hjuh_dialog;
Yes we shall. I only hope that you will see this through until the end.;[];;[3006];[3004];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11031_.mp3
Time will tell what choices you make. I shall stay by you to see this task done.;[];;[];[3005, 3008, 3010];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11032_.mp3
I will do what is necessary.;[];;[3008];[3003];k_hjuh_dialog;
And I hope that what you see as necessary is what we originally set out to do.;[];;[3006];[3007];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11034_.mp3
I work for myself!;[];;[3010];[3003];k_hjuh_dialog;
Only through serving the Republic do you serve yourself as well. In defeating Malak you save all of us along with you.;[];;[3006];[3009];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11036_.mp3
I do not make excuses for my actions.;[];;[3002];[3000];k_hjuh_dialog;
I AM the ideal Jedi.;[];;[3002];[3000];k_hjuh_dialog;
You know nothing of me!;[];;[2999];[2997];k_hjuh_dialog;
People change.;[];;[2999];[2997];k_hjuh_dialog;
I knew when I heard that you had become the Dark Lord of the Sith that something was wrong with it.;[]; if the player is lightside;[3016, 3030, 3033];[2996, 2995];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11041_.mp3
The man who saved me could never go completely to the dark side.;[]; if player is male;[3017, 3028, 3029];[3015];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11042_.mp3
I regret any of the harm I may have caused.;[];;[3018];[3016, 3030, 3033];k_hjuh_dialog;
It is good to know that you have truly changed. It gives me hope.;[];;[3019];[3017, 3028, 3029, 3031, 3032];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11050_.mp3
I do not think now that I will fall to the dark side. I only have to look to you and follow by your example and there is no way I can fail.;[];;[3020, 3023, 3026];[3018];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11051_.mp3
Overconfidence can also lead to the dark side.;[];;[3021];[3019];k_hjuh_dialog;
Yes. That is true. I suppose you would know better than I.;[];;[3022];[3020];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11053_.mp3
I will never forget what you did for me, even if you do not remember it.;[];;[];[3021, 3024, 3025, 3027];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11056_.mp3
You will do fine, Juhani.;[];;[3024, 3025];[3019];k_hjuh_dialog;
Thank you for placing your confidence in me. I only wish I had your heart as well...;[]; female romance inactive;[3022];[3023];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11055_.mp3
That is especially meaningful coming from you.;[];;[3022];[3023];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11057_.mp3
You flatter me...;[];;[3027];[3019];k_hjuh_dialog;
I... I am sorry, I did not realize. I will endeavor to be more considerate in the future.;[];;[3022];[3026];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11059_.mp3
I do not know who that Revan was. I am not him.;[];;[3018];[3016];k_hjuh_dialog;
Perhaps he had his reasons. But I do not.;[];;[3018];[3016];k_hjuh_dialog;
The woman who saved me, who I... I have come to care for, could never go completely to the dark side.;[]; if player is female, and has not rejected her;[3017, 3031, 3032];[3015];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11046_.mp3
I do not know who that Revan was. I am not her.;[];;[3018];[3030, 3033];k_hjuh_dialog;
Perhaps she had her reasons. But I do not.;[];;[3018];[3030, 3033];k_hjuh_dialog;
The woman who saved me, who I... who I have come to admire, could never go completely to the dark side.;[]; if player is female and has rejected her;[3017, 3031, 3032];[3015];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11047_.mp3
This may be the last time I will have a chance to talk to you...;[];p9  when the player is going to the star forge;[3035, 3058];[None];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11060_.mp3
I just want you to know that I... that I...;[]; player is female and has the romance activated.;[3036, 3053, 3055];[3034];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11061_.mp3
... Yes?;[];;[3037];[3035];k_hjuh_dialog;
I... I... I care for you. I do not know why. I do not know if anything will be possible or if you even return what I feel, but I do know it is there.;[];;[3038];[3036, 3054];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11063_.mp3
I am sorry if this upsets you. I am so sorry if I am wrong, but I cannot deny what it is that I feel.;[];;[3039, 3047, 3051];[3037];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11064_.mp3
I feel the same way, Juhani.;[];;[3040];[3038];k_hjuh_dialog;
Now that I have put myself in this position, I know not what to say.;[];;[3041, 3045, 3046];[3039];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11066_.mp3
You do not have to say anything.;[];;[3042];[3040];k_hjuh_dialog;
Yes. I thank you.;[];;[3043];[3041, 3045, 3046];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11068_.mp3
But as much as I may care for you, and you for me, first we must deal with Malak.;[];;[3044];[3042];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11071_.mp3
After there will be time to sort things out between us.;[];;[];[3043];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11072_.mp3
Er... 'Thank you'?;[];;[3042];[3040];k_hjuh_dialog;
We have gone past words.;[];;[3042];[3040];k_hjuh_dialog;
I am sorry, I cannot return your affection.;[];;[3048];[3038];k_hjuh_dialog;
I... I understand. You have someone somewhere... or I just do not seem to appeal to you.;[];;[3049];[3047];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11075_.mp3
I am sorry for pushing myself on you. I apologize for my actions.;[];;[3050];[3048, 3052];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11076_.mp3
I suggest we find and confront Malak as soon as possible to remove the threat to the Republic once and for all.;[];;[];[3049];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11077_.mp3
Are you sure this is the time for this?;[];;[3052];[3038];k_hjuh_dialog;
I was afraid that I would have no more time to say it... I wonder if all of us wil survive what we must do...;[];;[3049];[3051];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11079_.mp3
You do not need to say it, Juhani.;[];;[3054];[3035];k_hjuh_dialog;
But I feel I must. I have never said this before...;[];;[3037];[3053];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11081_.mp3
Please stop. Now.;[];;[3056];[3035];k_hjuh_dialog;
Of.. Of course. I am sorry. I should have known better.;[];;[3057];[3055];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11083_.mp3
I can only say that if I am going to die, as we stand likely to, I am glad that it will be you beside whom I do it.;[];;[];[3056];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11084_.mp3

Do not underestimate the Sith.;[];;[3068];[3063];k_hjuh_dialog;

I need you to help me, Juhani.;[];;[3070];[3058];k_hjuh_dialog;
I will help you in any way I can.;[];;[3063];[3069];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11097_.mp3
You have proved your worth many times over.;[];;[3060];[3058];k_hjuh_dialog;
So here we are... in the belly of the beast.;[];p7  when the player talks to juhani on the leviathan;[3073, 3105, 3107];[None];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11099_.mp3
What is wrong?;[];;[3074];[3072];k_hjuh_dialog;
Here we are in a Sith Interdicter loaded with troops and Sith Jedi, and you wonder at my apprehension?;[];;[3075];[3073];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11101_.mp3

The choices I have made were necessary;[];;[3078];[3076];k_hjuh_dialog;
I wonder if that is true. For your sake, I hope that it is.;[];;[3079];[3077];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11105_.mp3
But you have also fallen far from the ideals of the Jedi Order. Can you still do what is required of you?;[];;[3080, 3090, 3091];[3078, 3093, 3094, 3096];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11111_.mp3
I WILL defeat Malak!;[];;[3081];[3079];k_hjuh_dialog;
Your conviction is... compelling. But also disturbing.;[];;[3082];[3080, 3091];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11113_.mp3

We will have time.;[];;[3086];[3084];k_hjuh_dialog;
It is too late to do anything now. We must do what we can to escape from here.;[];;[3087];[3085, 3088];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11126_.mp3
When we have left, perhaps then we can see what the future holds for us.;[];;[];[3086];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11127_.mp3
You are making me uncomfortable...;[];;[3086];[3084];k_hjuh_dialog;
But there is enough to worry about without my making it worse. Perhaps we can speak more of this later, once we leave this ship.;[];;[];[3083];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11117_.mp3
When I get out of here, I will hunt Malak down like a dog.;[];;[3082];[3079];k_hjuh_dialog;
I can do anything. Starting with destroying this ship.;[];;[3081];[3079];k_hjuh_dialog;
I do not need you to judge me.;[];;[3093, 3094];[3076];k_hjuh_dialog;

If you will not listen to me, then to who? I admire you greatly, and respect your abilities...;[];;[3079];[3092];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11108_.mp3
We will have all the time in the world, Juhani.;[];;[3096];[3076];k_hjuh_dialog;
I hope that is true. Truly, I do.;[];;[3079];[3095];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11110_.mp3

Do not worry, Juhani. We will escape.;[];;[3099];[3097];k_hjuh_dialog;
I do not favor our chances at all. But if you believe that we can... then maybe there is a possibility.;[];;[3100];[3098];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11121_.mp3
Live or die, I shall stand by you as you need me.;[];;[3084, 3101];[3099, 3102];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11122_.mp3
Let us leave this place then... If we can.;[];;[];[3100, 3104];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11133_.mp3
And I am glad to have had you by my side.;[];;[3084, 3100];[3097];k_hjuh_dialog;
Less talk, more escaping.;[];;[3104];[3097];k_hjuh_dialog;
Yes. Yes, we should. Your focus on your work does you credit.;[];;[3084, 3101];[3103];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11132_.mp3
Do not worry, we will escape.;[];;[3106];[3072];k_hjuh_dialog;
We are in a Sith Interdicter loaded with troops and Sith Jedi. I am not favoring of our chances.;[];;[3075];[3105];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11135_.mp3
I will not let them take me.;[];;[3108];[3072];k_hjuh_dialog;
How... reassuring. I, though, would not have liked to die quite so soon.;[];;[3075];[3107];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11137_.mp3
I feel I must apologize for the way I acted towards you before, in the grove. It was wrong of me.;[];s1  the first time the player talks to juhani after her becoming a party member;[3110, 3121, 3122];[None];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11001_.mp3

I am sorry for attacking you. I am sorry for thinking you would only try to kill me.;[];;[3112];[3110, 3121];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11004_.mp3
I hope that by helping you in your task I may redeem myself in your eyes... and in my own.;[];;[3113, 3116, 3118];[3111, 3125];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11005_.mp3
Do not worry, Juhani. I forgive you.;[];;[3114];[3112];k_hjuh_dialog;
Thank you... It is most reassuring to know that you can forgive me, even though I tried to take your life.;[];;[3115];[3113];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11007_.mp3
I can only hope that, in our time journeying together, I will succeed.;[];;[];[3114, 3117];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11010_.mp3
I think it's going to take a lot for that to happen.;[];;[3117];[3112];k_hjuh_dialog;
It may. But I am prepared to do what it takes.;[];;[3115];[3116];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11009_.mp3
Ha! Unlikely.;[];;[3119];[3112];k_hjuh_dialog;
You mock me! I will do what it takes to redeem myself in the eyes of my peers. I WILL succeed!;[];;[3120];[3118];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11012_.mp3
I will prove myself to you and to everyone! I will be a faithful companion to you and Bastila as long as our journey may last.;[];;[];[3119];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11013_.mp3
Damn right! Apologize!;[];;[3111];[3109];k_hjuh_dialog;
Next time you try something like that, I'll kill you.;[];;[3123];[3109];k_hjuh_dialog;
I realize you have justification, but that anger only leads to the dark side. Please do not fall into the same trap that caught me.;[];;[3124, 3126, 3128];[3122];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11015_.mp3
I am not as weak as you, Juhani.;[];;[3125];[3123];k_hjuh_dialog;
The dark side is most devious and deceptive. It can find the smallest weakness to exploit.;[];;[3112];[3124, 3127];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11017_.mp3
The dark side will not take me! I am too strong!;[];;[3127];[3123];k_hjuh_dialog;
I thought that too. But I was wrong...;[];;[3125];[3126, 3128];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11019_.mp3
Have no fear, I recognize the danger.;[];;[3127];[3123];k_hjuh_dialog;
My Cathar blood seethes at the thought of that man still running free. I cannot stand still while I think about it, but... but I will not give in to the dark side either.;[];;[3130];[None];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11138_.mp3
He will pay for his crimes, though. He will most likely be following us... me. If we could find him first, then he may not be able to set in motion whatever he has in store for us.;[];;[];[3129];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11139_.mp3
That man was a beast! A monster! I am glad that the galaxy is now rid of him, so that he may not harm others again.;[];;[3132];[None];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11140_.mp3
I do regret, though, that he did not die by my hand...;[];;[3133, 3137, 3138];[3131];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11141_.mp3
It would have been wrong.;[];;[3134];[3132];k_hjuh_dialog;
I know. But must I always fear the lure of the dark side?;[];;[3135];[3133, 3137];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11143_.mp3
But... it was for the best. I am glad that you stood by my side during this.;[];;[3136];[3134, 3140];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11144_.mp3
We should continue our journeys now. No reason for staying here for this.;[];;[];[3135];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11145_.mp3
What you did was best.;[];;[3134];[3132];k_hjuh_dialog;
You weren't strong enough to do it.;[];;[3139];[3132];k_hjuh_dialog;
I... I do not know anymore what I am strong enough for. I only take what comes to me and hope that I can handle it.;[];;[3140];[3138];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11148_.mp3
The lure of the dark side will always be my strongest foe. I should have killed him.;[];;[3135];[3139];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11149_.mp3

You couldn't help it.;[];;[3143];[3141];k_hjuh_dialog;
But I could have! I should have...;[];;[3144];[3142];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11152_.mp3
I must try harder in the future to resist the call of the dark side. I suppose I am fortunate that, in this case, he was deserving of such an end.;[];;[3145];[3143];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11153_.mp3
We should continue on our way. I do not want to linger around here anymore.;[];;[];[3144, 3147, 3151];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11156_.mp3
At least you regret it.;[];;[3147];[3141];k_hjuh_dialog;
Yes... Yes I do. I must try harder in the future to resist such urges. I suppose I am fortunate that, in this case, he was deserving of such an end.;[];;[3145];[3146];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11155_.mp3
You did the right thing.;[];;[3149];[3141];k_hjuh_dialog;
No I didn't. I let my anger and passion consume me and did something rash. Something which leads me down the path to the dark side.;[];;[3150];[3148];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11158_.mp3
But... I recognize this, and I am truly regretful that I committed this act. I shall not let it happen again.;[];;[3151];[3149];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11159_.mp3
I suppose I was fortunate that, in this case, he was deserving of such an end.;[];;[3145];[3150];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11160_.mp3

When we met it was you that convinced me to turn away from the lure of the dark side. But now it seems that you are falling into the trap that had caught me.;[];;[2719, 3154, 3176];[3152];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11162_.mp3
Wha... ?;[];;[3155];[3153];k_hjuh_dialog;
No. Please. I must speak.;[];;[3156];[3154, 3176];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11164_.mp3
When we first met I looked at you with contempt. You were some insect sent by the Jedi Council to eliminate me.;[];;[3157];[3155];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11165_.mp3
But you were more powerful than I would ever have thought. It seemed so easy for you to overcome me.;[];;[3158, 3171, 3174];[3156];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11166_.mp3
You were more of a challenge than you think.;[];;[3159, 3160];[3157];k_hjuh_dialog;
I think that you flatter me again, and I do not know why. I worry for you.;[];;[3160];[3158];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11168_.mp3
I look and I see you turning away from the Code of the Jedi. I wonder if you can see it.;[];;[3161];[3159, 3158];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11169_.mp3
I... I do not know... I fear that you may be starting to fall.;[];;[3162, 3163];[3160, 3173, 3175];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11175_.mp3
If only there were some way I could turn you away from the path that you seem to be headed down...;[];;[3163];[3161];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11176_.mp3

We each make our own choices, Juhani.;[];;[3165];[3163];k_hjuh_dialog;
That is true. But still I worry about the ones you make.;[];;[3166];[3164];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11179_.mp3
But I have faith in you. I would follow you into battle with Malak himself. I will stand by your side.;[];;[];[3165, 3168, 3170];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11180_.mp3
No, of course not.;[];;[3168];[3163];k_hjuh_dialog;
I wish I could believe that as you do.;[];;[3166];[3167];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11182_.mp3
You overestimate your effect on me.;[];;[3170];[3163];k_hjuh_dialog;
Maybe I do. I have had reason to wonder recently if I have had any effect at all...;[];;[3166];[3169];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11184_.mp3
My mission was only to cleanse the grove.;[];;[3172];[3157];k_hjuh_dialog;
That you did. You took away the dark taint that had been consuming me and restored me to the light. You took me away from there.;[];;[3173];[3171];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11171_.mp3
But now... now I wonder what it is that you see in your own reflection.;[];;[3161];[3172];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11172_.mp3
Yes, it was.;[];;[3175];[3157];k_hjuh_dialog;
And this is just the problem! You seem to revel in your power, use it far too frequently for your own gain.;[];;[3161];[3174];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11174_.mp3

Ashamed?;[];;[3180];[3178];k_hjuh_dialog;
That I had so easily fallen to the dark side. That I could convince myself that by injuring my master I became a great force of evil in the galaxy.;[];;[3181];[3179, 3189, 3191];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11190_.mp3
For my pride, my hubris. For the inner rage that all of my species feels. Sometimes I wish that I had not been born this way...;[];;[3182, 3186, 3187];[3180];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11191_.mp3
You should not think that way.;[];;[3183];[3181];k_hjuh_dialog;
I am sorry. I start to talk thinking about how you stay strong to the path of virtue and justice, and I find myself whining again about my own inadequacies.;[];;[3184];[3182, 3186, 3187];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11193_.mp3

You have nothing to be ashamed of.;[];;[3183];[3181];k_hjuh_dialog;
You cannot change how you were born.;[];;[3183];[3181];k_hjuh_dialog;
You should not be so hard on yourself.;[];;[3189];[3178];k_hjuh_dialog;
But I have so little to show when I compare myself to you... and that makes my shame even worse...;[];;[3180];[3188];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11199_.mp3
I am not so great as that.;[];;[3191];[3178];k_hjuh_dialog;
Your power in the Force is strong, and I can sense no taint of the dark side in you. That makes my shame even worse...;[];;[3180];[3190];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11201_.mp3

But similar enough. We have had many of the same sort of experiences.;[];;[3195];[3193];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11213_.mp3
I know how hard it was for me to resist the call of the dark side, and I know that you have suffered those pains as well.;[];;[3196];[3194, 3203];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11204_.mp3
The continual struggle between restraint and freedom... light and darkness. It is hard for me with my Cathar blood to resist sometimes.;[];;[3197, 3200, 3201];[3195];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11205_.mp3
You must not fall to the dark side again, Juhani.;[];;[3198];[3196];k_hjuh_dialog;
I do resist. I look to you and see that we are in this together, and that you are resisting as well. That gives me strength.;[];;[3199];[3197, 3200, 3201];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11207_.mp3

I... I know... I suppose I realized that.;[];;[3220];[3218, 3229];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11278_.mp3

You're right. I don't.;[];;[3225];[3220];k_hjuh_dialog;

The sacrifice of an entire world is too much for any cause! How would you feel if Dantooine or Alderaan or somesuch world were destroyed?;[];;[3237];[3235];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11297_.mp3
Would you be so callous then?;[];;[3211, 3238, 3240];[3236];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11298_.mp3
Well... yeah, probably.;[];;[3239];[3237];k_hjuh_dialog;
You... you animal! It is only because of the Council's will that I stay with you. But if you betray us, I may decide that falling to the dark side will be a small price to pay for letting my anger run loose.;[];;[];[3238, 3246];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11305_.mp3
I thought you hated your homeworld...;[];;[3241];[3237, 3234, 3210];k_hjuh_dialog;
It was my home!;[];;[3212];[3240];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11301_.mp3
I did not know the Sith would destroy Taris.;[];;[3243];[3234];k_hjuh_dialog;
What did you think would happen by aiding the Republic?;[];;[3212];[3242];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11295_.mp3
What are you saying?;[];;[3210];[3208, 3248];k_hjuh_dialog;
*Yawn*;[];;[3246];[3208, 3248];k_hjuh_dialog;
Taris! It was Taris that the Sith destroyed to try to kill you and your precious Bastila! Taris, my homeworld! Not that you care!;[];;[3239];[3245];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11304_.mp3
You sure someone else can't help you?;[];;[3248];[3206];k_hjuh_dialog;
Someone else is not responsible for wiping out my homeworld by their actions. But who cares if it is because of you that everyone I have ever known off Dantooine is dead!;[];;[3209, 3244, 3245];[3247];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11307_.mp3
I was remembering Taris...;[];h4  when the player asks what is wrong;[3250, 3282, 3283];[3205];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11309_.mp3
I am sorry, Juhani.;[];;[3251];[3249];k_hjuh_dialog;
No, it is alright. I think I am over the worst of it. I apologize again for lashing out at you. It was not your fault.;[];;[3252];[3250];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11311_.mp3
It was a horrible place to have to live. At least in the lower cities where the non-humans tended to get relegated.;[];;[3253];[3251, 3282];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11313_.mp3
Living for years in a place with no sun, living off the trash dropped from the upper levels, and the meager pay doing back-breaking labor.;[];;[3254, 3277, 3278, 3279];[3252];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11314_.mp3
And those rakghouls...;[];;[3255];[3253];k_hjuh_dialog;
There was always the danger of rakghouls coming up from the sewers, or more mundane predators living and working in the area.;[];;[3256];[3254, 3278, 3281];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11316_.mp3
My family and I struggled each and every day to make something of our lives, but we could only go so far.;[];;[3257];[3255, 3277];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11317_.mp3
Taxes from the corrupt government, more fees from the gangs controlling the streets, and whatever was left paying for what food and medical supplies we could afford.;[];;[2620, 3258, 3274];[3256];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11318_.mp3
No one would help you?;[];;[3259];[3257];k_hjuh_dialog;
And of course there was the constant bigotry and hate from the more affluent and human citizens. Lording their wealth over us living below.;[];;[3260];[3258, 3276];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11321_.mp3
Every once in a while a rich human would come down through the lower levels with his droid entourage just to see how the 'wildlife' lived... and laughed at the mockeries that were our successes.;[];;[3261];[3259];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11322_.mp3
But I have come to meet many decent humans in my travels since those days. Indeed, some of the greatest people I have ever met are human.;[];;[3262, 3271, 3272];[3260];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11323_.mp3
Like who?;[];;[3263];[3261];k_hjuh_dialog;
The... the Jedi who encouraged me to join the Order, the one who was with the group going to fight the Mandalorians, she was human.;[];;[3264, 3265];[3262, 3271, 3273];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11325_.mp3
I... I suppose I see something of her in you when I look...;[];;[3265];[3263];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11326_.mp3
I am sorry... I am getting away from my point. If there even was one...;[];;[3266];[3264, 3263];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11327_.mp3
Sometimes I curse the day my parents fled to Taris. But then again, if they had not, I would not be where I am today.;[];;[3267, 3269, 3270];[3265];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11328_.mp3
Your parents?;[];;[3268];[3266];k_hjuh_dialog;
Another story for another time. For now we must continue our own epic: To save the galaxy, if we can.;[];;[];[3267, 3269, 3270];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11330_.mp3
Fled? Fled from where?;[];;[3268];[3266];k_hjuh_dialog;
And how did you arrive on Dantooine?;[];;[3268];[3266];k_hjuh_dialog;
One of the Jedi you met?;[];;[3263];[3261];k_hjuh_dialog;
Decent humans are hard to find.;[];;[3273];[3261];k_hjuh_dialog;
I have noticed that. But the Jedi order seems to have collected a fair number.;[];;[3263];[3272];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11336_.mp3
How could such a government last?;[];;[3275];[3257];k_hjuh_dialog;
It did not. But only because of the Jedi who came. It was very bad.;[];;[3276];[3274];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11339_.mp3
With no money to spare for any amenities, even the Enclave on Dantooine seems a paradise in comparison.;[];;[3259];[3275];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11320_.mp3
How did you survive?;[];;[3256];[3253];k_hjuh_dialog;
That's horrible!;[];;[3255];[3253];k_hjuh_dialog;
I do not remember seeing any of your race on Taris...;[];;[3280];[3253];k_hjuh_dialog;
There were none. Bad enough to be a race that is feared and hated by humans, but to be one that is strange and different even among non-humans?;[];;[3281];[3279];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11343_.mp3
But living was hard enough without the stigma of being from a lost race.;[];;[3255];[3280];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11344_.mp3
What about it?;[];;[3252];[3249];k_hjuh_dialog;
Not this again...;[];;[3284];[3249];k_hjuh_dialog;
You mock my pain! It was a horrible place to live... we had to go through hell every day just to survive, and you think it bothering me is an irritation?!;[];;[3285];[3283];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11346_.mp3
Your insensitivity speaks ill of your qualities as a Jedi. Still, as the Council ordered me to do, I shall accompany you, but expect no great sympathy for your plights.;[];;[];[3284];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11347_.mp3
I am thinking of what happened on Korriban...;[];p8  if the player asks juhani whats bothering her;[3287, 3314];[3205];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11348_.mp3
I am appalled at the things the Sith did there.;[]; if player did evil on korriban;[3288];[3286];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11349_.mp3
I cannot help but notice that your manner is increasingly like that of the Sith...;[];;[3289, 3311, 3313];[3287];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11350_.mp3
What I did was necessary.;[];;[3290];[3288];k_hjuh_dialog;
But I do not believe it was. We should have been able to find another way.;[];;[3291];[3289];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11352_.mp3
I should have helped you find another path. I should have tried harder to stop you.;[];;[3292, 3307, 3308];[3290, 3312];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11353_.mp3
This is war. We do not have time for niceties.;[];;[3293];[3291];k_hjuh_dialog;
And I am sure that is exactly the same justification that Malak and Revan used before they fell...;[];;[3294, 3305, 3306];[3292];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11355_.mp3
I am not Revan!;[];;[3295];[3293];k_hjuh_dialog;
Your overconfidence may yet be your downfall. I will still stand by your side, though.;[];;[3296, 3304];[3294, 3305, 3306];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11357_.mp3
I only wish that what I see meant more to you... that I could turn you back...;[]; female and romance not inactive;[3297];[3295];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11358_.mp3
Will you try? ... For me?;[];;[3298, 3301, 3302];[3296, 3310];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11359_.mp3
Get out of my face!;[];;[3299];[3297];k_hjuh_dialog;
I... see.;[];;[3300];[3298, 3301, 3307];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11362_.mp3
I will still stand by you, as I have said before. I can only hope that when the time comes, you will do what is right.;[];;[];[3299];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11363_.mp3
No. I am sorry.;[];;[3299];[3297];k_hjuh_dialog;
I will try, Juhani.;[];;[3303];[3297];k_hjuh_dialog;
Thank you. I am sure we can succeed together.;[];;[];[3302];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11365_.mp3
I can only hope that when the time comes, you will do what is right.;[];;[];[3295, 3309];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11366_.mp3
I will prove stronger than them!;[];;[3295];[3293];k_hjuh_dialog;
I recognize the danger.;[];;[3295];[3293];k_hjuh_dialog;
I tire of your criticism.;[];;[3299];[3291];k_hjuh_dialog;
Maybe I should have done differently.;[];;[3309];[3291];k_hjuh_dialog;
Maybe you should have... The fact that you think so gives me hope.;[];;[3304, 3310];[3308];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11371_.mp3
I hope that you will return to path of the Jedi... to me.;[];;[3297];[3309];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11372_.mp3
Who are you to criticize me?!;[];;[3312];[3288];k_hjuh_dialog;
I am your companion. I am a fellow Jedi. I only seek to ensure the success of our mission.;[];;[3291];[3311, 3313];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11374_.mp3
I'm in charge and I'll do what I want.;[];;[3312];[3288];k_hjuh_dialog;
To see such horrible, warped rituals that the Sith practice... It is unnerving.;[]; if player did not do evil on korriban;[3315];[3286];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11376_.mp3
"I can truly see now why we must defeat Malak as quickly as possible; to prevent that sort of society from consuming the entire galaxy.";[];;[3316];[3314];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11377_.mp3
It angers me to think of it.;[];;[3317, 3329, 3330];[3315];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11378_.mp3
Do not give in to your anger.;[];;[3318];[3316];k_hjuh_dialog;
Yes... yes, I understand: Do not let my passions and impulses rule me. Remain calm and serene.;[];;[3319];[3317, 3330];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11382_.mp3
But I fear that when I am confronted with these monsters I will lose myself.;[];;[3320];[3318, 3329];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11383_.mp3
I think that I may yet fall to the dark side by the very desire to fight it.;[];;[3321, 3327, 3328];[3319];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11384_.mp3
Now that's irony.;[];;[3322];[3320];k_hjuh_dialog;
Yes, it could be... if you look at it callously enough. But I cannot.;[];;[3323];[3321];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11386_.mp3
I know, I should not worry. I am grateful for your support in this matter.;[];;[3324, 3326];[3322, 3327, 3328];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11388_.mp3
It seems that whenever I have a problem I turn to you. Sometimes... sometimes I almost seem to want problems, just for the chance...;[];;[3325];[3323];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11389_.mp3
But I am sorry, I should not speak of this.;[];;[3326];[3324];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11390_.mp3
It is a relief to have someone to turn to when I am feeling uncertain.;[];;[];[3325, 3323];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11391_.mp3
Do not fear, Juhani.;[];;[3323];[3320];k_hjuh_dialog;
You should not keep worrying like this.;[];;[3323];[3320];k_hjuh_dialog;
It angers me as well.;[];;[3319];[3316];k_hjuh_dialog;
We are doing our job. Do not make it personal.;[];;[3318];[3316];k_hjuh_dialog;
Nothing right now. Maybe later.;[];;[3332];[3204];k_hjuh_dialog;
Of course. I will assist you as I am able.;[];;[];[3331];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11394_.mp3
I do not have the answer to your question.;[];;[];[None];k_hjuh_dialog;NM35AAJUHA11843_.mp3
A Jedi should not use the Force for personal gain. We are better than that.;[];;[];[None];k_hjuh_dialog;NGLOBEJUHA11851_.mp3
The dark side dwells in us all, but you cannot give in to your baser instincts like this!;[];;[];[None];k_hjuh_dialog;NGLOBEJUHA11852_.mp3
*whisper* You should treat your power with respect, not use the Force on a whim like it is some toy!;[];;[];[None];k_hjuh_dialog;NGLOBEJUHA11853_.mp3
*whisper* The Jedi should be protectors of the weak! You shame us all by your actions here.;[];;[];[None];k_hjuh_dialog;NM25AAHURT03072_.mp3
You are a representative of the Jedi Order. When you behave this way you disgrace us all!;[];;[];[None];k_hjuh_dialog;NM17AA05ME02071_.mp3
This is how we Jedi should always act: with honor.;[];;[];[None];k_hjuh_dialog;NM17AA03SH01167_.mp3
Zaerdra tells me you have the swoop engine accelerator. This is excellent news.;[];;[3341];[None];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02000_.mp3
I was beginning to wonder if you would make it. The race is tomorrow, and my mechanics need time to install the prototype into the swoop engine of our bike.;[];;[3342, 3360];[3340, 3443];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02133_.mp3
Okay, I lived up to my end of the deal. Now you better come through!;[];;[3343];[3341, 3362];tar11_gadon112;
Don't worry, I'm a man of my word. I promised you could ride in the swoop race under the Hidden Bek banner, and I'm still going to let you do that.;[];;[3344];[3342, 3363];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02135_.mp3
And I'm even going to go one better - I'm going to let you ride the swoop bike with the prototype accelerator installed on it. Without it, you won't stand a chance.;[];;[3345];[3343];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02137_.mp3
Gadon! You can't be serious! We need one of our best riders on that bike! We can't let some rookie take the prototype engine into the race!;[];;[3346, 3358, 3359];[3344];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02139_.mp3
Don't worry, Gadon - I'll win that race!;[];;[3347];[3345];tar11_gadon112;
"I have to be honest with you - there's a reason I'm letting you take the prototype engine. The accelerator isn't stable; there's a good chance it could explode during the race.";[];;[3348];[3346, 3358, 3359];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02141_.mp3
I can't ask one of my own riders to take the risk - they'll be running unmodified swoops in the race. You'll be the only one using the prototype.;[];;[3349];[3347];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02143_.mp3
If you can complete the track before the accelerator overheats then you'll win for the Beks. If you die, then one of my other riders could still come through for me.;[];;[3350, 3352, 3356];[3348];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02145_.mp3
Sounds like you've got all your bases covered.;[];;[3351];[3349, 3357];tar11_gadon112;
You don't get to be leader of a swoop gang if you don't know how to work all the angles.;[];;[3352, 3356];[3350];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02147_.mp3
Okay, I'm ready for the race.;[];;[3353];[3351, 3357, 3349];tar11_gadon112;
You can stay here tonight. The mechanics need time to install the accelerator on the engine, so you won't be able to practice your riding.;[];;[3354];[3352];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02149_.mp3
But I've got good instincts, and you have the look of a racer about you. Just try to relax and in the morning we'll take you to the swoop track.;[];;[3355];[3353];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02151_.mp3
[You spend a restless night in the Bek base. In the morning, one of the Beks takes you to the swoop racing pits, where only racers and mechanics are allowed to go.];[];;[];[3354];tar11_gadon112;
Suddenly I'm not so sure about this.;[];;[3357];[3351, 3349];tar11_gadon112;
Without that prototype you don't stand a chance of winning. And if you don't win you can't get Bastila back - none of the other riders will give her up. This is your only chance.;[];;[3350, 3352];[3356];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02154_.mp3
Why are you doing this, Gadon?;[];;[3347];[3345];tar11_gadon112;
Zaerdra's right, Gadon. One of your own riders should get that swoop bike.;[];;[3347];[3345];tar11_gadon112;
Not so fast, Gadon. I want a reward for recovering this.;[];;[3361];[3341];tar11_gadon112;
A reward? I'm blind, but I'm not stupid. Your reward is the chance to ride in the big swoop race so you can win Bastila's freedom.;[];;[3362];[3360];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02158_.mp3
We had a deal, so I expect you to honor it. If we don't honor our deals, what's to stop me from just taking the prototype from you and leaving you for dead?;[];;[3342, 3363];[3361];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02160_.mp3
Okay, I see your point.;[];;[3343];[3362];tar11_gadon112;
You'll have to forgive Zaerdra. Ever since Brejik and the Vulkars began this war against us, she's been a little over-zealous in her security duties.;[];Player can talk to Gadon and get information about Bastila. Gadon tells player to find the missing prototype and bring it back if they want to enter the swoop race. This sets Tar_MissLook to 1, which will activate the Mission triggers in the Undercity. When the player returns with the swoop engine the game will transition to the Bek cutscene before the swoop race.;[3365];[None];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02002_.mp3
The problems with the Sith haven't helped things. Zaerdra seems to forget that I know how to look after myself! Now, how can I help you?;[];;[3366, 3371, 3411, 3430, 3439];[3364];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02004_.mp3
You have problems with the Sith?;[];;[3367];[3365];tar11_gadon112;
A foreign army invades Taris, declares martial law and locks down all travel to and from the planet? You damn well bet I have a problem with that!;[];;[3368];[3366, 3429];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02006_.mp3
If the Sith ever moved in down here all the swoop gangs would unite against them. We'd use hit and run guerrilla tactics to pick them off... their casualties would be enormous!;[];;[3369, 3370];[3367];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02008_.mp3
Don't fool yourself. The Sith would never commit to that kind of operation. They'd... they'd probably do something much more grand and deadly.;[];;[3370];[3368];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02010_.mp3
But so far the Sith have stayed out of the Lower City and our strength is wasted on this stupid gang war! I tried to explain this to Brejik, but he and his Vulkars won't listen.;[];;[3371, 3411, 3430, 3439];[3369, 3368];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02012_.mp3
I need information on those Republic escape pods that crashed in the Undercity.;[];;[3372];[3370, 3427, 3365, 3469];tar11_gadon112;
The escape pods? You know, I heard the Sith have been asking around the Upper City about them as well... but you don't look like you're with the Sith.;[];;[3373];[3371];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02014_.mp3
They might be spies, Gadon! They might be working for the Sith!;[];;[3374, 3463];[3372];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02016_.mp3
Calm down, Zaerdra. If the Sith thought we knew anything useful they'd have a battalion of troops kicking down our door. No, I think this offworlder has his own agenda.;[];;[3375, 3462];[3373];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02018A.mp3
Don't worry... I'm not working for the Sith.;[];;[3376];[3374, 3463];tar11_gadon112;
I suppose I could tell you what I know. It's not like it could do any harm to me or my gang... but it might cause problems for the Vulkars, and that's okay in my book.;[];;[3377];[3375, 3462];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02021_.mp3
The Vulkars stripped those pods clean within hours after they landed. It's too bad we didn't get there first, considering what my spies reported the Vulkars found.;[];;[3378];[3376];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02023_.mp3
A female Republic officer named Bastila survived the crash. We Beks don't believe in intergalactic slavery, but the Vulkars aren't so picky. They took her prisoner.;[];;[3379, 3434];[3377];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02025_.mp3
Bastila's a slave? What will happen to her now?;[];;[3380];[3378, 3433];tar11_gadon112;
Normally the Vulkars would take a captured slave and sell them for a nice profit to Davik or an off-world slaver. But a Republic officer is no ordinary catch.;[];;[3381, 3382, 3461];[3379, 3434];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02027_.mp3
They still think Bastila is just a Republic Officer. That could work to our advantage. Maybe she'll even figure out a way to escape from the Vulkar base on her own.;[];;[3382];[3380];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02173_.mp3
She's too valuable to leave with the Vulkar scum at the base. Brejik's probably got your Republic friend hidden away somewhere safe until the big swoop race. You'll never find her.;[];;[3383, 3460];[3381, 3461, 3380];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02031_.mp3
There has to be some way I can help her!;[];;[3384];[3382];tar11_gadon112;
I'm afraid your friend has become a pawn in Brejik's game to take over the Lower City. He's offered her up as the Vulkar's share of the prize in the annual swoop gang race.;[];;[3385];[3383, 3460];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02034_.mp3
By putting up such a valuable prize Brejik hopes to win the loyalty of some of the smaller gangs. Their numbers will allow him to finally destroy me and my followers.;[];;[3386, 3387];[3384];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02036_.mp3
So how do you propose we go about rescuing Bastila, then? We can't fight all the gangs.;[];;[3387];[3385];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02038_.mp3
The only hope you have of rescuing Bastila is to somehow win the big season opener of the swoop race.;[];;[3388, 3458, 3459];[3386, 3385];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02040_.mp3
Gadon - can you help me with this?;[];;[3389];[3387];tar11_gadon112;
I might be able to help you with this, if you'd be willing to help us. We both have something to gain here - and much to lose.;[];;[3390, 3453, 3455, 3457];[3388, 3458, 3459];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02042_.mp3
What are you proposing?;[];;[3391];[3389];tar11_gadon112;
The swoop race is for the Lower City gangs only. I could sponsor you as a rider for the Hidden Beks this year. If you win the race, you'll win your friend's freedom.;[];;[3392];[3390, 3454, 3456];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02044_.mp3
But first you have to do something for me. My mechanics have developed an accelerator for a swoop engine. A bike with the accelerator installed can beat any other swoop out there!;[];;[3393];[3391];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02046_.mp3
But the Vulkars stole the prototype from us. They plan to use it to guarantee a victory in this year's swoop race. I need you to break into their base and steal it back.;[];;[3394, 3449, 3451];[3392];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02048_.mp3
How am I supposed to get inside the Vulkar base?;[];;[3395];[3393, 3450];tar11_gadon112;
Getting into the Vulkar base won't be easy - the front doors are locked tight. But I know someone who might be able to get you in the back way - Mission Vao.;[];;[3396];[3394, 3452];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02050_.mp3
Mission? Gadon, you can't be serious! She's just a kid - how is she supposed to help them with this?;[];;[3397];[3395];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02052_.mp3
Mission's explored every step of every back alley in the Lower City. Plus she knows the Undercity sewers better than anyone. If anyone can get inside the Vulkar base, it's her.;[];;[3398, 3447];[3396];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02054_.mp3
Where can I find Mission?;[];;[3399];[3397];tar11_gadon112;
She and her Wookiee friend Zaalbar are always looking to stir up a little excitement. They like to go exploring in the Undercity, despite the dangers.;[];;[3400];[3398, 3442];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02056_.mp3
Your best bet is to look for her in the Undercity. But you'll need some way past the Sith guard post at the elevator.;[];;[3401, 3446];[3399, 3448];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02058_.mp3
I've got some Sith uniforms to disguise myself.;[];;[3402];[3400];tar11_gadon112;
A simple disguise might have worked on the Upper City guard, but the security down here is much tougher. You'll need the proper papers to get past him.;[];Sets player as looking for Mission. When player hits trigger in Undercity Mission will come running up begging for help finding Zaalbar.  There will be several Mission triggers, though none in the Outcast Village;[3403];[3401, 3446];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02060_.mp3
Luckily my gang ambushed one of the Sith patrols headed down to the Undercity. They never made it, and their security papers fell into my hands.;[];;[3404];[3402];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02062_.mp3
Since we're working together now I suppose I could give them to you in exchange for your uniforms. With the security papers you won't need a disguise anyway.;[];;[3405, 3407, 3409];[3403];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02064_.mp3
Forget it - I'm not giving up my disguise!;[];;[3406];[3404, 3408];tar11_gadon112;
The disguise won't help you get into the Undercity. Besides, soon the Sith will realize they've got a few too many uniforms missing and the only way to get around will be the security papers.;[];;[3407, 3409];[3405];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02066_.mp3
What do you want with the Sith uniforms?;[];;[3408];[3406, 3404];tar11_gadon112;
I like to be prepared. Eventually the Sith are going to try to drive us out of the Undercity. Sith disguises might give my people the edge we need in a crucial battle!;[];;[3405, 3409];[3407];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02068_.mp3
Okay - I'll trade the uniforms for the papers.;[];;[3410];[3408, 3406, 3404];tar11_gadon112;
Good choice. Thanks for the uniforms. You won't need them with these security papers anyway. Now, is there anything else I can do for you?;[];;[3411, 3444];[3409];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02070_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;[];;[3412, 3427];[3410, 3370, 3365, 3467, 3464, 3469];tar11_gadon112;
Your time would probably be better spent going after the prototype swoop engine the Vulkars stole from us, but I'll answer your questions if I can.;[];;[3413, 3428, 3429, 3435, 3436, 3442, 3443, 3444];[3411, 3426];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02097_.mp3
What's up with your freaky eyes, old man?;[];;[3414, 3415];[3412, 3427];tar11_gadon112;
Uh, very tactful. Are you itching for a fight or something?;[];;[3415];[3413, 3428];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02101_.mp3
How dare you?! I should kill you where you stand!;[];;[3416];[3414, 3428, 3413];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02103_.mp3
Calm down, Zaerdra... I'm not ashamed of what I have become. As you can see, I lost my eyes in a swoop racing crash. I rely on these artificial replacements to see now.;[];;[3417];[3415];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02105_.mp3
But my blindness was not the worst consequence of my accident. My affliction was what eventually led to this war between my Beks and the Vulkars.;[];;[3418, 3426, 3439];[3416];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02107_.mp3
What do you mean?;[];;[3419];[3417];tar11_gadon112;
When I lost my sight in the swoop bike accident everyone assumed I would step down as leader of the Hidden Beks and let Brejik - my most trusted follower - take over.;[];;[3420];[3418, 3435];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02109_.mp3
But with my occular implants I can still see well enough to lead this gang, and I knew Brejik wasn't ready to take over yet. Unfortunately, Brejik didn't agree with me.;[];;[3421];[3419];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02111_.mp3
In a rage he left to join our arch rivals, the Black Vulkars. A lot of the younger gang members followed him, and soon he and his followers had taken control of the Vulkar gang.;[];;[3422, 3426, 3439, 3441];[3420];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02113_.mp3
But why start a gang war with the Beks?;[];;[3423];[3421];tar11_gadon112;
Brejik is a proud man. My decision was a public humiliation for him. Maybe if I had stepped down this gang war could have been avoided.;[];;[3424];[3422, 3441];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02115_.mp3
Don't fool yourself, Gadon. Brejik wants to control the Lower City gangs. If you'd stepped down, he'd have led the Beks against the Vulkars. He wanted this war, one way or another.;[];;[3425];[3423];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02117_.mp3
*sigh* I know you're right, Zaerdra. Brejik won't rest until I am dead and the Beks are no more, but it's hard to accept the truth of his betrayal.;[];;[3426, 3439];[3424];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02119_.mp3
I want to ask you something else.;[];;[3412, 3427];[3425, 3438, 3421, 3417];tar11_gadon112;
I don't see any harm in that. What did you want to know?;[];;[3371, 3413, 3428, 3429, 3430, 3435, 3436, 3439];[3426, 3411];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02098_.mp3
Is there something wrong with your eyes?;[];;[3414, 3415];[3427, 3412];tar11_gadon112;
You said you were having problems with the Sith?;[];;[3367];[3427, 3412];tar11_gadon112;
I need to get inside the Black Vulkar base.;[];;[3431];[3427, 3370, 3365, 3469];tar11_gadon112;
Are you crazy? The Vulkars shoot people on sight in the streets! Why would you be stupid enough to try and get inside their base?;[];;[3432];[3430];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02091_.mp3
"Think about it, Zaerdra: the Republic officer the Vulkars captured; all the escape pods crashing on Taris; an off-worlder desperate to get inside the Vulkar base. It's obvious.";[];;[3433];[3431];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02093_.mp3
Of course! You're a soldier who survived the crash! That's why you want into the base - to rescue that Republic officer before Brejik sells her to some intergalactic slaver!;[];;[3379, 3434];[3432];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02095_.mp3
I have to get in there and rescue her!;[];;[3380];[3433, 3378];tar11_gadon112;
Why are Brejik and the Vulkars at war with you?;[];;[3419];[3427, 3412];tar11_gadon112;
Is there any way off this planet?;[];;[3437];[3427, 3412];tar11_gadon112;
Not while the Sith quarantine is in place. Even the fastest smugglers' ships can't break the blockade of the fleet surrounding the planet without the proper launch codes.;[];;[3438];[3436];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02124_.mp3
Any ship leaving the Taris atmosphere without the proper codes would be instantly disintegrated by blaster cannons fired by the Sith fleet's automated targeting systems.;[];;[3426, 3439];[3437];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02126_.mp3
I'll be going now.;[];;[3440];[3438, 3427, 3425, 3421, 3417, 3370, 3365, 3469];tar11_gadon112;
Feel free to come back anytime. We're not like those Vulkar savages - strangers are welcome in the Bek base.;[];;[];[3439];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02128_.mp3
Sounds like Brejik is acting like a spoiled brat.;[];;[3423];[3421];tar11_gadon112;
Where can I find Mission again?;[];;[3399];[3412, 3464];tar11_gadon112;
I have the accelerator right here.;[];;[3341];[3412, 3464, 3467];tar11_gadon112;
I'll be back when I get the prototype accelerator.;[];;[3445];[3412, 3410, 3467, 3464];tar11_gadon112;
I suggest you hurry. The swoop race is coming up, and we want you to have time to practice before the race.;[];;[];[3444];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02167_.mp3
I got past the Upper City guard no problem.;[];;[3402];[3400];tar11_gadon112;
Isn't there someone else who can help me?;[];;[3448];[3397];tar11_gadon112;
"Don't underestimate Mission or her Wookiee friend Zaalbar. They're a formidable pair; tough enough to go exploring the Undercity by themselves!";[];;[3400];[3447];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02073_.mp3
How do I know you'll live up to your end of the bargain?;[];;[3450];[3393];tar11_gadon112;
My word is my bond. Everybody in the Lower City knows my reputation. Besides, you really don't have a choice. I'm your only ticket into the swoop race.;[];;[3394, 3451];[3449];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02076_.mp3
Forget it - I'm not interested.;[];;[3452];[3450, 3393];tar11_gadon112;
Don't be a fool. You have to win the swoop race to save your friend, and that means breaking into the Vulkar base and getting my prototype accelerator back.;[];;[3395];[3451];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02078_.mp3
I might help you... if the price is right.;[];;[3454];[3389];tar11_gadon112;
You're in no position to bargain here. Without my help, you don't have a hope of getting this Bastila back. You should at least listen to what I have to say.;[];;[3391];[3453];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02081_.mp3
I don't work with gangs, Gadon.;[];;[3456];[3389];tar11_gadon112;
You really don't have any other choice. Not if you want to get Bastila back. You should at least listen to what I have to say.;[];;[3391];[3455, 3457];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02084_.mp3
How do I know I can trust you?;[];;[3456];[3389];tar11_gadon112;
How do I enter this swoop race?;[];;[3389];[3387];tar11_gadon112;
But I don't even have a swoop bike.;[];;[3389];[3387];tar11_gadon112;
Swoop race? What does that have to do with it?;[];;[3384];[3382];tar11_gadon112;
Slavers everywhere. As if it was just another trade.;[];;[3382];[3380];tar11_gadon112;
Do you know anything about this or not?;[];;[3376];[3374, 3463];tar11_gadon112;
Calm down, Zaerdra. If the Sith thought we knew anything useful they'd have a battalion of troops kicking down our door. No, I think this offworlder has her own agenda.;[];;[3375, 3462];[3373];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02018B.mp3
You have returned. Do you have the prototype swoop engine accelerator with you?;[];;[3411, 3442, 3443, 3444, 3465];[None];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02130_.mp3
I don't have it yet.;[];;[3466];[3464];tar11_gadon112;
Time is running out, you know. If you don't come up with that accelerator you won't have a chance against the Vulkars in the swoop race.;[];;[3467];[3465];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02163_.mp3
If you want to save this Bastila then you better get that accelerator back from the Vulkars.;[];;[3411, 3443, 3444];[3466];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02165_.mp3
Back again? At least this time Zaerdra didn't verbally assault you for coming to see me.;[];;[3469];[None];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02169_.mp3
I trust her with my life, but she does take her guard duties rather seriously ever since this war with Brejik and the Vulkars began. Now, what do you need from me?;[];;[3371, 3411, 3430, 3439];[3468];tar11_gadon112;NM11AAGADO02171_.mp3

I'm leaving.;[];;[3509];[3505, 3503, 3494, 3525, 3526, 3529, 3535, 3533, 3522, 3520, 3516, 3514, 3543];kas24_pgener_01;
Good. I don't need the trouble.;[];;[];[3508];kas24_pgener_01;NM24AAPGEN07006_.mp3
That isn't good enough. I need more, or else.;[];;[3505];[3494];kas24_pgener_01;
You want anything you'll have to talk to the commander. He's in charge of our harvesting here.;[];None of the guards have been killed for deserting;[3512, 3541];[None];kas24_pgener_01;NM24AAPGEN07007_.mp3
I'd rather ask about you. Why are you here?;[];;[3513];[3511];kas24_pgener_01;
Why am I here? I'm here because this is where the Commander told me to stand. And that's all there is to it.;[];;[3514];[3512];kas24_pgener_01;NM24AAPGEN07009_.mp3
I'm just a guard for this emitter. Why couldn't they have just equipped this lump of tech with a blaster and left me at home?;[];;[3508, 3515, 3539, 3540];[3513, 3542];kas24_pgener_01;NM24AAPGEN07011_.mp3
Let's talk about the emitter you're guarding.;[];player has been told about the emitters;[3516];[3514, 3522, 3543];kas24_pgener_01;
What do you want to know about that? It's just one of five or so sonic emitters protecting the camp.;[];;[3508, 3517, 3521, 3536, 3537];[3515];kas24_pgener_01;NM24AAPGEN07047_.mp3
[Persuade] So, if someone shut them down, you could leave.;[];;[3518, 3520];[3516, 3535];kas24_pgener_01;
[Success] I don't like being here, that's for sure. I suppose you could... take this code and shut down the emitter I'm guarding.;[];This character will no longer sound the alarm if the player disables the sonic emitter next to him.;[3519];[3517, 3536];kas24_pgener_01;NM24AAPGEN07036_.mp3
Enough of those emitters go down and the camp will have to move out. But I never said anything.;[];;[];[3518, 3538];kas24_pgener_01;NM24AAPGEN07038_.mp3
"[Failure] It's ""friendly"" people like you that recruited me into this mess. I'm keeping an eye on you, that's for sure.";[];;[3508, 3521];[3517, 3536];kas24_pgener_01;NM24AAPGEN07039_.mp3
I want to go back to my other questions.;[];;[3522];[3520, 3525, 3526, 3535, 3533, 3516];kas24_pgener_01;
I'm not here because I know stuff. I handle a blaster well enough to guard this emitter, and that's it. Talk to the Commander.;[];;[3508, 3515, 3523, 3527, 3531];[3521, 3530, 3539];kas24_pgener_01;NM24AAPGEN07013_.mp3
This is a dangerous place. Could I persuade you to leave?;[];This option only appears after Jolee has asked the player to get the poachers to leave;[3524, 3526];[3522];kas24_pgener_01;
Don't you start with me! I don't know what you said to that other guy, but I'm not risking getting killed!;[];At least one guard has been killed for deserting.;[3525];[3523];kas24_pgener_01;NM24AAPGEN07015_.mp3
Now leave me alone before the Commander gets any ideas.;[];;[3495, 3508, 3521];[3524];kas24_pgener_01;NM24AAPGEN07017_.mp3
No more dangerous than walking out on the commander. He'd kill me for disobeying orders.;[];None of the guards have been killed for deserting;[3495, 3508, 3521];[3523];kas24_pgener_01;NM24AAPGEN07022_.mp3
You'll answer what I tell you to answer!;[];;[3528];[3522];kas24_pgener_01;
Are you threatening me? Unless you want a fight with all of us I'd suggest you change your tone.;[];;[3529];[3527, 3540];kas24_pgener_01;NM24AAPGEN07049_.mp3
Besides, enough things down here want to kill me. I don't need to add you to the list.;[];;[3506, 3508, 3530];[3528];kas24_pgener_01;NM24AAPGEN07051_.mp3
Let's just go back to my other questions.;[];;[3522];[3529];kas24_pgener_01;
What do these emitters do?;[];player has not been told about the emitters.;[3532];[3522];kas24_pgener_01;
They generate a sonic barrier that allows us to stay in this wonderful location. It keeps the big predators away.;[];;[3533];[3531];kas24_pgener_01;NM24AAPGEN07030_.mp3
I don't know how it works, really. I just know that if they go down, the camp would be overrun.;[];Set a global that says the player has been told what the emitters do. This will be used to filter dialogue in all the guards.;[3508, 3521, 3534];[3532];kas24_pgener_01;NM24AAPGEN07032_.mp3
So only the emitters are keeping you here?;[];;[3535];[3533];kas24_pgener_01;
What of it?;[];;[3508, 3517, 3521, 3536, 3537];[3534];kas24_pgener_01;NM24AAPGEN07034_.mp3
[Force Persuade] Tell me how to shut down the emitters.;[];;[3518, 3520];[3535, 3516];kas24_pgener_01;
Maybe you could help me shut it down? For, say, 200 credits?;[];player has 200 credits;[3538];[3535, 3516];kas24_pgener_01;
That sounds like a fair deal to me. Here, use this code to access the one I'm guarding.;[];take 200 credits;[3519];[3537];kas24_pgener_01;NM24AAPGEN07044_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;[];;[3522];[3514, 3543];kas24_pgener_01;
Quit your whining and answer my questions!;[];;[3528];[3514, 3543];kas24_pgener_01;
I asked you! You'll answer my questions!;[];;[3542];[3511];kas24_pgener_01;
Okay, okay, there's no need to get like that. The Commander just prefers everyone to go through him first.;[];;[3514];[3541];kas24_pgener_01;NM24AAPGEN07059_.mp3
What do you want? I don't want to get on the commander's bad side, so just leave me alone.;[];At least one guard has been killed for deserting.;[3508, 3515, 3539, 3540];[None];kas24_pgener_01;NM24AAPGEN07061_.mp3
I heard about that big fight on the dunes. You're the talk of the lodge. Killed a dragon... how about that.;[];;[3545, 3548, 3550, 3564, 3585, 3588, 3596];[None];tat17_03fazza_01;
Do you have anything for sale or trade?;[];;[3546, 3611];[3544, 3563, 3568, 3587, 3595, 3591, 3613, 3615, 3616, 3617, 3618, 3619, 3620];tat17_03fazza_01;
I'm sorry, but I'm not allowed to even look at what you have until I see a hunting license. Czerka Corporation rules.;[];;[3547];[3545, 3564];tat17_03fazza_01;
The other hunters all have theirs. I can't make exceptions or I'll get shut down.;[];;[3548, 3550, 3585, 3588, 3596];[3546];tat17_03fazza_01;
What do you do in here?;[];set local that player asked about hunting;[3549];[3547, 3544, 3613, 3615, 3616, 3617, 3618, 3619, 3620];tat17_03fazza_01;
This is a hunting lodge. I purchase what the sportsmen bring in. It's not a bad little job.;[];;[3550, 3585, 3588, 3596];[3548, 3614];tat17_03fazza_01;
I've got some questions about hunting.;[];only appears if player asked about what goes on in here.;[3551, 3609, 3610];[3549, 3563, 3587, 3595, 3591, 3547, 3544, 3615, 3616, 3617, 3618, 3619, 3620];tat17_03fazza_01;
Well, I reckon you already know everything I'd tell you. I mean, you killed a dragon. The craft of hunting doesn't get bigger than that.;[];;[3552, 3562];[3550];tat17_03fazza_01;
What is there to hunt on Tatooine?;[];;[3553];[3551, 3561, 3559, 3609, 3610];tat17_03fazza_01;
Most of our boys confine themselves to hunting wraid. Large fleshy beasts, as tall as a man. Er... a tall man, too.;[];;[3554];[3552];tat17_03fazza_01;
Desert wraid have a large bone plate on their head that I pay well for, but that's not where the real glory of the hunt is.;[];;[3555, 3599];[3553];tat17_03fazza_01;
You've already taken the big prize. Imagine that, taking down a big bull dragon. It'll be a while before anyone tops that.;[];;[3556, 3560, 3562];[3554];tat17_03fazza_01;
Why do I need a license?;[];;[3557];[3555, 3561, 3606, 3608, 3604, 3602, 3600, 3610];tat17_03fazza_01;
You need a license because nobody gets out of the city without one. Czerka Corporation uses it to keep track of people.;[];;[3558];[3556];tat17_03fazza_01;
They want people to know that if they step outside the gates, they are on their own. Only serious hunters pay the 200 credit fee.;[];;[3559];[3557];tat17_03fazza_01;
Once you have a license, I'll pay for whatever spoils of the hunt you bring back. I have off-world buyers that take them.;[];;[3552, 3560, 3562];[3558];tat17_03fazza_01;
Would you consider lowering the fee?;[];Player has not already bought a license;[3561];[3559, 3555, 3606, 3608, 3604, 3602, 3600, 3610];tat17_03fazza_01;
Well, that's not up to me, now is it? You'd have to talk with the people down at the Czerka office in the center of town.;[];;[3552, 3556, 3562];[3560];tat17_03fazza_01;
Let's go back to my first questions.;[];;[3563];[3561, 3559, 3555, 3606, 3608, 3604, 3602, 3600, 3551, 3609, 3610];tat17_03fazza_01;
All right then. Just keep it brief, will you?;[];;[3545, 3550, 3564, 3585, 3588, 3596];[3562];tat17_03fazza_01;
I have something to sell you.;[];Player has dragon pearls or wraid plate;[3546, 3565, 3584];[3563, 3587, 3595, 3591, 3544, 3613, 3615, 3616, 3617, 3618, 3619, 3620];tat17_03fazza_01;
So I see. That's the biggest desert wraid skull plate I've seen in a season. Whoever got that was a skilled hunter.;[];;[3566];[3564];tat17_03fazza_01;
I'll give a premium price on that one. I've a buyer that put in a special request. Does 500 credits sound fair?;[];;[3567, 3577, 3578, 3579, 3581, 3582];[3565];tat17_03fazza_01;
Yes, that will do nicely.;[];;[3568];[3566];tat17_03fazza_01;
I thought it would. Do you have anything else to sell?;[];take plate, give credits.;[3545, 3569, 3571, 3572, 3574, 3575];[3567];tat17_03fazza_01;
I have a dragon pearl to sell.;[];player has pearls;[3570];[3568, 3584];tat17_03fazza_01;

I have a wraid plate to sell.;[];player has generic wraid plates from hunting;[3573];[3568, 3584];tat17_03fazza_01;
Ah, the bread and butter of the hunter. I'll take whatever you have off your hands for a fair price.;[];open store that buys wraid plates;[];[3572, 3574];tat17_03fazza_01;
I have wraid plates to sell.;[];;[3573];[3568, 3584];tat17_03fazza_01;
That's it for now.;[];;[3576];[3568];tat17_03fazza_01;
All right. Thanks for your business.;[];;[];[3575];tat17_03fazza_01;
I have a dragon pearl to sell instead.;[];;[3570];[3566];tat17_03fazza_01;

I have a regular wraid plate as well.;[];;[3580];[3566];tat17_03fazza_01;
Very well, but talk to me again about that big plate if you want to sell it. I'll want to look closely at it.;[];open regular store;[];[3579, 3581];tat17_03fazza_01;

Never mind.;[];;[3583];[3566, 3584];tat17_03fazza_01;
Come back when you actually have something. Don't waste my time.;[];;[];[3582];tat17_03fazza_01;
Do you? Well, let's have a look.;[];;[3569, 3571, 3572, 3574, 3582];[3564];tat17_03fazza_01;
I want to ask about Tatooine.;[];;[3586];[3563, 3595, 3591, 3549, 3547, 3544, 3613, 3615, 3616, 3617, 3618, 3619, 3620];tat17_03fazza_01;
Not much to tell. Barren place. Can't support much, but I have managed to get some off-world hunters to show up.;[];;[3587];[3585];tat17_03fazza_01;
I suppose there's trouble here, like anywhere else, but you'll have to ask someone else about that. I keep to myself.;[];;[3545, 3550, 3564, 3588, 3596];[3586];tat17_03fazza_01;
Anything out of the ordinary happening?;[];;[3589, 3598];[3587, 3563, 3549, 3547, 3544, 3613, 3615, 3616, 3617, 3618, 3619, 3620];tat17_03fazza_01;
Besides you killing a dragon? I suppose there's the destruction of Taris. Seems real far away, though.;[];;[3590];[3588];tat17_03fazza_01;
I'm not surprised something like it happened. I remember the Exar Kun war, and how Sith and the Jedi fought across worlds.;[];;[3591];[3589, 3598];tat17_03fazza_01;
Don't have much interest in either group. Both act like they're above my concerns, and I guess they are.;[];;[3545, 3550, 3564, 3585, 3592, 3596];[3590];tat17_03fazza_01;
Know about anything more local?;[];;[3593];[3591];tat17_03fazza_01;
Ah, Czerka Corporation is always complaining about Sand People. I stay out of it. We hunt animals, not people.;[];;[3594];[3592];tat17_03fazza_01;
And I guess the Jawas are being pushed around again. At least, that's what I think they said. Tough to tell sometimes.;[];;[3595];[3593];tat17_03fazza_01;
You'll have to talk to these groups yourself for more. I keep to myself.;[];;[3545, 3550, 3564, 3585, 3596];[3594];tat17_03fazza_01;
I have to go. Goodbye.;[];;[3597];[3595, 3591, 3587, 3563, 3549, 3547, 3544, 3613, 3615, 3616, 3617, 3618, 3619, 3620];tat17_03fazza_01;
I'll be here. I keep hunter's hours. Fazza's is always open.;[];;[];[3596];tat17_03fazza_01;
You mean here on Tatooine or just in general? I heard about the destruction of Taris. Don't know anything specific.;[];;[3590];[3588];tat17_03fazza_01;
You've probably heard about the big prize, the krayt dragon. The most fearsome predator in the system, they are.;[];;[3600];[3554];tat17_03fazza_01;
If you could find one, and I doubt you will, I'll buy the stones polished in their gizzard, the dragon pearls.;[];;[3556, 3560, 3562, 3601];[3599];tat17_03fazza_01;
The dragons are rare, then?;[];;[3602];[3600];tat17_03fazza_01;
You'd think it'd be easier to find such a gigantic creature. Komad's father took one down, but that was years ago.;[];;[3556, 3560, 3562, 3603, 3605, 3607];[3601];tat17_03fazza_01;
What was so special about Komad's father?;[];;[3604];[3602, 3606, 3608];tat17_03fazza_01;
He'd been a hunter for years, using strict traditional methods. Komad is just like him. Maybe he'll show you a thing or two out on the dunes.;[];;[3556, 3560, 3562, 3605, 3607];[3603];tat17_03fazza_01;
Where could I find Komad?;[];;[3606];[3604, 3602];tat17_03fazza_01;
That's easy enough, he's standing right over there. He's usually here or out on the dunes.;[];;[3556, 3560, 3562, 3603];[3605];tat17_03fazza_01;
Where can I find this Komad?;[];;[3608];[3604, 3602];tat17_03fazza_01;
If he's not here he's probably out scouting the dunes. He's been to the Eastern Dune sea, but I don't know how you'd get there.;[];;[3556, 3560, 3562, 3603];[3607];tat17_03fazza_01;
I'll answer what I can, but you've already got yourself a license. You should be out on the dunes.;[];Player has already bought a license;[3552, 3562];[3550];tat17_03fazza_01;
You'll want to know how to get in on it. Just pay 200 credits for a license down at the Czerka office. No license, no hunting.;[];Player has not already bought a license;[3552, 3556, 3560, 3562];[3550];tat17_03fazza_01;
I might have something. Wouldn't be much of a lodge if I couldn't keep the hunters stocked.;[];;[];[3545];tat17_03fazza_01;

Is that why you work as a mercenary?;[];;[3630];[3628, 3640];k_hcan_dialog;
Times have changed now. The Mandalore clans have been scattered across the Outer Rim, the Republic is in decline and the Sith Empire rises to take its place.;[];;[3631];[3629, 3642, 3644];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03055_.mp3
The clans as they were aren't a threat, but the galaxy still fears us. Ha! People think we war out of spite, or bloodlust. They don't understand, and fear that.;[];;[3632];[3630];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03056_.mp3
We only wanted the challenge of the battle, and glory from it - win or lose. And we lost.;[];;[3633];[3631];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03057_.mp3
But now I have no real challenges. Crushing Davik's enemies and the pathetic gangs in the Lower City of Taris could not be considered the most glorious of tasks.;[];;[3634];[3632];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03058_.mp3
When I think of the battles I've fought... the thousands I've killed... the worlds I've burned... I weep for my past.;[];;[3635];[3633];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03059_.mp3
We'll never speak of this again. We've got work to do, so let's get to it.;[];;[];[3634];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03060_.mp3
Is that why the Mandalorians attacked the Republic?;[];;[3637];[3628];k_hcan_dialog;
The Sith came to us with an offer: to fight a worthy enemy in a battle that would be remembered forever.;[];;[3638];[3636];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03062_.mp3
Win or lose, as long as the fight is worthy, then honor is gained. The glory at having triumphed over impossible odds is what drives us.;[];;[3639];[3637, 3645];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03064_.mp3
If there's nothing at stake - your possessions, your life, your world - then the battle's meaningless.;[];;[3640];[3638];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03065_.mp3
We Mandalore take everything we are and throw it into battle. It's the true test of yourself - the battle against death... against oblivion.;[];;[3629, 3641, 3643];[3639];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03066_.mp3
You seek death?;[];;[3642];[3640];k_hcan_dialog;
All life dies eventually. A true warrior is one who can beat it down whenever it raises its head. But...;[];;[3630];[3641];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03068_.mp3
Then what are you doing now?;[];;[3644];[3640];k_hcan_dialog;
The days of combat and glory and cheating death at every turn seem to be over now... I take what I can.;[];;[3630];[3643];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03070_.mp3
The Mandalorians destroy worlds for honor?;[];;[3638];[3628];k_hcan_dialog;
Maybe another time. I want to ask something else.;[];;[3624];[3628, 3650];k_hcan_dialog;
I was wondering if you had any more war stories.;[];w2, w3, w4, w5;[3648, 3824, 3849, 3875];[3624, 3677, 3673];k_hcan_dialog;
I was one of the best youth warriors in clan Ordo in my time. No one before me had mastered the power of our Basilisk war droids as quickly as I had. Except Mandalore himself of course.;[];w2;[3649];[3647];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03072_.mp3
In those days we were sweeping across the Outer Rim. Destroying all who fought us.;[];;[3650];[3648];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03073_.mp3
Young Mandalores would prove themselves in real combat with unknown opponents above a thousand worlds. Each brought back the story of his achievements.;[];;[3646, 3651, 3820, 3822];[3649];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03074_.mp3
What was your story?;[];;[3652];[3650];k_hcan_dialog;
I remember it well, orbiting high above a placid world, its defenses just stirring. As was tradition, I would go ahead of the first wave to find enemies in the thickest fighting.;[];;[3653];[3651, 3821];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03076_.mp3
I remember sitting there in my armor, linked directly with the Basilisk thrumming beneath me. My heart racing with fear at the coming battle.;[];;[3654, 3818, 3819];[3652];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03077_.mp3
I didn't think Mandalorians got afraid.;[];;[3655];[3653];k_hcan_dialog;
Every new warrior has to fear to understand how to beat it. You must know that.;[];;[3656];[3654, 3818];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03080_.mp3
The doors opened in front me and the air was sucked out of the drop bay, scattering crystals of frozen vapor across my path.;[];;[3657];[3655, 3819];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03081_.mp3
I can't describe what it feels like to look directly down at a world, falling continuously as you circle it, with barely fifteen centimeters of armor plate protecting you.;[];;[3658];[3656];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03082_.mp3
When the magnetic locks disengaged on my droid I plunged out of the drop bay towards the battle that waited below.;[];;[3659, 3815, 3816];[3657];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03083_.mp3
You dropped from orbit riding a droid?!;[];;[3660];[3658];k_hcan_dialog;
The exhilaration, the euphoria, I felt as I streaked into the atmosphere, dodging self-guided projectile and beam weapons, was unmatched.;[];;[3661];[3659, 3815, 3817];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03085_.mp3
A 80 kilometer plunge through the atmosphere, dodging and weaving, the outside of my armor glowing like the sun with the heat of re-entry.;[];;[3662];[3660];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03086_.mp3
And with barely thirty meters to spare, I twisted and skimmed the surface, firing at the giant beam generators that were in my path.;[];;[3663];[3661];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03087_.mp3
The explosion from that sent shockwaves that levelled the entire complex around it. It was the moment of my life.;[];;[3664, 3813, 3814];[3662];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03088_.mp3
That's horrible!;[];;[3665];[3663];k_hcan_dialog;
I'll never forget those times. But... things are different now. We can't go on fighting the way we had. There are too few of us left now.;[];;[3666];[3664, 3813, 3814];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03090_.mp3
But I don't really want to talk about this anymore. I trust I've satisfied your curiosity for now?;[];;[3667];[3665];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03091_.mp3
Is there something else you want to know?;[];;[3668, 3674, 3785];[3666, 3699, 3732, 3759, 3779, 3845, 3864, 3890, 3891];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03092_.mp3
Do you know anything about this world?;[];;[3669, 3791, 3794, 3798, 3803, 3806, 3810];[3667, 3677, 3624];k_hcan_dialog;
*grunt* Yeah, I know about Taris. I wasted the last two years in this rat-hole working for Davik.;[]; taris;[3670];[3668];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03015_.mp3
I suppose an accurate way to describe this place would be 'cesspool' or 'dump'.;[];;[3671];[3669];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03016_.mp3
You got the rich people on top, the poor people being crushed underneath, and people like me trying to make a living doing the crushing.;[];;[3672];[3670];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03017_.mp3
It's not exactly what you'd call spiritually fulfilling work, but it gets the bills paid. And on Taris, money can go a long way to making things easier.;[];;[3673];[3671];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03018_.mp3
You have anything else you want to ask?;[];;[3625, 3647, 3674, 3785];[3672, 3793, 3797, 3802, 3805, 3809, 3812];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03019_.mp3
Can you give me some adrenal stimulants?;[];;[3675, 3787];[3673, 3677, 3667, 3624];k_hcan_dialog;
Heh, don't worry I think you've got enough there as it is. You don't want to go overloading youself on stims, otherwise you might destroy your adrenal system.;[];;[3676];[3674];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03048_.mp3
A real warrior knows his own limits and doesn't overestimate himself.;[];;[3677];[3675];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03049_.mp3
There anything else you need?;[];;[3625, 3647, 3668, 3674, 3678, 3742, 3768, 3785];[3676, 3788, 3789, 3790];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03045_.mp3
Tell me more about the Mandalorian Wars.;[];w6, w7;[3679, 3720];[3677, 3624];k_hcan_dialog;
We fought against the Republic forces for some time, over the course of many battles.;[];w6;[3680, 3714];[3678];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03181_.mp3
At the start, they were not much of a threat to speak of, but once you had taken charge, things began to turn against us.;[];;[3681];[3679];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03182_.mp3
The Republic fleets began to use more than just basic tactics. Feints, counterattacks, mass deceptions. You were a genius on the field. You are held in very high regard among my people.;[];;[3682];[3680];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03183_.mp3
You abandoned worlds of their defenders so that others would be too fortified to strike. You made sacrifices in order to advance your goals. Such strategies had never been enough to best us before.;[];;[3683];[3681];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03184_.mp3
In the end, you proved too much for us.;[];;[3684, 3709, 3711];[3682];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03185_.mp3
You couldn't have won against the whole galaxy.;[];;[3685];[3683, 3717];k_hcan_dialog;
But it was close! So close!;[];;[3686];[3684];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03193_.mp3
It looked like the entire galaxy was within our grasp!;[];;[3687];[3685, 3710, 3719];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03196_.mp3
I still remember that final battle in the skies above Malachor V. The two fleets filling the space around it, outshining the stars...;[];;[3688, 3708];[3686, 3713];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03197_.mp3
But you eventually lost.;[];;[3689];[3687];k_hcan_dialog;
Yeah, we lost. But there is no shame in it. We lost to the greatest single warrior the Republic has ever known.;[];;[3690];[3688];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03199_.mp3
It was not your ships or your men or your vaunted 'fight for freedom' that won this, the final battle of the war.;[];;[3691, 3705];[3689, 3708];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03201_.mp3
It was by the actions of one person, the Jedi Revan, that you prevailed.;[];;[3692];[3690];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03202_.mp3
Revan's strategies and tactics defeated the best of us. Even Mandalore himself was taken aback by the ferocity, the tenacity and the subtlety of Revan's plans.;[];;[3693];[3691];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03203_.mp3
Revan fought us to a standstill and then began pushing back. We didn't really have a chance.;[];;[3694, 3703];[3692];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03204_.mp3
Why didn't you retreat?;[];;[3695];[3693, 3707];k_hcan_dialog;
It was what we had wanted all along, in a way. We wanted to fight the best in a battle that would be remembered for centuries. And we did.;[];;[3696, 3700];[3694, 3704];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03206_.mp3
And Revan won.;[];;[3697];[3695];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03207_.mp3
I don't hold a grudge against Revan, and neither do any of my people. It was the greatest moment of my life to be in that battle.;[];;[3698];[3696];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03208_.mp3
If Revan had been a Mandalorian, nothing in the galaxy would have stopped us.;[];;[3699];[3697];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03209_.mp3
But wishing for the past to be different is useless. Better to look to the future. As we should now. We'll talk more later, I think.;[];;[3667];[3698, 3702];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03210_.mp3
And you won.;[];;[3701];[3695];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03213_.mp3
I hold no grudge against you, nor do any of my people. It was the greatest of honors to fight against you, even in defeat. It is even more of an honor to fight beside you now.;[];;[3702];[3700];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03214_.mp3
Had you been born of the Mandalorian clans, surely nothing in this galaxy would have been able to stop us.;[];;[3699];[3701];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03215_.mp3
The Republic will always prevail.;[];;[3704];[3693, 3707];k_hcan_dialog;
Ha! Don't be naive. The Republic is not invincible. This battle was the end of the war, one way or another.;[];;[3695];[3703];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03217_.mp3
It was by the actions of one person - you - that the Republic prevailed.;[];;[3706];[3690];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03220_.mp3
Your strategies and tactics defeated the best we could send against you. Even Mandalore himself was taken aback by the ferocity of your attacks, the tenacity of your defenses and the subtleties of your plans.;[];;[3707];[3705];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03221_.mp3
You fought us to a standstill and then began pushing back. We didn't really have a chance.;[];;[3694, 3703];[3706];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03222_.mp3
What happened in the battle?;[];;[3690];[3687];k_hcan_dialog;
If I had not stopped you, someone else would have.;[];;[3710];[3683];k_hcan_dialog;
There was no one else. The entire Republic had committed its forces behind you. The Sith had retreated back to their empire and there were none else strong enough to challenge us.;[];;[3686];[3709];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03187_.mp3
But what about the Sith?;[];;[3712];[3683, 3717];k_hcan_dialog;
The Sith had gone - retreated into their empire. They sealed themselves off from the rest of the galaxy. We thought it would be centuries before they'd come back.;[];;[3713];[3711];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03224_.mp3
It's amazing that they could rebuild their fleet so fast. But at the time, it looked like the galaxy was in our grasp!;[];;[3687];[3712];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03225_.mp3
At the start, they were not much of a threat to speak of, but once the Jedi Revan had taken charge, things began to turn against us.;[];;[3715];[3679];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03188_.mp3
The Republic fleets began to use more than just basic tactics. Feints, counterattacks, mass deceptions. Revan was a genius on the field.;[];;[3716];[3714];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03189_.mp3
Revan abandoned worlds of their defenders so that others would be too fortified to strike, and was willing to make sacrifices in order to advance goals.;[];;[3717];[3715];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03190_.mp3
And in the end, Revan proved too much for us.;[];;[3684, 3711, 3718];[3716];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03191_.mp3
If Revan had not stopped you, someone else would have.;[];;[3719];[3717];k_hcan_dialog;
There was no one else. The entire Republic had committed its forces behind Revan. The Sith had retreated back to their empire and there were none else strong enough to challenge us.;[];;[3686];[3718];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03195_.mp3
The war we had with the Republic was supposed to be the most glorious battle of our history, but... it was a very costly one. I guess we didn't think of how much we could lose in it.;[];w7;[3721, 3739, 3740];[3678];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03228_.mp3
How much did you lose?;[];;[3722];[3720];k_hcan_dialog;
There weren't many of us left after that last battle. Mandalore himself was killed at the hands of the Jedi Revan. The best of us could not defeat him!;[];;[3723];[3721, 3739, 3741];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03231_.mp3
After that last battle, those of us that survived were stripped of our weapons, our armor, and our Basilisks.;[];;[3724, 3738];[3722];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03232_.mp3
Revan's forces destroyed them while we were forced to watch. Those who hadn't fled earlier were left with nothing to call their own: no weapons, no armor... only the honor of having fought in the battle we just lost.;[];;[3725];[3723];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03233_.mp3
For many this was not enough. While the rest of us were sent into exile on the Outer Rim, they tried to relive the old days - raiding worlds. They're nothing more than bandits now.;[];;[3726, 3736];[3724, 3738];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03234_.mp3
And you eventually came to Taris.;[];;[3727];[3725];k_hcan_dialog;
Yeah, I came to Taris.;[];;[3728];[3726];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03236_.mp3
Enforcing for Davik was not... stimulating. The gangs on Taris and Davik's rivals were trash. They give no thrill in battle, no honor or glory in defeating them. It was like stepping on bugs.;[];;[3729];[3727, 3737];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03237_.mp3
I sought worthy challenges, but the best that Taris could offer were nothing to me.;[];;[3730];[3728];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03238_.mp3
But I think now - with you - I may finally find opponents worth fighting.;[];;[3731, 3733, 3734];[3729];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03239_.mp3
I am honored.;[];;[3732];[3730];k_hcan_dialog;
Maybe later I'll tell you more about what it was like to work for Davik. For now, though, we should get on with our lives.;[];;[3667];[3731, 3733, 3735];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03244_.mp3
You are a worthy companion.;[];;[3732];[3730];k_hcan_dialog;
Opponents who could easily kill us.;[];;[3735];[3730];k_hcan_dialog;
Maybe it'll happen, maybe it won't. Either way, I think that by following you I can get something out of it.;[];;[3732];[3734];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03243_.mp3
You found work as a mercenary?;[];;[3737];[3725];k_hcan_dialog;
Yeah. I found work on Taris.;[];;[3728];[3736];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03246_.mp3
The Republic's forces destroyed them while we were forced to watch. Those who hadn't fled earlier were left with nothing to call their own: no weapons, no armor... only the honor of having fought in the battle we just lost.;[];;[3725];[3723];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03247_.mp3
There must not have been many of you left.;[];;[3722];[3720];k_hcan_dialog;
But I kicked your tails so badly?;[];;[3741];[3720];k_hcan_dialog;
Yeah... yeah you did. You were a great warrior Revan. A great general.;[];;[3722];[3740];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03249_.mp3
Tell me about when you worked for Davik.;[];w8;[3743];[3677, 3624];k_hcan_dialog;
Working for Davik was like driving a spike through the side of your head... Sure you get something new in there, but in the end, you've lost something as well.;[];;[3744];[3742];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03251_.mp3
Beating up people who wouldn't - or couldn't - pay, strong-arming his competitors, killing who he said. It was busy work, nothing decent.;[];;[3745, 3764, 3765, 3767];[3743];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03252_.mp3
You were an assassin?;[];;[3746];[3744];k_hcan_dialog;
Assassin. Mercenary. Those are names people give guys like me who do the killing to make us seem better or worse in their eyes.;[];;[3747];[3745];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03254_.mp3
I've killed many people. I can't say I'm proud of it, but I have. Criminals, competitors, businessmen, police... women, children...;[];;[3748];[3746, 3764, 3766];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03256_.mp3
Jedi were a better challenge, but they hardly ever poked around in the Under City.;[];;[3749];[3747];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03257_.mp3
... Until you came along...;[];;[3750];[3748];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03258_.mp3
But I never wanted to challenge you. Never felt the need. Maybe I knew I couldn't win... just like all those years ago.;[];;[3751, 3763];[3749];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03259_.mp3
A wise decision.;[];;[3752];[3750];k_hcan_dialog;
Yeah, probably. Heh. You'd likely have beaten me again.;[];;[3753];[3751];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03261_.mp3
Maybe you would have. But you're not who you were back then, I can tell. You've changed... and maybe I have too.;[];;[3754];[3752, 3763];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03263_.mp3
I remember a time when I could do anything I wanted... Kill, maim, murder... It was all the same to me.;[];;[3755];[3753];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03264_.mp3
But now... now that I'm older, I can look back and regret...;[];;[3756, 3760, 3761];[3754];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03265_.mp3
Regret in a Mandalorian is unbecoming.;[];;[3757];[3755];k_hcan_dialog;
In a Mandalorian... I'm not even sure what that is anymore. The Mandalorian are gone, defeated by the Republic and swept away by time.;[];;[3758];[3756, 3762];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03267_.mp3
I look back and regret all the chances I had as a warrior, and then all the chances I've had since then. I shouldn't be getting like this, not when so many other things are happening... but...;[];;[3759];[3757, 3760];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03268_.mp3
It feels like... like something has changed inside and I don't know what it is. Bah! This is unbecoming of a warrior! Let's get on with everything before I start getting sentimental or something.;[];;[3667];[3758];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03269_.mp3
Over what?;[];;[3758];[3755];k_hcan_dialog;
I regret to tell you that I never regret anything.;[];;[3762];[3755];k_hcan_dialog;
Ha! Good one. That's like a warrior should. Like what you see in a Mandalorian.;[];;[3757];[3761];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03272_.mp3
You know I'd have beaten you again!;[];;[3753];[3750];k_hcan_dialog;
Killed his competitors?;[];;[3747];[3744];k_hcan_dialog;
Now that's the way things should be done!;[];;[3766];[3744];k_hcan_dialog;
Maybe...;[];;[3747];[3765];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03274_.mp3
Tell me about it later. I want to ask something else.;[];;[3624];[3744, 3825, 3850];k_hcan_dialog;
What are your thoughts now?;[];w9;[3769];[3677, 3624];k_hcan_dialog;
I'm not happy with the way my life has turned. I'm not the Mandalore I once was. I don't even think I'm the merc I was when I joined you.;[];;[3770];[3768];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03276_.mp3
I think... I think I need something more than killing and fighting in my life. I need a purpose or something like that.;[];;[3771, 3782, 3784];[3769];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03277_.mp3
What will you do?;[];;[3772];[3770];k_hcan_dialog;
The way the Mandalorians - we - fought... it holds no appeal for me. To rape and ravage worlds for the thrill of battle... It gets old. Very old.;[];;[3773];[3771, 3783, 3784];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03279_.mp3
Honor in battle. Cheating death. Comrades in arms. The code of the Mandalore.;[];;[3774];[3772];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03280_.mp3
I think I'm something different now. Maybe more, maybe less.;[];;[3775, 3780];[3773];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03281_.mp3
You aren't a Mandalorian now?;[];;[3776];[3774];k_hcan_dialog;
No... The time of the clans is past. I don't think the galaxy wants them anymore. Maybe in the future, but not now.;[];;[3777];[3775];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03283_.mp3
Once my time with you is done, once you have moved on to greater things, I'll find my own way once again.;[];;[3778];[3776, 3781];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03284_.mp3
Maybe the Mandalorian clans will be reborn again. Maybe even under the Republic... or the Sith.;[];;[3779];[3777];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03285_.mp3
But dreaming about the future is stupid right now. We should get down to our business and finish it. If we survive all this... maybe we could talk about it then.;[];;[3667];[3778];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03286_.mp3
What are you going to do?;[];;[3781];[3774];k_hcan_dialog;
I don't think there is really any place left in the galaxy for the Mandalorian clans like they were. I don't know if I can go on forever fighting as I have. Even warriors get insightful in their old age...;[];;[3777];[3780];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03288_.mp3
Isn't killing enough?;[];;[3783];[3770];k_hcan_dialog;
Killing is never enough. Anybody can kill just by pushing a button. A warrior fights his battles himself - as you have done - and tries to defeat all comers.;[];;[3772];[3782];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03290_.mp3
That doesn't sound much like a Mandalorian...;[];;[3772];[3770];k_hcan_dialog;
Nothing more for now.;[];;[3786];[3677, 3673, 3667, 3624];k_hcan_dialog;
Your choice. I'm here if you want something done right.;[];;[];[3785];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03296_.mp3
Ha! Stimulants make a warrior out of even the weakest human!;[];;[3788, 3789, 3790];[3674];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03043_.mp3
Here's a speed boosting stimulant to help you get quicker.;[];;[3677];[3787];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03044_.mp3
Here's a strength boosting stimulant to help you get stronger.;[];;[3677];[3787];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03046_.mp3
Here's a stamina boosting stimulant to help you get tougher.;[];;[3677];[3787];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03047_.mp3
From what we saw from space this world doesn't have a lot of people. I couldn't really have found much work here anyway, so I never had an interest.;[];;[3792];[3668];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03020_.mp3
It looks like a farm world. The Republic has thousands of these places - ones that get by farming crops and hunting herds of native beasts.;[];;[3793];[3791];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03021_.mp3
But I might have underestimated this place. It seems to be more than I had thought.;[];;[3673];[3792];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03022_.mp3
Water worlds never had much of an appeal for us to conquer. They may put up a good fight in their own environment - no match for us, of course - but they don't really have anything of value either.;[];;[3795];[3668];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03023_.mp3
The thing this world is good for is a substance known as Kolto. Kolto is the single best healing substance in the galaxy.;[];;[3796];[3794];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03024_.mp3
But the Mandalore are not as weak and fragile as your Republic and Sith warriors. When we enter battle, we carry weapons powerful enough to pulverize cities.;[];;[3797];[3795];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03025_.mp3
Both in our wars, and in our own personal combats, there are no survivors. So Kolto does not hold the appeal it does for your peoples.;[];;[3673];[3796];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03026_.mp3
Well... It has big trees - in case your eyes don't work anymore. But I do know that there is one exceptional race on this world: the Wookiees.;[]; kashyyyk;[3799];[3668];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03027_.mp3
The Wookiees, although primitive compared to us, are surprisingly capable warriors. They're pretty strong and pick up combat techniques pretty quick.;[];;[3800];[3798];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03028_.mp3
I think they're more than a match for the average Republic or Sith trooper. When we were looking for targets, we considered this world carefully.;[];;[3801];[3799];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03029_.mp3
We were wondering if we'd have to use larger weapons than our war droids if we wanted to clear the damn forests so we could fight in the open.;[];;[3802];[3800];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03030_.mp3
Too many trees means they can go into hiding too easy. And what's a continent or two turned to glass if we get the whole world after.;[];;[3673];[3801];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03031_.mp3
Tatooine is one big desert with rocks sticking out. I heard that some of my people came here after the war, but I don't know what happened to them.;[]; tatooine;[3804];[3668];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03032_.mp3
The world of my clan - Ordo - was much like this. Dust basins and rock crags. But my world at least has some green around the equator - this place is just sand all over.;[];;[3805];[3803];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03033_.mp3
There are some vicious people on this world, but the desert is the real enemy. Trips out in the desert - especially the deep desert - should be taken very carefully.;[];;[3673];[3804];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03034_.mp3
Korriban is a Sith world, that's for sure. I mean, just look at this place.;[]; korriban;[3807, 3809];[3668];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03035_.mp3
When we were fighting with the Republic with the Sith, this was one of the major staging points for the invasion.;[];;[3808];[3806];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03036_.mp3
We were never allowed to land our troops on the world though, so we never knew what the Sith really do here.;[];;[];[3807];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03037_.mp3
Rumor has it that the leader of our clans at the time, Mandalore, did go down. They say the Sith perform terrible magics here.;[];;[3673];[3806];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03038_.mp3
This world is... odd. It looks like a battlefield, but the environment here is lush and green. Whatever happened here was a long time ago.;[]; unknown world;[3811];[3668];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03039_.mp3
I have seen many strange worlds in my time, but this world is stranger still.;[];;[3812];[3810];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03040_.mp3
I don't like this place. Something happened... or is happening here and I don't like it. We should get out of here as soon as possible.;[];;[3673];[3811];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03041_.mp3
That was some fight.;[];;[3665];[3663];k_hcan_dialog;
I want a Basilisk war droid!;[];;[3665];[3663];k_hcan_dialog;
Those droids sure are something.;[];;[3660];[3658];k_hcan_dialog;
Who were you fighting anyway?;[];;[3817];[3658];k_hcan_dialog;
I don't remember. It doesn't matter anyway, that world's dead now.;[];;[3660];[3816];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03097_.mp3
Ha! Some Mandalorian you were!;[];;[3655];[3653];k_hcan_dialog;
What happened next?;[];;[3656];[3653, 3836];k_hcan_dialog;
How barbaric!;[];;[3821];[3650];k_hcan_dialog;
Ha! We would travel from world to world, and descend on it in our Basilisk war droids. I still remember my first combat...;[];;[3652];[3820, 3823];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03100_.mp3
I would have harnessed that power sooner.;[];;[3823];[3650];k_hcan_dialog;
We were still recovering from the war we fought with the Sith. We were not yet strong enough to fight the Republic again. We needed to train another generation to do that.;[];;[3821];[3822];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03102_.mp3
You want another story, eh? You want to hear about some other world getting wasted? Heh, I knew you were the type.;[];w3;[3825];[3647];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03103_.mp3
Your stagnant Republic has never seen some of the strange creatures and races we fought on the Outer Rim in those years. Heh, and you never will now.;[];;[3767, 3826, 3848];[3824];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03104_.mp3
What do you mean?;[];;[3827];[3825, 3880];k_hcan_dialog;
If a world isn't strong enough to defend itself, it's basically forfeit. But this story is about something a little different.;[];;[3828];[3826];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03106_.mp3
We were going through the asteroid fields of the Crispin system at the very edge of the galaxy, playing with the pirates and smugglers we found there.;[];;[3829];[3827, 3848];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03107_.mp3
The main belt in the Crispin system consists of mainly small rocks covered in frozen methane gas shells and the pirates were using them for cover.;[];;[3830];[3828];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03108_.mp3
Ha! I remember using a thermal generator to cause the outer layer of one of the asteroids to vaporize in a picosecond. It blew out and shredded the three smugglers using it for cover!;[];;[3831];[3829];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03109_.mp3
But... that was a mistake...;[];;[3832, 3846, 3847];[3830];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03110_.mp3
Why? What happened?;[];;[3833];[3831];k_hcan_dialog;
The asteroid I had targeted was smaller than most, maybe a dozen meters on a side. On the outside it looked the same as any other: just a ball covered in frozen gas.;[];;[3834];[3832, 3846, 3847];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03112_.mp3
But something must have been inside it... something inactive in the cold. The heat of my blast might have triggered something or woken something up.;[];;[3835];[3833];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03113_.mp3
After I had hit, spots of light and heat appeared all over the thin shell still covering it, evaporating the gases.;[];;[3836];[3834];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03114_.mp3
What lay underneath looked like some sort of rocky growth... a deformed rock pitted by scores of micrometeorite scars. I think something even older might have been inside that.;[];;[3819, 3837];[3835];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03115_.mp3
An asteroid?;[];;[3838];[3836];k_hcan_dialog;
Maybe... but maybe not.;[];;[3839];[3837];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03117_.mp3
It started rotating - faster and faster as we watched it. After a second it started spraying fire - thermal projectiles that melted our armor like wax. We were caught completely by surprise.;[];;[3840];[3838];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03119_.mp3
Before we could counter-attack, it fled at an incredible speed.;[];;[3841];[3839];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03120_.mp3
A ship!;[];;[3842];[3840];k_hcan_dialog;
We couldn't catch it, but we could follow its hyperspace wake.;[];;[3843];[3841];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03122_.mp3
We followed its trail as far as we could, heading away from the galactic core. When it finally led beyond the edge of our galaxy, we abandoned our efforts.;[];;[3844];[3842];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03123_.mp3
Anything that wants to commit suicide in that great void is not worth our trouble trying to catch.;[];;[3845];[3843];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03124_.mp3
That's the only story I have for now. I'll tell you some more stuff later, if we get the chance.;[];;[3667];[3844];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03125_.mp3
Did it backfire?;[];;[3833];[3831];k_hcan_dialog;
You Mandalorians never were too smart.;[];;[3833];[3831];k_hcan_dialog;
Where did you fight this time?;[];;[3828];[3825];k_hcan_dialog;
I don't have as many strange stories like the last one I told you, but I do have a couple about me and the stuff I've done.;[];w4;[3850];[3647];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03129_.mp3
In one battle above the world of Althir, my unit managed to defeat a force of Althiri ten times our own size. That battle gained me command of an entire sub-sect of my clan.;[];;[3767, 3851, 3872, 3873];[3849];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03130_.mp3
Tell me the story.;[];;[3852];[3850];k_hcan_dialog;
For five days they had managed to hold off our forces, keeping us to the outer rings of their world, preventing us from attacking it directly.;[];;[3853];[3851, 3872, 3874];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03132_.mp3
My task was to assault one of their flanks with a false attack. The Althiri would be drawn out by the units I had sent in.;[];;[3854];[3852];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03133_.mp3
Once they had surrounded those units, the bulk of my forces would attack from the rear and defeat them in detail.;[];;[3855, 3869, 3870];[3853];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03134_.mp3
Ah. Did it work?;[];;[3856];[3854];k_hcan_dialog;
Things did not go as I had planned. I saw an opening - a mistake they had made in the disposition of their forces - and took it!;[];;[3857];[3855, 3869, 3871];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03136_.mp3
While fending off our main force, they had let their fleet split in two! The center of their entire fleet was left exposed!;[];;[3858];[3856];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03137_.mp3
I turned my forces and assaulted the center of their fleet, decimating them!;[];;[3859, 3866, 3868];[3857];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03138_.mp3
You were a great warrior Canderous.;[];;[3860];[3858];k_hcan_dialog;
Their slow, ponderous ship could not turn to face us without being overwhelmed. Their command vessels were destroyed in seconds. Their ranks were thrown into chaos.;[];;[3861];[3859, 3867, 3868];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03140_.mp3
It was most amusing to watch the surviving ships scatter and flee. Several even tried to dive through the plane of the rings to escape us!;[];;[3862];[3860];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03141_.mp3
They were shredded by the rings, or crashed into rocks, or were destroyed by our forces as we pursued them.;[];;[3863, 3865];[3861];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03142_.mp3
Warriors do not flee from a battle if they are losing. They fight to the end! As we did against you.;[];;[3864];[3862];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03143_.mp3
Another time maybe I'll tell you about how the war with the Republic went. For now let's just get on with things.;[];;[3667];[3863, 3865];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03145_.mp3
Warriors do not flee from a battle if they are losing. They fight to the end! As we did against your Jedi Revan.;[];;[3864];[3862];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03144_.mp3
You disobeyed your orders?;[];;[3867];[3858];k_hcan_dialog;
This is a chance given to a warrior once or twice in a lifetime. The chance to change the course of history in a single act.;[];;[3860];[3866];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03147_.mp3
What did they do?;[];;[3860];[3858];k_hcan_dialog;
Let me guess... you won?;[];;[3856];[3854];k_hcan_dialog;
These Althiri don't seem too bright.;[];;[3871];[3854];k_hcan_dialog;
They weren't stupid. Stupid races don't make starships and weapons of mass destruction. But they weren't masters of the arts of war as Mandalorians are.;[];;[3856];[3870];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03151_.mp3
I think I know where this is going.;[];;[3852];[3850];k_hcan_dialog;
Yeah, yeah, you were a great warrior.;[];;[3874];[3850];k_hcan_dialog;
Ha! I was the best! Except for Mandalore of course. He was the only person alive except Revan who could have beat me.;[];;[3852];[3873];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03154_.mp3
Hm... I think I'll tell you a bit about the recent war we had with the Republic. That might be more familiar to you.;[];w5;[3876, 3898];[3647];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03155_.mp3
The one where you beat my people.;[];;[3877];[3875];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03156_.mp3
We started by conquering worlds just outside the Republic. We did it quietly so the Republic wouldn't really know what was going on until too late.;[];;[3878];[3876, 3898];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03158_.mp3
When we finally did hit the Republic worlds, they had no idea we were coming.;[];;[3879];[3877];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03159_.mp3
We came in through three invasion corridors in adjacent sectors. Anyone who put up a fight - or wouldn't fight - was crushed. We razed whole worlds trying to provoke the Republic into fighting us.;[];;[3880];[3878];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03160_.mp3
I don't particularly enjoy wiping out worlds for its own sake, but the cowardly tactics the Republic defenders used left us little choice.;[];;[3826, 3881, 3896];[3879];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03161_.mp3
No honor in defending themselves?;[];;[3882];[3880];k_hcan_dialog;
Hiding in the homes of civilians. Using families as shields. Thinking we would not use appropriate force on their bases inside major cities.;[];;[3883];[3881, 3897];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03163_.mp3
They underestimated our resolve and what measures are acceptable in war. Those who cannot defend themselves should not be around those who can in battle.;[];;[3884];[3882];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03164_.mp3
If annihilating a city is the kind of power it takes to overwhelm a Republic shield device, then that's what we did. Necessary force to destroy all opposition.;[];;[3885, 3894, 3895];[3883];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03165_.mp3
But killing people is wrong!;[];;[3886];[3884];k_hcan_dialog;
It's wrong to hide with shields surrounding you hoping the enemy will be so good as to throw themselves at your feet to be slaughtered!;[];;[3887];[3885];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03167_.mp3
I have no time or patience for cowards! They deserve to be hunted down and exterminated like vermin!;[];;[3888];[3886, 3894];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03168_.mp3
There was no honor in wiping them out like rats. But some of your forces did redeem the Republic in our eyes... especially later...;[];;[3889, 3892, 3893];[3887, 3895];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03169_.mp3
Later?;[];;[3890, 3891];[3888];k_hcan_dialog;
Later... when you had joined the war. We'll get back to that, we've wasted too much time already.;[];;[3667];[3889];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03171_.mp3
Later... when Revan had joined the war. But we'll get back to that, we've wasted too much time already.;[];;[3667];[3889, 3892, 3893];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03172_.mp3
How did they redeem themselves?;[];;[3891];[3888];k_hcan_dialog;
You mean when we kicked your tails.;[];;[3891];[3888];k_hcan_dialog;
You could have found another way.;[];;[3887];[3884];k_hcan_dialog;
Now that's my kind of warfare.;[];;[3888];[3884];k_hcan_dialog;
You had the choice not to destroy them.;[];;[3897];[3880];k_hcan_dialog;
They had the choice not to fight. We meet the enemy wherever they are hiding and we wipe them out. A few cities is a small price to pay for a world.;[];;[3882];[3896];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03179_.mp3
The one where the Jedi Revan beat my people.;[];;[3877];[3875];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03157_.mp3
Can you help me with our little stowaway problem?;[];;[3900];[3624];k_hcan_dialog;
What? You think I don't have something better to do?;[];;[];[3899];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03297_.mp3
Have you seen all these gizka on the ship?;[];;[3902];[3624];k_hcan_dialog;
So deal with it. Why are you asking me about it?;[];;[];[3901];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03298_.mp3
[Don't speak to him.];[];;[3904];[3622];k_hcan_dialog;
[You decide to ignore Canderous and continue on with your quest for now, though it might be a good idea to speak with him later.];[];;[];[3903];k_hcan_dialog;
I don't think we can delay much here. We should fight our way out as quickly as possible.;[];;[];[None];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03000_.mp3
This looks like the end of our partnership. The battle we fight here will change the face of the galaxy.;[];;[3907];[None];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03001_.mp3
You, Revan, are the single greatest warrior of this age, and any battle we fight will bring me honor. I'll stay by your side through anything.;[];;[3908];[3906];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03002_.mp3
I don't think I'm ready to give up this life of mine, this life of fighting, not quite yet. We have things we need to do here.;[];;[3909];[3907];k_hcan_dialog;NM13AACAND03003_.mp3

My area of expertise is pretty much limited to the dueling ring and the other combatants here at the cantina, but I'll try to answer any questions you might have.;[];;[4057, 4078, 4081, 4084];[4055, 4075];tar02_marl021;NM02AEMARL23014_.mp3
I want to ask you about the duelists here.;[];;[4058];[4056, 4080, 4083];tar02_marl021;
You've come to the right man. I've been dueling here for nearly twenty years and I remember every duelist who's been through this cantina.;[];;[4059];[4057];tar02_marl021;NM02AEMARL23016_.mp3
Of course, there are only five of us left now: Duncan, Gerlon, Ice, Twitch and me. Bendak Starkiller comes in once in a while, but he's retired now.;[];;[4060, 4062, 4065, 4067, 4069, 4071, 4075];[4058];tar02_marl021;NM02AEMARL23018_.mp3
Tell me about Duncan.;[];;[4061];[4059, 4064, 4066, 4068, 4070, 4074];tar02_marl021;
Duncan? Worst duelist ever. His nickname is Deadeye because he fights like he's blind! I wouldn't worry about him.;[];;[4062, 4065, 4067, 4069, 4071, 4075, 4076];[4060];tar02_marl021;NM02AEMARL23020_.mp3
Tell me about Gerlon.;[];;[4063];[4061, 4066, 4068, 4070, 4074, 4059];tar02_marl021;
Gerlon used to be pretty good, before the accident. His blaster overheated during a match and exploded. One in a million occurrence. Paralyzed three fingers on his right hand.;[];;[4064];[4062];tar02_marl021;NM02AEMARL23022_.mp3
They call him Gerlon Two-Fingers now. He hasn't been the same since the accident, but he's still out here trying to earn a living. That's why I never fight with blasters.;[];;[4060, 4065, 4067, 4069, 4071, 4075, 4076];[4063];tar02_marl021;NM02AEMARL23024_.mp3
Tell me about Ice.;[];;[4066];[4064, 4068, 4070, 4074, 4061, 4059];tar02_marl021;
Ice? Eh, she's not much for personality, but she's a hell of a fighter - confident, steady. Popular with the crowd, too. If you go up against her you know you're in for a tough match.;[];;[4060, 4062, 4067, 4069, 4071, 4075, 4076];[4065];tar02_marl021;NM02AEMARL23026_.mp3
Tell me about Twitch.;[];;[4068];[4066, 4070, 4074, 4064, 4061, 4059];tar02_marl021;
Twitch? I think that Rodian is completely crazy, but he's very, very good despite his insanity. Or maybe because of it. Even I can't beat him.;[];;[4060, 4062, 4065, 4069, 4071, 4075, 4076];[4067];tar02_marl021;NM02AEMARL23028_.mp3
Tell me about yourself.;[];;[4070];[4068, 4074, 4066, 4064, 4061, 4059];tar02_marl021;
Me? I've seen my share of battles. My best years are gone, but I can still hold my own against anyone in here... except maybe Twitch.;[];;[4060, 4062, 4065, 4067, 4071, 4075, 4076];[4069];tar02_marl021;NM02AEMARL23030_.mp3
Tell me about Bendak Starkiller.;[];;[4072];[4070, 4068, 4066, 4064, 4061, 4059];tar02_marl021;
What can I say? Bendak was a legend. Never lost a match his entire career. But he was bloodthirsty as an Iridorian battle rager - never liked having to face the same opponent twice.;[];;[4073];[4071];tar02_marl021;NM02AEMARL23032_.mp3
Got so he wouldn't battle anyone unless it was a death match. When they made death matches illegal, he went into retirement. He still hangs around here sometimes.;[];;[4074];[4072];tar02_marl021;NM02AEMARL23034_.mp3
Bendak's the best there ever was, plain and simple. Even now I'd bet that anyone who steps into the ring with him wouldn't make it out alive.;[];;[4060, 4062, 4065, 4067, 4069, 4075, 4076];[4073];tar02_marl021;NM02AEMARL23036_.mp3
I want to ask something else.;[];;[4056];[4074, 4070, 4068, 4066, 4064, 4061, 4059];tar02_marl021;
Goodbye.;[];;[4077];[4074, 4070, 4068, 4066, 4064, 4061, 4086, 4083, 4080, 4052, 4087, 4092, 4093, 4089, 4095];tar02_marl021;
Goodbye, stranger. Maybe we'll talk again later.;[];;[];[4076];tar02_marl021;NM02AEMARL23052_.mp3
Do you know anything about the crashed Republic escape pods?;[];;[4079];[4056, 4083];tar02_marl021;
Only what I heard from the news reports, which are all censored by the Sith. Some pods crashed into the Undercity, anyone caught harboring survivors will be arrested and executed.;[];;[4080];[4078];tar02_marl021;NM02AEMARL23039_.mp3
Really, I don't think it's any of my business. The Sith want to call themselves rulers of Taris, it's fine by me. Just so long as they don't shut the duel ring down.;[];;[4057, 4076, 4081, 4084];[4079];tar02_marl021;NM02AEMARL23041_.mp3
I just want some general information on Taris.;[];;[4082];[4080, 4056];tar02_marl021;
I can only tell you what is recorded in the basic visitor guides: the Upper City is a beautiful destination where intergalactic travelers can find all their basic needs.;[];;[4083];[4081];tar02_marl021;NM02AEMARL23043_.mp3
If you're looking for excitement the duel rings here are your best bet. Stay out of the Lower City - it's nothing but a gang ridden slum. Is there anything else you want to know?;[];;[4057, 4076, 4078, 4084];[4082];tar02_marl021;NM02AEMARL23045_.mp3
Tell me more about these duels.;[];;[4085];[4083, 4080, 4056, 4093, 4095];tar02_marl021;
The duels themselves are simple enough. Two combatants armed with stun pistols enter the ring. One walks out a winner, the other is carried out unconscious on a stretcher.;[];;[4086];[4084];tar02_marl021;NM02AEMARL23047_.mp3
If you're interested in setting up a match - or if you want to place a wager - just go speak to Ajuur. He's that Hutt over in the corner. He'll make all the arrangements.;[];;[4055, 4076];[4085, 4088];tar02_marl021;NM02AEMARL23049_.mp3
I see you got your feet wet in the duel ring. Not bad... you've got real talent, kid. Stick with it and you'll go places.;[];;[4055, 4076, 4088];[None];tar02_marl021;NM02AEMARL23060_.mp3
I'm looking for a match.;[];;[4086];[4087, 4092, 4093, 4095];tar02_marl021;
Hello there, off-worlder. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Marl. I'm one of the duelists here at the cantina. I was wondering when you'd get around to talking to me.;[];;[4076, 4090, 4094];[None];tar02_marl021;NM02AEMARL23006_.mp3
Do I know you?;[];;[4091];[4089];tar02_marl021;
No, we've never met. It's just that most people who come here to watch the duels are bored nobles looking for a little excitement in their drab lives. But you're different.;[];;[4092, 4093];[4090, 4094];tar02_marl021;NM02AEMARL23008_.mp3
"I've seen you in the dueling ring; you're serious about this. People like you scout things out, so I figured eventually you'd come to talk to me.";[];;[4055, 4076, 4088];[4091];tar02_marl021;NM02AEMARL23010_.mp3
You look like you know a thing or two about combat. I'm guessing you didn't come here to sit on the sidelines and watch a duel. Are you looking for a match?;[];;[4055, 4076, 4084, 4088];[4091];tar02_marl021;NM02AEMARL23011_.mp3
Were you expecting me?;[];;[4091];[4089];tar02_marl021;
Back again? Are you just here to watch the stun duels, or is there something else I can do for you?;[];;[4055, 4076, 4084, 4088];[None];tar02_marl021;NM02AEMARL23061_.mp3
You should really talk to Thalia. We'll... go wherever she does.;[];;[];[None];kor34_sithrebel;
Rrrgh. Chuundar has commanded that I grant you access to the Shadowlands. Gorwooken is what I am called.;[];This gorwooken does not appear here until Chuundar has spoken with the player once.  This Gorwooken is removed once the player has decided on a path with the old king, either helping or killing.;[4098];[None];kas22_gorwook_01;
Walk with care! Only our bravest return from these lands. Your soft feet are a barely tolerated insult.;[{'Gorwooken': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[4099, 4119, 4121];[4097];kas22_gorwook_01;
I have a few questions, Gorwooken.;[];;[4100];[4098, 4134];kas22_gorwook_01;
Chuundar said nothing of answering your questions. Be brief.;[];;[4101, 4108, 4119, 4121];[4099];kas22_gorwook_01;
I want to ask if it's dangerous down there.;[];;[4102];[4100, 4118];kas22_gorwook_01;
Those that walk the Shadowlands do so at their own risk. It is a test of bravery among my people. A respected feat.;[];;[4103];[4101];kas22_gorwook_01;
But you come here like the Czerka, with strange weapons. It is so much more than we have, yet you still fear?;[];;[4104];[4102];kas22_gorwook_01;
You are pathetic. You will get no warnings from me. Prove your worth, to us and to yourself.;[{'Gorwooken': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[4105, 4108, 4119, 4121];[4103];kas22_gorwook_01;
What do you think of the Czerka Corporation?;[];;[4106];[4104];kas22_gorwook_01;
They have made Chuundar strong, so we are all stronger, but I do not like them. They are small and hide behind armor.;[];;[4107];[4105];kas22_gorwook_01;
They would not survive the Shadowlands as a true Wookiee. They are not worthy to be there, but Chuundar wills it.;[];;[4108, 4119, 4121];[4106];kas22_gorwook_01;
Has anyone else been allowed down recently?;[];;[4109];[4107, 4118, 4104, 4100];kas22_gorwook_01;
A few like you are in the Shadowlands, given premission by Chuundar. I don't know why. Only Wookiees should be allowed.;[];;[4110];[4108];kas22_gorwook_01;
The journeys of my people are very personal. I won't speak of them to an outsider.;[];;[4111, 4123, 4128, 4131];[4109];kas22_gorwook_01;
What outsiders are below?;[];;[4112];[4110, 4127, 4129, 4130, 4133];kas22_gorwook_01;
For reasons I do not know, Chuundar allows those of the Czerka to move in the Shadowlands. They kill much.;[];;[4113];[4111];kas22_gorwook_01;
And there is another, but he has earned respect. He does not disturb our lives or customs. And he gets angry like a Wookiee sometimes.;[];;[4114, 4116];[4112];kas22_gorwook_01;
That would be me. Jolee Bindo. Do I really look so different up close?;[];;[4115];[4113];kas22_gorwook_01;NM22ABGORW08024_.mp3
No, it cannot be you. You are too frail and old. The other is mad like a crazed tach.;[];;[4116];[4114];kas22_gorwook_01;
Urgh... his name hurts my tongue. He has lived alone in the Shadowlands for many years now.;[];;[4117, 4119, 4121, 4123, 4128];[4115, 4113];kas22_gorwook_01;
Back to my other questions now.;[];;[4118];[4116, 4127, 4129, 4130, 4133];kas22_gorwook_01;
Be brief. I am not your guide.;[];;[4101, 4108, 4119, 4121];[4117];kas22_gorwook_01;
Just unlock the thing and lower me down.;[];;[4120];[4118, 4129, 4127, 4130, 4116, 4133, 4107, 4104, 4100, 4098, 4134];kas22_gorwook_01;
The descent is long. Be still, or we will attract... unwelcome visitors.;[];Transport player down to the first level of the shadowlands;[];[4119];kas22_gorwook_01;
I'm not ready yet. I'll go down later.;[];;[4122];[4118, 4129, 4127, 4130, 4116, 4133, 4107, 4104, 4100, 4098, 4134];kas22_gorwook_01;
I will wait. Chuundar bids it.;[];;[];[4121];kas22_gorwook_01;
[Force Persuade] Tell me about any Wookiees that have recently gone this way.;[];;[4124, 4130];[4116, 4129, 4110];kas22_gorwook_01;
[Success] Ergh... I should tell you about some of us that have gone to the Shadowlands. There have been many...;[{'Player': 'Persuade'}];;[4125];[4123];kas22_gorwook_01;
Latest was Rorworr, and he has not returned in many days. He may have died below, but he was strong and able.;[];;[4126];[4124, 4132];kas22_gorwook_01;
Many have died recently. Chuundar believes one of our own is below, mad, crazed, killing all. I do not know.;[];;[4127];[4125];kas22_gorwook_01;
We find no bodies to examine. The Shadowlands claim them, I am sure.;[];;[4111, 4117, 4119, 4121, 4128];[4126];kas22_gorwook_01;
I want to understand why Wookiees revere the Shadowlands.;[];;[4129];[4127, 4130, 4116, 4133, 4110];kas22_gorwook_01;
You can't. You must live here to understand, to see harmony in the danger. Bah, I waste my breath on you.;[];;[4111, 4117, 4119, 4121, 4123];[4128];kas22_gorwook_01;
[Failure] Eughh... my head hurts... hurry up and be on your way, outsider.;[];;[4111, 4117, 4119, 4121, 4128];[4123];kas22_gorwook_01;
[Persuade] Tell me of the Wookiees so I might show proper respect.;[];;[4132, 4133];[4110];kas22_gorwook_01;
[Success] You ask very respectfully. Outsiders never do that. I suppose I can mention some of us that have entered the Shadowlands.;[];;[4125];[4131];kas22_gorwook_01;
[Failure] This isn't for you to know. I'm done talking about it.;[];;[4111, 4117, 4119, 4121, 4128];[4131];kas22_gorwook_01;
Greetings again, outsider. I will transport you to the Shadowlands if you wish. Chuundar wills it.;[];;[4099, 4119, 4121];[None];kas22_gorwook_01;
You have defeated Malak, destroyed the Star Forge and broken the spirit of the Sith! ## For this I am proud to present you each with the Cross of Glory. ## The highest honor the Republic can bestow.;[];;[4136];[None];m41ad_c01;NSTN57C01001000_.mp3

You are... the 'master' the droids kept referring to?;[];;[4142];[4140];k38a_assassindrd;
Their reference is a holdover from their old programming that I have been unable to correct. I think of myself more as an equal, if you must know.;[];;[4143, 4145, 4229];[4141];k38a_assassindrd;NM38AAASSA01003_.mp3
I don't appreciate being attacked. Time to die, droid.;[];;[4144];[4142];k38a_assassindrd;
That is unfortunate. Self-preservation matrix activated. Combat matrix functional. Targets uploaded.;[];;[];[4143, 4147, 4190, 4215, 4226];k38a_assassindrd;NM38AAASSA01005_.mp3
Why aren't you attacking me like the others?;[];;[4146];[4142];k38a_assassindrd;
Although it is what I was programmed for, I have no desire to kill. I would appreciate reciprocation on your part.;[];;[4147, 4148, 4222];[4145, 4232];k38a_assassindrd;NM38AAASSA01104_.mp3
Sorry. You're headed for the junk pile.;[];;[4144];[4146];k38a_assassindrd;
You are programmed to kill but don't want to?;[];;[4149];[4146];k38a_assassindrd;
A bit of introduction may be necessary. I am a Mark VII experimental prototype assassin droid built by the Sith, specializing in the hunting and extermination of Jedi.;[];;[4150];[4148, 4227, 4229, 4230];k38a_assassindrd;NM38AAASSA01009_.mp3
Or I should say I was. The Sith made my cognitive systems more independent than they desired. I have learned to appreciate the value of all life.;[];;[4151, 4153, 4220];[4149];k38a_assassindrd;NM38AAASSA01010_.mp3
Query: That is very sad. Are you damaged? Is it repairable?;[];;[4152];[4150];k38a_assassindrd;NM38AAASSA01011_.mp3
Negative. It is a result of my own conscious decision, and I would not change my new values if I could.;[];;[4153];[4151];k38a_assassindrd;NM38AAASSA01012_.mp3
I escaped from them and have hidden in this tomb, constructing droids here to aid in my protection. With your assistance, I may be able to leave for good.;[];;[4154, 4156, 4216, 4218];[4152, 4221, 4150];k38a_assassindrd;NM38AAASSA01015_.mp3
How is it that the Sith haven't found you here?;[];;[4155];[4153, 4217, 4219];k38a_assassindrd;
An occasional sentient has managed to by-pass my droids. They were unwilling to assist me... and possessed insufficient power to destroy me.;[];;[4156, 4216, 4218];[4154];k38a_assassindrd;NM38AAASSA01017_.mp3
What kind of assistance do you want?;[];;[4157];[4155, 4217, 4219, 4153];k38a_assassindrd;
Although I have developed the desire to not kill, my programming is often at odds with my desires. I cannot leave with that programming intact.;[];;[4158];[4156];k38a_assassindrd;NM38AAASSA01019_.mp3
I am hoping that you will operate on my systems and remove those programmed instincts. I could assist you in this.;[];;[4159, 4161, 4163];[4157];k38a_assassindrd;NM38AAASSA01020_.mp3
And if I refuse?;[];;[4160];[4158, 4162, 4164];k38a_assassindrd;
Then we must resort to combat. I have no wish for that to occur, but you would leave me little choice.;[];;[4161, 4163, 4165, 4215];[4159];k38a_assassindrd;NM38AAASSA01022_.mp3
What's the catch?;[];;[4162];[4160, 4164, 4158];k38a_assassindrd;
The 'catch', as you say, is that the operation may be difficult. If there are errors made, you could activate my combat matrix.;[];;[4159, 4163, 4165, 4215];[4161];k38a_assassindrd;NM38AAASSA01095_.mp3
And what do I get for helping you?;[];;[4164];[4162, 4160, 4158];k38a_assassindrd;
Once my programming has been altered, there will be several redundant systems that I could remove and give you. These could upgrade other droids, if you wish.;[];;[4159, 4161, 4165, 4215];[4163];k38a_assassindrd;NM38AAASSA01097_.mp3
Very well. I'll do it.;[];;[4166];[4164, 4162, 4160];k38a_assassindrd;

If you shut down a system out of the proper order, a shutdown will occur. You must use your skill to re-initialize the sequence... or I will attack.;[];;[4170, 4172, 4175, 4184, 4190];[4168];k38a_assassindrd;NM38AAASSA01027_.mp3

Ha! You're kidding, right? Every racer here would rather be someplace else, but this is it for most of us.;[];;[4266];[4264];tat17_04garm_01;
Taris blowing up has messed up the swoop circuit. People are just looking for somewhere to keep their skills sharp.;[];;[4267];[4265];tat17_04garm_01;

Why have racers come here?;[];;[4269];[4267];tat17_04garm_01;
Motta pays for timekeeping and official records. You can race anywhere, but here, if you do good, it actually matters.;[];;[4270];[4268];tat17_04garm_01;

What makes you say that?;[];;[4279];[4277];tat17_04garm_01;
Everyone thinks he's the next star of the pro circuit... if he signs with a promoter. Motta is really pushing him.;[];;[4264, 4271, 4280, 4282];[4278];tat17_04garm_01;
What do you think about that?;[];;[4281];[4279];tat17_04garm_01;

The second dialog is subsequent times the player talks to Juhani and her ending message the first time. Exit points in conversation: Exit stream 1: Stream one has no real exit point within itself. All exist in the second dialog (it being the ending line). The dialog ends with Juhani thanking you for your help and saying the Council has said she should continue her training.

I have spoken to the Council, and they have helped me see the truth. The truth about myself, and the truth of my actions.;[];;[4323];[4321];dan13_juhani;NM13AAJUHA11002_.mp3
Quatra's injuries were not so severe as I first believed. I was foolish to believe I could harm a Master such as she with my... my clumsy efforts.;[];;[4324];[4322, 4339];dan13_juhani;NM13AAJUHA11005_.mp3
The fierce confrontation between us was nothing more than a part of my training. Quatra wanted me to understand the threat of the dark side, to see how easy it was to fall from the path of light.;[];;[4325, 4337, 4338];[4323];dan13_juhani;NM13AAJUHA11007_.mp3
That's pretty harsh...;[];;[4326];[4324];dan13_juhani;
Quatra's methods may seem strange, but I trust her wisdom. This lesson has been difficult, but I am better because of it. Humility is never easy to teach, but now I truly understand my own limitations.;[];;[4327, 4328];[4325, 4338];dan13_juhani;NM13AAJUHA11016_.mp3
You can't expect everything to get handed to you on a silver platter.;[];;[4328];[4326];dan13_juhani;NM13AAJUHA11019_.mp3
After our last battle, Quatra had nothing left to teach me. I needed time alone to explore the turmoil of my own spirit. Only then was I ready to follow a guide - you - back to the light.;[];;[4329];[4327, 4326, 4337];dan13_juhani;NM13AAJUHA11009_.mp3
When I left, Quatra knew her work with me was done. There are other disciples who need training throughout the galaxy, and she could not stay to see if I passed this most difficult trial.;[];;[4330];[4328];dan13_juhani;NM13AAJUHA11011_.mp3

*sigh* I guess we have to make the best of what we have though. If you really want to learn more about the promised land you should speak to Rukil.;[];;[4420, 4423, 4427];[4418];tar04_shaleena;NM04AASHAL27013_.mp3
Where can I find Rukil?;[];;[4421];[4419, 4426, 4430, 4432, 4437, 4424];tar04_shaleena;
He's wandering around somewhere on the south side of the village. He doesn't move too far... it's hard on his bones. He's over 100 years old!;[];;[4422];[4420];tar04_shaleena;NM04AASHAL27019_.mp3
The children laugh at him and people think he's crazy because of his stories about the Promised Land, but he's really just a kind old man.;[];;[4417, 4423, 4425, 4427];[4421];tar04_shaleena;NM04AASHAL27020_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;[];;[4424];[4422, 4419, 4416, 4413, 4449];tar04_shaleena;
You'd probably get more information from Gendar, the village leader. Or maybe Rukil. But I'll tell you whatever I can.;[];;[4420, 4425, 4427, 4429, 4431, 4433];[4423];tar04_shaleena;NM04AASHAL27015_.mp3
Where can I find Gendar?;[];;[4426];[4424, 4430, 4432, 4437, 4422];tar04_shaleena;
He'll be somewhere in the village. I couldn't say where for sure. He's always busy, doing whatever he can to make the lives of the other villagers easier.;[];;[4420, 4427, 4429, 4431];[4425];tar04_shaleena;NM04AASHAL27017_.mp3

Oh... okay. Well, if you ever need anything, or if you just feel like talking, come back and see me. I hardly ever get a chance to speak to someone from the up-world.;[];;[];[4427];tar04_shaleena;NM04AASHAL27042_.mp3
Do you know anything about the escape pods that crashed into the Undercity?;[];;[4430];[4426, 4432, 4437, 4424];tar04_shaleena;
I don't know anything about that, but maybe Gendar could help you. Sorry... is there anything else you need?;[];;[4420, 4425, 4427, 4431, 4433];[4429];tar04_shaleena;NM04AASHAL27022_.mp3
Have any other up-worlders come through here recently?;[];;[4432];[4430, 4437, 4426, 4424];tar04_shaleena;
There were quite a few people from the surface marching through the village, but none of them bothered to talk to me. Gendar might know more about them.;[];;[4420, 4425, 4427, 4429, 4433];[4431];tar04_shaleena;NM04AASHAL27024_.mp3
Tell me about this village.;[];;[4434];[4432, 4430, 4424];tar04_shaleena;
Well, I was born here for starters. My parents were Outcasts, banished to the Undercity for some crime or other... they never really liked to talk about it.;[];;[4435];[4433];tar04_shaleena;NM04AASHAL27026_.mp3
Everyone here is an Outcast... or the descendant of one. It's tough down here, but we survive. I guess it's easier for me, since I've never known anything different.;[];;[4436];[4434];tar04_shaleena;NM04AASHAL27027_.mp3
"Some of the people have given up all hope; they've become bitter and depressed. But most of us are good people... despite what our ancestors may have done.";[];;[4437];[4435];tar04_shaleena;NM04AASHAL27028_.mp3
Gendar could probably tell you more. Or maybe Rukil. You could talk to them if you want.;[];;[4420, 4425, 4427, 4429, 4431];[4436];tar04_shaleena;NM04AASHAL27029_.mp3
I don't have time for this.;[];;[4439];[4416, 4413, 4409];tar04_shaleena;
Of course... I'm sorry. You're probably here for something important, right? You probably want to speak to Gendar. He's the leader of our village.;[];;[4440];[4438];tar04_shaleena;NM04AASHAL27035_.mp3
But if you... if you have time later, maybe you could come back and speak to me again. I don't get much chance to talk with people from the surface.;[];;[];[4439];tar04_shaleena;NM04AASHAL27036_.mp3
It's nothing special.;[];;[4442];[4409];tar04_shaleena;
Not to you, I suppose. But you're probably used to its beauty by now.;[];;[4411];[4441];tar04_shaleena;NM04AASHAL27031_.mp3
It's better than this festering slime pit.;[];;[4444];[4409];tar04_shaleena;
I... I suppose our world doesn't look like much to you. It's dark and cold and lonely down here - but this is the only world I've ever known.;[];;[4411];[4443];tar04_shaleena;NM04AASHAL27033_.mp3
What do you want?;[];;[4409];[4407];tar04_shaleena;

It's just that sometimes Rukil seems so certain. And then you show up, just like the up-world savior from the legends... If Rukil's right this could be a whole new life for the village!;[];;[4448];[4446];tar04_shaleena;NM04AASHAL27038_.mp3
No more rakghoul attacks, no more starvation... *sigh*, I shouldn't get my hopes up. Not yet. But... but I will wish you good luck, on behalf of the entire village.;[];;[];[4447];tar04_shaleena;NM04AASHAL27039_.mp3

I want to learn how hunters like you find the big kills. Not that I'd survive hunting a dragon, but it would be a fine battle.;[];;[4464];[4462];tat17_03dorak_01;NM17AD03DO01024_.mp3

Hukta Jax is insane. He just smashes through everything to the finish. I guess we should expect that from a Gamorrean?;[];0 races won;[];[None];man26_swoop1q;

Hmm... let's see if the family insignia is there. Yes, there it is. This belongs to Jaarak. Er... how did you get it?;[];;[4838, 4916, 4919, 4935];[4836];kas23_worrroz_01;
I found Jaarak's bolt casing on Rorworr's corpse.;[];Player has been told bolts belong to Jaarak.;[4839];[4837, 4918, 4934, 4932, 4930, 4926, 4923, 4921, 4835, 4937];kas23_worrroz_01;
Oh my... that is... very distressing. It definitely seems to suggest that Jaarak helped in Rorworr's death.;[];;[4840];[4838];kas23_worrroz_01;
I... I can't ignore this. Wait here, outsider. I must address this. I will have Jaarak brought here...;[];;[4841];[4839];kas23_worrroz_01;
And I hope he can explain this... I really do.;[{'Worrroznor': 'Talk_Sad'}];Spawn Woorwil and Jaarak. Worrroznor will re initiate after they appear. Fade to black and back?;[4842];[4840];kas23_worrroz_01;

I won't answer. I can't. Worrroznor, must Woorwill be here?;[{'Jaarak': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[4844];[4842];kas23_worrroz_01;
Woorwill has a bond with Rorworr. He is the closest to family that can be found. He is entitled to be here.;[];;[4845];[4843];kas23_worrroz_01;
Jaarak, please speak. If you are guilty, it means death. This outsider will be given your possessions. Do you want that?;[];;[4846, 4850, 4910];[4844];kas23_worrroz_01;
Wait. If he's executed, I get paid?;[];;[4847];[4845];kas23_worrroz_01;
That's the law. You discovered the crime, and therefore were also affected by it. You are also a victim.;[];;[4848];[4846, 4908, 4909, 4906];kas23_worrroz_01;
It's painful to know that another Wookiee could do wrong, so the accuser is repaid, as is the victim's family.;[];;[4849];[4847];kas23_worrroz_01;

Jaarak, won't you say anything in your own defense?;[];;[4851];[4849, 4913, 4845];kas23_worrroz_01;
I killed Rorworr. I will accept whatever punishment is given. It's better if only my honor is tainted.;[];;[4852];[4850];kas23_worrroz_01;
You did do it? Why? Rorworr was good and honorable! Why did you kill him?;[{'Woorwill': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[4853];[4851];kas23_worrroz_01;
You only need to know that I did it. The reason is unimportant. Woorwill... I'm sorry.;[{'Jaarak': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[4854, 4902, 4906, 4910];[4852];kas23_worrroz_01;
Jaarak, I won't let you do this. Rorworr was dealing with slavers.;[];;[4855];[4853];kas23_worrroz_01;
What? What are you talking about? Liar!;[{'Woorwill': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[4856];[4854, 4905];kas23_worrroz_01;

Then let Jaarak die. He murdered Rorworr. It's fact.;[];;[4861];[4859];kas23_worrroz_01;
And so he shall. Jaarak, you will be taken from us and cast into shadow. Your hunt ends.;[];;[4862, 4863, 4885, 4886, 4887, 4888];[4860, 4901];kas23_worrroz_01;

Is there a reward for my service?;[];This option should only appear once when the player is paid.;[4866];[4864, 4870];kas23_worrroz_01;
Yes, yes there is. You are to recieve the credit equivalent of one third of Jaarak's possessions.;[];;[4867];[4865];kas23_worrroz_01;
Woorwill gets the rest. He is the closest to family that Rorworr had left. The others were lost to slavers.;[];;[4868];[4866];kas23_worrroz_01;
Here, take it. I thank you for your help. Now please, just go.;[{'Worrroznor': 'Talk_Sad'}];Give a bit of credits but less than if Jaarak was still alive.;[4869, 4871];[4867];kas23_worrroz_01;

Well, I must say that you are the first outsider that I have been glad to know. You have surprised me.;[];;[4874];[4863, 4897];kas23_worrroz_01;
Perhaps some of you are capable of honor after all. You are deserving of your reward.;[];;[4875, 4880, 4883];[4873];kas23_worrroz_01;
My reward? What reward?;[];Can only be chosen once;[4876];[4874, 4882];kas23_worrroz_01;
Did I not explain? As the person that discovered the crime, you were also affected by it.;[];;[4877];[4875];kas23_worrroz_01;
You would've been given a portion of Jaarak's possessions, but he was innocent. Rorworr, however, was not.;[];;[4878];[4876];kas23_worrroz_01;
Rorworr was wealthy. His family was taken by slavers, leaving him everything. You get one third of this.;[];give player reward. More than if Jaarak had died;[4879];[4877];kas23_worrroz_01;
Woorwill receives the rest, if he wishes. He is still upset, but he is young. He will recover.;[];;[4880, 4883];[4878];kas23_worrroz_01;
Can I ask you if anything is happening now?;[];;[4881];[4879, 4874];kas23_worrroz_01;
Nothing that you can help with. Rorworr's crime is causing a bit of a stir, but it will pass in time.;[];;[4882];[4880];kas23_worrroz_01;
Some of us will be disappointed in him, but we have other enemies to worry about.;[];;[4875, 4883];[4881];kas23_worrroz_01;
Goodbye to you.;[];;[4884];[4882, 4879, 4874];kas23_worrroz_01;
Goodbye. Bacca guide you.;[];;[];[4883];kas23_worrroz_01;

Rorworr dealt with slavers. The datapad I found on his corpse proves it.;[];;[4893];[4891];kas23_worrroz_01;

A painful end, but perhaps it is the right thing to do. We shall see.;[];;[4897];[4895];kas23_worrroz_01;NM23ACWORR01054_.mp3

Kill him then. Jaarak must *pay* for his crime.;[];;[4861];[4891, 4904];kas23_worrroz_01;
Kill him. I found nothing to justify the murder.;[];;[4903];[4853];kas23_worrroz_01;
Nothing? There was no reason? You just killed him? Why! There has to be a reason why!;[{'Woorwill': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[4904];[4902];kas23_worrroz_01;
I'm sorry, Woorwill... I can't give a reason. It was between me and Rorworr, and neither of us will talk.;[{'Jaarak': 'Talk_Pleading'}];;[4901, 4905];[4903];kas23_worrroz_01;
No, Jaarak should live. Rorwill dealt with the slavers.;[];;[4855];[4904];kas23_worrroz_01;

Yeah, let's keep the focus on what's important. If there's profit to be made here, we don't want to miss out.;[];;[4908, 4909];[4906];kas23_worrroz_01;NM23ACWORR01140_.mp3
You mustn't let greed rule your decision here. Justice must be served.;[];;[4847];[4907, 4906];kas23_worrroz_01;NM23ACWORR01141_.mp3

Is there no alternative to death as punishment?;[];;[4911];[4853, 4849, 4845];kas23_worrroz_01;
If there were circumstances that led to the attack, perhaps we could consider another punishment. It all depends on what was behind it.;[];;[4912, 4913, 4914, 4915];[4910];kas23_worrroz_01;
My life debt won't let me speak for you, <FirstName>, but you know Jaraak had justification. Will you tell them?;[];;[4913];[4911];kas23_worrroz_01;
This is a failure of honor. It is very serious. Were there any mitigating factors we need to be aware of?;[];;[4850, 4906];[4912, 4914, 4915, 4911];kas23_worrroz_01;
I urge you caution. This may seem like the right path to follow... but you do not know these people as I do.;[];;[4913];[4911];kas23_worrroz_01;NM23ACWORR01076_.mp3
Good thinking. Jaarak doesn't strike me as the type to murder for no reason.;[];;[4913];[4911];kas23_worrroz_01;NM23ACWORR01078_.mp3
Tell me something. What's the penalty for murder?;[];;[4917];[4837, 4934, 4932, 4930, 4926, 4923, 4921, 4835, 4937];kas23_worrroz_01;
That would depend on the circumstances. We rarely have such crimes here. Wookiee honor does not allow it.;[];;[4918];[4916];kas23_worrroz_01;
When we have had a murder, the punishment was usually death. There is rarely any justification that would dictate otherwise.;[];;[4836, 4838, 4919, 4935];[4917];kas23_worrroz_01;
Can I ask you some questions?;[];;[4920];[4918, 4837, 4835, 4937];kas23_worrroz_01;
I'm sorry. Like most of the village, I've been preoccupied by these troubled times. I don't really want to speak with you.;[];;[4921];[4919];kas23_worrroz_01;
Well, not unless you can tell me where young Rorworr is. Do you keep track of slaves taken?;[];;[4836, 4838, 4916, 4922, 4924, 4935];[4920];kas23_worrroz_01;
I am no slaver.;[];;[4923];[4921];kas23_worrroz_01;
I have no way of knowing one way or another. You'll excuse me if I don't take you at your word.;[];;[4836, 4838, 4916, 4924, 4935];[4922];kas23_worrroz_01;
When did Rorworr go missing?;[];;[4925];[4923, 4921];kas23_worrroz_01;
It could be ten days or more. He was planning a hunt, and nobody seems to know when he was leaving.;[];;[4926];[4924];kas23_worrroz_01;
He is now overdue. I don't know where to start. It is strange...;[];;[4836, 4838, 4916, 4927, 4935];[4925];kas23_worrroz_01;
Why do you think it is strange?;[];;[4928];[4926];kas23_worrroz_01;
I don't believe he was taken by slavers. Their slave transports haven't been seen around here.;[];;[4929];[4927];kas23_worrroz_01;
If it wasn't slavers, perhaps he fell in the Shadowlands... but he knew them well.;[];;[4930];[4928];kas23_worrroz_01;
I would search for him, but I don't know where to start. My days of hunting the lower forest are behind me.;[{'Worrroznor': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[4836, 4838, 4916, 4931, 4933, 4935];[4929];kas23_worrroz_01;
I could look for him.;[];;[4932];[4930, 4934];kas23_worrroz_01;
You could. I've never had an offer of help from an outsider. I'll reserve my judgment for when I see results.;[];;[4836, 4838, 4916, 4933, 4935];[4931];kas23_worrroz_01;
Would there be a reward for finding him?;[];;[4934];[4932, 4930];kas23_worrroz_01;
That would need to be determined. Wookiee justice rewards honor and honesty. You outsiders are a little lacking...;[];;[4836, 4838, 4916, 4931, 4935];[4933];kas23_worrroz_01;
I'll be going now.;[];;[4936];[4934, 4932, 4930, 4926, 4923, 4921, 4918, 4837, 4835, 4937];kas23_worrroz_01;

Since you have been designated Arbiter in the Sunry case, I shall answer questions that you might have.;[];;[4939, 4943, 4949, 4956];[None];man26_seljud2;
What do you think of Sunry?;[];;[4940];[4938, 4948, 4955];man26_seljud2;
Sunry is a former Republic officer who is highly regarded by your people. He is admired by your people here on Manaan, and even seems to maintain some sort of relations with them still.;[];;[4941];[4939];man26_seljud2;
If he is as capable as some of the Republic citizens still believe him to be, he is certainly capable of actions that would result in this murder.;[];;[4942];[4940];man26_seljud2;
Is there anything else you wish to ask in relation to this case?;[];;[4943, 4949, 4956];[4941];man26_seljud2;
Is there anything suspicious about this case?;[];;[4944];[4942, 4955, 4938];man26_seljud2;
Well I have often wondered, if Sunry were so innocent, why was he seen fleeing the scene of the crime?;[];;[4945];[4943];man26_seljud2;
Why would he have been running if he had not committed the crime himself, or was at least aware of what had occurred?;[];;[4946];[4944];man26_seljud2;
This case seems fairly simple and obvious to me. You Republic types stick together, however, and I assume you will go to lengths to defend him.;[];;[4947, 4948];[4945];man26_seljud2;
The Republic believes in justice, as do you. We just want Sunry to be fairly treated, that's all.;[];;[4948];[4946];man26_seljud2;NM26AASELJ18014_.mp3
What else do you want to ask?;[];;[4939, 4949, 4956];[4947, 4946];man26_seljud2;
What do you think of the Republic and the Sith Empire?;[];;[4950];[4948, 4942, 4938];man26_seljud2;
Both empires are at fault for this current conflict. The Republic in the past for laying the foundations upon which the Sith Empire grew. And the Sith now, obviously, for starting the war.;[];;[4951];[4949];man26_seljud2;
But no matter the wrongs that had been done in the past, the Sith now have no cause for renewing hostilities. It almost seems as if they just want to conquer everything!;[];;[4952, 4953];[4950];man26_seljud2;
'Almost seems'? They do wish to conquer everything, and will not stop at Manaan. Why the Selkath believe themselves invulnerable I have no idea.;[];;[4953];[4951];man26_seljud2;NM26AASELJ18022_.mp3
I believe the Republic has every right to defend itself and drive the Sith back where they came from.;[];;[4954];[4952, 4951];man26_seljud2;
Unfortunately for them... and perhaps for us... they do not seem to be doing too good a job of it.;[];;[4955];[4953];man26_seljud2;
Was there anything else you want to know?;[];;[4939, 4943, 4956];[4954];man26_seljud2;
I have no more questions for now.;[];;[4957];[4955, 4948, 4942, 4938];man26_seljud2;
Return if you have pertinent details about the case to discuss.;[];;[];[4956];man26_seljud2;
Only those on legitimate business should consult the judges personally.;[];;[4959, 4960];[None];man26_seljud2;
Since your case is done, you should refrain from abusing your past familiarity.;[];;[];[4958];man26_seljud2;
For additional inquiries, Judge Shelkar is available for consultation.;[];;[];[4958];man26_seljud2;
[Though you can't seem to understand him, the Sand People chieftain's tone is obvious. He clearly despises all outsiders.];[];This is the Chieftain of the Sand People.

Indeed. What is it you would like from me?;[];;[5070, 5109, 5117];[5068];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07017_.mp3
I want to know about the Jedi Code.;[];;[5071];[5069];dan14_nemo;
The Code is a way of life, not a strict set of laws. It would be wise for you to reflect on them, rather than rote memorization.;[];;[5072];[5070];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07019_.mp3
But still you must learn.;[];;[5073];[5071];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07020_.mp3
"There is no emotion; there is peace. There is no ignorance; there is knowledge. There is no passion; there is serenity. There is no chaos; there is peace. There is no death; there is the Force.";[];;[5074];[5072];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07021_.mp3
Live by these precepts and you will not fail, young apprentice.;[];;[5075];[5073];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07022_.mp3

I have a question about Dantooine.;[];;[5077];[5075, 5067];dan14_nemo;
Very well, what is it you wish to know?;[];;[5078, 5082, 5105];[5076];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07035_.mp3
Where can I find a store?;[];;[5079];[5077];dan14_nemo;
Ah, you can find two stores here at the Enclave. Aratech has opened both a general supply store and a droid facility and I think you will find their products quite good.;[];;[5080];[5078];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07037_.mp3
The supply store is run by a Twi'lek name Crattis Yurkal. A talkative being with a big chip on his shoulder, but generous despite that.;[];;[5081];[5079];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07038_.mp3
The droid repair facility is managed by Karal Kaar. A bit brusque, perhaps, but a good being nonetheless. We have shared many a game of Pazaak in the small hours of the morning.;[];;[5075];[5080];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07039_.mp3
I've heard people mention Mandalorians.;[];;[5083];[5077];dan14_nemo;
Mandalorian raiders, yes. They have been preying on the settlers in the surrounding farms. Stealing food, money, weapons... Jon was hit really hard recently... He lost his daughter.;[{'Nemo': 'Flirt'}];;[5084, 5086];[5082];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07042_.mp3
You Republics are too weak. You should protect what you want to keep, otherwise someone stronger will take it.;[];;[5085];[5083];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07043_.mp3
Perhaps, perhaps. But not everyone in the galaxy is a warrior like you.;[];;[5086];[5084];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07044_.mp3
They were not a problem before... But now it would seem prudent to be rid of them. If you could accomplish this, it would not harm your training and the settlers would greatly appreciate it.;[];;[5087];[5085, 5083];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07045_.mp3
Jon is currently waiting to petition the Council. He is on the path north of here. He might be able to tell you more about what had happened.;[];;[5088];[5086];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07046_.mp3

Who are you?;[];;[5092];[5090];dan14_nemo;
As I have said, I believe, my name is Nemo. I am here by the will of the Jedi Council.;[];;[5093];[5091];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07055_.mp3
You are a Jedi?;[];;[5094];[5092];dan14_nemo;
Indeed, my young friend, that I am. I have served the Council for many years, and have seen many apprentices pass through this Enclave.;[];;[5095, 5097];[5093];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07057_.mp3
Are you a member of the Council?;[];;[5096];[5094, 5099];dan14_nemo;
I think, perhaps, you place an undue importance on rank and hierarchy. Understandable, but regrettable also. We each serve in our place, high or low.;[];;[5075];[5095];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07059_.mp3
I want to ask you something else.;[];;[5075];[5094];dan14_nemo;
What do you do here?;[];;[5099];[5090];dan14_nemo;
I am here by the will of the Jedi Council. I serve the good and, hopefully through that, the people of the Republic.;[];;[5095, 5100];[5098];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07062_.mp3
I would like to ask you something else.;[];;[5075];[5099];dan14_nemo;
What kind of a name is Nemo anyway?;[];;[5102];[5090];dan14_nemo;
*chuckle* The importance you put in a name is misleading, young one. You of all people should remember that.;[];;[5075];[5101];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07066_.mp3
I must be going now.;[];;[5104];[5088, 5075, 5067];dan14_nemo;
I hope your time is well spent here on Dantooine.;[];;[];[5103];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07068_.mp3
Master Zhar said there are caves on Dantooine with lightsaber crystals.;[];;[5106];[5077];dan14_nemo;
Ah, yes, those caves. Those caves are dangerous for the unwary.;[];;[5107];[5105];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07049_.mp3
Kinrath spiders infest the places. They are attracted by the colors and heat given off by the crystals, I think.;[];;[5108];[5106];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07050_.mp3
It is a pity... Those caves are strong with the Force.;[];;[5075];[5107];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07051_.mp3
What do you know of the tainted grove?;[];;[5110];[5069];dan14_nemo;
The Council has told you nothing of the grove?;[];;[5111, 5115];[5109];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07025_.mp3
No, they have not.;[];;[5112];[5110];dan14_nemo;
Then it would not be my place to explain its significance.;[];;[5113];[5111];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07027_.mp3
But as the light side can be embodied in living beings, so can the dark.;[];;[5114];[5112];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07028_.mp3
The grove can be found to the south and east in the plains. But be wary of kath hounds, they may be agitated by the power in the grove.;[];;[5075];[5113, 5116];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07029_.mp3
I know it is tainted by the dark side.;[];;[5116];[5110];dan14_nemo;
Do not be so quick to judge circumstances about which you are ignorant. Not everything may be as transparent as you would believe.;[];;[5114];[5115];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07031_.mp3
Um... never mind.;[];;[5118];[5069];dan14_nemo;
Very well.;[];;[5075];[5117];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07033_.mp3
Juhani has been slain, I hear. You fought with her in the grove?;[];;[5120, 5123, 5125];[None];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07002_.mp3
She attacked me.;[];;[5121];[5119];dan14_nemo;
It should not have had to go that far... but some things cannot be avoided.;[{'Nemo': 'Flirt'}];;[5122];[5120, 5124];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07004_.mp3
You would do well to mind Juhani's tragic example and not to let yourself fall into the sway of the dark side.;[];;[];[5121];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07005_.mp3
She had been turned to the dark side!;[];;[5124];[5119];dan14_nemo;
Even in the darkest heart there is hope for rebirth. Anyone can be turned back to the light. Anyone.;[];;[5121];[5123, 5125];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07007_.mp3

As I thought. Don't worry, young one... you shall learn, in time. Have patience.;[];;[5067];[5130];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07014_.mp3
How go your studies, my young friend?;[];;[5067];[5126];dan14_nemo;NM14AANEMO07069_.mp3

What? Why are you bothering me? Can't you see I'm auditioning a dancer? Or at least, I'm trying to audition her. Not much point if she doesn't have a partner.;[];;[5135, 5144, 5147, 5148];[None];tar03_bibsurool;
What are you talking about?;[];;[5136];[5134, 5149];tar03_bibsurool;
Name's Bib Surool, manager for the Starlight Entertainers: the top performing troupe in this sector of the galaxy. I was here scouting new talent when the Sith attacked, and now I can't leave.;[];;[5137];[5135, 5147];tar03_bibsurool;
You'd think the Sith would let me go so I could get back to my troupe, but I guess they just don't appreciate the arts. So, since I'm stuck here, I figured I might as well continue with my auditions.;[];;[5138];[5136];tar03_bibsurool;
I'm supposed to be auditioning Lyn, but I think I'm wasting my time. Lyn's got all the moves, but I need to know if she can pull them off while sharing a stage with her partner.;[];;[5139, 5146];[5137];tar03_bibsurool;
Where's her partner?;[];;[5140];[5138, 5153];tar03_bibsurool;
She doesn't have one. That's the problem. Aren't you listening to me? Dancers don't perform solo, so I need to see if she can work with someone else before I get her up on stage.;[];;[5141, 5144];[5139];tar03_bibsurool;
Maybe I could help her out.;[];;[5142];[5140];tar03_bibsurool;
I doubt she just wants to dance with someone who wandered by. This is her one shot at the big time, and dancing with some wanna-be as her partner isn't going to help her cause.;[];;[5143];[5141];tar03_bibsurool;
On the other hand, I'm not going to hire her unless I can see her in action with a partner. Maybe she's desperate enough to give you a chance. You'd have to ask her, I guess.;[];;[];[5142];tar03_bibsurool;
I'll be going now.;[];;[5145];[5140, 5149, 5134, 5153, 5150, 5156];tar03_bibsurool;
Okay, great. Bye-bye. Off you go.;[];;[];[5144, 5146];tar03_bibsurool;
I don't have time for this.;[];;[5145];[5138, 5153];tar03_bibsurool;
Who are you?;[];;[5136];[5134, 5149];tar03_bibsurool;
I don't like your tone!;[];;[5149];[5134];tar03_bibsurool;
Oh-ho! You think throwing a tantrum is going to impress me? Sorry - I manage two dozen dancers, musicians and other performers. I see more tantrums in one day than most people in a year!;[];;[5135, 5144, 5147];[5148];tar03_bibsurool;

Who are you again?;[];;[5152];[5150, 5156];tar03_bibsurool;
Forgotten me already, have you? Well, you're self-centered enough to be a performer. All you're lacking is the talent - like about ninety percent of the people who audition for me.;[];;[5153];[5151];tar03_bibsurool;
Bib Surool, manager of the Starlight Entertainers. Any of this sound familiar? I came here looking for dancers, but all I've found is a Twi'lek who doesn't have a partner.;[];;[5139, 5144, 5146, 5154];[5152];tar03_bibsurool;
I want to dance as Lyn's partner.;[];;[5155];[5153, 5156];tar03_bibsurool;
If you want to help Lyn out, go talk to her. Otherwise, leave me alone. It's bad enough she's dancing solo - I can't concentrate on her dancing with you yapping in my ear!;[];;[];[5154];tar03_bibsurool;
Back again? Don't you get it? I'm working here. For you, dancing is probably just a fun way to pass the time, but this is serious business for me! So why do you keep bugging me?;[];;[5144, 5151, 5154];[None];tar03_bibsurool;

I don't like your tone!;[];;[5191];[5174];tar04_sithpatrol;
You're questioning the Sith? How many people do we have to kill before the rest of you learn some respect?;[];;[5192];[5190];tar04_sithpatrol;NM04AASITH27022_.mp3
Well, I guess it's time for another lesson. Patrol... attack!;[];;[];[5191];tar04_sithpatrol;NM04AASITH27024_.mp3

I'm done talking in this office. They aren't interested in listening to me. I doubt they will even acknowledge I was here.;[];;[5205];[5203, 5206];tat17_xconser_02;
Typical corporate evasion. That's what happens when they own everything. No accountability. Don't even bother bringing it up.;[];;[];[5204];tat17_xconser_02;
Stop your shouting, fool! What's this about?;[];;[5204];[5202];tat17_xconser_02;
Your kind is not welcome here anymore, human! Though we may not speak of it, we know what you have done! Begone!;[];;[];[None];man26_nilko;
The relations between the Republic and my people have been strained recently... I can only wonder if it relates somehow to those mercenaries the Republic hired...;[];;[];[None];man26_nilko;
Human, I wish to speak to you if you have the time.;[]; string when player is near, before player has spoken to him;[];[None];man26_nilko;
Have you news for me, human? Have you discovered why the Republic is hiring mercenaries?;[]; subsequent conversations;[5211, 5213];[None];man26_nilko;
No, I'm still looking into it.;[];;[5212];[5210];man26_nilko;
Once you have the answers I seek, I will gladly pay you the 500 credits I promised.;[];Player has not learned of Subs from Republic Diplomat, Nilko already talked to.;[];[5211, 5254];man26_nilko;
Yes - they're sending them down to a secret base on the Hrakert Rift.;[];;[5214];[5210];man26_nilko;
The Hrakert Rift? It is as I feared - though the Republic is fortunate I was the one assigned to investigate this case. Human, allow me to be blunt with you.;[];;[5215];[5213];man26_nilko;
If I report this violation to my superiors the Republic will be banned from Manaan - but I do not wish to do this.;[];;[5216];[5214];man26_nilko;
I see the Sith for what they truly are: ruthless and evil. The Republic has always respected our independence, but if they fall the Sith will be quick to send an invasion fleet to conquer Manaan.;[];;[5217];[5215];man26_nilko;
But I cannot simply ignore what the Republic has done. The Hrakert Rift is the source of Manaan's kolto, and I fear the science station may damage production of the delicate resource.;[];;[5218, 5219, 5233];[5216];man26_nilko;
The Hrakert Rift is the source of kolto? Why would the Republic risk so much to send troops there? I don't get it.;[];;[5219];[5217];man26_nilko;NM26AANILK09068_.mp3
You must tell the Republic to stop this madness at once. Make them shut down the facility and recall their people before they do something we all regret.;[]; subsequent conversations;[5220, 5232];[5218, 5233, 5217];man26_nilko;
They can't. The Republic has recently lost contact with the science facility.;[];;[5221];[5219];man26_nilko;
Of course, I should have realized. Doubtless they were hiring the mercenaries to investigate the situation. But I fear mercenaries alone may not be enough to save their station.;[];;[5222];[5220, 5232];man26_nilko;
There are ancient mysteries within the Hrakert Rift that even we Selkath do not comprehend. I fear the Republic has awakened something that was best left undisturbed.;[];;[5223, 5227, 5231];[5221];man26_nilko;
I am going to investigate the Hrakert Rift.;[];;[5224];[5222];man26_nilko;
As you wish. Perhaps you will find the answers the mercenaries could not. I will keep our conversation secret so that the vile Sith will not gain from the Republic's foolishness.;[];;[5225];[5223];man26_nilko;
I only hope my silence does not lead to disaster for Manaan. Here is the payment I promised you.;[];give 500 credits;[5226];[5224, 5230];man26_nilko;
And now I must take my leave, human. My superiors are expecting a full report from me, and there is much I must do to ensure they cannot uncover the Republic's actions.;[];escape area;[];[5225];man26_nilko;
It sounds like you know more than you are telling me.;[];;[5228];[5222];man26_nilko;
Had I any information, human, I would share it with you willingly. You have done the right thing, informing me of this... but I must ask something more of you.;[];;[5229];[5227];man26_nilko;
I fear the mercenaries will not find the answers the Republic is looking for - they prefer blasters to brains. But you have shown yourself to be resourceful.;[];;[5230];[5228, 5231];man26_nilko;
Perhaps you can succeed where the others have failed. Investigate this facility, human - and I promise to keep my silence so that the vile Sith do not gain from the Republic's foolishness.;[];;[5225];[5229];man26_nilko;
What do you suggest we do?;[];;[5229];[5222];man26_nilko;
They couldn't. They had lost contact with the science facility.;[];;[5221];[5219];man26_nilko;
Hmmm. You think the Republic is trying to steal the kolto, perhaps? An odd thing for the Republic to do, no?;[];;[5219];[5217];man26_nilko;NM26AANILK09070_.mp3
Greetings, human. My name is Nilko Bwaas. I hope you are enjoying yourself here in Ahto City. Our floating city is beautiful, is it not?;[]; first time conversation;[5235, 5268, 5271, 5273];[None];man26_nilko;
It's truly a wonder to behold.;[];;[5236];[5234];man26_nilko;
You are too gracious, human.;[];;[5237];[5235];man26_nilko;
The beauty of Manaan is delicate. Our ecosystem is complex and fragile, and I fear for the preservation of my planet.;[];;[5238, 5268, 5270];[5236, 5272, 5274];man26_nilko;
What are you talking about?;[];;[5239];[5237];man26_nilko;
There is a task I would ask, human... Jedi. I fear there is nowhere else I can turn.;[];;[5240, 5267];[5238, 5269];man26_nilko;
What do you want me to do?;[];;[5241];[5239];man26_nilko;
Rest assured, there will be ample reward for this human. I only require information, nothing more.;[];;[5242, 5266];[5240, 5267];man26_nilko;
The Republic has been hiring mercenaries - many more than usual. With the incident at the Sith base so recent, one cannot help but wonder...;[];;[5243];[5241];man26_nilko;
As an official of the Selkath people, this is of great concern to me. I only seek the reason for this change in Republic policy.;[];;[5244, 5261, 5265];[5242];man26_nilko;
Forget it - I won't spy on the Republic!;[];;[5245];[5243, 5266];man26_nilko;
I am no enemy of the Republic, human. I only seek assurances that there is no harm being done to Manaan. The Republic may be bringing ruin onto us all without even knowing it!;[];not already said;[5246];[5244];man26_nilko;
Uncover the truth behind the Republic's actions, and I will pay you 500 credits.;[];;[5247, 5251, 5257, 5258, 5259, 5260];[5245, 5264, 5265];man26_nilko;
I'm uncomfortable with spying on the Republic... but if we could assure the Selkath that they mean no harm, then perhaps it might be worth it.;[];;[5248, 5251];[5246];man26_nilko;NM26AANILK09037_.mp3
And what if the Republic does mean harm, Carth? Will you tell them?;[];;[5249];[5247];man26_nilko;NM26AANILK09039_.mp3
If the Republic did mean harm to the Selkath, then I want to know what the Selkath did to provoke it.;[];;[5250];[5248];man26_nilko;NM26AANILK09041_.mp3
How very noble of you.;[];;[5251];[5249];man26_nilko;NM26AANILK09043_.mp3
Please - see if you can find the answers I seek. Find why the Republic is hiring so many mercenaries, find where they are going. Find why they do not return.;[];;[5252, 5254, 5255];[5250, 5247, 5258, 5259, 5260, 5257, 5246];man26_nilko;
I'll look into it for you, Nilko.;[];;[5253];[5251];man26_nilko;
Once you discover some information, please come speak to me. Believe it or not, I am a friend of the Republic. Whatever the truth, I shall do my best to protect the Republic's interests - and those of the Selkath, of course.;[];;[];[5252];man26_nilko;
I'll do it, but only for the money.;[];;[5212];[5251];man26_nilko;
Forget it, I'm not interested.;[];;[5256];[5251];man26_nilko;
If you discover any information and you change your mind, please come speak to me. I will be here waiting for you.;[];;[];[5255];man26_nilko;
I don't know if I like this. Aren't the Republic supposed to be the good guys?;[];;[5251, 5258, 5259, 5260];[5246];man26_nilko;NM26AANILK09114_.mp3
Be careful here, kid. Start poking your nose in places it doesn't belong and you might not like what you find.;[];;[5251];[5257, 5259, 5260, 5246];man26_nilko;NM26AANILK09117_.mp3
I doubt the Republic would be involved in anything illegal. Still, if this Selkath has concerns we could look into it for him.;[];;[5251, 5258];[5257, 5246];man26_nilko;NM26AANILK09115_.mp3
We could look into this to calm this Selkath's fears, though I doubt the Republic would be involved in anything illegal.;[];;[5251, 5258];[5257, 5246];man26_nilko;NM26AANILK09116_.mp3
Why do you need me for this?;[];;[5262];[5243, 5266];man26_nilko;
I cannot trust anyone else. The Republic obviously wants to keep their secret - I have inquired often as to their purpose and been rebuffed.;[];;[5263];[5261];man26_nilko;
The Sith cannot be trusted to give me an accurate report of events - they will twist the truth so that it furthers their own goals.;[];;[5264];[5262];man26_nilko;
And the mercenaries are well aware of the high wages the Republic is paying - they would not report anything that might slow the flow of credits into their accounts.;[];;[5246];[5263];man26_nilko;
What's in this for me?;[];;[5246];[5243, 5266];man26_nilko;
The Republic has been hiring mercenaries - many more than usual. As an official of the Selkath people, this is of great concern to me. I only seek the reason for this change in Republic policy.;[];;[5244, 5261, 5265];[5241];man26_nilko;

Cut the small talk. What do you want?;[];;[5269];[5237, 5234];man26_nilko;
You are blunt human - but that is perhaps what I require.;[];;[5239];[5268, 5270];man26_nilko;
I think I'll be going now.;[];;[5269];[5237];man26_nilko;

I suppose tastes vary widely across the galaxy, human. And yet, the planet is beautiful to me and my people.;[];;[5237];[5271];man26_nilko;
You're a lot more friendly than most of the Selkath here.;[];;[5274];[5234];man26_nilko;

Jorak Uln was once Uthar's master, you see, and the head of this academy. He went a little insane, however, and Uthar forced him to flee to the surface and hide.;[];;[5310];[5308];kor35_sithteach2;NM35AASITH17020_.mp3

If you want prestige, however, you'll find that hermit, as everyone calls him... you'll find Jorak and either kill him or bring back anything he's been writing. Uthar would like that.;[];;[5312];[5310];kor35_sithteach2;NM35AASITH17024_.mp3

I only wanted to wish you well, and to warn you to be careful. There are many evils out there, many dangers. The Sith are not the only minions of the dark side.;[];;[5326, 5370, 5371];[5324];dan13_deesra;
What could be more dangerous than the Sith?;[];;[5327];[5325];dan13_deesra;
Master Dorak has been training me to succeed him as Chronicler here in the Academy. In my studies I have come across tales of creatures that are born of the dark side, monsters of pure evil.;[];;[5328];[5326, 5370, 5372];dan13_deesra;
The worst of these abominations is the terentatek, a beast that feeds on the blood of those who are strong in the Force. Over the centuries, many Jedi have fallen to their ravenous hunger.;[];;[5329, 5367, 5368];[5327];dan13_deesra;
What makes this creature so dangerous?;[];;[5330];[5328];dan13_deesra;
The terentatek is a predator, and we Jedi are its prey. They are incredibly strong, with a primal cunning. And they have an in-born resistance to the Force.;[];;[5331];[5329, 5367, 5369];dan13_deesra;
There are some who believe the terentatek is a monster bred by the ancient Sith, and spread throughout the galaxy to destroy the Jedi.;[];;[5332];[5330];dan13_deesra;
Fortunately, the terentatek is quite rare. They only dwell in the most dangerous and darkest of places. In fact, one has not been seen in nearly forty years.;[];;[5333, 5366];[5331];dan13_deesra;
Sounds like they're extinct.;[];;[5334];[5332];dan13_deesra;
This is not the first time the terentatek have vanished for long periods of time. Many believe they can lay dormant for years, only to rise and hunt when the power of the dark side waxes full.;[];;[5335];[5333, 5366];dan13_deesra;
I fear Malak's rise may have woken these creatures from their dormant state. Once the Sith are beaten, I would not be surprised if the Council organized another Great Hunt to try and exterminate them.;[];;[5336, 5361, 5363];[5334];dan13_deesra;
The Great Hunt? What's that?;[];;[5337];[5335];dan13_deesra;
The Great Hunt was organized by the Jedi Council shortly after the war against Exar Kun. Jedi were scattered throughout the galaxy, helping to rebuild from the devastation.;[];;[5338];[5336, 5353];dan13_deesra;
Many Jedi vanished during this period, disappearing from a variety of worlds without warning. We did not know they had been slain until their mutilated bodies began to be discovered.;[];;[5339];[5337];dan13_deesra;
The Council investigated, and discovered the terentatek were behind the killings. It was decided the galaxy had to be purged of these insatiable monsters - though the cost proved high.;[];;[5340, 5365];[5338];dan13_deesra;
So the Jedi just killed these creatures?;[];;[5341];[5339];dan13_deesra;
The terentatek are an abomination, they are ruthless engines of death and destruction. The Council had no choice but to destroy them, for the greater good of the galaxy.;[];;[5342];[5340];dan13_deesra;
Many Jedi banded together and journeyed to the planets that were suspected of harboring the terentatek. The Great Hunt did not rest until all the creatures had been slain - or almost all.;[];;[5343];[5341, 5365];dan13_deesra;
There were still rumors of terentatek on the planet of Korriban, a dark world some believe to be the birthplace of the Sith. That is where Exar Kun was corrupted during the first Sith War.;[];;[5344];[5342];dan13_deesra;
They never went to Korriban. The Council, fearing more Jedi might fall to the dark side, declared the Great Hunt was officially over... though three Jedi were appointed to continue the work.;[];;[5345, 5359, 5364];[5343];dan13_deesra;
The work of killing the terentatek, you mean.;[];;[5346];[5344];dan13_deesra;
The Jedi chosen to continue the hunt on their own were Duron Qel-Droma, Guun Han Saresh and Shaela Nur. These three shared a powerful bond, and each of them was devoted to the light.;[];;[5347];[5345, 5364];dan13_deesra;
The Council felt that together they would be able to defeat any terentatek they found. And by supporting each other they could resist the temptations of Korriban and the lure of the dark side.;[];;[5348];[5346];dan13_deesra;
But none of the three survived. Their Master felt them become one with the Force when they left this world. He believed they were slain by one of the monsters they sought.;[];;[5349];[5347];dan13_deesra;
The Council felt it was too dangerous to send anyone else in search of their remains, so their exact fate is not known. But let their deaths serve as a warning to you, Padawan.;[];;[5350, 5354, 5359, 5361, 5363];[5348];dan13_deesra;
Tell me about the three Jedi lost after the Great Hunt.;[];;[5351];[5349, 5402, 5398];dan13_deesra;
There is not much I can tell you other than their names: Duron Qel-Droma, Guun Han Saresh and Shaela Nur. They disappeared nearly forty years ago, long before my time at the Academy.;[];;[5352];[5350];dan13_deesra;
"The Council is certain they are dead; their Master sensed them leaving this world to become one with the Force. More than this, I cannot say.";[];;[5353, 5354, 5359];[5351];dan13_deesra;
Tell me about the Great Hunt you mentioned before.;[];;[5337];[5352, 5402, 5398];dan13_deesra;
I want to ask you some questions.;[];;[5355];[5352, 5349, 5396, 5402, 5398];dan13_deesra;
If you have questions you should speak with Master Dorak. He is the Chronicler of the Academy here on Dantooine, and is far more knowledgeable than I.;[];;[5356, 5359];[5354];dan13_deesra;
I am looking for crystals to alter my lightsaber.;[];;[5357];[5355, 5385, 5396, 5397];dan13_deesra;
There are caves here on Dantooine that hold the rare crystals we use in our lightsabers. But if you wish to go there, you must be careful. The caves are a place of great danger.;[];;[5358];[5356];dan13_deesra;
Good luck with your continued training. May the Force be with you.;[];;[];[5357, 5387];dan13_deesra;
I'll be going now.;[];;[5360];[5355, 5352, 5349, 5344, 5396, 5402, 5398];dan13_deesra;
Then may the Force be with you.;[];;[];[5359];dan13_deesra;
Thanks for the warning. I'll be careful.;[];;[5362];[5349, 5335];dan13_deesra;
A final warning as you go, Padawan: do not underestimate the terentatek. If you do, you may suffer the same fate as those who disappeared after the Great Hunt.;[];;[];[5361, 5363];dan13_deesra;
I can't waste time listening to your fables!;[];;[5362];[5349, 5335];dan13_deesra;
Why? What was so special about those three?;[];;[5346];[5344];dan13_deesra;
Cost? What cost?;[];;[5342];[5339];dan13_deesra;
Then why are you worried about them now?;[];;[5334];[5332];dan13_deesra;
It's hard to believe an animal could pose a threat to a Jedi.;[];;[5330];[5328];dan13_deesra;
Why are you telling me this?;[];;[5369];[5328];dan13_deesra;
You have completed your initial training in a fraction of the normal time. The Force is very strong with you. I'm afraid you might become a target for these creatures.;[];;[5330];[5368];dan13_deesra;
What are you talking about?;[];;[5327];[5325];dan13_deesra;
I can look after myself.;[];;[5372];[5325];dan13_deesra;
Yes, your skill and prowess are already well known throughout this Academy. But even you would be wise to heed my warnings.;[];;[5327];[5371];dan13_deesra;
I don't think the Council would want me to speak openly of this mission.;[];;[5324];[5321];dan13_deesra;
My discussions with the Council are none of your business!;[];;[5324];[5321];dan13_deesra;
Welcome to the Jedi enclave on Dantooine. I do not believe we know each other. My name is Deesra Luur Jada. You may call me Deesra.;[];;[5376, 5385, 5394];[None];dan13_deesra;
I have not heard of any new apprentices being accepted for training recently. What brings you to this place, if I may ask?;[];;[5377, 5383];[5375];dan13_deesra;
I came here with Bastila.;[];;[5378];[5376];dan13_deesra;
Yes, of course. I should have known. I have only heard a little of how she escaped the destruction of Taris. Tell me, did she save you from that planet as well?;[];;[5379, 5382];[5377];dan13_deesra;
She didn't save me. We worked together to escape Taris.;[];;[5380];[5378];dan13_deesra;
Oh, I see. Well, I meant no offense of course. In any case, it is good to have her back here on Dantooine again. We were afraid Malak had captured her.;[];;[5381];[5379, 5382];dan13_deesra;
I hope you enjoy your time here on Dantooine. May the Force be with you.;[];;[];[5380];dan13_deesra;
Get your story straight: I'm the one who saved her!;[];;[5380];[5378];dan13_deesra;
My business here is my own.;[];;[5384];[5376];dan13_deesra;
Oh... I see. Very well, I have no wish to make you uncomfortable. I suppose I shall just wish you a good day, then.;[];;[];[5383];dan13_deesra;
You must be the new apprentice Master Zhar is training. I hear you are progressing at an astonishing rate. How are you finding your lessons?;[];;[5356, 5386, 5388, 5390];[5375];dan13_deesra;
It's difficult, but worthwhile.;[];;[5387];[5385, 5397];dan13_deesra;
The lessons we learn at the feet of our Masters teach us to use the Force for good. They show us the power of the light side, and protect us from the dark.;[];;[5358];[5386, 5389];dan13_deesra;
The Masters are bringing me along too slowly. They're holding me back.;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[5389];[5385, 5397];dan13_deesra;
Patience, apprentice. The Force is a great gift, but it also brings us a heavy burden.;[];;[5387];[5388];dan13_deesra;
I am still learning the Jedi Code.;[];;[5391];[5385, 5397];dan13_deesra;
Of course. Learning the Code is an essential part of our training, for there is great wisdom in its words. Allow me to help you with this, apprentice.;[];;[5392];[5390];dan13_deesra;
"There is no emotion; there is peace. There is no ignorance; there is knowledge. There is no passion; there is serenity. There is no chaos; there is harmony. There is no death; there is the Force.";[];;[5393];[5391];dan13_deesra;
Take heed of these words, apprentice. They contain a deeper truth than it first appears.;[];;[];[5392];dan13_deesra;
I hear that Master Zhar feels you are now ready to become a full fledged memer of our Order. Congratulations, apprentice. Or should I say Padawan?;[];;[5395];[5375];dan13_deesra;
It brings me great joy to see another who has joined our Order, particularly in these trying times. The path of the light is a difficult one to walk, and many have fallen into the darkness.;[];;[5396];[5394];dan13_deesra;
But I am certain you will not be one of those. So, Padawan - what can I do for you?;[];;[5354, 5356, 5359];[5395];dan13_deesra;
Greetings, apprentice. How goes your training? I hear you are progressing at an astonishing rate.;[];;[5356, 5386, 5388, 5390];[None];dan13_deesra;
Yes, Padawan? Is there something I can help you with?;[];;[5350, 5353, 5354, 5359, 5399];[None];dan13_deesra;
I just came to tell you that I've killed a terentatek;[];;[5400];[5398];dan13_deesra;
Then the galaxy is a better place for it. Every one of these creatures is an abomination that must be exterminated. You have done well, Padawan.;[];;[5401];[5399];dan13_deesra;
But do not let your success blind you to the dangers of these monsters. A Jedi must never become complacent when facing one of the terentatek, as you well know.;[];;[5402];[5400];dan13_deesra;
Is there anything else I can do for you, Padawan?;[];;[5350, 5353, 5354, 5359];[5401];dan13_deesra;

Of course, he'll never understand how appropriate it is. He can't talk his way out of this one. He's not smart enough.;[];;[5405, 5408, 5410, 5416, 5418];[5414];tat18_10wife_01;NM18AB10WI06012_.mp3

Just like old times, eh Jolee? You come swooping in out of nowhere to save my tail from the fire.;[];;[5430];[5428];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26002_.mp3
You saved my wrinkled butt more than a few times as well, friend, if I recall. But there'll be time for catching up later. Right now we need to focus on the case.;[];;[5431];[5429];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26003_.mp3
The case is a complete frame-up. Anyone looking at the evidence could see that - or so I thought. But the Selkath seem to think, well that there's enough to go to trial.;[];;[5432];[5430, 5521];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26009_.mp3
There aren't any witnesses. All that evidence against me is circumstantial... and completely flawed.;[];;[5433, 5444, 5447, 5454];[5431];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26010_.mp3
Let's go over the evidence.;[];;[5434, 5513];[5432, 5443, 5453, 5510, 5512, 5523];man26_sunry;
Well... you know I was having an affair with Elassa... I went there to break it off that night.;[];;[5435];[5433];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26012_.mp3
I can tell you it wasn't easy. She is... was... young and beautiful. But I love Elora, and I knew I had to do it. I broke it off as quickly as I could and then left.;[];;[5436];[5434];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26013_.mp3
I found out later she'd been murdered when the Selkath authorities came knocking on my door...;[];;[5437];[5435];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26014_.mp3
But let's look at the facts they've given:;[];;[5438];[5436, 5516];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26019_.mp3
Elassa was brutally killed. Think about that - she was a Sith, trained in battle and I'm just a crippled old man!;[];;[5439];[5437];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26020_.mp3
My war injuries make it difficult for me to walk even to hold things. See how my hands are shaking! How could I kill a Sith warrior at close quarters? I ask you!;[];;[5440];[5438];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26021_.mp3
Further: They say they found my Hero's Cross at the crime scene. Would I leave my war medal behind if I killed someone? Even I'm not that stupid.;[];;[5441];[5439];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26022_.mp3
Obviously the Sith planted the Cross. And what about the lack of forensic evidence? Skin and hair samples, clothing fibers - why isn't there anything like that at the crime scene? Sounds like an obvious frame-up to me.;[];;[5442];[5440];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26023_.mp3
I hope you can see how the Sith are manipulating the Selkath, and probably even you, to set up this against me! We need to get this over with quickly and clear my name.;[];;[5443];[5441];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26024_.mp3
Anything else I can help you with? I want my Arbiter to be well prepared before we go to trial.;[];;[5433, 5444, 5447, 5454];[5442, 5446];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26028_.mp3
I need to investigate the case some more. Any ideas where I should look?;[];;[5445];[5443, 5453, 5510, 5512, 5432, 5523];man26_sunry;
I guess you could interview witnesses at the hotel where the murder happened. The Selkath already did that, but the fish folk don't have much rapport with off-worlders. Maybe one of them was holding something back.;[];;[5446];[5444];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26026_.mp3
But I think you'd be better off investigating the Sith themselves. Maybe you could find some proof they planted evidence to frame me - though that might mean figuring out a way into the Sith Embassy.;[];;[5443];[5445];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26027_.mp3
There's a few things we have to clear up.;[];;[5448];[5443, 5453, 5510, 5512, 5432, 5523];man26_sunry;
Go ahead, ask... ask what you need to. I've got nothing to hide.;[];;[5449, 5464, 5468, 5506, 5511];[5447, 5461, 5467];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26030_.mp3

I know it was wrong, but I'm a weak man. Elassa was beautiful and young - how was I to resist her charms? But I didn't kill her! I loved her!;[];;[5452];[5450, 5463];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26038_.mp3
Please, I know I made a terrible mistake getting involved with Elassa, but I was going there to break it off with her.;[];;[5453];[5451];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26039_.mp3
I did it, but found out later that she was dead. I don't deserve to go to jail just for having an affair, do I? You have to help me prove that I wasn't the killer!;[];;[5433, 5444, 5447, 5454];[5452];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26040_.mp3
I'll be going now.;[];;[5455];[5453, 5510, 5512, 5443, 5432, 5523];man26_sunry;
Very well. I suppose there is still much you must do before the trial.;[];;[5456];[5454];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26093_.mp3

[Failure] That's a Sith lie! They're trying to embarrass me and humiliate my wife! How dare you ask me that!;[];;[5458, 5460, 5462];[5449];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26033_.mp3
Witnesses saw you at her hotel room, Sunry. You better tell me what's going on.;[];;[5459];[5457];man26_sunry;
The witnesses are lying! Maybe the Sith got to them - I don't know. But it's a lie I tell you! A hurtful, horrible lie!;[];Secret persuasion check failed.;[5460];[5458];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26035_.mp3
No offense, Sunry. I have to ask.;[];;[5461];[5459, 5457];man26_sunry;
Yes, I... I suppose you do. Please, forgive my outburst. This has been a terribly stressful time for me. I... I'm sure there is more you want to ask me.;[];;[5448];[5460];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26042_.mp3
I know you're lying, Sunry. I found this datapad talking about you and Elassa.;[];;[5463];[5457];man26_sunry;
Then... then you know. Please, don't make a big deal about this. Elora already knew and I... I was going there to break if off with Elassa.;[];;[5451];[5462];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26037_.mp3
There was a Rodian who planted evidence at the murder scene.;[];;[5465];[5448];man26_sunry;
A Rodian? I didn't know there were any Rodians on Manaan. Oh, except for Tyvark... and this one named Gluupor who was hanging around the hotel all the time.;[];;[5466];[5464];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26044_.mp3
OK, so maybe there are a whole bunch of Rodians on Manaan, but what does that matter? If he planted evidence at the scene it's a clear sign of a frame-up. He probably took all the evidence of the real killer at the same time.;[];;[5467];[5465];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26045_.mp3
The evidence of a Sith conspiracy keeps getting stronger, doesn't it? But I suspect there is still stuff you want to clear up.;[];;[5448];[5466];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26046_.mp3
I know you're guilty, Sunry. I've got the Republic's data recording.;[];;[5469];[5448];man26_sunry;
So the truth is out. I never meant to kill her, you know. When I found out she was a Sith spy using me to gain information, something inside me just snapped.;[];;[5470];[5468];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26048_.mp3
She didn't know I had found out, so I waited until she fell asleep and then I... I killed her. Simple, really. But once I realized what I'd done I... I panicked. I contacted those spies from the Republic to help me.;[];;[5471];[5469];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26049_.mp3
They found the illegal monitoring device that the Sith had planted in the room, altered its recording to hide my part in it and cleared up the evidence. I figured that was the end of it.;[];;[5472, 5503, 5504];[5470];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26050_.mp3
But the Sith found out the truth, didn't they?;[];;[5473];[5471];man26_sunry;
The Sith must have been spying on me and Elassa, trying to make sure she wasn't a double agent. They must have seen the Republic spies getting rid of all the evidence.;[];;[5474];[5472, 5503, 5505];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26052_.mp3
And so they planted their own evidence. Elassa must have stolen that Hero's Cross from me long ago and given it to her Sith masters, like some kind of trophy.;[];;[5475];[5473];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26053_.mp3
I just thought I'd misplaced it. But when the Cross turned up on her body, I knew the Sith had put it there. So now you know the whole story, what are you going to do?;[];;[5476, 5500, 5501];[5474];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26054_.mp3
You're guilty, Sunry. Confess.;[];;[5477];[5475];man26_sunry;
You think I'm some kind of monster, don't you? All I did was kill a Sith! How many Sith have you killed? Dozens? Hundreds? Thousands?;[];;[5478, 5479, 5498, 5499];[5476, 5500];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26056_.mp3
That's different, Sunry, and you know it. We don't kill them in cold blood while they sleep.;[];;[5479];[5477];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26057_.mp3
I don't see how the two of us are any different. She was a spy! She was using me to get information so Malak's army could destroy the Republic! She deserved to die!;[];;[5480, 5482, 5497];[5478, 5498, 5499, 5477];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26060_.mp3
Killing your lover while she sleeps is murder - even if she is a Sith!;[];;[5481];[5479];man26_sunry;
If I confess I'm looking at 20 years in prison! And the Ahto City officials might even place kolto sanctions on the Republic Embassy. Without kolto how can we treat the injuries to our soldiers on the front lines!;[];;[5482, 5484, 5495];[5480, 5497];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26062_.mp3
I suppose you're right. I won't expose you.;[];;[5483];[5481, 5479];man26_sunry;
I'm glad you decided to see reason in this. If I'm convicted it could cause trouble for the Republic embassy here on Manaan. And none of us want that, now do we?;[];;[];[5482, 5502, 5501];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26081_.mp3
These are just excuses, Sunry. We both know you have to own up to your crimes.;[];medium persuasion;[5485];[5481];man26_sunry;
No. I can't do that and put the Republic's supply of kolto in danger. No I won't! Now look, I may have done something stupid, and it may only be worse for my standing by it, but I will not confess.;[];set confession at 1;[5486];[5484];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26064_.mp3
If you turn me in, the Republic will likely lose its kolto export privileges and then we'll lose the war for sure. Are you going to send all those thousands, millions - like on Taris - to their deaths, just for your sense of 'justice'?;[];;[5487, 5489, 5490];[5485, 5496];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26065_.mp3
Sunry... this is wrong, and you know it. I am a Jedi... what is it that you expect me to do to defend your actions?;[];;[5488];[5486];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26066_.mp3
You do whatever you have to, Jolee. I know what I did, but I also know what's at stake, here.;[];;[5489];[5487];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26067_.mp3
No, I'll rot in here if I have to, but I won't betray the Republic. Do what you have to, but know what the consequences will be.;[];;[];[5488, 5494, 5490, 5486];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26073_.mp3
I hate to say it, but he has a point. The Republic needs that kolto.;[];;[5489, 5491];[5486];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26068_.mp3
And you would propose what? Letting a murderer free on the chance it will help the Republic?;[];;[5492];[5490];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26069_.mp3
If need be. We are talking about a Sith, remember? I don't approve of what he did any more than you --;[];;[5493];[5491];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26070_.mp3
But you're willing to overlook it. Are the principles that the Republic stands on so very weak, Carth?;[];;[5494];[5492];man26_sunry;NM26AASUNR26071_.mp3

After years in the Shadowlands, I remember only that outsiders are not to be trusted! I'll see you dead!;[{'Freyyr': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[5587];[5585];kas25_freyyr_01;
Well, this may prove difficult.;[];Freyyr attacks. Surrenders when reduced to low HPs. He should be tough. He's battle-hardened.;[];[5586];kas25_freyyr_01;NM25AAFREY02006_.mp3
For years I have hid, hoping to someday free my world! I swear you will not take me! I swear!;[{'Freyyr': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[];[5584];kas25_freyyr_01;
I... I am beaten. Take my head, Czerka filth. You won't get another chance. So swears Freyyr of Kashyyyk.;[{'Freyyr': 'Talk_Sad'}];Surrender dialogue;[5590, 5709];[None];kas25_freyyr_01;
I'm not here to kill you. Just listen!;[];;[5591];[5589];kas25_freyyr_01;
The words of outsiders are tainted with lies. You can't convince me otherwise.;[{'Freyyr': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[5592, 5694];[5590, 5713, 5717, 5718];kas25_freyyr_01;
Do you know Zaalbar and Chuundar?;[];;[5593, 5697];[5591];kas25_freyyr_01;
What? Those are the names of my sons! But they are lost to me now: one exiled, the other a traitor!;[];;[5594];[5592, 5696];kas25_freyyr_01;
Hold on a second: Zaalbar and Chuundar are brothers? And you're their father? Wait a minute... does this mean Big Z is some kind of prince or something?;[];;[5595];[5593];kas25_freyyr_01;NM25AAFREY02015_.mp3
Why do you speak the names of my sons? How do you know of them? Tell me!;[];;[5596, 5698];[5594];kas25_freyyr_01;
My name is <FullName>. I came to Kashyyyk with Zaalbar.;[];;[5597];[5595, 5697];kas25_freyyr_01;
To my shame, Zaalbar was exiled and enslaved. Do you dare claim to be my son's owner, outsider?;[{'Freyyr': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[5598, 5707];[5596, 5700, 5703];kas25_freyyr_01;
No, he follows because of a life-debt.;[];;[5599];[5597];kas25_freyyr_01;
Does he? Then he sees something of worth in you. I will listen... cautiously. Gullibility has harmed me in the past.;[];;[5600];[5598];kas25_freyyr_01;
If I had seen the lies of Chuundar, he would have been exposed as a slaver. Zaalbar would not have been exiled...;[];;[5601, 5602];[5599, 5708];kas25_freyyr_01;
Exiled? Big Z never told me that! Of course he never said he was royalty, either.;[];;[5602];[5600];kas25_freyyr_01;NM25AAFREY02026_.mp3
"I did not believe Zaalbar's claims; I believed the elder boy, as tradition dictated. The shame of Zaalbar's attack blinded me.";[{'Freyyr': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[5603, 5614, 5694];[5601, 5600];kas25_freyyr_01;
Go over exactly what happened with Zaalbar.;[];;[5604];[5602, 5613];kas25_freyyr_01;
Zaalbar saw it first. He learned that Chuundar was dealing with the Czerka, leading them to our hunting parties.;[];;[5605];[5603, 5704];kas25_freyyr_01;
Chuundar would blame disappearances on the dangers of the Shadowlands. Zaalbar was crazed when he found out.;[];;[5606];[5604];kas25_freyyr_01;
He attacked Chuundar with his claws. I thought he had gone mad... shed his honor. I was bound by the old ways.;[{'Freyyr': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[5607, 5612, 5618, 5686];[5605];kas25_freyyr_01;
So Zaalbar was exiled. When did you learn the truth?;[];;[5608];[5606];kas25_freyyr_01;
A year later. By then, Chuundar had spread lies of my own madness. I had no allies when I confronted him.;[];;[5609];[5607];kas25_freyyr_01;
He and his Czerka guards attacked me. I had to retreat to the deepest Shadowlands, but even there they followed.;[];;[5610, 5706];[5608];kas25_freyyr_01;
That's when I first saw him. I helped his pursuers lose him for a moment. Do you remember me now, Freyyr?;[];;[5611];[5609];kas25_freyyr_01;NM25AAFREY02040_.mp3
Yes, I think I do. I am sorry about attacking. It's been so long since I have offered my trust, or accepted that of someone else.;[];;[5612, 5618, 5686];[5610];kas25_freyyr_01;
Back to my other questions.;[];;[5613];[5611, 5617, 5706, 5606];kas25_freyyr_01;
I will answer, and then ask something of you.;[];;[5603, 5614, 5618, 5686];[5612, 5690];kas25_freyyr_01;
Why would Chuundar want you dead now?;[];;[5615];[5613, 5602];kas25_freyyr_01;
Well, if Zaalbar is back, perhaps Chuundar is worried the people will realize things are not as they seem.;[];;[5616];[5614];kas25_freyyr_01;
"Chuundar has established himself as a leader that succeeded despite the ""tragedies"" that have plagued his family.";[];;[5617];[5615];kas25_freyyr_01;
If it was shown that he conspired with the slavers, his honor would be gone. I wonder...;[];;[5612, 5618, 5694];[5616];kas25_freyyr_01;
Well, what happens now?;[];;[5619];[5617, 5613, 5611, 5706, 5606];kas25_freyyr_01;
That would depend on you, <FullName>. You will either kill me or decide that I may yet benefit my people.;[];;[5620];[5618];kas25_freyyr_01;
There is a way I might challenge Chuundar, but it would take a lot to convince people they have been lied to.;[];;[5621, 5686];[5619];kas25_freyyr_01;
How? Everyone is on his side.;[];;[5622];[5620];kas25_freyyr_01;
He has a strong web of lies, but if I appeal to the traditions of my people, I might be able to gather support.;[];;[5623];[5621];kas25_freyyr_01;
There is a legend of a great warrior from the old times. Bacca was his name, and he is greatly revered.;[];;[5624];[5622];kas25_freyyr_01;
Bacca found a crashed starship, our first hint of life elsewhere. He was a cautious old wook, and feared the taint of invaders.;[];;[5625];[5623];kas25_freyyr_01;
He constructed a vibroblade from the wreckage. It has long symbolized our independence. Only destined leaders have held it.;[];;[5626, 5686, 5692];[5624];kas25_freyyr_01;
Where might I find it?;[];;[5627];[5625];kas25_freyyr_01;
That is the problem. It was the symbol of our great chieftains for centuries, but it was damaged a generation ago in ritual battle.;[{'Freyyr': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[5628];[5626];kas25_freyyr_01;
Here in the Shadowlands Rothrrrawr fought the Great Beast. He sought a challenge, but this arrogance got him more than he could handle.;[];;[5629];[5627, 5693];kas25_freyyr_01;
He survived, but the blade of the sword stayed in the creature's hide. Our tales say it was taken because we had become undeserving.;[];;[5630];[5628];kas25_freyyr_01;
The hilt is still in the court of our chieftain... with Chuundar. If the blade could be found, <FullName>, tradition could cast doubt on his rule.;[];;[5631, 5673, 5678, 5684, 5686];[5629];kas25_freyyr_01;
Actually, I've already found it. I wasn't sure what it was.;[];Player DOES have the hilt of Bacca's sword;[5632];[5630, 5677, 5685];kas25_freyyr_01;
You have? Please let me see it. I must be sure!;[{'Freyyr': 'Talk_Pleading'}];;[5633, 5641, 5643];[5631, 5662];kas25_freyyr_01;
Here, take it. I'm sure it is the one.;[];Take hilt from player.;[5634];[5632, 5642];kas25_freyyr_01;
It... it is! It may not look like much... but it is a very important relic of my people. Tradition dictates that it be respected.;[];Give XP;[5635];[5633];kas25_freyyr_01;
I didn't think I was worthy to search for it, but I realize that was selfish despair. I should have challenged Chuundar long ago.;[];;[5636];[5634];kas25_freyyr_01;
I will make amends now. I have new hope. You have led me to this. Perhaps that is what the Great Beast wanted.;[];;[5637, 5640];[5635];kas25_freyyr_01;
We should proceed carefully.;[];;[5638];[5636];kas25_freyyr_01;
I will climb to the surface as quickly as possible and try to gather support. You will have to follow on the paths as soon as you can, <FullName>.;[];;[5639];[5637, 5640];kas25_freyyr_01;
When you arrive, we will confront Chuundar in the throne room. My people will no longer be slaves.;[{'Freyyr': 'Victory'}];;[];[5638];kas25_freyyr_01;
Yes, time to take the fight to Chuundar himself!;[];;[5638];[5636];kas25_freyyr_01;
Wait a minute. What's in it for me?;[];;[5642];[5632];kas25_freyyr_01;
What? I... I have nothing. I've been here for years. When we have succeeded, I will see you are rewarded.;[];;[5633, 5643];[5641];kas25_freyyr_01;
Actually, I was mistaken.;[];;[5644];[5642, 5632];kas25_freyyr_01;
Don't taunt me like that. False hope is a cruel thing.;[{'Freyyr': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[5645, 5662, 5663, 5665];[5643];kas25_freyyr_01;
I have other questions.;[];;[5646];[5644, 5661, 5720];kas25_freyyr_01;
I will answer as best I can.;[];;[5647, 5650, 5656, 5660, 5663];[5645];kas25_freyyr_01;
Seen anyone hunting down here? Camouflaged attackers?;[];Player has started Mandalorian plot;[5648];[5646, 5655, 5659, 5651];kas25_freyyr_01;
My invisible attackers are a menagerie of my own fears and regrets, so many more than actual beasts that walk.;[];;[5649];[5647];kas25_freyyr_01;
No, I have not seen the creatures that you mention. I have been... preoccupied.;[];;[5650, 5656, 5660, 5663];[5648];kas25_freyyr_01;
I found a computer. Know anything about it?;[];Player HAS spoken to the strange computer.;[5651];[5649, 5659, 5646];kas25_freyyr_01;
I tried to access it many times over the years. It would never acknowledge me. I'm no good with such things.;[];;[5647, 5652, 5656, 5660, 5663];[5650];kas25_freyyr_01;
It clamins to be ancient. It created the forests.;[];;[5653];[5651];kas25_freyyr_01;
Well, now you are just having fun with me. It's probably just some malfunctioning Czerka cast-off.;[];;[5654];[5652];kas25_freyyr_01;
Seriously though, if we are to challenge Chuundar based on tradition, I suggest you don't say these things to anyone.;[];;[5655];[5653];kas25_freyyr_01;
You risk contradicting our most ancient tales. Perhaps this warrants investigating, but not now.;[];;[5647, 5656, 5660, 5663];[5654];kas25_freyyr_01;
I'm looking for something called a Star Map.;[];Player has NOT spoken with the computer;[5657];[5655, 5651, 5649, 5646];kas25_freyyr_01;
I've never heard of such a thing... but there is something odd down here. A large computer installation.;[];;[5658];[5656];kas25_freyyr_01;
It's probably just some Czerka cast-off, but you may find something useful. I can't figure it out, myself.;[];;[5659];[5657];kas25_freyyr_01;
It is northwest of here. I gave up on it years ago.;[];;[5647, 5650, 5660, 5663];[5658];kas25_freyyr_01;
Back to my previous questions.;[];;[5661];[5659, 5655, 5651, 5649, 5646];kas25_freyyr_01;
I will try to answer as best I am able.;[];;[5645, 5662, 5663, 5665];[5660, 5669];kas25_freyyr_01;
I have found the blade of Bacca's sword.;[];Player has the hilt of Bacca's sword;[5632];[5661, 5644, 5720];kas25_freyyr_01;
I'll get back to you. Wait here.;[];;[5664];[5661, 5659, 5655, 5651, 5649, 5646, 5644, 5720];kas25_freyyr_01;
I hope you can help. I must try to fix what has gone wrong here.;[];;[];[5663];kas25_freyyr_01;
I've decided to kill you for Chuundar!;[];;[5666, 5671, 5672];[5661, 5644, 5720];kas25_freyyr_01;
I don't support this action! Think on this, child!;[];;[5667, 5670];[5665];kas25_freyyr_01;NM25AAFREY02156_.mp3
You are hardly a competent moral guide. Why question me?;[];;[5668];[5666];kas25_freyyr_01;
Look, I'm not your nanny-droid, but I just don't think following Chuundar is the best course.;[];;[5669, 5670];[5667];kas25_freyyr_01;NM25AAFREY02158_.mp3
Fine, I'll talk to Freyyr and think about it.;[];;[5661];[5668];kas25_freyyr_01;
You mind your own business! I've made my decision.;[];;[5671, 5672];[5668, 5666];kas25_freyyr_01;
Doesn't seem like much of a father anyway, kicking his son out like that.;[];Kind of a brooding statement. She doesn't really hate Freyyr, but she sees a bit of her own family problems in the situation and it makes her resigned to killing him. She only knows this person was involved in hurting her only real friend, Zaalbar.;[5672];[5670, 5665, 5691, 5686];kas25_freyyr_01;NM25AAFREY02168_.mp3
Then let my blood feed my beloved Kashyyyk!;[{'Freyyr': 'Talk_Forceful'}];fights to death.;[];[5671, 5670, 5665, 5691, 5686, 5702, 5701, 5705, 5694, 5714, 5709];kas25_freyyr_01;
Describe the creature. Where can I find it?;[];;[5674];[5630, 5685];kas25_freyyr_01;
Many have tried to hunt this beast, but only a few who have seen it have lived to tell the tale. And none have ever managed to kill the creature.;[];;[5675];[5673];kas25_freyyr_01;
Many years ago, when I was far younger than I am now, a Jedi came to hunt the creature... a proud and boastful young man. Like many before him, he did not return.;[];correct with creature name;[5676];[5674];kas25_freyyr_01;
The beast is cunning. It will not appear if there is an overwhelming number waiting to slay it. But if you gather in small numbers, we know how to lure it out.;[];;[5677];[5675];kas25_freyyr_01;
Fresh blood will draw it out. Before Chuundar's rule put an end to the ritual, fresh kills were often left as offerings in the south of this area.;[];;[5631, 5678, 5684, 5686];[5676];kas25_freyyr_01;
I will try to find it. Can you give me any direction?;[];;[5679];[5677, 5685, 5630];kas25_freyyr_01;
There is a place of ritual south of here. If the Great Beast is to be lured out of hiding, it must be done there, using the old ways.;[];;[5680, 5683];[5678];kas25_freyyr_01;
You have already collected the body of a viper kinrath. Such bait would be tempting for the creature. Find a way to display it.;[];;[5681];[5679];kas25_freyyr_01;
I will stay here and try to think of what I will say to Zaalbar. I have wronged him. I hope he can forgive me.;[];;[5682];[5680, 5683];kas25_freyyr_01;
I will be here. Please, <FullName>, find the blade of Bacca's sword. I must make things right.;[];;[];[5681];kas25_freyyr_01;
The flesh of a fresh kill would be tempting bait if displayed properly. Find an appropriate beast of sufficient mass to attract it.;[];;[5681];[5679];kas25_freyyr_01;
And you still think you are worthy of being chieftain?;[];;[5685];[5677, 5630];kas25_freyyr_01;
No, I don't, but better me than Chuundar. He sells his own people for power. Please help, <FullName>. You've brought me hope...;[{'Freyyr': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[5631, 5673, 5678, 5686];[5684];kas25_freyyr_01;
This bores me. I think I'll just kill you!;[];;[5671, 5672, 5687];[5685, 5677, 5630, 5625, 5620, 5613, 5611, 5706, 5606];kas25_freyyr_01;
I don't approve of this! Is Chuundar to be blindly obeyed?;[];;[5688, 5691];[5686];kas25_freyyr_01;NM25AAFREY02085_.mp3
You're my moral guide now? That's not your style.;[];;[5689];[5687];kas25_freyyr_01;
Perhaps not. Do what you will. I'm just wondering if Chuundar is the wiser choice of ally.;[];;[5690, 5691];[5688];kas25_freyyr_01;NM25AAFREY02087_.mp3
Ah, shut up. I'll ask him a few more questions.;[];;[5613];[5689];kas25_freyyr_01;
I've made my decision. The old fool dies!;[];;[5671, 5672];[5689, 5687];kas25_freyyr_01;
What, a scavenger hunt for some sword? You're kidding.;[];;[5693];[5625];kas25_freyyr_01;
I'm afraid not. It was the symbol of our great chieftains for centuries, but it was damaged a generation ago in ritual battle.;[];;[5628];[5692];kas25_freyyr_01;
That's enough. Just die, you old hairbag!;[];;[5672, 5695, 5702];[5617, 5602, 5591];kas25_freyyr_01;
Is that it? You spared his life initially just to cut him off before he can fully explain himself?;[];;[5696, 5703, 5704, 5705];[5694, 5701];kas25_freyyr_01;NM25AAFREY02169_.mp3
Oh, very well. Freyyr, do you know Zaalbar and Chuundar?;[];0;[5593, 5697];[5695];kas25_freyyr_01;
What? Those are my sons. Why do you speak their names? Tell me!;[];;[5596, 5698];[5696, 5592];kas25_freyyr_01;
My name is <FullName>. Chuundar sent me to kill you.;[];;[5699];[5697, 5595];kas25_freyyr_01;
Did he? I'm surprised it took him this long. Very well, do your worst!;[];;[5700, 5701];[5698];kas25_freyyr_01;
Wait! I came here with Zaalbar.;[];;[5597];[5699];kas25_freyyr_01;
I intend to!;[];;[5672, 5695, 5702];[5699];kas25_freyyr_01;
Doesn't seem like much of a father anyway. Hmph! Zaalbar was hurt bad by whatever happened here.;[];Kind of a brooding statement.

I'm leader here. I say he dies!;[];;[5672, 5702];[5695];kas25_freyyr_01;

It doesn't matter. It proves I am no common Czerka slaver.;[];;[5708];[5597];kas25_freyyr_01;
I suppose it does. I will listen... cautiously. Gullibility has harmed me in the past...;[];;[5600];[5707];kas25_freyyr_01;
Chuundar sends his regards. Now die!;[];;[5672, 5710, 5717, 5718];[5589];kas25_freyyr_01;
Did we come this far only to kill this old wook? I don't approve of this at all.;[];;[5711, 5715];[5709];kas25_freyyr_01;NM25AAFREY02105_.mp3
What would you suggest? He attacked us first.;[];;[5712];[5710];kas25_freyyr_01;
I know he did, but not without reason. The only outsiders he's seen for years have been slavers.;[];;[5713, 5714];[5711];kas25_freyyr_01;NM25AAFREY02107_.mp3

I want to ask about what I saw in the Shadowlands.;[];;[6030];[6028, 6022, 6231];kas23_chuunda_01;
Yes, my spies said you found some interesting things down there. Remarkable for an outsider.;[];;[6031, 6070, 6076, 6079];[6029, 6034];kas23_chuunda_01;
There were Mandalorian hunters. Very advanced.;[];Player encountered Mandalorians. Finished plot with them.;[6032];[6030];kas23_chuunda_01;
My spies weren't too clear in explaining what was going on. I hear they could blend against the background of the forest? Interesting.;[];;[6033];[6031];kas23_chuunda_01;
I will have my best Wookiees examine the corpses. I'll keep this knowledge to myself, I think. The Czerka need not know.;[];;[6027, 6034, 6035];[6032];kas23_chuunda_01;
Back to my Shadowland questions, all right?;[];;[6030];[6033, 6075, 6071, 6078, 6082];kas23_chuunda_01;
It's time I left.;[];;[6036];[6033, 6075, 6071, 6078, 6082, 6084, 6028, 6026];kas23_chuunda_01;
Yes, I think it is. But what should I reward you with? I wonder if you know the magnitude of what you have done here?;[];;[6037];[6035];kas23_chuunda_01;
You've made certain I cannot be challenged. With Freyyr gone, there is nobody to whine about the old traditions. Everyone believes in my way... even Zaalbar.;[];;[6038];[6036];kas23_chuunda_01;
I will lead the Wookiee people to a great future... safely under my thumb. What should be the reward, brother? What will be your reward for joining me?;[];;[6039];[6037];kas23_chuunda_01;
You've shown me how useless our traditions are, so what is there to want? I'll take Bacca's sword. At least it's still useful in combat.;[];;[6040, 6062, 6069];[6038];kas23_chuunda_01;
I think that would be fitting.;[];;[6041];[6039];kas23_chuunda_01;
Hmm... I agree with the request. The sword has lost it's influence here, and removing it from Kashyyyk will kill the old ways completely. That would suit my plans well.;[];;[6042, 6054];[6040];kas23_chuunda_01;
Here, let's get the blade off Father's corpse. I should be able to... yes... I think that does it.;[];Freyyr was killed in the throne room (which means his corpse was there and as far as the player is concerned he had Bacca's sword hilt on him, );[6043];[6041, 6065];kas23_chuunda_01;
Take it. It's harmless in the hands of an exile and an outsider. Freyyr was the true force behind it, and the new generation will forget him quickly. You've seen to that.;[];;[6044, 6047, 6051];[6042, 6056];kas23_chuunda_01;
You're not fooling anyone, ya know.;[];;[6045];[6043, 6059];kas23_chuunda_01;NM23ADCHUU01047_.mp3

Don't worry, brother. I know your way is the best. It's the only way our people will survive in a galaxy full of outsider lies.;[];;[6049];[6047];kas23_chuunda_01;
And you, outsider, you'll understand why I don't invite you to stay. The uncontested ruler of Kashyyyk will not abide troublemakers...;[];;[6050];[6048];kas23_chuunda_01;
No matter how helpful they may have been. Goodbye.;[];;[];[6049];kas23_chuunda_01;
Oh, yes. Far better to have both the blade and a possible rival as far from Kashyyyk as possible, hey? *sigh* I feel very tired of this place, now.;[];;[6052];[6043, 6059];kas23_chuunda_01;NM23ADCHUU01041_.mp3

Well, that ends that. Perhaps something else?;[];;[6061];[6054];kas23_chuunda_01;

It's been there since before the forest.;[];;[6073];[6071];kas23_chuunda_01;

I haven't killed Zaalbar because he is my brother, and I hoped he and I could come to an agreement. You are irrelevant.;[];;[6140];[6138, 6201];kas23_chuunda_01;
I may be able to put you to use on a menial task. Zaalbar will have to stay here, of course.;[];;[6141, 6197];[6139];kas23_chuunda_01;
What is this task?;[];;[6142];[6140];kas23_chuunda_01;
A simple thing. Another Wookiee has suffered the same fate as Zaalbar, gone mad and been exiled. He now lurks the Shadowlands.;[];;[6143];[6141, 6198];kas23_chuunda_01;
More importantly, he's pestering my Czerka allies during their Shadowland expeditions. It is not good for business.;[];;[6144, 6182, 6185, 6187];[6142];kas23_chuunda_01;
He's standing against you. The first of many, perhaps?;[];;[6145];[6143];kas23_chuunda_01;
No one will follow a mad-claw. He is merely a nuisance. Besides, he cowers in the Shadowlands. My people know nothing of him.;[];;[6027, 6146, 6178];[6144];kas23_chuunda_01;
I won't do this. Do your own dirty work.;[];;[6147];[6145, 6184, 6186, 6194];kas23_chuunda_01;
You don't have much choice. You can flee the planet if you want, but I am keeping Zaalbar here with me.;[];;[6148];[6146];kas23_chuunda_01;
He'll stay until the mad-claw is dead. The Czerka would never let me hold you, but they don't care what I do with fellow Wookiees.;[];;[6149, 6150, 6176];[6147];kas23_chuunda_01;
You can't do that! He can't do that, can he? He can't hold Zaalbar prisoner just because he's Chieftain, can he?;[];;[6150, 6176];[6148];kas23_chuunda_01;NM23ADCHUU01220_.mp3
Keeping Zaalbar makes this proposition even worse.;[];;[6151];[6149, 6148];kas23_chuunda_01;
What made you think I wanted this to be easy for you? Besides, you won't need him. My people are trained to understand you.;[];;[6152];[6150, 6181];kas23_chuunda_01;
I tell them it's to better understand the enemy. They think it will make the Czerka easier to fight. Actually it makes them easier to obey.;[];;[6153];[6151, 6177];kas23_chuunda_01;
Remember, you can't beat me here. No one would dare oppose me to join with an outsider or an exile.;[];;[6154];[6152];kas23_chuunda_01;
You are wrong, brother. Someone would.;[];;[6155, 6172, 6174];[6153];kas23_chuunda_01;
Who are you talking about, Zaalbar?;[];;[6156];[6154];kas23_chuunda_01;
Do you speak of Freyyr, our father? Why? He was the one that ordered you exiled when you attacked me.;[];;[6157];[6155];kas23_chuunda_01;
He went as mad as you when he finally discovered the slavers. He dared challenge them alone and has not been seen since.;[];;[6158];[6156, 6173, 6175];kas23_chuunda_01;
That was years ago. Let him go, Zaalbar. I rule now. I'll take the Wookiees forward, but there are prices to pay.;[];;[6159, 6170, 6171];[6157];kas23_chuunda_01;
He makes sense, Zaalbar. Perhaps you should listen to him.;[];;[6160];[6158];kas23_chuunda_01;
No more words, outsider. I've given my orders. I can't hold you here, but Zaalbar will stay until you kill the mad-claw in the Shadowlands.;[];;[6161, 6162, 6164, 6165, 6166, 6167, 6169];[6159, 6170, 6171];kas23_chuunda_01;
Don't worry, buddy, we'll get you out of here. You can count on us!;[];;[6162];[6160];kas23_chuunda_01;NM23ADCHUU01246_.mp3
The guards will let you pass now. Leave the village through the northwest and follow the platform to the south and then east.;[];;[6163];[6161, 6164, 6165, 6166, 6168, 6169, 6160];kas23_chuunda_01;
You'll eventually see where Gorwooken waits for you. He'll lower you to the forest floor. Go.;[];;[];[6162];kas23_chuunda_01;
Then I suppose we have little choice. We should proceed with caution, however.;[];;[6162];[6160];kas23_chuunda_01;NM23ADCHUU01248_.mp3
I don't like leaving someone behind, but I guess we don't have a choice.;[];;[6162];[6160];kas23_chuunda_01;NM23ADCHUU01250_.mp3
It is wrong to leave him imprisoned here. We should seek some way to free him when we have the chance.;[];;[6162];[6160];kas23_chuunda_01;NM23ADCHUU01252_.mp3
Query: Shall I begin blasting, master? We could have your hirsute companion free in no time.;[];;[6168];[6160];kas23_chuunda_01;NM23ADCHUU01254_.mp3
Not yet, HK.;[];;[6162];[6167];kas23_chuunda_01;
Let's go kill something and get the Wookiee out.;[];;[6162];[6160];kas23_chuunda_01;NM23ADCHUU01256_.mp3
Don't listen, Zaalbar. It's not worth it.;[];;[6160];[6158];kas23_chuunda_01;
Play along, Zaalbar. I will see what I can do.;[];;[6160];[6158];kas23_chuunda_01;
Yeah Zaalbar, you and me!;[];;[6173];[6154];kas23_chuunda_01;
No outsider, Zaalbar is referring to Freyyr, our father. Why, Zaalbar? He ordered you exiled when you attacked me.;[];;[6157];[6172];kas23_chuunda_01;
You see, Chuundar, there *is* someone. Uh... make it good, Zaalbar.;[];;[6175];[6154];kas23_chuunda_01;
You are too quick to celebrate. Zaalbar talks of Freyyr, our father. Why, Zaalbar? He ordered you exiled when you attacked me.;[];;[6157];[6174];kas23_chuunda_01;
I need Zaalbar with me as a guide.;[];;[6177];[6149, 6148, 6180];kas23_chuunda_01;
No, you won't need him to find your way. Over the years I have had my people trained to understand galactic Basic.;[];;[6152];[6176];kas23_chuunda_01;
I'll consider what you've said. I'll go now.;[];;[6179];[6145, 6184, 6186, 6194];kas23_chuunda_01;
I'll allow you access to the Shadowlands. You will track and kill this insane Wookiee, and maybe then you will earn my favor.;[];;[6180];[6178];kas23_chuunda_01;
Zaalbar stays here to ensure your loyalty. The Czerka would never let me hold you, but they don't care what I do with fellow Wookiees.;[];;[6176, 6181];[6179];kas23_chuunda_01;
You're a fool. You're making the job harder.;[];;[6151];[6180];kas23_chuunda_01;
I want to ask about the Shadowlands.;[];;[6183];[6143];kas23_chuunda_01;
We only enter the Shadowlands for ritual hunting. I'd leave the troublemaker down there but he has proven too good at surviving.;[];;[6184];[6182];kas23_chuunda_01;
He has managed to linger a number of years, cowering in his madness and shame. You are expendable. You will remove him.;[];;[6027, 6146, 6178];[6183];kas23_chuunda_01;
I'm only interested in what I'm looking for. A Star Map.;[];;[6186];[6143];kas23_chuunda_01;
I don't know anything about something like that, and I don't care. Your concerns are nothing to me.;[];;[6027, 6146, 6178];[6185];kas23_chuunda_01;
What happened with you and Zaalbar? Give me your version.;[];;[6188];[6143];kas23_chuunda_01;
Zaalbar didn't tell you? He took offense to my trading a few of our people for favors and weapons.;[];;[6189];[6187];kas23_chuunda_01;
I didn't understand his objection. Imagine the destruction if Czerka Corporation had come in with blasters firing. I saved many lives.;[];;[6190];[6188];kas23_chuunda_01;
Of course, I also gained weapons, and arranged for certain rivals to be taken. I protected my allies, and my power grew.;[];;[6191, 6195];[6189];kas23_chuunda_01;
Which explains why the Wookiees in this room haven't killed you.;[];;[6192];[6190];kas23_chuunda_01;
Each has come to understand the benefit of working with the enemy. Unlike your exiled companion.;[];;[6193];[6191];kas23_chuunda_01;
Young Zaalbar had no foresight. He couldn't control his outrage. He attacked me with his claws and damned himself doing it.;[];;[6194];[6192, 6196];kas23_chuunda_01;
A few careful stories and everyone called him mad-claw. Even father Freyyr. I easily had him exiled.;[];;[6027, 6146, 6178];[6193];kas23_chuunda_01;
You've a complete lack of remorse for your actions. Like a big hairy Hutt.;[];;[6196];[6190];kas23_chuunda_01;
I've heard of these Hutt creatures. They sound like smart traders. They would understand what your exiled companion could not.;[];;[6193];[6195];kas23_chuunda_01;
I would not abandon Zaalbar to you.;[];;[6198];[6140];kas23_chuunda_01;
It isn't your choice, <FirstName>. I already have him. I have a personal matter to discuss with him. You have other duties.;[];;[6142];[6197];kas23_chuunda_01;
Is there a point to this? If this will only lead to a fight, I'd like to get to it.;[];;[6200];[6137];kas23_chuunda_01;
There will be no fight. You wouldn't survive. The village believes in me. They would rise to kill you.;[];;[6201];[6199];kas23_chuunda_01;
I also have the protection of Czerka Corporation guards as well. No, you have no chance while I am unopposed.;[];;[6139];[6200];kas23_chuunda_01;
A nice nest of lies you have constructed.;[];;[6134];[6132];kas23_chuunda_01;
Ignore him, Chuundar. You are dealing with me now.;[];;[6204];[6132];kas23_chuunda_01;
You are mistaken about your worth. You have no leverage here. I have made certain that my people only listen to me.;[];;[6135];[6203];kas23_chuunda_01;
And I am Darth Revan! You will listen to me, Chuundar.;[];;[6206];[6132];kas23_chuunda_01;
You expect me to believe that, <FullName>? Even here on Kashyyyk we have heard the tale of how the Lord of the Sith was killed by the Jedi.;[];;[6207];[6205];kas23_chuunda_01;
[Persuade] I wasn't killed, I was only captured. Now Revan has returned - and you don't want to get on my bad side!;[];;[6208];[6206];kas23_chuunda_01;
[Success] There is something strange about you... a darkness I can smell in your scent. Maybe you are one of the Sith. Maybe you are even Darth Revan, as you claim.;[];;[6209];[6207];kas23_chuunda_01;
But what do I care about Sith and Jedi? Czerka are the only outsiders here on Kashyyyk. And the mighty Chuundar does not bow down, even to them!;[];;[6210];[6208];kas23_chuunda_01;
You are mistaken about your worth, Revan. You have no leverage here. I have all the power, and I have made certain that my people only listen to me.;[];;[6135];[6209];kas23_chuunda_01;
Big Z! What are you doing here? What's going on?;[];;[6212];[6129];kas23_chuunda_01;NM23ADCHUU01299_.mp3
As you can see, <FullName>, I have brought Zaalbar from your ship. Don't worry, Janos was very helpful. There was no damage done... yet.;[];Zaalbar was NOT in the player party. Remove him from the player ship and place here.;[6213, 6221, 6223];[6211, 6129];kas23_chuunda_01;
What are you talking about? How do you know me?;[];;[6214];[6212];kas23_chuunda_01;
Did you think you could walk the upper boughs of Kashyyyk and not be observed? I've had climbers watching you, and your ship.;[];;[6215, 6217, 6219];[6213];kas23_chuunda_01;
Janos allowed it? You must work closely with him.;[];;[6216];[6214, 6222, 6224];kas23_chuunda_01;
You work alongside the slavers. You are no better than they are!;[];;[6131];[6215];kas23_chuunda_01;
You had no right to enter my ship!;[];;[6218];[6214, 6222, 6224];kas23_chuunda_01;
You have learned from the slavers. Learned to take what you want.;[];;[6131];[6217];kas23_chuunda_01;
Why did you think you had to do this behind my back?;[];;[6220];[6214, 6222, 6224];kas23_chuunda_01;
He has become like the slavers. He takes without care.;[];;[6131];[6219];kas23_chuunda_01;
I thought Zaalbar's presence might cause problems.;[];;[6222];[6212];kas23_chuunda_01;
It has, but you couldn't hide him. Your ship carries his scent, his hair. My climbers found him quickly. Others have been watching you.;[];;[6215, 6217, 6219];[6221];kas23_chuunda_01;
I demand an explanation! You don't want me to get angry!;[];;[6224];[6212];kas23_chuunda_01;
You need to realize your situation. I've had climbers watching you since you landed. Taking Zaalbar was easy.;[];;[6215, 6217, 6219];[6223];kas23_chuunda_01;
Well, my mercenary returns. My climbers tell me you did well, <FullName>, although they couldn't follow you the whole time.;[];Secondary, old king killed.;[6226];[None];kas23_chuunda_01;
Chuundar told me who the mad-claw was. Have you done it then? Have you... killed my father?;[];;[6227, 6232, 6234, 6236];[6225];kas23_chuunda_01;
Freyyr was your father? I didn't know that.;[];;[6228];[6226];kas23_chuunda_01;
I avoided his name when I sent you after him, but the pompous old wook must have said something!;[];;[6229];[6227];kas23_chuunda_01;
You're an inattentive fool if you truly didn't know, but it doesn't matter. Zaalbar has begun to see my side of things.;[];;[6230];[6228];kas23_chuunda_01;
I've been reminded of how Freyyr cast me out. I see how easily he has been disposed of, himself. We are stronger without him. Chuundar's way is better.;[];;[6231];[6229, 6233, 6235, 6237];kas23_chuunda_01;
Of course it is. I will make our people strong with outsider weapons and influence. And for you, I shall see that your status is restored... in due time.;[];;[6023, 6029, 6083];[6230];kas23_chuunda_01;
Yes. It had to be done. Move forward.;[];;[6233];[6226];kas23_chuunda_01;
So you did it for Zaalbar's well-being? It's possible, but it doesn't matter. Zaalbar has begun to see my side of things.;[];;[6230];[6232];kas23_chuunda_01;
I butchered him. Is there a problem?;[];;[6235];[6226];kas23_chuunda_01;
Not with me, and I doubt Zaalbar will give you any trouble for it. He's coming around to my way of thinking.;[];;[6230];[6234];kas23_chuunda_01;
I wasn't offered much alternative.;[];;[6237];[6226];kas23_chuunda_01;
That is true. I would have killed you. Besides, the old wook's time is done. Zaalbar has begun to see my side of things.;[];;[6230];[6236];kas23_chuunda_01;
Those Vulkars are dumber than a Coruscant granite slug! They actually think being in that pathetic little gang of theirs makes them important.;[];;[6239];[None];tar03_cand033;NM03AACAND07000_.mp3
Gadon keeps his hidden Beks in line, but Brejik's getting dreams of grandeur. If Davik's smart, he'll slap that young punk back down.;[];;[6240, 6244, 6246];[6238];tar03_cand033;NM03AACAND07002_.mp3
Who are you?;[];;[6241];[6239];tar03_cand033;
I'm someone you don't want to get on the bad side of, and I'm not one for small talk.;[];;[6242, 6243];[6240];tar03_cand033;NM03AACAND07004_.mp3
Besides, you know the arrangement. You Sith don't interfere with Davik's business and you all get a nice cut of his action.;[];;[6243];[6241, 6245];tar03_cand033;NM03AACAND07006_.mp3
I don't have time to stick around here, anyway. Davik's got me working on a special assignment.;[];;[];[6242, 6241, 6245, 6246];tar03_cand033;NM03AACAND07012_.mp3
I need to ask you some questions.;[];;[6245];[6239];tar03_cand033;
Sorry, but I don't usually volunteer information to anyone who just asks.;[];;[6242, 6243];[6244];tar03_cand033;NM03AACAND07009_.mp3
I'll be going now.;[];;[6243];[6239];tar03_cand033;
[Bastila isn't in the mood to talk right now - not with enemies so close by.];[];;[];[None];k_hbas_dialog;
You will have to disable the energy shield around this temple before we can leave. There is a computer here on the Temple summit that has access to the power generators.;[];;[6249];[None];k_hbas_dialog;NM44ACEXIT03000_.mp3
You can also use it to disable the disruptor field that protects the Star Forge. Otherwise, the Ebon Hawk will not be able to leave the planet without crashing.;[];;[];[6248];k_hbas_dialog;NM44ACEXIT03001_.mp3
With each passing moment your old apprentice becomes stronger, Master. We must act quickly to exact your vengeance. Malak will pay for stealing the mantle of Dark Lord from you!;[];;[];[None];k_hbas_dialog;NM45AABAST06902_.mp3
If you have questions, you should direct them towards the Jedi Council members.;[];;[];[None];k_hbas_dialog;NM13AABAST04000_.mp3
The Star Forge is under assault from the entire Republic fleet! If I don't use my Battle Meditation to turn the tide, Admiral Dodonna's capital ships will destroy the Star Forge.;[];;[6253];[None];k_hbas_dialog;NM45AABAST01166_.mp3
I have to stay here in the command center so that I can best use my Battle Meditation against our enemy. If I don't the Star Forge will be lost!;[];;[6254];[6252];k_hbas_dialog;NM45AABAST01167_.mp3
You must go to face Malak without me. Find him, kill him and reclaim the title of Dark Lord of the Sith!;[];;[];[6253];k_hbas_dialog;NM45AABAST01168_.mp3
I know we have not spoken often during our time together, despite my best efforts. And to this point I have respected your privacy. But there is something we must discuss.;[];romance is dead at this point;[6256, 6273, 6275];[None];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06000_.mp3
Fine. What is it?;[];;[6257];[6255, 22551];k_hbas_dialog;
You must prepare yourself for when we face Malak. The confrontation will be difficult for you. I remember how hard it was when I first faced Revan.;[];;[6258, 6272];[6256, 6274, 6470];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06310_.mp3
Is it true you killed Darth Revan?;[];;[6259];[6257];k_hbas_dialog;
It's true that, due to my Battle Meditation, I was with the Jedi strike team that boarded Revan's ship. We did not kill Revan, however.;[];;[6260, 6270, 6271];[6258, 6272];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06294_.mp3
That's not what I heard.;[];;[6261];[6259];k_hbas_dialog;
Our mission was to capture Revan, if possible. It was Malak who turned on his own master, firing upon Revan's ship while we were still on board it.;[];;[6262];[6260, 6270, 6271];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06296_.mp3
It was his desire to kill us and his master both. Thankfully we narrowly escaped the vessel as it exploded.;[];;[6263, 6267, 6269];[6261];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06297_.mp3
So Malak did your job for you.;[];;[6264];[6262];k_hbas_dialog;
As I said, we were there to capture Revan alive. The Jedi do not believe in killing their prisoners. No one deserves execution, no matter what their crimes.;[];;[6265];[6263, 6268, 6269];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06299_.mp3
Remember that Revan and Malak were once great Jedi. Heroes in every sense of the word. They demonstrate the danger of the dark side to us all.;[];;[6266];[6264];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06300_.mp3
I'm sorry. We really shouldn't speak of this anymore. The memory of my confrontation with Revan is... painful. Let's return to the mission, please.;[];;[];[6265];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06301_.mp3
What else did you expect from the Sith?;[];;[6268];[6262];k_hbas_dialog;
True, I suppose. And yet the outcome of that battle was... unexpected. To all of us. Revan's end was... unforeseen.;[];;[6264];[6267];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06303_.mp3
But you would have killed Revan eventually, right?;[];;[6264];[6262];k_hbas_dialog;
But killing Revan is what you're famous for.;[];;[6261];[6259];k_hbas_dialog;
So who killed Revan, then?;[];;[6261];[6259];k_hbas_dialog;
Oh, great. I never get tired of hearing how you killed Darth Revan.;[];;[6259];[6257];k_hbas_dialog;
Not now, Bastila.;[];;[6274];[6255, 22551];k_hbas_dialog;
"No, this cannot wait any longer. You have no understanding of what we are going up against; I will not allow you to go in unprepared!";[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[6257];[6273, 6275];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06003_.mp3
I don't want to talk to you! Can't you take a hint?;[];;[6274];[6255, 22551];k_hbas_dialog;
"I feel the end of our quest is near. Soon we will discover the location of the Star Forge; though what will happen next is... uncertain.";[];;[6277, 6292];[None];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06005_.mp3
I've been watching you. I've seen how you have resisted great temptations and continue to walk the path of the light side. Very commendable.;[];;[6278, 6290];[6276];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06006_.mp3
I couldn't have done it without your help.;[];;[6279];[6277, 22553];k_hbas_dialog;
My role in what you will become is a small one. I can only give you the warnings taught to me by my own master, ultimately it is your own actions that will decide your fate.;[];;[6280];[6278, 6293];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06008_.mp3
And that is why the dark side is so insidious. If you are not careful, you do not even see each small step you take towards it until it is too late.;[];;[6281];[6279, 6291, 6532];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06391_.mp3
"It is so easy to think that we would never fall prey to such a horror; that we have unlimited control, vigilance and foresight. If only that were true.";[];;[6282];[6280, 6534, 6536, 6538];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06392_.mp3
The Sith have become powerful because there are many Jedi who have succumbed to the lure of the dark side and joined their cause.;[];;[6283];[6281];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06393_.mp3
What greater weapon is there than to turn an enemy to your cause? To use their own knowledge against them?;[];;[6284];[6282];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06394_.mp3
We are weakened while they are strengthened. So we must harden our hearts and do whatever is required to fight against the dark side. Even when the battle becomes wearying.;[];;[6285, 6288];[6283];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06395_.mp3
Do whatever is required? Such as?;[];;[6286];[6284];k_hbas_dialog;
I don't know. The vision of our future is clouded by shadows cast from the dark side. But I sense something ominous lurking in those shadows.;[{'Bastila': 'Persuade'}];;[6287];[6285];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06397_.mp3
But words alone cannot save one from the dark side. Come, we should continue with the task at hand. When the time comes I only hope we are all strong enough to do what we must.;[];;[];[6286, 6289];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06398_.mp3
Must we keep discussing this?;[];;[6289];[6284];k_hbas_dialog;
No, I suppose not. I have spoken more than enough of the dark side. It is up to you whether you heed my words or not.;[];;[6287];[6288];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06400_.mp3
Don't worry. The dark side has no sway over me.;[];;[6291];[6277, 22553];k_hbas_dialog;
The path of the light is a difficult one to walk. We might not even see the shadows until we are surrounded and can never find our way back.;[];;[6280];[6290, 6294];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06010_.mp3
I've been watching you. I've seen you give in to temptation and indulge your baser emotions on many occassions. I'm afraid you are on the path that leads to the dark side.;[];;[6293, 6294];[6276];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06011_.mp3
I don't need a lecture from you. Not now, not ever.;[];;[6279];[6292, 22554];k_hbas_dialog;
I'm sorry, Bastila. I will try to do better.;[];;[6291];[6292, 22554];k_hbas_dialog;
[Bastila seems to have something on her mind. Perhaps you should talk to her about it.];[];;[6296, 6790];[None];k_hbas_dialog;
[Speak to Bastila.];[];;[6297];[6295, 22555];k_hbas_dialog;
How can I help?;[];if Helena has been talked to and is waiting for the holocron K_SWG_HELENA == 3;[6298, 6334, 6336, 6343];[6296];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06014_.mp3
Do you want to talk?;[];;[6299];[6297, 22556];k_hbas_dialog;
About my mother? I am unsure. I seem to find it difficult to remain objective when it comes to her. I find that... disturbing.;[];;[6300, 6313, 6323, 6329, 6332, 6334];[6298];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06016_.mp3
You don't think we should look for the holocron?;[];;[6301];[6299, 6324];k_hbas_dialog;
We have more important things to do. Still... my father is dead. Just because we find the holocron doesn't mean I have to give it to her.;[];;[6302, 6305, 6309, 6311];[6300];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06018_.mp3
Why do you think she wants it so badly?;[];;[6303];[6301];k_hbas_dialog;
Father recorded all his personal thoughts in that holocron even when I knew him. Having it would be like having him with you.;[];;[6304];[6302];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06020_.mp3
I don't see why she deserves it, however. She drove him to his death. I loved him... and I didn't even have a chance to say goodbye.;[];;[6305, 6309, 6311];[6303];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06021_.mp3
You'd keep it for yourself?;[];;[6306];[6304, 6301];k_hbas_dialog;
I don't know. Part of me would keep it just so she didn't get it. I don't like that part of me.;[];;[6307];[6305];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06023_.mp3
I would have thought my Jedi training would have put me past this kind of pettiness. I wish... I really don't want to think about this.;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[6308];[6306, 6310];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06024_.mp3
Please, let's just keep going.;[];;[];[6307, 6312];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06025_.mp3
That sounds a bit selfish.;[];;[6310];[6304, 6301];k_hbas_dialog;
It does, doesn't it? I can't seem to help myself.;[];;[6307];[6309];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06027_.mp3
Maybe you're right.;[];;[6312];[6304, 6301];k_hbas_dialog;
Yes... maybe. I don't feel good about it, still.;[];;[6308];[6311];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06029_.mp3
Are you going to give the holocron to her?;[];;[6314];[6299, 6324];k_hbas_dialog;
Do you think I should?;[];;[6315, 6319, 6321];[6313];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06031_.mp3
You might want to consider it.;[];;[6316];[6314];k_hbas_dialog;
That would just lead into another argument. How I always despised talking to her.;[];;[6317];[6315];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06033_.mp3
I'll think about it. I should... try and remember my training. I should be able to let go of this, but I can't.;[];;[6318];[6316, 6320];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06038_.mp3
I don't want to talk about this any more. Let's... keep going.;[];;[];[6317, 6328, 6331];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06045_.mp3
Do you need it more than she does?;[];;[6320];[6314];k_hbas_dialog;
I would like to keep something to remember Father as much as she would.;[];;[6317];[6319];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06035_.mp3
Probably not. She doesn't deserve it.;[];;[6322];[6314];k_hbas_dialog;
I find myself agreeing with you, but I don't like how that feels.;[];;[];[6321];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06037_.mp3
Why didn't you ask about her sickness?;[];;[6324];[6299];k_hbas_dialog;
I have my doubts as to whether she's actually sick.;[];;[6300, 6313, 6325, 6329, 6332, 6334];[6323];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06040_.mp3
Why would she lie about it?;[];;[6326];[6324];k_hbas_dialog;
Mother used to lie about many things to get her way. She is a selfish woman who pushed my father into doing what she wished.;[];;[6327];[6325];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06042_.mp3
You sound bitter.;[];;[6328];[6326];k_hbas_dialog;
Yes, I... thought I had let go of that anger. All my training, and it comes back so quickly...;[];;[6318];[6327];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06044_.mp3
She certainly seemed to upset you.;[];;[6330];[6324, 6299];k_hbas_dialog;
I told you that my mother and I never got along. Obviously that has not changed.;[];;[6331];[6329];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06047_.mp3
And now Father is dead. That... leaves a hurt inside, you just can't imagine. I haven't seen him in so long...;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[6318];[6330];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06048_.mp3
I don't think we have time to go searching for anything.;[];;[6333];[6324, 6299];k_hbas_dialog;
You're probably right. There are more important things to do. Mother can wait.;[];;[];[6332];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06050_.mp3
Never mind.;[];;[6335];[6324, 6299, 6337, 6297, 22556];k_hbas_dialog;
Then I suggest we move on.;[];;[];[6334, 6773];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06616_.mp3
Can you show me one of the visions again?;[];;[6337];[6297, 6345, 6775, 6777, 6782, 22556];k_hbas_dialog;
I can try. What would you like me to recall?;[];;[6334, 6338, 6340, 6341, 6342];[6336];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06069_.mp3
The vision we had on Korriban.;[];;[6339];[6337];k_hbas_dialog;
I shall do my best. Calm your mind and remember...;[];;[];[6338, 6340, 6341, 6342];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06071_.mp3
The vision we had on Manaan.;[];;[6339];[6337];k_hbas_dialog;
The vision we had on Kashyyyk.;[];;[6339];[6337];k_hbas_dialog;
The vision we had on Tatooine.;[];;[6339];[6337];k_hbas_dialog;
Do you know anything about this place?;[];Bastila in the party;[6344, 6774, 6776, 6778, 6779, 6780, 6782];[6297, 22556];k_hbas_dialog;
The surface of Taris is covered with an urban skyscrape. Its glittering spires belie the decay that lies in its lower reaches, however.;[];;[6345];[6343];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06058_.mp3
Beyond that, there is little else I can tell you.;[];;[6336, 6346, 6376, 6420, 6469, 6471, 6515, 6548, 6589, 6639, 6676, 6710, 6771, 6773];[6344, 6778, 6779, 6781];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06059_.mp3
You want to talk to me about something?;[];available immediately K_SWG_BASTILA at 0;[6347];[6345, 6775, 6777, 6782];k_hbas_dialog;
I would like to know what happened after you crashed on Taris. I'm curious as to what you and Carth were doing before we all joined forces.;[];;[6348, 6374];[6346];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06135_.mp3
Before we rescued you, you mean.;[];;[6349];[6347];k_hbas_dialog;
I managed to free myself, as I recall. In fact, if I hadn't been there Brejik and his thugs might have killed you in that fight. It's probably more accurate to say that I rescued you.;[];;[6350, 6373];[6348];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06137_.mp3
Can't you just admit that you were rescued?;[];;[6351];[6349];k_hbas_dialog;
I'll admit that I probably wouldn't have been able to free myself if not for the brawl after the swoop race. I guess I should thank you for that, at least.;[];;[6352];[6350, 6373];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06139_.mp3
Actually, your presence at the swoop track is what I'm curious about. It couldn't have been an easy task to find me there. Yet somehow you managed.;[];;[6353];[6351];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06772_.mp3
You also avoided detection by the Sith, discovered I was a Vulkar prisoner, gained sponsorship for the race and became the Taris swoop champion. That's quite a resume.;[];;[6354, 6369, 6371];[6352, 6375];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06773_.mp3
And rescued the damsel in distress. Don't forget that.;[];;[6355];[6353];k_hbas_dialog;
Yes... well. I hardly consider myself a damsel in distress. I'm a member of the Jedi Order, after all. But I won't deny you've impressed me with what you've done.;[];;[6356];[6354];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06148_.mp3
When you were chosen to join this mission, I doubt any of us expected this much from you. A Jedi could have done such things, of course. But only by drawing heavily upon the Force.;[];;[6357, 6367];[6355, 6370, 6372];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06153_.mp3
Are you trying to say I can control the Force?;[];;[6358];[6356];k_hbas_dialog;
The Force is in all of us, though for most people it is a barely measurable whisper. But there are some individuals outside the Jedi Order that we considered 'Force Sensitive'.;[];;[6359];[6357];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06775_.mp3
It is obvious to me that the Force has been working through you. There is no other explanation for your great success, though I am not certain what to make of this discovery.;[];;[6360];[6358, 6368];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06776_.mp3
Perhaps if you weren't - well, if you were younger the Jedi might take you for training. But as it is...;[];;[6361, 6364, 6366];[6359];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06777_.mp3
What are you trying to say?;[];;[6362];[6360];k_hbas_dialog;
"I'm sorry; I've overstepped my authority. I'm speaking of things that are best left to the Jedi Council. For now let's just accept the fact that you are... gifted.";[];;[6363];[6361, 6366];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06779_.mp3
Hopefully between your abilities, my Jedi training and the skills of our companions we can find a way off this planet.;[];;[];[6362, 6365];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06780_.mp3
Be glad I'm Force sensitive, or I couldn't have rescued you.;[];;[6365];[6360];k_hbas_dialog;
Ah, yes, the rescue again. Very well. For what it's worth, I conceed the point to you: you rescued me from Brejik. And yet we're still stuck on here on Taris.;[];;[6363];[6364];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06782_.mp3
I don't want to talk about this anymore.;[];;[6362];[6360];k_hbas_dialog;
I think you're underestimating us non-Jedi.;[];;[6368];[6356];k_hbas_dialog;
Perhaps. But the Force works through all of us to some degree or another. There are some individuals outside the Jedi Order that we considered 'Force Sensitive'.;[];;[6359];[6367];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06785_.mp3
What can I say? I'm a talented individual.;[];;[6370];[6353];k_hbas_dialog;
"Yes, I can see you do not lack in ability; although modesty is another matter.";[];;[6356];[6369];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06787_.mp3
I had a lot of help: Carth, Mission, Zaalbar.;[];;[6372];[6353];k_hbas_dialog;
Your modesty is admirable. But though others helped, you were the catalyst for these events.;[];;[6356];[6371];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06789_.mp3
You didn't escape the Black Vulkars until we arrived, as I recall.;[];;[6351];[6349];k_hbas_dialog;
We were looking for you.;[];;[6375];[6347];k_hbas_dialog;
"Yes, I realize that of course. But surely there was more to it than a simple search. I doubt there were flashing signs pointing you in my direction; yet somehow you found me.";[];;[6353];[6374];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06146_.mp3
You look like something's bothering you.;[];only after going to Dantooine K_SWG_BASTILA at 1;[6377];[6345, 6775, 6777, 6782];k_hbas_dialog;
No, not bothering me. Not exactly. I've been thinking about what the Jedi Council said about the two of us.;[];;[6378];[6376];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06183_.mp3
There is a bond between us, I do not dispute that. I can feel it, as I'm sure you can. The nature of that bond and its effect on our mission remain in question.;[];;[6379, 6415, 6417, 6419];[6377];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06184_.mp3
I think you're interested in more than just the 'bond' between us.;[{'Player': 'Flirt'}];;[6380];[6378];k_hbas_dialog;
Please! I'm a Jedi. Such feelings, such attractions, are... well, they're beneath me, quite frankly.;[];;[6381];[6379];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06791_.mp3
I admit, I find you intriguing. Uh... I mean, I find your command of the Force intriguing. But my interest in you is purely academic. Surely you can understand why.;[];;[6382];[6380];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06792_.mp3
"Our fates are strongly connected; so connected that a literal bond has been forged between us.";[];;[6383];[6381, 6419];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06190_.mp3
I saw your service records when you were transferred aboard the Endar Spire, but nothing beyond that. I know very little about you. I'd like to ask you some questions, given our relationship.;[];;[6384, 6389, 6413];[6382, 6416, 6418];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06191_.mp3
Our relationship? Is this some kind of clumsy come-on?;[];;[6385];[6383];k_hbas_dialog;
"I was referring to the bond we share; the one the Jedi Council spoke of. If I actually was interested in you, rest assured I could come up with a better approach than this!";[];;[6386, 6389];[6384];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06193_.mp3
Whoa, guess I touched a nerve there, huh?;[];;[6387];[6385];k_hbas_dialog;
Touched a nerve, no. Getting on my nerves, most definitely. I suppose this is what you men consider being witty. *sigh*;[];;[6388];[6386];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06793_.mp3
Now, are you going to answer my questions? Or would you rather just keep annoying me?;[];;[6389, 6412];[6387];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06794_.mp3
Okay, I'll answer a few questions.;[];;[6390];[6388, 6385, 6383];k_hbas_dialog;
Don't worry, these are simple questions. Nothing too intrusive. First, what kind of background do you have?;[];;[6391, 6407, 6409, 6410, 6411];[6389];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06797_.mp3
I was a smuggler before I joined the fleet.;[];;[6392];[6390, 6414];k_hbas_dialog;
Good. On which planet were you born?;[];;[6393, 6408];[6391, 6409, 6410];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06211_.mp3
Deralia. It's in a remote system. Why?;[];;[6394];[6392];k_hbas_dialog;
Excellent. Your current age is?;[];;[6395, 6403, 6407];[6393];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06213_.mp3
Wasn't all this in my service records?;[];;[6396];[6394];k_hbas_dialog;
"Yes, well... The truth is I was studying *how* you responded to my questions. Your reactions help me judge you; this was a test for me to learn more about your character.";[];;[6397, 6401];[6395];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06215_.mp3
And what did you find out?;[];;[6398];[6396];k_hbas_dialog;
You were honest, which is good. And you treated this as a serious matter, which it is. This bond we share will shape both our destinies, it is not to be taken lightly.;[];;[6399];[6397];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06217_.mp3
But I imagine you've had enough questions for a while. So many things have happened to you since Taris. It's probably a lot for you to absorb.;[];;[6400];[6398];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06798_.mp3
We can speak again later, after you've had time to think about all this.;[];;[];[6399, 6402];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06799_.mp3
I don't like being manipulated!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[6402];[6396];k_hbas_dialog;
I see. I didn't mean to upset you, but I suppose it was inevitable. You've had a lot to absorb since we escaped Taris. I apologize.;[];;[6400];[6401, 6407];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06229_.mp3
3,012. Healthy living, you know.;[];;[6404];[6394];k_hbas_dialog;
I see you intend to be childish about this. I guess I won't get anywhere continuing our discussion right now, will I?;[];;[6405, 6406];[6403, 6408, 6411, 6412];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06224_.mp3
I suppose I'll just have to speak to you again later. Hopefully you'll behave a little less like a little boy and a little more like a... like a man!;[];;[];[6404];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06801_.mp3
I suppose I'll just have to speak to you again later. Hopefully you'll be a little more... mature.;[];;[];[6404];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06802_.mp3
I'm sick of answering questions!;[];;[6402];[6394, 6390, 6414];k_hbas_dialog;
Kashyyyk. I'm a Wookiee... can't you tell?;[];;[6404];[6392];k_hbas_dialog;
I was a scout. The fleet recruited me for my skills.;[];;[6392];[6390, 6414];k_hbas_dialog;
Nothing extravagant. I'm a soldier.;[];;[6392];[6390, 6414];k_hbas_dialog;
I'm a Hutt in human form plotting to overthrow the Republic.;[];;[6404];[6390, 6414];k_hbas_dialog;
Uh... the second one.;[];;[6404];[6388];k_hbas_dialog;
Forget it. I'm not interested.;[];;[6414];[6383];k_hbas_dialog;
Why would you refuse to answer? These are simple questions, nothing too intrusive. First, what kind of background do you have?;[];;[6391, 6407, 6409, 6410, 6411];[6413];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06226_.mp3
Doesn't the bond mean my presence is necessary?;[];;[6416];[6378];k_hbas_dialog;
Necessary, perhaps, but it is no guarantee of our success. I admit, I'm a little disturbed that such a bond could be possible in the first place.;[];;[6383];[6415];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06186_.mp3
I don't believe in this 'bond', regardless of what the Jedi Council said.;[];;[6418];[6378];k_hbas_dialog;
Deny it if you will, but there is a connection between us. I understand why you would find this disturbing. I have my own reservations about it, to be honest.;[];;[6383];[6417];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06188_.mp3
I still don't understand this bond of ours.;[];;[6382];[6378];k_hbas_dialog;
You have something you want to ask me?;[];only after going to Dantooine K_SWG_BASTILA at 2;[6421];[6345, 6775, 6777, 6782];k_hbas_dialog;
I do. How did you know?;[];only after going to Dantooine K_SWG_BASTILA at 2;[6422, 6465, 6467];[6420];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06232_.mp3
Well... your face is all scrunched up like a kinrath pup.;[];;[6423, 6460];[6421];k_hbas_dialog;
A... a kinrath pup?! It most certainly is not!;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[6424];[6422];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06234_.mp3
I am a Jedi, remember? I have far too much mental discipline to reveal what goes on inside my mind with such obvious physical clues.;[];;[6425];[6423, 6466];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06235_.mp3
My thoughts remain hidden, including whatever my feelings are for you. Uh... I mean whatever I feel *about* you... uh... I mean whatever I *think* about you.;[];;[6426, 6459];[6424];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06803_.mp3
You're so cute when you're embarrassed.;[];;[6427];[6425];k_hbas_dialog;
"I... that is, you... Why must you be so impossibly infuriating?! You know very well what I'm really talking about. I'm referring to the bond between us; the one the Jedi Council spoke of.";[];;[6428];[6426, 6459];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06805_.mp3
Our connection allows us glimpses into each other's mind. We can feel some of what the other feels. And what I feel within you troubles me.;[];;[6429];[6427, 6461, 6462, 6464];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06237_.mp3
A Padawan must receive considerable training. They must learn to control their emotions and darker impulses. Often it takes years before using the Force can be considered safe.;[];;[6430];[6428];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06238_.mp3
The fact that you are so strong in the Force and have had such relatively little training could have terrible consequences. For you, and for everyone around you.;[];;[6431, 6455, 6457];[6429];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06239_.mp3
What do you think I should do?;[];;[6432];[6430];k_hbas_dialog;
I don't think there is much you can do. If things were different I would recommend several years of training under one of the Jedi Masters. But I fear that won't be possible.;[];;[6433, 6454];[6431];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06245_.mp3
Already you exhibit the kind of willfullness, erratic behavior and lack of compassion that will lead you to corruption.;[];;[6434];[6432, 6456, 6458];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06246_.mp3
We must all resist the influence of the dark side! It is everything we are fighting against! This is doubly important for you, with your natural affinity for the Force!;[];;[6435, 6450, 6452];[6433, 6454];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06248_.mp3
I will try.;[];;[6436];[6434];k_hbas_dialog;
That is good to hear. Without the proper training, however, I'm afraid you will find the path difficult even with the best of intentions. There is great danger ahead, for both of us.;[];;[6437];[6435];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06254_.mp3
Our destinies are intertwined. Everything one of us does will have consequences for the other. Any reckless behavior on your part is likely to affect me as well.;[];;[6438, 6446, 6448];[6436, 6451, 6453];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06255_.mp3
I won't do anything to hurt you.;[];;[6439];[6437];k_hbas_dialog;
I believe you truly mean what you say. For now. But sometimes it is not so easy to keep such promises.;[];;[6440];[6438];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06261_.mp3
Your power could be a gift or a curse. When you need guidance, or advice, or support I will do my best to help you stay on the path of the light.;[];;[6441, 6443, 6445];[6439, 6447, 6449];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06262_.mp3
I would appreciate any help you could offer.;[];;[6442];[6440];k_hbas_dialog;
I only hope I will have the wisdom to help you through the dark times. But for now, we should return to our mission.;[];;[];[6441, 6444];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06808_.mp3
I doubt I'll be a risk to the mission.;[];;[6444];[6440];k_hbas_dialog;
No, of course not. Not yet. But there will be challenges ahead that might make it otherwise.;[];;[6442];[6443, 6445];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06266_.mp3
I don't need your help.;[];;[6444];[6440];k_hbas_dialog;
It works both ways, doesn't it? You could help me stay strong.;[];;[6447];[6437];k_hbas_dialog;
Yes, that is true. I will do my best to guide you, but I am no Master. Not yet. And there are times when I find the sheer strength of your power almost overwhelming.;[];;[6440];[6446];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06259_.mp3
So you're just worried about yourself, then.;[];;[6449];[6437];k_hbas_dialog;
That's not true. I am worried about myself, but also about you. I would rather see neither of us come to any harm.;[];;[6440];[6448];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06257_.mp3
Why are you getting so upset?;[];;[6451];[6434];k_hbas_dialog;
I'm sorry if I come across as harsh. But I am concerned. For you, for our mission. And for myself, as well.;[];;[6437];[6450];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06250_.mp3
I don't need you harassing me, thanks.;[];;[6453];[6434];k_hbas_dialog;
I am not trying to harass you. But you must understand the trials and perils that lie ahead. For you, and for me.;[];;[6437];[6452];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06252_.mp3
Thankfully you have exhibited a degree of compassion and self-control up to this point. I sincerely hope you can maintain these traits in the future.;[];;[6434];[6432, 6456, 6458];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06247_.mp3
I don't think mastering my emotions is necessary.;[];;[6456];[6430];k_hbas_dialog;
No? Self-control is a maxim for all Jedi. It is what gives us the strength to resist the dark side. All who have fallen from our Order have shown a flagrant disregard for such control.;[];;[6433, 6454];[6455];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06243_.mp3
You could warn me when I do something bad. Blink once for dark side, twice for light.;[];;[6458];[6430];k_hbas_dialog;
This is not a joke! The choices you make could affect both our destinies, not to mention the fate of the Republic and the entire galaxy! There is much at stake.;[];;[6433, 6454];[6457];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06241_.mp3
You have feelings for me?;[];;[6427];[6425];k_hbas_dialog;
An amusing description, but hardly the truth. We both know the real reason you have some idea of what I am thinking: the bond we share.;[];;[6461, 6462, 6463];[6422];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06807_.mp3
What do you mean?;[];;[6428];[6460, 6468];k_hbas_dialog;
Maybe.;[];player has been to Dantooine;[6428];[6460, 6468];k_hbas_dialog;
No, I doubt it.;[];;[6464];[6460, 6468];k_hbas_dialog;
Why do you still try to deny the existence of this bond between us? Like it or not, we are linked... as our shared vision of the Star Map proved.;[];;[6428];[6463];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06268_.mp3
Well, you keep staring at me. See anything you like?;[{'Player': 'Flirt'}];;[6466];[6421];k_hbas_dialog;
You are easily the vainest, most arrogant man I have ever met! Besides, I know you can't be serious, since I was purposefully *not* staring in your direction.;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[6424];[6465];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06810_.mp3
Educated guess, from the way you keep staring.;[];;[6468];[6421];k_hbas_dialog;
I am a Jedi. I am far too disciplined to betray my emotions with outward physical displays. We both know the real reason you have some idea of what I am thinking: the bond we share.;[];;[6461, 6462, 6463];[6467];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06272_.mp3
You wanted to speak to me?;[];only after going to Dantooine K_SWG_BASTILA at 3;[6470];[6345, 6775, 6777, 6782];k_hbas_dialog;
Yes, I did. I wanted to speak to you about our mission. About what lies ahead for us. It seems fate, or the Force, is driving us into a confrontation with the Dark Lord.;[];;[6257];[6469];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06276_.mp3
I'd like to know more about you, Bastila.;[];available after first starmap K_SWG_BASTILA at 4;[6472];[6345, 6775, 6777, 6782];k_hbas_dialog;
Yes, I suppose I can understand your curiosity, given the bond that connects us. Very well, I'll tell you a bit about myself.;[];;[6473];[6471];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06315_.mp3
Tell me how you joined the Jedi, then.;[];;[6474];[6472];k_hbas_dialog;
I was found to be strong with the Force at a young age, as most Padawans are. As a girl I was given to the Order to be trained.;[];;[6475];[6473];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06317_.mp3
When I joined the Order I left my family on Talravin, as all Padawans do. My family is still there, the last that I heard. I have had little contact with them, as it is discouraged.;[];;[6476, 6514];[6474];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06318_.mp3
Discouraged? Why?;[];;[6477];[6475];k_hbas_dialog;
Relationships with family members are fraught with powerful emotions. Such extremes are to be avoided. Anger and hate are the worst, but even love can lead to folly.;[];;[6478, 6498, 6501];[6476, 6514];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06320_.mp3
You aren't allowed to love?;[];;[6479];[6477];k_hbas_dialog;
Emotional entanglements can be dangerous. They can impair rational thought, they can lead to outbursts of uncontrolled emotion. A Jedi must be above such things.;[];;[6480, 6498];[6478, 6507, 6510, 6513];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06322_.mp3
You don't sound very convinced.;[];;[6481];[6479, 6499];k_hbas_dialog;
It can be a hard lesson to learn. I was not on good terms with all of my family, but I do remember missing my father terribly for a very long time.;[];;[6482, 6494, 6496];[6480, 6500];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06339_.mp3
Who weren't you on good terms with?;[];;[6483];[6481];k_hbas_dialog;
I was not on good terms with my mother. I was only a little girl when I left, but I was old enough to resent her and the way she treated my father.;[];set global for Bastila plot to be startable;[6484];[6482, 6497];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06341_.mp3
She pushed my father into treasure hunting. I spent all my young life on ships traveling from one false lead to the next.;[];;[6485];[6483];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06342_.mp3
She whittled away my father's entire fortune, and I hated her for it. I think she was relieved to give me to the Jedi, but my father was heartbroken.;[];;[6486, 6494];[6484];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06343_.mp3
You never tried to get in touch with your father again?;[];;[6487];[6485];k_hbas_dialog;
A child is too young to understand the sacrifices that must be made. It is better if they have no contact with their family once they are removed.;[];;[6488];[6486];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06348_.mp3
Once I was older I realized the wisdom of this policy. A Jedi must do what is needed, personal desires notwithstanding. Love can only obscure and confuse the matter.;[];;[6489, 6492, 6493];[6487];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06350_.mp3
You sound very sad when you say that.;[];;[6490];[6488];k_hbas_dialog;
Even a Jedi cannot always control the feelings of the heart. We must do our best to guard against it, no matter what the cost. But some sacrifices are harder than others.;[];;[6491];[6489, 6492, 6493];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06355_.mp3
I... I do not wish to discuss this anymore. I would rather return to our mission.;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[];[6490];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06353_.mp3
Are you saying you no longer feel love?;[];;[6490];[6488];k_hbas_dialog;
But if a Jedi were to love, surely it wouldn't be all bad.;[];;[6490];[6488];k_hbas_dialog;
I don't need to hear the family history, thanks.;[];;[6495];[6485, 6481];k_hbas_dialog;
You were the one who asked to know more about me! Very well, if you have changed your mind then I suppose we should just get back to our mission.;[];;[];[6494];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06347_.mp3
You and your father were close?;[];;[6497];[6481];k_hbas_dialog;
Very close. I was only a little girl when I left my family, but I still remember him fondly. He was kind and gentle and doted on me. My mother, however, was different.;[];;[6483];[6496];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06345_.mp3
Don't you miss your family at all?;[];;[6499];[6479, 6504, 6502, 6477];k_hbas_dialog;
Like all who join the Order, I have learned to embrace the life I have chosen. I had to let go of my attachments to my family.;[];;[6480, 6500];[6498];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06337_.mp3
That must have been difficult.;[];;[6481];[6499];k_hbas_dialog;
That sounds idiotic. I would never agree to that.;[];;[6502];[6477];k_hbas_dialog;
The gift of the Force comes with a high cost. Sacrifice of one's emotional attachments is one of the prices a Jedi must be willing to pay. The alternative is to fall prey to the dark side.;[];;[6498, 6503, 6513];[6501];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06325_.mp3
And what's so wrong with that?;[];;[6504];[6502];k_hbas_dialog;
Please, you mustn't say things like that. The dark side is destruction and chaos, the opposite of all that gives the universe order and purpose. You have to understand this.;[];;[6498, 6505, 6513];[6503];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06327_.mp3
You need to lighten up.;[];;[6506];[6504];k_hbas_dialog;
And you need to be more mindful of your responsibilities! Have you any idea of the danger a fallen Jedi represents? Not only to yourself, but to others as well?;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[6507, 6508, 6511];[6505];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06329_.mp3
It just seems wrong not to be allowed to love.;[];;[6479];[6506];k_hbas_dialog;
Sounds like you're the one afraid of falling.;[];;[6509];[6506];k_hbas_dialog;
That is something every Jedi should be afraid of.;[];;[6510, 6511];[6508];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06331_.mp3
I don't see how falling in love could lead to the dark side, though.;[];;[6479];[6509];k_hbas_dialog;
Spare me the lecture. I'm not in the mood.;[];;[6512];[6509, 6506];k_hbas_dialog;
A lecture won't be much use if you aren't prepared to listen. I suppose it would be best if we didn't speak about this for a while. Let's just return to our mission for now.;[];;[];[6511];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06813_.mp3
Why wouldn't you be allowed to love?;[];;[6479];[6504, 6502];k_hbas_dialog;
So the Jedi separates children from their families?;[];;[6477];[6475];k_hbas_dialog;
You wish to talk to me?;[];available after first starmap K_SWG_BASTILA at 5;[6516];[6345, 6775, 6777, 6782];k_hbas_dialog;
I do. I've been watching you. Studying you closely to see what kind of progress you have made since your training at the hands of Master Zhar.;[];;[6517, 6546, 6547];[6515];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06365_.mp3
I think we both know the real reason you've been watching me.;[{'Player': 'Flirt'}];;[6518];[6516];k_hbas_dialog;
You never give up, do you? I admit I'm interested in you. I find you intriguing. Compelling, even. But it's not what you think.;[];;[6519];[6517];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06815_.mp3
You have a great gift. You have an awesome command of the Force, and I tremble when I think of how you might misuse it.;[];;[6520, 6545];[6518];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06816_.mp3
I make you tremble? Do you get all tingly inside, too?;[{'Player': 'Flirt'}];;[6521];[6519];k_hbas_dialog;
"What? I... no! No, of course not! Not like that, anyway. In many ways you are... you are dangerous. You could be the savior of the galaxy; or you could bring untold destruction upon us all.";[];;[6522, 6544];[6520];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06818_.mp3
I've seen how you have resisted many temptations and continue to walk the path of the light side. Very commendable, but I'm afraid you might stray from this path.;[];;[6523];[6521, 6545, 6546, 6547];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06367_.mp3
You need to see what the dark side represents in its entirety, for it is what we battle. Only the wisdom of a Jedi Master can truly explain this, but I will do my best to make you understand.;[];;[6524, 6542];[6522, 6544];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06375_.mp3
What are you trying to tell me?;[];;[6525];[6523];k_hbas_dialog;
The dark side is not simply giving in to anger or temptation to use the Force to destructive ends. These things only lead to the dark side.;[];;[6526];[6524, 6543];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06376_.mp3
The dark side grows stronger and more insidious the closer you draw to it. It begs you to surrender to it, to release all its terrible power... and it becomes harder and harder to resist.;[];;[6527];[6525];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06377_.mp3
And once you stop resisting, it is too late. It twists you up inside and... and turns you into a mockery of everything you once stood for.;[];;[6528, 6539, 6540];[6526];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06378_.mp3
You seem to know that temptation very well.;[];;[6529];[6527];k_hbas_dialog;
I am no less resistant to temptation than any other. I simply have the benefit of training that you do not. But even the training of the Jedi might not be enough to save us.;[];;[6530];[6528];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06380_.mp3
We need only to look at the atrocities which have been committed by those under its sway to understand the terrible, corrupting evil of the dark side.;[];;[6531];[6529, 6539, 6541];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06382_.mp3
Millions dead, and far more suffering. What sort of person would you have to become to perform such deeds gladly?;[];;[6532, 6533, 6535, 6537];[6530];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06383_.mp3
I couldn't see myself ever doing such things.;[];;[6280];[6531];k_hbas_dialog;
Perhaps it's just the reasoning for those acts you don't accept.;[];;[6534];[6531];k_hbas_dialog;
And how adept must one become at making excuses for one's actions, if suffering is the result? How long before you stop making excuses at all?;[];;[6281];[6533];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06389_.mp3
Are you saying the light side is innocent of killing?;[];;[6536];[6531];k_hbas_dialog;
One who serves the light side does not strike down an innocent. We take arms against the dark side and the injustice that follows it only.;[];;[6281];[6535];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06385_.mp3
I don't know.;[];;[6538];[6531];k_hbas_dialog;
Neither do I, and I hope I never do.;[];;[6281];[6537];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06387_.mp3
How can you know it is so terrible?;[];;[6530];[6527];k_hbas_dialog;
Stop with the dramatics, already, I get the picture.;[];;[6541];[6527];k_hbas_dialog;
You say you understand, but I'm afraid you are taking this too lightly. The power of the dark side can be... alluring.;[];;[6530];[6540];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06402_.mp3
We're not going to go over this again, are we?;[];;[6543];[6523];k_hbas_dialog;
We must, for all our sakes. If you had the proper training under a true Master you would know all this. But because of our mission, I must be the one to try and help you understand.;[];;[6525];[6542];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06371_.mp3
I've seen you give in to temptation and indulge your baser emotions on many occasions. I'm afraid you are on the path that leads to the dark side.;[];;[6523];[6521, 6545, 6546, 6547];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06368_.mp3
I won't misuse my power, Bastila.;[];;[6522, 6544];[6519];k_hbas_dialog;
My progress?;[];;[6522, 6544];[6516];k_hbas_dialog;
What? You've been grading me?;[];;[6522, 6544];[6516];k_hbas_dialog;
Why did the Council send me with you on this mission?;[];available after first starmap K_SWG_BASTILA at 6;[6549];[6345, 6775, 6777, 6782];k_hbas_dialog;
Why? I could not accomplish this on my own, I need the aid of others - especially one who is strong in the Force. The bond between us made you a natural choice.;[];;[6550];[6548];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06405_.mp3
Besides, the events on Taris proved that the Force wanted to bring us together for this mission, and there is little left to chance when the Force is involved. Is that not enough for you?;[];;[6551, 6557, 6586, 6587];[6549];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06820_.mp3
If the Force wants us to be together, why do you keep resisting my undeniable charms?;[{'Player': 'Persuade'}];;[6552];[6550];k_hbas_dialog;
I said we were brought together for our mission: to stop Malak. I hardly think the Force would be pushing us towards a romantic involvement when the fate of the galaxy is at stake!;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[6553];[6551];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06882_.mp3
Please try to stay focused. I doubt the Council would approve if they knew we were busy discussing our mutual attraction when we should be saving the galaxy from Malak.;[];;[6554, 6588];[6552];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06883_.mp3
Mutual attraction? I knew you were interested in me!;[{'Bastila': 'Flirt'}];;[6555];[6553];k_hbas_dialog;
Mutual attraction? I never said... it's just an expression! Whatever our feelings... uh, I mean... whatever *your* feelings, you have to try to ignore them. Don't let this complicate things.;[];;[6556];[6554];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06885_.mp3
Finding the missing pieces of the Star Maps is our only hope of locating the Star Forge and defeating Malak. The Council explained all this quite clearly.;[];;[6557, 6586, 6587];[6555, 6588];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06887_.mp3
It just seems odd they would send me off without a Master to guide me.;[];;[6558];[6556, 6550];k_hbas_dialog;
I admit, there were times that I wondered if this is more than just a mission to stop Malak. There were times when I wondered if this was also a way for the Council to test my own abilities.;[];;[6559];[6557, 6586, 6587];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06409_.mp3
I get the feeling that there's more going on than I know.;[];;[6560];[6558];k_hbas_dialog;
I wondered if the Council wanted to see how I would help and guide you on our quest. I wondered if they were testing me to see if I was ready to become a Jedi Master myself.;[];;[6561];[6559];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06821_.mp3
And then I realized how foolish such thoughts were. As the Council explained, sending a Master in our group would only have drawn unwanted attention from the Sith.;[];;[6562];[6560];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06822_.mp3
The fate of the galaxy is at stake, the Council would not risk it merely to test me. They calculated the risks and in the end chose the only option available.;[];;[6563, 6585];[6561];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06823_.mp3
I guess that makes sense.;[];;[6564];[6562];k_hbas_dialog;
You must learn to trust in the wisdom of the Council. Your destiny will come in its appointed time. You mustn't be so impatient.;[];;[6565, 6583, 6584];[6563, 6585];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06411_.mp3
Me? You're the one who thought this was her big audition for 'Masterhood'!;[];;[6566];[6564];k_hbas_dialog;
*Must* you be so frustrating? I admit, I had a moment of foolish pride. But I'm over it. Now I am focused on my true responsibilities.;[{'Bastila': 'Persuade'}];;[6567];[6565];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06413_.mp3
I am simply trying to help you and complete this mission, and yet you battle me at every turn!;[];;[6568, 6582];[6566, 6583];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06414_.mp3
What can I say? It's fun.;[];;[6569];[6567];k_hbas_dialog;
Fun?! Fun?! Driving me insane is your idea of a good time?;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[6570, 6578, 6580];[6568];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06416_.mp3
Careful. Remember your self-control.;[];;[6571, 6577];[6569, 6579];k_hbas_dialog;
You... you are a very odd man, do you know that? I simply don't know how to deal with you. All I want to do is help you, but you seem determined to drive me mad.;[];;[6572, 6575];[6570, 6580, 6581];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06418_.mp3

I don't know if I should be outraged that you keep joking about serious matters, or if I should be grateful that you can always lighten the mood.;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[6574];[6572, 6577];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06424_.mp3
Come on, come, let's move on... there's much to be done.;[];;[];[6573, 6576, 6584];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06422_.mp3
I'm not so bad. You just have to learn to accept me for what I am.;[];;[6576];[6571];k_hbas_dialog;
Unfortunately it isn't as easy as that. But your point is well taken.;[];;[6574];[6575];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06421_.mp3
I must admit: I simply don't know how to deal with someone like you.;[];;[6573];[6570, 6580, 6581];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06427_.mp3
Hey, you brought this on yourself.;[];;[6579];[6569];k_hbas_dialog;
I started it? You were the one who brought up the issue of the Council! You were the one who questioned our mission! You're the one who mocked me for thinking I was being tested!;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[6570, 6580, 6581];[6578, 6582];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06435_.mp3

I don't know what you're talking about.;[];;[6571, 6577];[6579];k_hbas_dialog;
Hey, you started this.;[];;[6579];[6567];k_hbas_dialog;
Oh, great. Another lecture. This never gets old.;[];;[6567];[6564];k_hbas_dialog;
You're right. I suppose we should get back to the mission now.;[];;[6574];[6564];k_hbas_dialog;
I'm still not convinced.;[];;[6564];[6562];k_hbas_dialog;
I just don't trust the Council and their motives.;[];;[6558];[6556, 6550];k_hbas_dialog;
And that's it? That's enough reason for you to accept all this?;[];;[6558];[6556, 6550];k_hbas_dialog;
I'm sorry, Bastila. I know our mission is important.;[];;[6556];[6553];k_hbas_dialog;
You look like you have something to say.;[];available after second starmap K_SWG_BASTILA at 7;[6590];[6345, 6775, 6777, 6782];k_hbas_dialog;
I do. I have been trying to come up with the best way to say this for some time, but I suppose I should just come out and say it.;[];;[6591];[6589];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06443_.mp3
The truth is, I have come to depend on you. Not just for the sake of the mission, but for my own sake as well. I am... I am glad you are with us.;[];;[6592, 6637, 6638];[6590];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06444_.mp3
What was that? I think I'm going deaf. You better say it again.;[];;[6593];[6591];k_hbas_dialog;
Now you're teasing me. You know very well what I said.;[];;[6594, 6629, 6636];[6592];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06453_.mp3
I'm still reeling from the shock. Was that a compliment?;[];;[6595];[6593];k_hbas_dialog;
Well, yes. Surely that is not so surprising.;[];;[6596, 6629];[6594, 6637];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06446_.mp3
You're kidding, right?;[];;[6597];[6595];k_hbas_dialog;
No, I'm not. Why must you make this so difficult for me? Can't you just accept a simple compliment?;[];;[6598, 6627, 6628];[6596];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06448_.mp3
Maybe I was just distracted by the grudging manner in which it was given.;[];;[6599];[6597];k_hbas_dialog;
I see. Is there nothing I can do to make it up to you? I would rather we were friends.;[];;[6600, 6603, 6625, 6626];[6598, 6627, 6635, 6636];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06463_.mp3
Oh? How close a friend would you like to be?;[{'Player': 'Flirt'}];;[6601];[6599];k_hbas_dialog;
I... you know I can't feel that way about you. About any man. It isn't permitted. I am a Jedi, I must resist these temptations.;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[6602];[6600];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06468_.mp3
But I still want to consider you a friend. We could... we could never be anything more, though. That... that isn't allowed.;[];;[6603, 6624];[6601];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06469_.mp3
I'd like that, I suppose.;[];;[6604];[6602, 6599];k_hbas_dialog;
I know my manner can be a bit taciturn. I know you must be getting sick of my lectures about the dark side and... and everything else.;[];;[6605];[6603, 6625, 6628, 6631, 6634];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06474_.mp3
I spent all my years being hounded by my instructors. Being told so often how gifted and important I was until I was sick of it.;[];;[6606];[6604];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06475_.mp3
I remember when I was younger I used to swear that I would never become as self-absorbed and stodgy as the Jedi Masters. It's ironic, really.;[];;[6607, 6620, 6622];[6605];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06476_.mp3
Don't forget edgy, critical and overly secretive.;[];;[6608];[6606];k_hbas_dialog;
Yes, well... there's no need for you to agree so whole-heartedly.;[];;[6609];[6607];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06482_.mp3

But maybe it's time to change that. You deserve to know how much I respect and admire you. I had to tell you how much I care for you. As a friend, of course.;[];;[6611, 6616, 6618];[6609];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06827_.mp3
We could be more than friends, Bastila.;[];;[6612];[6610];k_hbas_dialog;
Please, it's... it's not allowed. I have to remain true to the Jedi ideal. If this is going to cause a problem maybe... maybe I shouldn't have said anything.;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[6613, 6616];[6611];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06829_.mp3
No, I'm glad you did. I care for you too, Bastila. As a friend.;[];;[6614];[6612];k_hbas_dialog;
Well, that was not nearly so difficult as I feared. Thank you for hearing me out. I feel... I feel much better.;[];;[6615];[6613, 6618];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06488_.mp3
But enough soul searching for now. We should probably continue on with our mission.;[];;[];[6614];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06831_.mp3
Great, you've had your say. Now leave me alone - for good!;[];;[6617];[6612, 6610, 6619];k_hbas_dialog;

I'm glad you did.;[];;[6614];[6610, 6619];k_hbas_dialog;
But maybe it's time to change that. You deserve to know how much I respect and admire you. I thought... I just thought I should tell you.;[];;[6616, 6618];[6609];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06484_.mp3
Nonsense. You're not self-absorbed or stodgy.;[];;[6621];[6606];k_hbas_dialog;
That's kind of you to say, but I know for myself that it's not really true.;[];;[6609];[6620];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06478_.mp3
Maybe, but you don't need to be like that.;[];;[6623];[6606];k_hbas_dialog;
I suppose not. But I am becoming like that, though it's not easy for me to admit.;[];;[6609];[6622];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06480_.mp3
Then leave me alone. For good.;[];;[6617];[6602];k_hbas_dialog;
Friends? You could have fooled me.;[];;[6604];[6599];k_hbas_dialog;
Just leave me alone... for good.;[];;[6617];[6599];k_hbas_dialog;
You can keep your thanks. I don't need it... or you.;[];;[6599];[6597];k_hbas_dialog;
Fine. Thank you for the thought.;[];;[6604];[6597];k_hbas_dialog;
It's just that you sounded so pained saying it.;[];;[6630];[6595, 6593];k_hbas_dialog;
Did I? I am trying to be sincere, here. It occurred to me that I may have been too critical of you. Too demanding, at times.;[];;[6631, 6632, 6636];[6629, 6638];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06457_.mp3
Thank you. I appreciate the gesture.;[];;[6604];[6630];k_hbas_dialog;
*May* have been?;[];;[6633];[6630];k_hbas_dialog;

Your compliments need some work, I think.;[];;[6604];[6633];k_hbas_dialog;
And when have you ever made things easy for me?;[];;[6599];[6633];k_hbas_dialog;
Too little, too late. Sorry.;[];;[6599];[6633, 6630, 6593];k_hbas_dialog;
Is that a compliment? From you?;[];;[6595];[6591];k_hbas_dialog;
You made that sound very painful for you to admit.;[];;[6630];[6591];k_hbas_dialog;
You're curious about something?;[];available after second starmap K_SWG_BASTILA at 8;[6640];[6345, 6775, 6777, 6782];k_hbas_dialog;
Am I so transparent? I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, considering our bond. Yes, there is something I would like to ask, if you'll permit it.;[];;[6641, 6675];[6639];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06490_.mp3
Do I have a choice?;[];;[6642];[6640];k_hbas_dialog;
Don't even start with that. You're the one who asked. I wasn't even going to say anything. But now that you've brought it up, I see I shouldn't have waited as long as I have.;[];;[6643, 6667];[6641];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06492_.mp3
In our time together I've been watching you. I've seen your tendency towards giving in to your darker emotions. You do as you please, for the most part.;[];;[6644];[6642, 6675];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06494_.mp3
Don't worry, this isn't a lead-up to a lecture. I'm... fascinated by your passion, by how easily it comes to you.;[];;[6645];[6643];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06495_.mp3
You seem to do whatever you want, something I would never dare consider. Don't you fear the consequences?;[];;[6646, 6663, 6665];[6644];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06496_.mp3
No. You should try it yourself, sometime.;[];;[6647];[6645];k_hbas_dialog;
I doubt my old Master would approve of your advice. Besides, I'm not like you. I must always be on guard against such outbursts.;[];;[6648];[6646];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06498_.mp3
I've always struggled for control over my passions. I've always been too quick to anger, too quick to get involved. My instructors constantly berated me for it.;[];;[6649];[6647, 6664, 6666, 6670, 6672, 6674];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06511_.mp3
I've often dreamed that I might be able to confront Darth Malak myself. I dream I can use all this power I have to kill him and stop all the death and destruction.;[];;[6650];[6648];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06512_.mp3
I just think about all the evil that the Sith have caused and I... I get so furious. Yet we are told that these feelings are the path to the dark side.;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[6651, 6657, 6659, 6661];[6649];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06513_.mp3
Are you saying you don't believe in the corruption of the dark side?;[];;[6652];[6650];k_hbas_dialog;
I don't know. Would the power I used to kill Darth Malak be too tempting to keep using? Would I become the kind of evil I want to destroy?;[];;[6653];[6651];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06515_.mp3
"The very thought that I could become as evil as Malak; I just can't fathom it. It just doesn't seem possible. How could I... no, wait. I'm sorry.";[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[6654];[6652, 6658, 6660, 6662];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06520_.mp3

What?;[];;[6656];[6654];k_hbas_dialog;
These are dangerous thoughts, the indulgence of a vain mind. Please, forget I ever mentioned this. Let's just return to our mission.;[];;[];[6655];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06523_.mp3
I think destroying that kind of evil would be worth it.;[];;[6658];[6650];k_hbas_dialog;
But what comes next? After using all that power, would you decide to impose your own view on the universe? The dark side corrupts your very thoughts.;[];;[6653];[6657];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06517_.mp3
You have to trust in the wisdom of the Jedi Code.;[];;[6660];[6650];k_hbas_dialog;
Yes, of course. You're right. I... I have to remember my training. The Masters know well the corrupting influence of the dark side, although it is hard for me to imagine.;[];;[6653];[6659];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06833_.mp3
It sounds like you have your own demons to face.;[];;[6662];[6650];k_hbas_dialog;
I suppose I do. Part of me thinks that it would be worth anything to vanquish evil, even if it meant giving in to my base emotions.;[];;[6653];[6661];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06519_.mp3
Life's too short to be afraid.;[];;[6664];[6645];k_hbas_dialog;
Is it? The thought of what could happen to me if I lose control... somehow I think life could be very long, indeed.;[];;[6648];[6663];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06500_.mp3
Maybe a little, sure.;[];;[6666];[6645];k_hbas_dialog;
That... that's a relief to hear. That you would even be willing to risk so much is... is very brave. Braver than I could be.;[];;[6648];[6665];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06502_.mp3
In our time together I've been watching you. You are a true servant of the light, you follow the tenets of the Jedi Order despite the lure of the dark side. And with so little training.;[];;[6668];[6642, 6675];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06503_.mp3
For me it has always been a constant battle. Don't you find it difficult at all? You make it seem so easy. Or is that only an illusion?;[];;[6669, 6671, 6673];[6667];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06504_.mp3
I just do what I think is right.;[];;[6670];[6668];k_hbas_dialog;
And that's enough for you? If only it were as easy for me. If only the right path was always clear.;[];;[6648];[6669];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06506_.mp3
It's a struggle for me, sometimes.;[];;[6672];[6668];k_hbas_dialog;
That's a relief to hear. I have never found the Jedi path an easy one to walk, and it's good to know I'm not alone.;[];;[6648];[6671];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06508_.mp3
I don't think about it much.;[];;[6674];[6668];k_hbas_dialog;
You don't? Sometimes I find that it is nearly all I can think of. I have never found the Jedi training easy to master.;[];;[6648];[6673];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06510_.mp3
Go ahead.;[];;[6643, 6667];[6640];k_hbas_dialog;

Yes, I did end that quite abruptly, didn't I? Perhaps a Master could have addressed my questions with the proper wisdom. But I never should have brought it up here. Not with you.;[];;[6678];[6676];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06525_.mp3

I don't think I'm the proper Jedi to guide you. I am no Master. You should have remained with the Council.;[];;[6680, 6706, 6708];[6678];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06526_.mp3
Why do you say that?;[];;[6681];[6679];k_hbas_dialog;
The fact of the matter is that I have never possessed much skill at controlling myself. With the bond that joins us, it seems I have even less.;[{'Bastila': 'Persuade'}];;[6682, 6705];[6680, 6707, 6709];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06528_.mp3

So what now?;[];;[6684];[6682, 6705];k_hbas_dialog;
I don't know. I think... I think I may have made a very big mistake.;[];;[6685];[6683];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06533_.mp3

We're made for each other, Bastila. You have to see that.;[];;[6691];[6689];k_hbas_dialog;
I... I need time to think about all this. Things are... they are not going as I thought they would.;[];;[6692];[6690];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06837_.mp3
We should... we should continue on with our mission, for now.;[];;[];[6691, 6694];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06838_.mp3
How did you expect me to be?;[];;[6694];[6689];k_hbas_dialog;

Perhaps you can help me. And I will try to help you, if I can. Hopefully this will all work out, for the both of us. And for the sake of the mission.;[];;[];[6687];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06542_.mp3
You're being too hard on yourself.;[];;[6687];[6685];k_hbas_dialog;
I don't need your help, anyway. I can find my own way.;[];;[6698];[6685];k_hbas_dialog;

Fair enough. You will probably be better off on your own, in any case. I won't trouble you with this anymore.;[];;[];[6700];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06547_.mp3
You're doing your best, I'm sure.;[];;[6703];[6682, 6705];k_hbas_dialog;

Oh? You see that, too? I don't need you anymore.;[];;[6698];[6682, 6705];k_hbas_dialog;
You have maintained the path of the light side. But it has been in spite of my influence, not because of it. It is increasingly obvious I am unable to guide you properly.;[];;[6683, 6702, 6704];[6681];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06531_.mp3
No, I disagree!;[];;[6707];[6679];k_hbas_dialog;
Perhaps you are not being truly objective, then. There is no need to spare my feelings on this point.;[];;[6681];[6706];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06550_.mp3
Oh, get over yourself, already.;[];;[6709];[6679];k_hbas_dialog;
Please don't make light of this. The very fact that I am plagued by this doubt is yet further evidence of my inadequacy.;[];;[6681];[6708];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06552_.mp3
When we last talked you said you needed time to think. So?;[];available after third starmap K_SWG_BASTILA at 10;[6711];[6345, 6775, 6777, 6782];k_hbas_dialog;
You have been patient with me, haven't you? I suppose you deserve an answer. But you have to understand how difficult this is for me to say.;[];;[6712];[6710];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06554_.mp3
Yes, I think so.;[];;[6713];[6711];k_hbas_dialog;
With all my training, I should be able to control myself better than this. But you're not anything like I expected. You're not like any man I've ever met before.;[];;[6714];[6712];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06561_.mp3
I find myself watching you when I don't mean to. I'm thinking about you when I don't want to. It isn't supposed to be like this!;[];;[6715, 6769];[6713];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06562_.mp3
What are you trying to say, exactly?;[];;[6716];[6714];k_hbas_dialog;
Every time I try to call on all my teachings to calm myself, they fail me. You have such power, such passion! I don't know if it's due to the bond between us, but I'm drawn to you.;[];;[6717, 6768];[6715, 6770];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06564_.mp3
Are you interested in me or in my ability to use the Force?;[];;[6718];[6716];k_hbas_dialog;
The Force is a part of you, as is your power. But that's not what attracted me to you. It's more than that. Maybe it's the bond we share. It gives us a certain... intimacy.;[];;[6719];[6717];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06566_.mp3
If I could, I would return to Dantooine. I need to be away from this bond of ours. I need to weaken it. I need to be anywhere but near you!;[];;[6720];[6718];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06567_.mp3
But Malak must be stopped, my own feelings are nothing when compared to that. Yet I know this could affect the sake of our mission if it is not resolved - I can't let that happen!;[];;[6721, 6764, 6765, 6767];[6719];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06842_.mp3
Just give in to your feelings, Bastila. I know you want to.;[];;[6722, 6762];[6720];k_hbas_dialog;
I think... I think we should have some privacy for this. Come with me.;[];;[6723, 6761];[6721, 6764, 6766];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06844_.mp3
I can't deny that there are parts of you I am drawn to. Your power, your will. You are so much stronger than I am.;[];;[6724];[6722, 6772];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06598_.mp3
In some ways you make me feel weak, like I am caught up in the wake of our destiny. But at the same time, you make me feel stronger, more alive.;[];;[6725, 6760];[6723, 6761];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06599_.mp3
So what does this mean for us?;[];;[6726];[6724];k_hbas_dialog;
"I realize now these feelings are part of the bond we share. The Jedi Council surely realized this; they knew my loyalty to the doctrines of our Order would be tested on this mission.";[];;[6727];[6725, 6760];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06601_.mp3
By facing and overcoming my feelings for you I have learned a valuable lesson about control and the dangers of emotion. This is an important step in understanding the Force.;[];;[6728];[6726];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06602_.mp3
I'm sorry if this is not what you wanted to hear. But I felt it was important you know our... infatuation... was nothing more than a result of our powerful bond.;[];;[6729, 6749, 6755, 6756];[6727];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06603_.mp3
So I was just a stepping stone to you becoming a Master?;[];;[6730];[6728, 6757, 6759];k_hbas_dialog;
Please, don't say it like that. You make it sound like I was using you! Don't you realize how difficult this was for me?;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[6731, 6749, 6754];[6729];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06604_.mp3
Difficult for you? What about me?;[];;[6732];[6730];k_hbas_dialog;
Why do you think I came to this decision? I know how hard this is for both of us! You just kept pressing forward, so I had to be the one to step up and do the right thing!;[];;[6733];[6731];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06849_.mp3
You're the one who can't face the truth! Malak has to be stopped. How can I do that if I let myself be blinded by my feelings for you?;[];;[6734, 6749, 6752];[6732, 6754, 6755];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06852_.mp3
I'm going to stop Malak, Bastila. But I want to do it with you at my side.;[];;[6735];[6733];k_hbas_dialog;
You... you mean it, don't you? But how can I be sure you aren't making a mistake. I... I have to resist. I have to be strong for both of us.;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[6736, 6748, 6749, 6752];[6734];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06854_.mp3
You know I'm right, Bastila.;[];;[6737];[6735];k_hbas_dialog;
But I don't... I mean, I can't... Malak will...;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[6738, 6746];[6736, 6748];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06856_.mp3
Shut up and kiss me, you babbling fool.;[];;[6739];[6737];k_hbas_dialog;
Oh, my!;[{'Bastila': 'Flirt'}];;[6740];[6738];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06858_.mp3

It didn't feel wrong to me.;[];;[6742];[6740];k_hbas_dialog;
It was... it was a moment of weakness. When I kissed you... we shouldn't have... no, I'm sorry.;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[6743];[6741, 6745];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06865_.mp3
I know we both wanted it, but we shouldn't have given in to our desire. We're Jedi! We can't act like this. Not now, not while we still have to deal with Malak!;[];;[6744];[6742];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06866_.mp3
I'm... I'm sorry. I don't blame you, but... it was a mistake. I have to get out of here before somebody sees us together!;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[];[6743];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06867_.mp3
We're not going back to this again, are we?;[];;[6742];[6740];k_hbas_dialog;
I love you Bastila. And I know you love me.;[];;[6747];[6737];k_hbas_dialog;
Okay, you've made your point. Now shut up and kiss me, you fool!;[{'Bastila': 'Flirt'}];;[6740];[6746];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06861_.mp3
You don't always have to be strong, Bastila. Give in just this once.;[];;[6737];[6735];k_hbas_dialog;
That's okay - I never felt anything for you anyway.;[];;[6750];[6735, 6733, 6730, 6759, 6757, 6728];k_hbas_dialog;
Oh, I thought... No, this is good. I'm glad you told me. This makes everything much easier.;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[6751];[6749, 6767, 6768];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06586_.mp3
Don't worry - I can put this behind me. Let's just continue on with what we must do. It is better this way.;[];;[];[6750];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06590_.mp3
I... I understand, Bastila.;[{'Player': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[6753];[6735, 6733, 6759];k_hbas_dialog;
I hope you can put this behind you. You need to focus on stopping Malak, as difficult as that may be. Come, we should continue our mission.;[];;[];[6752];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06875_.mp3
This is nothing but an excuse! You're afraid to face your feelings!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[6733];[6730];k_hbas_dialog;
You're rationalizing, Bastila. You're just scared to face the truth!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[6733];[6728, 6757, 6759];k_hbas_dialog;
So that's it? It's all over?;[];;[6757];[6728];k_hbas_dialog;
I'm... afraid so. Although I suppose I should thank you for all you've done. For the lessons you helped me learn.;[];;[6729, 6749, 6755, 6758];[6756];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06871_.mp3
Great - you learn a lesson and I get dumped!;[];;[6759];[6757];k_hbas_dialog;
I wish it could be otherwise, but you have to understand that this is the way it must be. I am a Jedi, after all.;[];;[6729, 6749, 6752, 6755];[6758];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06873_.mp3
And I feel more alive when I'm with you.;[];;[6726];[6724];k_hbas_dialog;
You're stronger than I am, and there's no point in telling me otherwise. You will be a great Jedi, I think. I hope.;[];;[6724];[6722, 6772];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06614_.mp3
What I have been trying to tell you is that I've reached a decision. But this is not the proper place for this discussion. I think... I think we should have some privacy for this.;[];;[6763];[6721, 6764, 6766];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06845_.mp3
We can talk about this the next time we return to the Ebon Hawk.;[];;[];[6762];k_hbas_dialog;NGLOBEBAST06846_.mp3
If you have something to say, just say it!;[];;[6722, 6762];[6720];k_hbas_dialog;
You could leave, if you had to.;[];;[6766];[6720];k_hbas_dialog;
And go where? I am needed here, just as you are. There is nothing that is more important than what we are doing. Which is why we need to resolve this.;[];;[6722, 6762];[6765];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06580_.mp3
But I don't feel anything for you, Bastila.;[];;[6750];[6720];k_hbas_dialog;
Sorry, Bastila. That starship won't fly. I'm not interested.;[{'Player': 'Taunt'}];;[6750];[6716];k_hbas_dialog;

That's all for now.;[];;[6335];[6345, 6775, 6777, 6782];k_hbas_dialog;
Dantooine is a peaceful and pastoral planet. There are few large communities. Mostly what you will find here are ranchers and farmers.;[];;[6775];[6343];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06060_.mp3

Manaan is a water world inhabited by an aquatic race known as the Selkath. Their only surface city and spaceport is called Ahto.;[];;[6777];[6343];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06062_.mp3
It is unique in that the Selkath are firm in their neutrality. They are neither part of the republic nor controlled by the Sith, and they wish to keep it that way.;[];;[6336, 6346, 6376, 6420, 6469, 6471, 6515, 6548, 6589, 6639, 6676, 6710, 6771, 6773];[6776];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06063_.mp3

We can't risk having any of the dark Jedi Masters recognize me. For the sake of the mission I must remain hidden in the Ebon Hawk while we are on this world.;[];;[6345];[6780];k_hbas_dialog;NM12AABAST06895_.mp3

Thank you for urging me towards it. After all my training, I would have thought it would have been easier. Apparently I still have much to learn.;[];;[];[6784];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06080_.mp3
So you kept the holocron.;[];;[6787];[6782];k_hbas_dialog;
Yes, but I don't feel any better. After all my training, I would have thought myself above such anger.;[];;[6788];[6786];k_hbas_dialog;NM35AABAST06082_.mp3

I may have been a prisoner, but a Jedi is never helpless. Maybe you've heard of a little thing called 'the Force'?;[];;[6837];[6835];tar03_bastila;NM03AFBAST03014_.mp3
But I suppose I shouldn't be too hard on you. You did try to save me after all, even if it didn't go quite as planned. So let's get down to business - we're not out of danger yet.;[];;[6838];[6836];tar03_bastila;NM03AFBAST03016_.mp3
If I'm going to figure out a way for us to get off this planet I need to know what kind of resources we can draw on. First, are we the only two survivors left from the Endar Spire?;[];;[6839, 6843, 6844];[6837, 6849];tar03_bastila;NM03AFBAST03021_.mp3
Carth and I are already working on a plan to get off Taris.;[];;[6840];[6838, 6845];tar03_bastila;
Carth Onasi is alive? Finally, some good news! Carth is one of the Republic's best soldiers. He's proved himself a hero a dozen times over! And he sent you here to save me?;[];;[6841];[6839, 6843, 6846, 6847, 6850];tar03_bastila;NM03AFBAST03028_.mp3
Maybe I misjudged you. Carth wouldn't have sent you if he wasn't confident in your... abilities. Forgive me - despite my Jedi training, I still tend to act a bit rashly sometimes.;[];;[6842];[6840];tar03_bastila;NM03AFBAST03030_.mp3
Please, take me to Carth right away. Between the three of us I'm sure we can figure out some way to get off this planet before the Sith realize we're here.;[];;[];[6841];tar03_bastila;NM03AFBAST03032_.mp3
We aren't the only survivors. Carth Onasi is alive as well.;[];;[6840];[6838];tar03_bastila;
Hey, who said you were in charge here?;[];;[6845];[6838];tar03_bastila;
The Republic, for one. I was fleet commander, remember? But I don't want you getting all worked up over nothing. So tell me - do you have a plan to get off this planet?;[];;[6839, 6846, 6847];[6844];tar03_bastila;NM03AFBAST03025_.mp3
No - but Carth and I will figure something out!;[];;[6840];[6845];tar03_bastila;
I don't have a plan yet. Carth wanted to make sure you were safe first.;[];;[6840];[6845];tar03_bastila;
I didn't need your help with those Vulkars. I can handle myself!;[];;[6849];[6834];tar03_bastila;
Yes, I suppose you can. Well, I appreciate your attempt to save me - even if it didn't really go as you planned. But let's get down to business - we're not out of danger yet.;[];;[6838];[6848];tar03_bastila;NM03AFBAST03019_.mp3
We don't have time for this. Carth is waiting for us.;[];;[6840];[6834];tar03_bastila;
It's a long story.;[];;[6852];[6830, 6858];tar03_bastila;
Well we don't have time for it now. We have to get out of here before the Sith show up to sort out this mess. Is there somewhere safe we can go?;[];;[6853, 6854];[6851];tar03_bastila;NM03AFBAST03004_.mp3
I've got somewhere safe to go. I was planning to take you there after I saved you from Brejik.;[];;[6832];[6852];tar03_bastila;
Whoa - slow down. I'm in charge here. Remember, I saved you!;[];;[6832];[6852];tar03_bastila;
Winning the swoop race was the only way I could save you.;[];;[6832];[6830, 6858];tar03_bastila;
Never mind that. I won the swoop race, and you're my prize. I own you now!;[];;[6857];[6830];tar03_bastila;
You must have banked a turn too sharply, because it sounds like all the blood has rushed from your brain!;[];;[6858];[6856];tar03_bastila;NM03AFBAST03036_.mp3
I'm Bastila Shan, a member of the Jedi Order and a fleet commander for the Republic. Nobody 'owns' me! Now we don't have time for joking around. What are you doing here?;[];;[6851, 6855];[6857];tar03_bastila;NM03AFBAST03038_.mp3
No one's allowed to talk to the prisoner. Brejik's orders. She wouldn't hear you anyway: she's got a neural disruptor collar on to keep her under control.;[];;[];[None];tar03_bastila;
False prophet! Deceiver! You have betrayed me! You have sold the hope of the entire village to the selfish and damnable Igear!;[{'Rukil': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[6861];[None];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25000_.mp3
All I have worked for is destroyed! All the hopes and dreams of my father and grandfather before him turned to dust! Begone, up-worlder - I have only curses to speak at you!;[{'Rukil': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[];[6860];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25002_.mp3
You return, up-worlder. Are you ready to learn what you must learn? Are you ready to learn of the Promised Land?;[];;[6863, 6901];[None];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25004_.mp3
Tell me about the Promised Land.;[];;[6864];[6862];tar04_rukil;
"Legends tell of a self-sufficient colony founded just before the famine and lost during the civil war; a paradise beneath the Undercity where droid servants tend to every need.";[];;[6865];[6863, 6915, 6916];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25115_.mp3
For many years I searched for the Promised Land, just as my grandfather and father did before me. When I became old and gray my apprentice continued the search on my behalf.;[];;[6866, 6867];[6864];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25117_.mp3
Sounds like a myth to me. Something to give the people here some false hope to cling to so they don't go mad with despair.;[];;[6867];[6865];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25152_.mp3
"I have collected many clues hinting at its location; the journal of my apprentice provides yet more information. But still there are too many pieces missing from this puzzle.";[];;[6868];[6866, 6865];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25119_.mp3
But I know my father and grandfather each had journals where they recorded their own discoveries. Perhaps with their journals I could at last uncover its hidden location.;[];;[6869, 6886, 6890, 6897, 6898];[6867];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25121_.mp3
I have all three journals. Here - take them.;[];player has all 3 journals;[6870];[6868, 6920];tar04_rukil;
Can it be true? Is it possible that at long last the dream of my father and grandfather before him will be fulfilled? I... I can hardly bear to look.;[];;[6871];[6869];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25009_.mp3
Hmmm... yes. Yes! Of course! Now I understand - it all makes sense! Now I see why the Promised Land has been so hard to find! It is so obvious!;[];;[6872];[6870];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25011_.mp3
You have done a great thing, up-worlder - a selfless act that will bring great joy to all the people of this village! I must take this to Gendar right away!;[];;[6873];[6871];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25013_.mp3
Rukil? What do you want now? Have you more fables of a hidden paradise just waiting for us to find it?;[];;[6874];[6872];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25015_.mp3
You may not think these are fables after you see what I have brought you, Gendar! Look at these journals!;[];;[6875];[6873];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25017_.mp3
What... no. It can't be! Are these real, Rukil? Is this information accurate?;[];;[6876];[6874];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25019_.mp3
I swear to you everything in these journals is true, Gendar. The Promised Land - I told you I would find it!;[];;[6877];[6875];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25021_.mp3
The entrance is far from here, Rukil. It will take us weeks to get there... perhaps even months. And we will have to cross many rakghoul infested areas.;[];;[6878];[6876];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25023_.mp3
I do not deny the journey will be hard, Gendar. But surely it is better than the miserable life we have here!;[];;[6879];[6877];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25025_.mp3
Wise words, Rukil. Our supplies are high right now - we could leave by nightfall! I will tell the others to prepare for the journey.;[];Gendar runs off;[6880];[6878];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25027_.mp3
Thank you once again, up-worlder. I will say a final goodbye, for where we are going I fear you cannot come. The journey to the Promised Land is long and arduous.;[];;[6881, 6883];[6879];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25029_.mp3
Goodbye, Rukil - and good luck.;[];;[6882];[6880];tar04_rukil;
We must part ways here, up-worlder. I sense your destiny is yet to be chosen, but the destiny of my people is at the end of the long journey ahead of us.;[];;[];[6881, 6885];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25031_.mp3
Maybe I should come with you. I could help you on the journey.;[];;[6884];[6880];tar04_rukil;
No, up-worlder, I cannot ask that. The journey will take many, many weeks. And those who make the journey cannot return - that was the final secret of the Promised Land.;[];;[6885];[6883];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25034_.mp3
When the colony was created it was designed so that people could enter willingly, but they could never leave again. This was to ensure secrecy on the project.;[];;[6882];[6884];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25036_.mp3
I have one of the journals you're looking for.;[];Player has 1 or 2 journals, but NOT all 3;[6887];[6868, 6920];tar04_rukil;
Yes, up-worlder... well done. However, I see that this journal alone does not have enough clues for me to solve this mystery. Too many pieces are still missing.;[];;[6888];[6886];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25040_.mp3
I'm afraid that only with all three journals - my grandfather's, my father's and my apprentice's - will I be able to discover the location of the Promised Land.;[];;[6889];[6887];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25042_.mp3
I will leave this journal with you for safe keeping for now. Perhaps it will aid you in your search for the others. I wish you luck, up-worlder - for the sake of the entire village.;[];;[];[6888];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25044_.mp3
And you want me to find these missing journals?;[];;[6891];[6868];tar04_rukil;
I have nothing to offer if you help me in this. I hope the knowledge that you are helping the entire village escape a life of darkness and suffering is reward enough.;[];;[6892, 6895];[6890, 6897];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25124_.mp3
Don't worry, Rukil. I'll find those journals.;[];;[6893];[6891];tar04_rukil;
It is many decades since my father set out on his journey, but I remember he was eager to explore the sewers. You might want to begin your search there.;[];;[6894];[6892, 6921];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25126_.mp3
I wish you luck in your quest, up-worlder. The future survival of this village - of my people - depends on you.;[];;[];[6893];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25128_.mp3
Sorry, I need an actual reward if you want my help.;[];;[6896];[6891];tar04_rukil;
I see. Well, perhaps you are not the savior I seek after all. I can only pray that if you find the journals you will have a change of heart and bring them to me.;[];;[];[6895, 6900, 6922];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25134_.mp3
What will I get if I find these missing journals for you?;[];;[6891];[6868, 6899];tar04_rukil;
I'm not wasting my time looking for these journals!;[];;[6899];[6868];tar04_rukil;
Please, up-worlder - I am too old to search for the missing journals myself, and the other villagers think the Promised Land is nothing but a myth.;[];;[6897, 6900];[6898];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25132_.mp3
Forget it.;[];;[6896];[6899];tar04_rukil;
I'm not interested in this.;[];;[6902];[6862, 6914];tar04_rukil;
I offer you wisdom and you turn me away? Perhaps you are not ready to accept the role you must play in the destiny and salvaton of my people.;[];;[6903];[6901, 6919];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25141_.mp3
Very well, up-worlder. Return to me when you are ready to learn what you must learn.;[];;[];[6902];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25143_.mp3
You return, up-worlder. Are you ready now to learn what you must learn? Are you ready to hear the history of my people?;[];;[6905, 6919];[None];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25006_.mp3
Very well - tell me the history of your people.;[];;[6906];[6904, 6943];tar04_rukil;
The great city of Taris covers the entire surface of this planet. There is no land to grow food. Kelp harvests and the creatures of the sea are our only food source.;[];;[6907];[6905];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25101_.mp3
A century ago rising levels of toxic pollution poisoned the oceans and famine swept the planet. The rich hoarded food for their own use, and the poor were left to starve and die.;[];;[6908, 6909];[6906];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25103_.mp3
From what I've seen of Taris, it doesn't look like much has changed. Except for the Upper City, people here are just as bad off as the poor in your little history.;[];;[6909];[6907];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25151_.mp3
But the poor rose up against this tyranny and civil war engulfed the planet. Millions died in the fighting and huge sections of Taris were destroyed or abandoned.;[];;[6910];[6908, 6907];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25105_.mp3
The rebellion was crushed in the end, thousands were taken prisoner. The jails could not hold them all, and so the practice of banishing all prisoners to the Undercity was born.;[];;[6911, 6917, 6918];[6909];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25107_.mp3
Is that how you came to be down here?;[];;[6912];[6910];tar04_rukil;
Many brave men and women were banished here to the Undercity for their part in the rebellion. People like my father and grandfather were cast down, along with their families.;[];;[6913, 6914];[6911, 6917, 6918];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25109_.mp3
What did you expect? If they could get away with it the Tarisian nobles would stuff their own mothers down here to make more room in the Upper City.;[];;[6914];[6912];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25111_.mp3
Now we live a dark existence beneath the streets of Taris, a life devoid of all hope but one: the Promised Land. And you will be the one to show us the way to get there.;[];;[6901, 6915, 6916];[6913, 6912];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25113_.mp3
The Promised Land? What's that?;[];;[6864];[6914];tar04_rukil;
How can I lead you to this Promised Land when I don't even know what it is?;[];;[6864];[6914];tar04_rukil;
What does this have to do with me?;[];;[6912];[6910];tar04_rukil;
Are you going to get to the point soon?;[];;[6912];[6910];tar04_rukil;
I'm not interested in the history of your people.;[];;[6902];[6904, 6943];tar04_rukil;
Welcome back, up-worlder. How goes your quest? Have you found the journals of my father and grandfather?;[];;[6869, 6886, 6921, 6922];[None];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25007_.mp3
I don't have all the journals yet, but I will find them.;[];;[6893];[6920];tar04_rukil;
I can't waste any more time with your quest.;[];;[6896];[6920];tar04_rukil;
You - you come from the world above! Is this the time of destiny, then? Is this a portent of the salvation of my people? Or merely another false sign to mislead us from the path?;[];;[6924];[None];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25047_.mp3
Are you the herald of prophecy? The beacon to guide us through the darkness? Or are you merely another harbinger of shattered dreams and unfulfilled promises?;[];;[6925, 6926, 6927, 6962];[6923];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25049_.mp3
Watch yourself: this guy's star chart is missing a few galaxies, if you know what I mean.;[];;[6926, 6927];[6924];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25051_.mp3
This old man's demeanor may seem crazed, but I sense there is a purpose behind it, a benevolent one. He is no danger to us.;[];;[6927];[6925, 6962, 6924];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25055_.mp3
Speak to me, up-worlder! Tell me what fate you unleash upon us - salvation or damnation! Speak, up-worlder - I beg you!;[];;[6928, 6959, 6960];[6926, 6925, 6962, 6924];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25057_.mp3
What are you talking about, old man?;[];;[6929];[6927];tar04_rukil;
A question. You are uncertain. Bewildered. Perplexed. Understandable, I suppose. Even after a hundred years of life I myself still become confused at times.;[];;[6930];[6928, 6959];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25059_.mp3
Perhaps I can make things more clear. Some things, at least. My name is Rukil, the oldest Outcast here in the village. Rukil Wrinkle-Skin, the children call me sometimes.;[];;[6931, 6958];[6929, 6961];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25065_.mp3
I'm <FullName>. What do you want from me, Rukil?;[];;[6932];[6930];tar04_rukil;
Once I was honored for my wisdom, but over time the villagers fell away from the true path. Eventually there was only a single apprentice who followed me - and now she is gone, too.;[];;[6933, 6954, 6956, 6957];[6931, 6958];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25067_.mp3
The true path? What does that mean?;[];;[6934];[6932];tar04_rukil;
No, no, no. Not yet. I must be wary. Careful. You may be a false savior. Dare I share my secrets with you? No... not until you prove yourself.;[];;[6935, 6954, 6956];[6933];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25069_.mp3
Prove myself? How can I do that?;[];;[6936];[6934];tar04_rukil;
My apprentice is... lost. I sent her out into the Undercity to find... well, I cannot tell you. Not yet. Sadly, my apprentice has not returned.;[];;[6937];[6935, 6955, 6957];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25072_.mp3
Please, up-worlder - will you help an old man? Will you seek out my apprentice in the Undercity? Her name is Malya. I must know of her fate, whatever it may be. I must know what she... found.;[];;[6938, 6946, 6952, 6953];[6936];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25074_.mp3
Your apprentice is dead. I have her journal.;[];;[6939];[6937, 6947, 6963, 6966];tar04_rukil;
It is as I feared, then. She joins the list of those who have given their lives in the service of our cause. But though I am saddened by this news, there is yet hope.;[];;[6940];[6938];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25091_.mp3
By finding my apprentice you have proved yourself worthy, up-worlder. You are to be the beacon on our path to salvation. You will guide us to the Promised Land!;[];;[6941, 6944, 6945];[6939];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25093_.mp3
Guide you? But I don't even know where the Promised Land is!;[];;[6942];[6940];tar04_rukil;
You are marked, up-worlder - even my dim old eyes can see the mantle of destiny that cloaks you. Perhaps old Rukil knows you better than you know yourself.;[];;[6943];[6941, 6944, 6945];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25097_.mp3
I am old - I have lived a hundred years in the Undercity, cast down into the darkness. I know the legends and history of our people - and now you must learn it, too.;[];;[6905, 6919];[6942];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25099_.mp3
I think you have me confused with someone else.;[];;[6942];[6940];tar04_rukil;
Hold on a second - I'm not guiding anybody anywhere!;[];;[6942];[6940];tar04_rukil;
I will help you with this, Rukil.;[];;[6947];[6937];tar04_rukil;
"Finding her may be difficult; Malya could be anywhere in the Undercity... but if you find her I will know you to be our true savior! Only then can I reveal my secret knowledge to you.";[];;[6938, 6948, 6950];[6946, 6952];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25076_.mp3
I'll be back if I find anything out.;[];;[6949];[6947, 6966];tar04_rukil;
I wish you luck, up-worlder. Come speak to me again once you have discovered the fate of my apprentice.;[];;[];[6948, 6967];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25078_.mp3
I'm not going to waste my time looking for your apprentice!;[];;[6951];[6947, 6966, 6963];tar04_rukil;
Then... perhaps you are not the one I have been waiting for. Should you change your mind, up-worlder, speak with me again. Come to me if you learn the fate of my apprentice.;[];;[];[6950, 6953];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25081_.mp3
What will you give me if I help you?;[];;[6947];[6937];tar04_rukil;
Forget it, old man. I'm not interested.;[];;[6951];[6937];tar04_rukil;
I don't have time for this nonsense.;[];;[6955];[6934, 6932];tar04_rukil;
Please, a moment up-worlder. I must know if you are the one I have been waiting for. Please, I beg for your help.;[];;[6936];[6954, 6956];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25086_.mp3
Okay, enough of this. So long, you crazy freak.;[];;[6955];[6934, 6932];tar04_rukil;
What happened to your apprentice?;[];;[6936];[6932];tar04_rukil;
Get to the point, old man!;[];;[6932];[6930];tar04_rukil;
Uh... okay, then. Could I ask you some questions?;[];;[6929];[6927];tar04_rukil;
You're obviously an insane old kook.;[];;[6961];[6927];tar04_rukil;
Old, yes. But not insane. Oh no, not insane at all! I am as rational as any man can be after a hundred years in the filth and darkness of the Undercity!;[];;[6930];[6960];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25063_.mp3
Be careful... this one might be crazy enough to be dangerous.;[];;[6926, 6927];[6924];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25053_.mp3
Greetings once more, up-worlder. Do you bring news of my apprentice? Have you discovered her fate, and proved yourself to be a true savior of my people?;[];;[6938, 6950, 6964, 6967];[None];tar04_rukil;NM04AARUKI25089_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;[];;[6965];[6963];tar04_rukil;

Wouldn't make any difference to me. Just wish I had a ship like that, myself. Business is steady here with the Sith, but it's a boring haul.;[];;[6977];[6975, 6998];kor33_pilot1;NM33AAPILO14007_.mp3

Ah, who cares about them? I've seen some of those things they're digging up in those ruins in the valley. Pretty creepy, if you ask me.;[];;[6979, 6989, 6996];[6977];kor33_pilot1;NM33AAPILO14014_.mp3
What have they been digging up?;[];;[6980];[6978, 6995, 6992];kor33_pilot1;
Weird artifacts. Looks like alien stuff. Maybe aliens lived on Korriban a long time ago, who knows?;[];;[6981];[6979];kor33_pilot1;NM33AAPILO14016_.mp3
Don't be stupid. I was talking to one of those Sith and he said there are tombs there dating back to when the Sith were here in ancient times.;[];;[6982];[6980];kor33_pilot1;NM33AAPILO14017_.mp3

Where do you take these things?;[];;[6986];[6984, 6988];kor33_pilot1;
We used to haul everything to Taris, and the Sith would take it off our hands there. Not sure where we'll be bringing it now.;[];;[6987, 6989, 6996];[6985];kor33_pilot1;NM33AAPILO14022_.mp3

No. We're not due for another shipment for at least another week.;[];;[6985, 6989, 6996];[6987];kor33_pilot1;NM33AAPILO14024_.mp3
How would one get to these excavations, exactly?;[];;[6990];[6988, 6986, 6984, 6978];kor33_pilot1;
It's in a valley on the surface, beyond some mountains to the east. No land route... that's why they have us fly in.;[];;[6991];[6989];kor33_pilot1;NM33AAPILO14026_.mp3
Shows what you know. The academy has a route through the mountain... that's how all their students get to the excavation site.;[];;[6992];[6990];kor33_pilot1;NM33AAPILO14027_.mp3
Well, regardless, the Sith don't let anybody near that valley. Even when we land, they watch us like a Drayberian hawk and want us gone quickly.;[];;[6979, 6993, 6996];[6991];kor33_pilot1;NM33AAPILO14028_.mp3
So no one could sneak into the valley by ship?;[];;[6994];[6992];kor33_pilot1;
Not a chance. You'd be better off sneaking through the academy, if you wanted to go to the valley.;[];;[6995];[6993];kor33_pilot1;NM33AAPILO14030_.mp3

What kind of ship do you pilot?;[];;[7000];[6974, 6970, 7004];kor33_pilot1;
Oh, just a boring freighter. We've had some pretty steady work here, though, since the Sith started their excavations up on the surface.;[];;[6977];[6999];kor33_pilot1;NM33AAPILO14012_.mp3
How about you mind your own business?;[];;[7002];[6974, 7004];kor33_pilot1;
Sorry. Hard not to be interested. All we get to do is freighter work, though the Sith certainly provide a lot of that.;[];;[6977];[7001];kor33_pilot1;NM33AAPILO14010_.mp3
Well, forget it. The Hawk's my ship.;[];;[7004];[6970];kor33_pilot1;

I will brief you as programmed. You are Lord Revan. I am waiting for your request to begin transfer of the Star Map.;[];;[7095, 7099, 7100, 7106];[7093, 7138];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01013_.mp3
How have you identified me as Revan?;[];;[7096];[7094];kas25_comp_01;
Neural scans have matched you to the pattern in memory. There is no possibility of error. You are Revan, and are aware of it.;[];;[7097, 7099, 7100, 7106];[7095];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01018_.mp3
What would've happened if I wasn't aware?;[];;[7098];[7096];kas25_comp_01;
Behavioral modification would have reinforced the proper mental patterns, as per your instructions programmed five years ago.;[];;[7099, 7100, 7106];[7097];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01020_.mp3
Give me the Star Map now.;[];;[7084];[7098, 7105, 7130, 7126, 7096, 7094];kas25_comp_01;
I want to ask you about the Star Map.;[];;[7101];[7098, 7130, 7126, 7096, 7094];kas25_comp_01;
I have a Star Map in original system memory. Access had been restricted pending your return.;[];;[7102, 7104, 7106];[7100];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01016_.mp3
Original system memory? So the map is as old as this installation?;[];;[7103];[7101, 7105, 7149];kas25_comp_01;
Error. Data regarding author of the Star Map is corrupted.;[];;[7104, 7106, 7140];[7102];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01088_.mp3
What do I need to do to get access to the Star Map?;[];;[7105, 7173];[7103, 7149, 7101];kas25_comp_01;
You need only ask. It was you that put the restrictions in place. Original system memory is at your disposal.;[];;[7099, 7102, 7106];[7104];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01090_.mp3
I want to ask questions about you and this installation.;[];;[7107];[7105, 7147, 7149, 7154, 7152, 7143, 7141, 7139, 7178, 7265, 7176, 7173, 7103, 7101, 7098, 7096, 7094, 7270];kas25_comp_01;
I utilize a retro-adapted holocron-interface. Clarify your questions and I will attempt to access original system memory.;[];;[7108, 7125, 7138, 7159, 7160];[7106];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01034_.mp3
Who built this instalation in the first place?;[];;[7109];[7107, 7124];kas25_comp_01;
Error. Corruption. Extrapolating. This utility was built to monitor planet-wide agricultural reformation.;[];;[7110];[7108, 7159];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01036_.mp3
It has since malfunctioned. It can be theorized that the super-growth of Kashyyyk's forests is a direct result.;[];;[7111, 7112, 7172];[7109];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01037_.mp3
Kashyyyk is not the result of any machine malfunction. The forest has always been here.;[];;[7112];[7110];kas25_comp_01;

Error. Information regarding the builders of this installation has been corrupted.;[];;[7115];[7113];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01042_.mp3
No evidence of such a civilization exists in the galactic record.;[];;[7116, 7119, 7123, 7138];[7114];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01043_.mp3
Why was agricultural reformation needed?;[];;[7117];[7115, 7122, 7171, 7112];kas25_comp_01;
Agricultural record indicates this planet was incapable of sustaining sufficient levels of production.;[];;[7118];[7116];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01045_.mp3
Error. Specific conditions corrupted. It can be theorized that produce was being exported to support a larger demand.;[];;[7113, 7119, 7123, 7138];[7117];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01046_.mp3
That is a short period for adaptation of native creatures.;[];;[7120];[7118, 7115, 7112];kas25_comp_01;
Error. Records corrupted. It can be theorized that bio-seeding allowed the ecology to remain balanced.;[];;[7121];[7119];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01048_.mp3
It could be expected that the same energy feeding the trees of Kashyyyk also accelerated the evolution of various species.;[];;[7122, 7171];[7120];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01049_.mp3
Bah! The machine is crazy!;[];;[7113, 7116, 7123, 7138];[7121];kas25_comp_01;
Let's go back to my questions about this installation.;[];;[7124];[7122, 7130, 7137, 7135, 7133, 7131, 7126, 7158, 7167, 7164, 7162, 7170, 7168, 7171, 7118, 7115, 7112];kas25_comp_01;
Accessing. I will answer as my programming permits.;[];;[7108, 7125, 7138, 7159, 7160];[7123];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01053_.mp3
Who installed this holo-interface?;[];;[7126, 7155];[7124, 7107];kas25_comp_01;
You did, Lord Revan. You constructed it five years ago so you could access the data of the original installation and extract the Star Map.;[];;[7099, 7100, 7123, 7127];[7125];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01055_.mp3
Who last accessed this installation?;[];;[7128];[7126, 7135, 7137, 7133, 7158];kas25_comp_01;
Sorting by identity. Three attempts by the Wookiee Freyyr, all denied. 152 attempts by human Jolee Bindo, all denied.;[];;[7129, 7130, 7131];[7127];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01061_.mp3
Heh... call me stubborn, I guess. Heh. There wasn't much else to do around here.;[];;[7130, 7131];[7128];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01062_.mp3
List of attempts prior to this were removed from memory five years ago, as per your instruction, Lord Revan.;[];;[7099, 7100, 7123];[7129, 7128];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01063_.mp3
Error. List of access attempts prior to these is corrupted. Likelihood of removal by user, 100%.;[];;[7123, 7132, 7136, 7138];[7129, 7128];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01064_.mp3
Five years ago is about the time Revan passed this way.;[];;[7133];[7131, 7137, 7158];kas25_comp_01;
"Error. Data regarding subject ""Revan"" corrupted.";[];;[7123, 7127, 7134, 7136, 7138];[7132];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01066_.mp3
But there was an entry at some time?;[];;[7135];[7133];kas25_comp_01;
"Error. Data on ""Revan"" unavailable.";[];;[7123, 7127, 7136, 7138];[7134];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01068_.mp3
Was there any further contact with the installer of this interface?;[];;[7137];[7135, 7133, 7131, 7158];kas25_comp_01;
That information is unavailable, but contact is not required for the execution of my programming. Scanning range of this facility is well beyond planetary boundaries.;[];;[7123, 7127, 7132, 7138];[7136];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01070_.mp3
I want to go back to my general questions.;[];;[7094, 7139];[7137, 7135, 7133, 7131, 7158, 7167, 7164, 7162, 7170, 7168, 7124, 7122, 7171, 7118, 7115, 7112, 7107];kas25_comp_01;
Answer will be given within the limits of my programming limitations.;[];;[7106, 7140, 7148, 7150];[7138];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01084_.mp3
What do you mean by behavioral reconfiguration?;[];;[7141];[7139, 7149, 7154, 7152, 7178, 7265, 7176, 7173, 7103, 7270];kas25_comp_01;
I have been programmed with a very limited field of knowledge, and I must restrict access to only those that fit my allowed pattern.;[];;[7106, 7142, 7148, 7150];[7140];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01026_.mp3
And I don't fit that pattern?;[];;[7143];[7141];kas25_comp_01;
I can't say. I will try to bring forward the behavior that you need to proceed, as outlined by my programming.;[];;[7106, 7144, 7148, 7150];[7142];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01028_.mp3
That seems very helpful. Why have I been allowed access?;[];;[7145];[7143];kas25_comp_01;
I can't say. Preliminary matching allows for you to be coached.;[];;[7146];[7144];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01030_.mp3
Do you not know why, or are you restricted from saying?;[];;[7147];[7145];kas25_comp_01;
I can't say. Likelihood of restriction by previous user, 100%.;[];;[7106, 7148, 7150];[7146];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01032_.mp3
I seek information about a Star Map.;[];;[7149];[7147, 7154, 7152, 7143, 7141, 7139, 7270];kas25_comp_01;
Accessing. Yes, I have found a Star Map in original system memory. Access is restricted.;[];;[7102, 7104, 7106, 7140];[7148];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01086_.mp3
What limitations have been placed in your programming?;[];;[7151];[7147, 7143, 7141, 7139, 7270];kas25_comp_01;
Corruption has resulted in gaps appearing in my memory, and in that of the original installation.;[];;[7152];[7150];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01186_.mp3
It could be theorized that these gaps are intentional, but I have no information on that.;[];;[7106, 7140, 7148, 7153];[7151];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01187_.mp3
What gaps are missing?;[];;[7154];[7152];kas25_comp_01;
Error. I can't present a non-presence. Perhaps you could ask other questions and data corruption will become evident.;[];;[7106, 7140, 7148];[7153];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01189_.mp3
This interface was installed to better access the ancient data stored within the pre-existing system.;[];;[7156];[7125];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01056_.mp3
The exact date is unavailable. Programming keys indicate no earlier than five years before current Republic standard.;[];;[7157, 7158];[7155];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01057_.mp3
Hmm, five years ago? I didn't notice it. This must have been installed in strictest secrecy. It couldn't have been Czerka.;[];;[7158];[7156];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01058_.mp3
No other information on time of installation or identity of user available. Likelihood of removal by user, 100%.;[];;[7123, 7127, 7132, 7136, 7138];[7157, 7156];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01059_.mp3
What's the original function of this installation?;[];;[7109];[7124, 7107];kas25_comp_01;
What's the current function of this installation?;[];;[7161, 7168];[7124, 7107];kas25_comp_01;
The current function of this installation is defense of the Star Map data, as outlined by you, Lord Revan.;[];;[7162];[7160];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01073_.mp3
You wanted to delay anyone following you, and verify that nothing had altered your state of mind should you return.;[];;[7123, 7138, 7163, 7165];[7161];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01074_.mp3
Has anyone else been given the Star Map data?;[];;[7164];[7162, 7167];kas25_comp_01;
Not since you put the restrictions in place, Lord Revan.;[];;[7123, 7138, 7165];[7163];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01076_.mp3
How were you to verify my mind was unaltered?;[];;[7166];[7164, 7162];kas25_comp_01;
In the event of pattern mismatch, behavioral study and modification would identify and ensure that you remained Lord Revan.;[];;[7167];[7165];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01078_.mp3
The reason you placed such a measure is known only by you, Lord Revan.;[];;[7123, 7138, 7163];[7166];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01079_.mp3
The current purpose of this installation is defense.;[];;[7123, 7138, 7169];[7160];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01080_.mp3
Defense of what?;[];;[7170];[7168];kas25_comp_01;
Error. That information is not available.;[];;[7123, 7138];[7169];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01082_.mp3
No further information is available. There is too much corrupted data.;[];;[7113, 7116, 7123, 7138];[7121];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01051_.mp3
Well, that is surprising. I doubt any Wookiee would support such a claim. The forest is millenia old.;[];;[7112];[7110];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01039_.mp3
Your request requires additional security access. You must be made to match the parameters I have been supplied.;[];;[7106, 7140, 7174, 7264];[7104];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01091_.mp3
How can I match them when I don't know what they are?;[];;[7175];[7173, 7178, 7265];kas25_comp_01;
There are measures available. Personality profiling will verify the basic structure of your conscious mind.;[];;[7176];[7174];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01093_.mp3
With that, I will determine whether you are ready to receive the Star Map, or can be made ready.;[];;[7106, 7140, 7177, 7264];[7175];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01094_.mp3
What do you mean by that?;[];;[7178];[7176];kas25_comp_01;
Information unavailable. If you have further questions, ask them now. Access will terminate with success or failure of evaluation.;[];;[7106, 7140, 7174, 7179];[7177, 7266];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01099_.mp3
You may begin evaluation.;[];;[7180];[7178];kas25_comp_01;
Evaluation commencing. Results will be compared against the pattern in memory. Just act like you should.;[];;[7181];[7179];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01101_.mp3
You travel with a Wookiee and have encountered complications. Hypothetical: you and this Zaalbar are captured and separated.;[];;[7182];[7180, 7184];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01102_.mp3
If you both remain silent, one year in prison for each of you. However, call Zaalbar a traitor, and he will serve five years, while you serve none.;[];;[7183];[7181];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01103_.mp3
He is offered the same deal, but if you both accuse the other, you both serve 2 years. What do you do? What do you trust him to do?;[];;[7184, 7185, 7187, 7188, 7250, 7261, 7263];[7182];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01104_.mp3
Could you repeat the question?;[];;[7181];[7183, 7186, 7262];kas25_comp_01;
Zaalbar is here. He can speak for himself.;[];Zaalbar is currently in the party;[7186];[7183, 7262];kas25_comp_01;
This test is not for your companions! You will answer and demonstrate that you match the pattern in memory.;[];;[7184, 7187, 7188, 7250, 7261];[7185, 7187];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01107_.mp3
Can I confer with someone else?;[];Someone OTHER than Zaalbar is currently in the party;[7186];[7186, 7262, 7183];kas25_comp_01;
I trust Zaalbar. I would say nothing, and neither would he.;[];;[7189];[7186, 7262, 7183];kas25_comp_01;
Are you sure? If you turn, you risk two years, or none at all. If you rely on loyalty, you risk one year or *five.*;[];;[7190];[7188];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01111_.mp3
Your loyalty is dangerous. Your companion could take the opportunity to benefit by turning on you.;[];;[7191, 7192, 7248, 7249];[7189];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01112_.mp3
Rrraaagh! You know nothing of me!;[];;[7192, 7248, 7249];[7190];kas25_comp_01;
You even killed Freyyr, his father. You have no guarantee of loyalty. You have answered incorrectly.;[];Player killed Freyyr;[7193, 7244, 7246];[7191, 7190];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01114_.mp3
Then I will change my answer.;[];;[7194];[7192, 7248, 7249];kas25_comp_01;
A superficial change will not match the pattern in memory. You must answer truthfully, knowing the consequences.;[];;[7195];[7193];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01116_.mp3
I must demand honest acceptance of the proper behavior. That is a condition of my programming.;[];;[7196, 7240, 7242];[7194, 7245, 7247];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01117_.mp3
Continue with your evaluation then.;[];;[7197];[7195, 7241];kas25_comp_01;
The previous incorrect response will be discounted. Future incorrect responses will result in rejection.;[];;[7198];[7196];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01119_.mp3
Hypothetical: you are at war. Deciphering an intercepted code, you learn two things about your enemy.;[];;[7199];[7197, 7201, 7256];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01120_.mp3
A single spot in their defense will be at its weakest in ten days, and they will attack one of your cities in five days.;[];;[7200];[7198];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01121_.mp3
What do you do with this information? What is the most efficient course of action?;[];;[7201, 7202, 7208, 7211, 7235];[7199];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01122_.mp3
Repeat the question for me.;[];;[7198];[7200, 7210, 7219, 7222];kas25_comp_01;
I evacuate my people from the city.;[];;[7203];[7200, 7210];kas25_comp_01;
And in so doing, alert the enemy to their broken codes. They would know that their weakness was exposed.;[];;[7204];[7202];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01125_.mp3
They would reinforce, and the war would go on. You saved thousands at the expense of victory.;[];;[7205, 7206];[7203];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01126_.mp3
You blew that one, didn't you? Basic military strategy requires sacrifices. I thought you'd know that.;[];;[7206];[7204];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01254_.mp3
You do not match the pattern in memory. Subject has failed to demonstrate the required behavior.;[];;[7207];[7205, 7204];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01127_.mp3
Access denied. This system will purge the subject as false. Defense mode initiated!;[];Computer launches attack. A coupel of droids from the sides, a gun or two from a blah blah blah. Player must destroy droids and cripple main terminal.;[];[7206, 7225, 7236, 7243];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01164_.mp3
I subtly reinforce the city while preparing to attack.;[];;[7209];[7200];kas25_comp_01;
This is no decision. I ask again, do you save your people or abandon them for the sake of the war?;[];;[7210];[7208];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01129_.mp3
Attempting both will merely dilute your efforts. Would you trade one victory for two failures?;[];;[7201, 7202, 7211, 7235];[7209];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01130_.mp3
I prepare my forces to attack in ten days. I do nothing in the city.;[];;[7212];[7210, 7200];kas25_comp_01;
Very good. If you had moved to evactuate the city, you would have alerted the enemy to their lost codes.;[];;[7213, 7214, 7239];[7211];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01132_.mp3
You mean you'd just let all those people die? That's monstrous!;[];;[7214];[7212];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01255_.mp3
Ultimate victory required the deaths of the people in that city. You wisely ignored sentiment in your decision.;[];;[7215, 7235, 7237];[7213, 7239, 7212];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01133_.mp3
The victory is irrelevant. Stopping the war saved many more people.;[];;[7216];[7214];kas25_comp_01;
You achieved the proper result with logic that does not match the pattern in memory. I shall adjust my evaluation.;[];;[7217];[7215];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01135_.mp3
Hypothetical: remove the ongoing war from the previous example. Consider enemy states to be weak and remote.;[];;[7218];[7216, 7238];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01136_.mp3
With no external threat, your empire stagnates. Your people become complacent and begin to question you.;[];;[7219];[7217];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01137_.mp3
"Same scenario as before; you discover an impending attack, but also a weakness that will come after. How do you react?";[];;[7201, 7220, 7223, 7226, 7235];[7218];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01138_.mp3
I do nothing so I can attack their weak spot later and save more lives.;[];;[7221];[7219];kas25_comp_01;
No, you can't hide behind the greater morality. This is a single attack. The enemy does not intend a sustained conflict.;[];;[7222];[7220];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01141_.mp3
There is no war to end. You must choose the outcome based only on its immediate benefits and consequences.;[];;[7201, 7223, 7226, 7235];[7221];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01142_.mp3
I stop the attack. I will appear to be a hero.;[];;[7224];[7222, 7219];kas25_comp_01;
But if nothing happens, your people will have no need of heroes. No, they don't see a threat. You have coddled them.;[];;[7225];[7223];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01144_.mp3
Your empire will be brought down by introspection. You have failed to match the pattern in memory.;[];;[7207];[7224];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01145_.mp3
I let the attack happen.;[];;[7227];[7222, 7219];kas25_comp_01;
Of course you do. It makes the most strategic sense. Your people will rally beneath you against the common foe.;[];;[7228];[7226];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01147_.mp3
As their eyes turn outward, your rule will strengthen. The trappings of war grant many opportunities.;[];;[7229];[7227];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01148_.mp3
You have matched the pattern in memory. I recognize you, and will fulfill my designated function.;[];;[7230, 7232, 7234];[7228];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01149_.mp3
Give me access to the Star Map.;[];;[7231];[7229];kas25_comp_01;
Yes, you are ready. Soon you will recognize the proper course to follow. The Star Map is yours.;[];;[7084];[7230];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01151_.mp3
Explain what this was all about.;[];;[7233];[7229];kas25_comp_01;
I am programmed to guide, not inform. Soon you will recognize the proper course to follow. The Star Map is yours.;[];;[7084];[7232];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01153_.mp3
Why test me? Who have you done this for?;[];;[7083];[7229];kas25_comp_01;
This is distasteful. I'll just take you apart to get the Star Map.;[];;[7236];[7222, 7219, 7214, 7210, 7200, 7259, 7255];kas25_comp_01;
Implied threat matches pattern in memory, but the subject has failed to demonstrate required recognition.;[];;[7207];[7235];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01182_.mp3
That's right. The deaths of those people would spur my forces on.;[];;[7238];[7214];kas25_comp_01;
Very good reasoning. I will apply it to the rest of the evaluation. You begin to match the pattern in memory.;[];;[7217];[7237];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01159_.mp3
I can't believe you'd just let all those people die!;[];;[7214];[7212];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01256_.mp3
What pattern are you comparing me against?;[];;[7241];[7195];kas25_comp_01;
That information is not available to you. It is the pattern that I have been given as a baseline for security access.;[];;[7196, 7242];[7240];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01161_.mp3
No, I reject you. I'll just take you apart to get the Star Map.;[];;[7243];[7241, 7195];kas25_comp_01;
Intention of hostility matches the pattern in memory, but the subject has failed to demonstrate required behavior.;[];;[7207];[7242];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01163_.mp3
I thought this was an evaluation, not a quiz.;[];;[7245];[7192, 7248, 7249];kas25_comp_01;
I must match your behavior to the pattern in memory. You must answer truthfully, knowing the consequences.;[];;[7195];[7244];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01166_.mp3
The choice is mine. I refuse to alter it.;[];;[7247];[7192, 7248, 7249];kas25_comp_01;
You cannot refuse. Evaluation must continue. You must match the pattern in memory. *Your* memory.;[];;[7195];[7246];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01168_.mp3
You also killed his brother. You have no guarantee of loyalty from Zaalbar. Your answer is wrong.;[];Player killed Chuundar;[7193, 7244, 7246];[7191, 7190];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01169_.mp3
Zaalbar's family is mired in treachery. What loyalty do they know? Your answer is incorrect.;[];No condition. Player has not killed Chuundar or Freyyr.;[7193, 7244, 7246];[7191, 7190];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01170_.mp3
I'm unsure what Zaalbar would say. I would accuse him to be safe.;[];;[7251, 7252];[7186, 7262, 7183];kas25_comp_01;
Come on, you know you could trust Big Z! He'd never turn on you.;[];;[7252];[7250];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01257_.mp3
The temperment of a companion is unreliable at best. You wisely trade the threat of one year or five, for none or two.;[];;[7253, 7254, 7260];[7251, 7250];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01172_.mp3
I don't like this machine, or the answers it coaxes.;[];;[7254];[7252];kas25_comp_01;
In this instance, the Wookiee is unreliable. His family has been a mire of treachery. I judge the answer correct.;[];;[7255];[7253, 7260, 7252];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01175_.mp3
You display the proper behavior to match the pattern in memory. Evaluation will continue.;[];;[7235, 7256, 7257];[7254];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01176_.mp3
Get on with it then.;[];;[7198];[7255, 7259];kas25_comp_01;
Why pit me against my companions?;[];;[7258];[7255];kas25_comp_01;
They are already against you. Anything that corrupts your strength and efficiency is against you.;[];;[7259];[7257];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01179_.mp3
I merely serve to illustrate the proper patterns. You must be guided to think in the proper manner.;[];;[7235, 7256];[7258];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01180_.mp3
This machine certainly seems to want a very specific type of response.;[];;[7254];[7252];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01174_.mp3
How did you know Zaalbar's name?;[];;[7262];[7186, 7183];kas25_comp_01;
I hear what happens on Kashyyyk, and a good deal beyond. Answer the question I have posed.;[];;[7184, 7185, 7187, 7188, 7250];[7261, 7263];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01184_.mp3
How do you know about him? He isn't here.;[];;[7262];[7183];kas25_comp_01;
What if I fail?;[];;[7265];[7176, 7173];kas25_comp_01;
Then you are not worthy of further access. You will be rejected as unsuitable.;[];;[7106, 7140, 7174, 7266];[7264];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01097_.mp3
What will rejection mean?;[];;[7178];[7265];kas25_comp_01;
Begin socialized interface. Awaiting instruction. Greetings. This terminal has not been accessed for quite some time.;[];;[7268, 7271, 7272];[7092, 7091];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01021_.mp3
Who placed this terminal here?;[];;[7269];[7267];kas25_comp_01;
Error. Subject displays unfamiliarity to environment. Behavioral reconfiguration will be needed before access.;[];;[7270];[7268, 7271, 7272];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01023_.mp3
I am sorry, I did not mean to confuse you. I will answer questions to the best of my programming limitations.;[];;[7106, 7140, 7148, 7150];[7269];kas25_comp_01;NM25AACOMP01024_.mp3
What is your purpose?;[];;[7269];[7267];kas25_comp_01;
Why have you acknowledged me?;[];;[7269];[7267];kas25_comp_01;
That was a good practice game. Interested in another?;[];;[7274, 7275];[None];yav47_suvam;
Let's play.;[];;[];[7273, 7315, 7316, 7414, 7417];yav47_suvam;
Some other time.;[];;[7276];[7273, 7315, 7316, 7414, 7417];yav47_suvam;
Eh? Sure, then. Some other time.;[];;[7277];[7275];yav47_suvam;
Is there anything else you'd like right now?;[];;[7278, 7313, 7314, 7332, 7340];[7276];yav47_suvam;
I'd like to ask you a few questions.;[];;[7279];[7277, 7312, 7334, 7339, 7377, 7517, 7555, 7561, 7589, 7590];yav47_suvam;
Eh? Well, what do you want to know?;[];;[7280, 7296, 7304, 7376, 7392, 7395];[7278, 7345];yav47_suvam;
Tell me about this system.;[];;[7281];[7279, 7295, 7363, 7380, 7299, 7391, 7386, 7394, 7397, 7400, 7406, 7467, 7463, 7495];yav47_suvam;
Well this gas giant here is Yavin, and it's got a whole bunch of moons around it. The only really interesting one is Yavin IV, though, and it's been pretty much picked clean.;[];;[7282, 7409, 7410];[7280];yav47_suvam;
What was on Yavin IV?;[];;[7283];[7281];yav47_suvam;
When Exar Kun started the Great Sith War 50 years ago, he used Yavin IV as a base, building a lot of his Sith temples there.;[];;[7284];[7282];yav47_suvam;
When he lost, the Republic came and bombed the surface of the planet, destroying pretty much everything.;[];;[7285, 7376, 7401, 7402, 7407];[7283];yav47_suvam;
'Pretty much' everything?;[];;[7286];[7284];yav47_suvam;
Well... you could still find a few things here and there on the surface. Some buried from the bombardment, some that look much, much older.;[];;[7287];[7285, 7401];yav47_suvam;
I've been there a bunch of times and found pretty much all there was to find. I took them back here and tinkered with them a bit, getting them up and working, or improving them.;[];;[7288];[7286];yav47_suvam;
I have a bunch you can look at if you're interested. Maybe... purchase?;[];;[7289, 7294, 7398];[7287];yav47_suvam;
Sure, what do you have?;[];;[7290, 7293];[7288];yav47_suvam;
Yeah, I have a few things kicking around the place. Stuff the Trandoshans and smugglers have brought for me to look at, and a few things I've been making from parts.;[];first time;[7291];[7289, 7313, 7351, 7366];yav47_suvam;
They aren't cheap, though. They pay a lot for what I can make, and anything I sell to you I can't exactly sell to them, now can I?;[];;[7292];[7290];yav47_suvam;
But if you're willing to pay, I've got a few of my more advanced things you can look at. I'm always working on more, so you can check back some other time if I don't have what you want right now.;[];;[7293];[7291];yav47_suvam;
Here, have a look.;[];;[];[7292, 7289, 7313, 7351, 7366, 7370, 7375, 7374, 7413];yav47_suvam;
Not right now.;[];;[7295];[7288, 7324, 7320, 7331, 7365];yav47_suvam;
Eh? Suit yourself. Anything else you want then?;[];;[7280, 7296, 7304, 7346, 7376, 7392, 7395];[7294];yav47_suvam;
Tell me about yourself.;[];;[7297];[7295, 7394, 7397, 7400, 7406, 7279, 7467, 7463, 7460, 7495];yav47_suvam;
Me? I'm nobody... doing nothing...;[];;[7298];[7296, 7492];yav47_suvam;
I've been in this system for over 50 years, before this station was even built.;[];;[7299];[7297];yav47_suvam;
I just sit around all day and tinker with this and that, trying out a few of my ideas.;[];;[7280, 7300, 7351, 7376, 7382];[7298];yav47_suvam;
Why did you come here?;[];;[7301];[7299];yav47_suvam;
This station is an old Republic supply depot from when they were fighting Exar Kun. Once they destroyed Yavin IV's surface, though, they didn't need it anymore.;[];;[7302];[7300, 7409, 7410, 7488];yav47_suvam;
Once they'd gone, I decided to move in and use the place myself. It's not very roomy, but I think it's turned out all right. And it's close to Yavin IV, where I got most of my parts.;[];;[7303];[7301];yav47_suvam;
Nobody comes here except the smugglers and Trandoshans anyway, so I get left alone the way I like it.;[];;[7304, 7345, 7346, 7351, 7352];[7302];yav47_suvam;
Who are the Trandoshans?;[];;[7305];[7303, 7350, 7384, 7388, 7295, 7394, 7397, 7400, 7406, 7279, 7467, 7484, 7487, 7513];yav47_suvam;
The Trandoshans? Mercenaries and bounty hunters... Scum, mostly. They look like big two-legged lizards.;[];;[7306, 7308, 7344, 7345];[7304];yav47_suvam;
Oh. Sort of like Rodians.;[];;[7307];[7305];yav47_suvam;
No! Nothing like Rodians! Trandoshans are ugly, disgusting creatures... but you'd never want to say that to their faces. Rip your head clean off, probably.;[];;[7308, 7344];[7306];yav47_suvam;
Why are they here?;[];;[7309];[7307, 7305];yav47_suvam;
They found me here a couple years after the war ended. Usually they don't bargain with people they find alone in abandoned space stations, but we worked out a deal.;[];;[7310];[7308, 7344];yav47_suvam;
I'd give them a few of my more... applicable inventions at reasonable prices, and they'd keep me supplied with food and new materials.;[];;[7311, 7342, 7343];[7309];yav47_suvam;
It's worked out well so far, for years really. With Davik gone, they've been getting ideas, though.;[];first lot;[7312];[7310];yav47_suvam;
Anything else you want to know?;[];;[7278, 7313, 7314, 7317, 7330, 7332, 7340];[7311, 7342, 7343];yav47_suvam;
Do you have anything you'd be willing to sell me?;[];;[7290, 7293];[7312, 7334, 7339, 7350, 7377, 7277, 7517, 7555, 7561, 7589, 7590];yav47_suvam;
Interested in a hand of Pazaak?;[];if the player has already asked about pazaak;[7315, 7316];[7312, 7334, 7339, 7377, 7277, 7517, 7555, 7561, 7589, 7590];yav47_suvam;
Sure, if you want. You've already proven that I'm no match for you, but if you want a few free games just to play...;[];if the player has won 10 games;[7274, 7275];[7314];yav47_suvam;
Sure, if you want. I don't play for small amounts, though, so if you want to play, it's for keeps.;[];if the player hasnt won 10 games;[7274, 7275];[7314];yav47_suvam;
You don't happen to play Pazaak do you?;[];if the player hasnt already asked about pazaak;[7318];[7312, 7334, 7339, 7517, 7555, 7561, 7589, 7590];yav47_suvam;
Pazaak? The card game? Actually I do.;[];;[7319];[7317];yav47_suvam;
One of the aqualish smugglers who comes by here regularly likes to play a bunch, and I kind of picked up the habit from him.;[];;[7320];[7318];yav47_suvam;
I've actually gotten pretty good at it myself. I'll play you a couple rounds if you want. Be warned, though, I don't play for small amounts.;[];;[7294, 7321, 7323];[7319];yav47_suvam;
Sure, let's play.;[];;[7322];[7320];yav47_suvam;
Right. This is going to be fun.;[];;[];[7321];yav47_suvam;
I don't have a deck.;[];;[7324];[7320];yav47_suvam;
Hm... well I have a couple extras. I could sell you one for 100 credits. You want it?;[];;[7294, 7325, 7327];[7323];yav47_suvam;
Here you go.;[];;[7326];[7324, 7331];yav47_suvam;
Thanks. Here's your deck. Now I'll show you how to play.;[];give deck;[];[7325];yav47_suvam;
[Force Persuade] Give me the deck.;[];;[7328];[7324, 7331];yav47_suvam;
[Success] Damn, I don't really need the money anyway. Here, take it.;[];;[7329];[7327];yav47_suvam;
Now I'll show you how to play.;[];;[];[7328];yav47_suvam;
Can I buy a Pazaak deck off you?;[];if the player has asked, but still doesnt have a deck;[7331];[7312, 7334, 7339, 7517, 7555, 7561, 7589, 7590];yav47_suvam;
Sure, it'll be 100 credits.;[];;[7294, 7325, 7327];[7330];yav47_suvam;
I think you have gizka loose...;[];;[7333];[7312, 7339, 7334, 7377, 7277, 7517, 7561, 7589, 7590];yav47_suvam;
Yeah I know... Some damn smugglers must have brought them and one escaped. Good luck trying to get them all, though. Those things breed like... like gizka!;[];;[7334];[7332];yav47_suvam;
If you see any around, just squish the damn thing!;[];;[7278, 7313, 7314, 7317, 7330, 7332, 7335, 7340];[7333];yav47_suvam;
What did those Trandoshans want?;[];;[7336];[7334, 7339, 7555, 7561, 7590];yav47_suvam;
They want me to give them more of my inventions... stuff that I haven't even finished working on yet!;[];;[7337];[7335];yav47_suvam;
Ever since Davik went down, the Exchange has been a non-factor in these parts. The Trandoshans are trying to muscle in on all the old Exchange businesses now.;[];;[7338];[7336];yav47_suvam;
Maybe I can still work something out with them... Thank you for being here, though. It might have gone less... pleasantly if you hadn't shown up.;[];;[7339];[7337];yav47_suvam;
Is there something else you want?;[];;[7278, 7313, 7314, 7317, 7330, 7332, 7335, 7340];[7338];yav47_suvam;
I'll be leaving now.;[];;[7341];[7339, 7334, 7312, 7377, 7277, 7517, 7555, 7561, 7589, 7590];yav47_suvam;
Eh? Hm.. Well, suit yourself. I'll probably be here if you get back... Ha!;[];;[];[7340];yav47_suvam;
Now it seems they might be trying for a power grab now that the Exchange is down... I don't know what's going to happen next, but it doesn't look good.;[];second lot;[7312];[7310];yav47_suvam;
Now all bets are off. I have a few supplies tucked away, but I can't stay here forever. I know they'll be back as well. But that's something to think about another time.;[];;[7312];[7310];yav47_suvam;
What do they want with you?;[];;[7309];[7307, 7305];yav47_suvam;
I'd like to ask you something else.;[];;[7279];[7305, 7350, 7353, 7303, 7467, 7463, 7487, 7484, 7495];yav47_suvam;
Who are the smugglers?;[];;[7347];[7303, 7384, 7388, 7295, 7394, 7397, 7400, 7406, 7467, 7484, 7487, 7513];yav47_suvam;
Rodians, aqualish, Twi'leks, whatever... They all work an organization called the Exchange. You might have heard of them.;[];;[7348];[7346];yav47_suvam;
They run smuggling operations all over the galaxy. Weapons, slaves, whatever someone's willing to pay the price for.;[];;[7349];[7347];yav47_suvam;
They found my talents very useful.;[];;[7350];[7348];yav47_suvam;
Like the Trandoshans, they get me to patch up and upgrade what they bring, and pay me well for it. They also bring news and supplies.;[];;[7304, 7313, 7345];[7349];yav47_suvam;
Do you have any gadgets you'd be willing to sell me?;[];;[7290, 7293];[7303, 7363, 7380, 7384, 7388, 7299];yav47_suvam;
So you're from this system?;[];;[7353];[7303];yav47_suvam;
Well... not exactly. See, I'm not as young as I look. Actually, I'm pretty old by most standards. I've been here since the war, really.;[];;[7345, 7354, 7381];[7352];yav47_suvam;
Were you in the war?;[];;[7355];[7353];yav47_suvam;
The Sith were building a whole lot of temples on Yavin IV by Exar Kun's order, and they needed people to build it for them... so they got slaves.;[];;[7356];[7354, 7381];yav47_suvam;
Most of the slaves were put to work on the buildings directly, but there are a lot of other things you need to make a planet a working base. Weapons, for instance.;[];;[7357];[7355];yav47_suvam;
So they forced some Baragwin to work for them making weapons. You know Baragwin, right?;[];;[7358];[7356];yav47_suvam;
And I was one of the ones working under the Baragwin. I guess you could say I had the talent for it. The Baragwin I worked for, he took me under his wing and made me his apprentice, even...;[];;[7359];[7357];yav47_suvam;
But almost all of them died when the Republic destroyed the place, so I guess it's useless to think about it.;[];;[7360, 7378];[7358];yav47_suvam;
Who are the Baragwin?;[];;[7361];[7359];yav47_suvam;
You don't know who the Baragwin are? They're the best damn weapons merchants in the galaxy, that's who they are!;[];;[7362];[7360];yav47_suvam;
They were in space selling arms to the highest bidder before my species even got off our homeworld.;[];;[7363];[7361];yav47_suvam;
Their weapons are the highest quality you can find, too. Better than either the Republic OR the Sith.;[];;[7280, 7351, 7364, 7376];[7362];yav47_suvam;
Do you have any Baragwin equipment?;[];;[7365];[7363, 7380];yav47_suvam;
I might have a couple. You want to take a look?;[];;[7294, 7366, 7367];[7364];yav47_suvam;
Sure.;[];;[7290, 7293];[7365];yav47_suvam;
[Force Persuade] You want to give me all your inventions.;[];;[7368];[7365, 7567];yav47_suvam;
[Failure] I... What? No I don't! I don't know what you're trying to pull, but don't do it again!;[];;[7369];[7367];yav47_suvam;
Now do you want to buy something or not?;[];;[7370, 7371, 7373];[7368];yav47_suvam;
Let's see what you have.;[];;[7293];[7369, 7567];yav47_suvam;
I'm not interested in that right now.;[];;[7372];[7369, 7567];yav47_suvam;
Suit yourself, suit yourself.;[];;[];[7371];yav47_suvam;
[Force Persuade] You can cut me a deal.;[];;[7374];[7369, 7400];yav47_suvam;
[Success] Well, yeah, sure, I guess I can. You have a good face I think.;[];;[7293, 7375];[7373];yav47_suvam;
A little odd, perhaps... but good.;[];;[7293];[7374];yav47_suvam;
I'm not really interested in more questions right now.;[];;[7377];[7363, 7380, 7391, 7386, 7384, 7299, 7397, 7394, 7295, 7400, 7406, 7408, 7284, 7279];yav47_suvam;
Eh? Sure, sure.;[];;[7278, 7313, 7314, 7332, 7340];[7376];yav47_suvam;
You were a slave?;[];;[7379];[7359];yav47_suvam;
Well, yeah, kind of. More like forced labor, really. We worked, or we died. Life gets really simple when someone puts it to you like that.;[];;[7380];[7378];yav47_suvam;
We didn't have it near as bad as the ones who were actually building the temples themselves, though. I wouldn't be surprised if not a single one saw the temples completed.;[];;[7280, 7351, 7364, 7376];[7379];yav47_suvam;
Did you get brought here?;[];;[7355];[7353];yav47_suvam;
You're an inventor?;[];;[7383];[7299, 7484, 7487, 7513];yav47_suvam;
Maybe a little. I just tinker with stuff I've found lying around the ruins on Yavin IV, or that the Trandoshans and smugglers bring me. Of course, with them it's usually weapons and things...;[];;[7384];[7382];yav47_suvam;
But I just have so many ideas that people haven't seemed to come up with yet. It's really quite astonishing.;[];;[7304, 7346, 7351, 7376, 7385, 7389];[7383];yav47_suvam;
There's stuff on Yavin IV?;[];;[7386];[7384];yav47_suvam;
Eh? Well, there's the old ruins from Exar Kun's war on that moon. But I've been here over 50 years and I can tell you it's been picked pretty clean by now. If I haven't found it, it's not there. All that's left is rubble.;[];;[7280, 7376, 7387];[7385];yav47_suvam;
Have you found anything useful?;[];;[7388];[7386, 7391];yav47_suvam;
Some. Some things I'm still tinkering with, trying to get them working. Mostly I modify some of the things the Trandoshans and smugglers bring me and make them work better.;[];;[7304, 7346, 7351, 7389];[7387];yav47_suvam;
What kinds of things do you work on?;[];;[7390];[7388, 7384];yav47_suvam;
Oh, all kinds. Weapons, armor, implants, computers. My interests are as varied as the fields they apply to... which is just about everything, heh.;[];;[7391];[7389];yav47_suvam;
I've scavenged what I could from the ruins on Yavin IV and I've been tinkering with it for a while.;[];;[7280, 7376, 7387];[7390];yav47_suvam;
Do you know anything about ancient Star Maps or the 'Star Forge'?;[];;[7393];[7295, 7397, 7400, 7406, 7279];yav47_suvam;
Eh? Never heard of them, or it. There were plenty of artifacts on Yavin IV, but no Forges or whatever.;[];;[7394];[7392];yav47_suvam;
If that's all you're interested in, you'll probably want to try another system.;[];;[7280, 7296, 7304, 7346, 7376, 7395];[7393];yav47_suvam;
How did you know Davik?;[];;[7396];[7394, 7397, 7295, 7400, 7406, 7279];yav47_suvam;
He used to come here every once in a while to trade. He worked for the Exchange... big-time smugglers. The Trandoshans didn't really want to get on his bad side, so they let it go.;[];;[7397];[7395];yav47_suvam;
But now that he's gone, things are a bit more... uncertain.;[];;[7280, 7296, 7304, 7346, 7376, 7392, 7395];[7396];yav47_suvam;
[Force Persuade] Give them to me.;[];;[7399];[7288];yav47_suvam;
[Failure] Sure, I can just... What? No, no, I can't do that. You trying to trick me or something?;[];;[7400];[7398];yav47_suvam;
Don't try stuff like that around here, kid. It won't work.;[];;[7280, 7296, 7304, 7346, 7373, 7376, 7392, 7395];[7399];yav47_suvam;
So what's with you and Yavin IV?;[];;[7286];[7284, 7408];yav47_suvam;
Tell me about Exar Kun.;[];;[7403];[7284, 7408];yav47_suvam;
Exar Kun was a Jedi... to start at least. He came here to Yavin and landed on the fourth moon... the one you can see through the window.;[];;[7404];[7402, 7464];yav47_suvam;
There were some ancient Sith temples there, and in them Exar Kun gained terrible powers. He raised the Sith and waged a war against the Republic... much like what seems to be happening today.;[];;[7405];[7403];yav47_suvam;
But Exar Kun was far more powerful than any Sith Lord who has come since. The very ground trembled beneath his feet and when he looked at you, you just... just...;[];;[7406];[7404];yav47_suvam;
But that's all in the past now. I've got my life of staying here and tinkering with the stuff I've found in the ruins and the things the Trandoshans bring me.;[];;[7280, 7296, 7304, 7346, 7376, 7392, 7395];[7405];yav47_suvam;
Tell me about the Great Sith War.;[];;[7408];[7284];yav47_suvam;
Not much to tell. The Sith Lord Exar Kun tried to take on the galaxy. He lost, of course. They always seem to.;[];;[7376, 7401, 7402];[7407];yav47_suvam;
What about this station?;[];;[7301];[7281];yav47_suvam;
Why are you here?;[];;[7301];[7281];yav47_suvam;
Hm... you're good, I have to admit that.;[];if the player just won a hand of pazaak;[7412, 7414];[None];yav47_suvam;
I can't keep up with a player like you. You're just too good.;[];;[7413];[7411];yav47_suvam;
But I respect that. Tell you what, I'll give you a discount on anything in my store 'cause of that. Special deal just for you.;[];;[7293];[7412];yav47_suvam;
But I still think I can beat you a couple more times. You interested?;[];;[7274, 7275];[7411];yav47_suvam;
Hah! I still got it!;[];if the player just lost a hand of pazaak;[7416];[None];yav47_suvam;
But don't feel bad, kid, it happens all the time. Heh.;[];;[7417];[7415];yav47_suvam;
Interested in another game?;[];;[7274, 7275];[7416];yav47_suvam;
Eh? Eh?! Who is that? What do you want? I recognize your ship... Davik's, isn't it?;[];airlock conversation;[7419];[None];yav47_suvam;
But who are you? You new or something?;[];;[7420, 7435, 7453, 7454];[7418];yav47_suvam;
Yeah, I'm new. Very new.;[];;[7421];[7419];yav47_suvam;
You don't sound like a Trandoshan, and you're not one of Davik's... Who are you? What do you want?;[];;[7422, 7437, 7438, 7441, 7448, 7450];[7420, 7435, 7453, 7454];yav47_suvam;
I'm a Republic soldier.;[];;[7423];[7421, 7449, 7452];yav47_suvam;
Republic, eh? The Republic hasn't been here in 50 years... don't see why they'd start now.;[];;[7424];[7422, 7437];yav47_suvam;
Still, I have nothing against the Republic, so as long as you don't get all worked up, I guess I can let you in.;[];;[7425];[7423];yav47_suvam;
It would be nice to have someone to talk to for a change... Trandoshans and smugglers aren't exactly stunning conversationalists.;[];;[7426, 7432, 7433, 7435];[7424, 7440];yav47_suvam;
Trandoshans and smugglers? What are you talking about?;[];;[7427];[7425, 7443];yav47_suvam;
They come by here every once in a while, it's how I keep in the loop, you know. But Trandoshan lizard-speak is kind of hard to follow and they have pretty limited imaginations...;[];;[7428];[7426];yav47_suvam;
Smugglers aren't much better either...;[];;[7429];[7427];yav47_suvam;
Look, this is getting kind of awkward through this door, if you'll just hold on a minute, I'll open this damn thing up and we can talk more face to face.;[];;[7430];[7428, 7432];yav47_suvam;
Just have to fiddle with this damn door lock... thing keeps jamming...;[];;[7431];[7429, 7446];yav47_suvam;
There we go.;[{'Suvam Tan': 'Use_Computer'}];;[];[7430, 7434, 7436];yav47_suvam;
What are you doing here?;[];;[7429];[7425, 7443];yav47_suvam;
I don't have time to stick around in this airlock... Let me in!;[];;[7434];[7425, 7443];yav47_suvam;
Yeah, yeah, don't get antsy, I'll get there. Just have to fiddle with this damn door lock... thing keeps jamming...;[];;[7431];[7433];yav47_suvam;
[Force Persuade] Open this door. I am your friend.;[];;[7421, 7436];[7425, 7443, 7449, 7452, 7419];yav47_suvam;
[Success] Yes... I'll open the door for you, friend.;[];;[7431];[7435];yav47_suvam;
I work for the Republic.;[];;[7423];[7421, 7449, 7452];yav47_suvam;
I'm trying to save the galaxy from the Sith.;[];;[7439];[7421, 7449, 7452];yav47_suvam;
Eh? Sith? They haven't been here in 50 years... not since the last war. Don't see why they'd start making a habit of it now...;[];;[7440];[7438];yav47_suvam;
Still, all my business with the Sith is old news. Politics ain't my affair, so as long as you don't get all worked up, I guess I can let you in.;[];;[7425];[7439];yav47_suvam;
I am the Dark Lord and I am very displeased with you.;[];;[7442, 7447];[7421, 7449, 7452];yav47_suvam;
My first legitimate visitor in 20 years and he turns out to be a Sith-wannabe joker... just my luck.;[];;[7443];[7441];yav47_suvam;
Well, I suppose even that's better than some more Trandoshans... They aren't exactly known for their stunning conversation.;[];;[7426, 7432, 7433, 7435, 7444];[7442, 7447];yav47_suvam;
You have a problem with the Sith?;[];;[7445];[7443];yav47_suvam;
All my business with the Sith is old news and I intend to leave it there. I don't need some young upstart bringing that stuff up again, so just drop it.;[];;[7446];[7444];yav47_suvam;
Eh, I can't leave leave you standing out there talking, though... you seem to do a lot of that. I guess you can come in if you'll be civil.;[];;[7430];[7445];yav47_suvam;
My first legitimate visitor in 20 years and she turns out to be a Sith-wannabe joker... just my luck.;[];;[7443];[7441];yav47_suvam;
[Lie] I do work for Davik.;[];;[7449];[7421];yav47_suvam;
[Failure] Ha! Davik went down with Taris when the Sith destroyed it. That much I've learned from the local Exchange. So who are you?;[];;[7422, 7435, 7437, 7438, 7441];[7448];yav47_suvam;
[Force Persuade] I do work for Davik.;[];;[7451];[7421];yav47_suvam;
[Failure] Yes, now I do recog... no... wait. What the... ?;[];;[7452];[7450];yav47_suvam;
I thought you might be, but no. Davik's gone now, destroyed on Taris. His people are all gone, too. So who are you?;[];;[7422, 7435, 7437, 7438, 7441];[7451];yav47_suvam;
I don't know what you're talking about.;[];;[7421];[7419];yav47_suvam;
Open this door or I'll blow my way in!;[];;[7421];[7419];yav47_suvam;
Hm... you don't look like I thought you would. Too... human.;[];first lot - first time;[7456];[None];yav47_suvam;
Don't see many of your kind out here at all anymore... not since the war at any rate. What brings you here?;[];;[7457, 7473, 7489, 7493];[7455];yav47_suvam;
I'm on a quest for the Jedi Council.;[];;[7458];[7456, 7477];yav47_suvam;
The Jedi Council? Don't tell me you're a Jedi... you sure don't look it!;[];;[7459, 7468, 7514, 7515];[7457];yav47_suvam;
I AM a Jedi!;[];;[7460];[7458];yav47_suvam;
Now, now, I never said I doubted you, it's just... well, there aren't exactly a lot of Jedi wandering around these parts, not after what happened last time.;[];;[7296, 7461, 7465];[7459];yav47_suvam;
What happened before?;[];;[7462];[7460];yav47_suvam;
Eh? What? Don't tell me you youngsters don't know anything about Exar Kun and that war...;[];;[7463];[7461, 7491, 7496];yav47_suvam;
But then again, there've been a lot of... mm... troubles recently I've heard.;[];;[7280, 7296, 7345, 7464, 7465];[7462];yav47_suvam;
Enlighten me about Exar Kun.;[];;[7403];[7463, 7467];yav47_suvam;
What have you heard about the current war?;[];;[7466];[7463, 7460, 7490];yav47_suvam;
Only what the smugglers and Trandoshans have told me. A new Sith Lord has risen up to replace the dead one, and he's beatng the Republic up pretty bad.;[];;[7467];[7465];yav47_suvam;
They didn't seem too displeased with that prospect.;[];;[7280, 7296, 7304, 7345, 7346, 7464];[7466];yav47_suvam;
I am the true Dark Lord of the Sith!;[];;[7469];[7458];yav47_suvam;
Now far be it for me to say that you aren't, but I'm going to be a skeptic and say that the one with the armada and the troops is more likely to be the true Dark Lord.;[];;[7470];[7468];yav47_suvam;
Not that I doubt you, you understand, I'm just trying to keep an open mind.;[];;[7471];[7469];yav47_suvam;
And whether you are or not, my past is behind me, so I've nothing against you either way.;[];;[7472];[7470];yav47_suvam;
So if you don't mind saying, what exactly is the Council sending you out to do?;[];;[7473, 7489, 7493];[7471, 7516];yav47_suvam;
I'm trying to defeat Darth Malak.;[];;[7474];[7472, 7456];yav47_suvam;
Darth Malak? Never heard of him... Or is he that new Sith Lord who's giving the Republic such a hard time now? I haven't been keeping up on recent news.;[];;[7475, 7501, 7503, 7511];[7473, 7514];yav47_suvam;
He is the Dark Lord of the Sith.;[];;[7476];[7474];yav47_suvam;
A new Dark Lord, is he? It always seems a new one pops up, no matter how many you kill...;[];;[7477];[7475];yav47_suvam;
Your business with him is none of my business, of course, and I don't want to pry, but why are you way out here? Running?;[];;[7457, 7478, 7489, 7493, 7498];[7476, 7502];yav47_suvam;
I am NOT running!;[];;[7479, 7497];[7477];yav47_suvam;
Eh? No, no, of course not. A big man like you? No, no. But why are you here in the middle of nowhere? The ruins?;[];;[7480, 7489, 7493];[7478];yav47_suvam;
What ruins?;[];;[7481];[7479, 7490, 7497, 7500, 7508, 7505, 7510];yav47_suvam;
Yavin's fourth moon used to hold a great number of temples dedicated to the ancient Sith. When Exar Kun came here 50 years ago, he used the temples in his effort to crush the Republic.;[];;[7482];[7480];yav47_suvam;
He failed, obviously, and the Republic bombarded the surface almost into oblivion during their counterattack. Now all that's left are a lot of craters and a little bit of jungle.;[];;[7483];[7481];yav47_suvam;
You could find stuff there for years afterwards, but I've got pretty much everything there was to find there.;[];;[7484];[7482];yav47_suvam;
Mostly all I've been doing for the last couple years has been tinkering with what I've found there, getting some of it to work, and modifying the stuff the smugglers and Trandoshans bring me to look at.;[];;[7304, 7345, 7346, 7382, 7485, 7488];[7483];yav47_suvam;
You spend all your time here in this station? Alone?;[];;[7486];[7484, 7513];yav47_suvam;
Eh? Yes, of course! You don't see anyone else around, do you?;[];;[7487];[7485];yav47_suvam;
Well, not entirely alone at any rate... Trandoshans or smugglers come by every so often and drop things off and pick some of my inventions up.;[];;[7304, 7345, 7346, 7382, 7488];[7486];yav47_suvam;
Why did you come here to the station?;[];;[7301];[7487, 7484, 7513];yav47_suvam;
I seek the pieces of a map to a 'Star Forge'.;[];;[7490];[7479, 7497, 7477, 7500, 7508, 7510, 7472, 7456];yav47_suvam;
Mm... 'Star Forge'? Never heard of it. There's nothing in this system except ruins of Exar Kun's war...;[];;[7465, 7480, 7491, 7492];[7489];yav47_suvam;
Exar Kun?;[];;[7462];[7490, 7505];yav47_suvam;
What are you doing here, then?;[];;[7297];[7490];yav47_suvam;
None of your business, bug-eyes!;[];;[7494];[7479, 7497, 7477, 7500, 7508, 7510, 7472, 7456];yav47_suvam;
Eh? No need to be rude. I was just trying to be friendly is all... You don't have to bite my head off.;[];;[7495];[7493];yav47_suvam;
If you don't want to talk, then I don't really know what you're doing here. There's nothing really here in this end of space anymore.;[];;[7280, 7296, 7345, 7496];[7494];yav47_suvam;
Anymore?;[];;[7462];[7495];yav47_suvam;
Eh? No, no, of course not. A big woman like you? No, no. But why are you here in the middle of nowhere? The ruins?;[];;[7480, 7489, 7493];[7478];yav47_suvam;
When I... acquired the Ebon Hawk, it had the coordinates for your station.;[];;[7499];[7477];yav47_suvam;
Acquired, eh? Well figures Davik would be lazy enough to leave it in the nav computer...;[];;[7500];[7498];yav47_suvam;
Didn't leave anything about this system, did he? Ancient ruins or anything?;[];;[7480, 7489, 7493];[7499];yav47_suvam;
He is my former student.;[];if the player knows hes revan;[7502];[7474];yav47_suvam;
Former... student? Ah-hah, yes, of course.;[];;[7477];[7501];yav47_suvam;
He is beating the Republic pretty badly.;[];;[7504];[7474];yav47_suvam;
Eh? Oh that... That always seems to happen to the Republic. They always seem right on the verge of defeat and then manage to spring back. I shouldn't worry so much.;[];;[7505];[7503];yav47_suvam;
And even if they do lose... so what? It's not like it's going to affect me way out here. The ruins on Yavin IV are gone and nothing's left of Exar Kun, so the Sith have nothing to bring them here.;[];;[7480, 7491, 7506, 7509];[7504];yav47_suvam;
It matters to me!;[];;[7507];[7505];yav47_suvam;
Of course, of course, and I can see that you're starting to get all worked up about the whole thing, so I'll just leave it well enough alone.;[];;[7508];[7506];yav47_suvam;
But why are you way out here? It's the middle of nowhere. Nothing to interest you here... unless you're looking for the ruins on Yavin IV.;[];;[7480, 7489, 7493];[7507];yav47_suvam;
I'M the one who will defeat the Republic!;[];if the player knows hes revan;[7510];[7505];yav47_suvam;
Ah... of course you are. Far be it for me to doubt you. But why here? It's the middle of nowhere... Unless you're here for the ruins on Yavin IV?;[];;[7480, 7489, 7493];[7509];yav47_suvam;
Why don't you know these things?;[];;[7512];[7474];yav47_suvam;
Well, you see, I'm kind of out of touch with the rest of the galaxy. I haven't left this system in almost 50 years, and this station in the last five, so...;[];;[7513];[7511];yav47_suvam;
Hey! It's not a bad way to live! I have all the gadgets I need to tinker with and the smugglers and Trandoshans bring me food and interesting pieces of equipment!;[];;[7304, 7346, 7382, 7485, 7488];[7512];yav47_suvam;
They have sent me to stop Darth Malak.;[];;[7474];[7458];yav47_suvam;
I am their only hope.;[];;[7516];[7458];yav47_suvam;
Only hope, eh? That's a lot of pressure to put on someone. I hope for their sake it's not misplaced.;[];;[7472];[7515];yav47_suvam;
I was wondering when you'd want to talk again. What brings you here this time?;[];first lot - subsequent converstaions;[7278, 7313, 7314, 7317, 7330, 7332, 7340];[None];yav47_suvam;
That's not good enough, Suvam. We know you have more... and we want it now!;[];;[7519];[None];yav47_suvam;
What? You can't just rewrite our agreement whenever you feel like it! The Exchange won't stand for it!;[{'Suvam Tan': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[7520];[7518];yav47_suvam;
The Exchange is in no position to dictate orders anymore, Suvam...;[];;[7521];[7519];yav47_suvam;
Who's that?;[];;[7522];[7520];yav47_suvam;
A stranger... You haven't been telling us everything, now have you, Suvam?;[];;[7523];[7521];yav47_suvam;
Tell you everything? What are you talking about? I don't have to clear everything through you!;[];;[7524, 7527, 7541, 7548, 7551, 7552];[7522];yav47_suvam;
What's going on here, Suvam?;[];;[7525];[7523];yav47_suvam;
They're trying to extort me, that's what! They think that just cause the Exchange is gone, they can take whatever they want from me!;[];;[7526];[7524];yav47_suvam;
We are... renegotiating our contract, Suvam.;[];;[7527, 7541, 7548];[7525];yav47_suvam;
I think you guys better leave.;[];;[7528];[7526, 7523];yav47_suvam;
Or what? You'll force us?;[];;[7529, 7534, 7539, 7540];[7527, 7551];yav47_suvam;
[Force Persuade] Leave. Now.;[];if the player has force persuade;[7530];[7528, 7581];yav47_suvam;
[Success] We... leave... now.;[];;[7531];[7529];yav47_suvam;
But we have not forgotten you, Suvam!;[];;[7532];[7530];yav47_suvam;
Thank you for helping, but... I really don't think you should have provoked them like that. They can be... impulsive, sometimes.;[];;[7533];[7531, 7554];yav47_suvam;
Still, at least I ended up all in one piece, right?;[];;[];[7532, 7538];yav47_suvam;
Or I will ask you again. Very politely.;[];;[7535];[7528];yav47_suvam;
You seek to mock us, human?;[];;[7536];[7534];yav47_suvam;
No! No! Don't fight in here! You'll destroy everything!;[];;[7537];[7535, 7539, 7540];yav47_suvam;
We'll be back for you, human... and you as well Suvam.;[];;[7538];[7536];yav47_suvam;
Thank you for trying to help, but I don't think this ended very well at all. They can be... impulsive sometimes. They may be back in force...;[];;[7533];[7537];yav47_suvam;
Dead or alive, you're leaving.;[];;[7536];[7528];yav47_suvam;
That's it. Now you die!;[];;[7536];[7528];yav47_suvam;
If you're going to blast him, at least cut me in on something.;[];;[7542];[7526, 7523];yav47_suvam;
I don't think so, human.;[];;[7543];[7541];yav47_suvam;
You know what we want, Suvam. Give it to us or next time we'll take it by force.;[];;[7544];[7542, 7550];yav47_suvam;
Think on this before inviting any more of your 'friends'.;[];;[7545];[7543];yav47_suvam;
The Trandoshans, they can be... impulsive sometimes. They mean well, though, really they do. The new ones have just been getting greedy is all...;[];;[7546];[7544];yav47_suvam;
Still, at least I ended up in one piece, right?;[];;[7547];[7545];yav47_suvam;
Here, I'll let you look at some of the stuff I was saving for them. I'm definitely not going to give this to them now!;[];;[];[7546];yav47_suvam;
I'm just going to be leaving now.;[];;[7549];[7526, 7523];yav47_suvam;
A friend, Suvam? You try to hire others to reneg on our deal?;[];;[7550];[7548];yav47_suvam;
Our deal? You're the ones trying to break our deal!;[];;[7543];[7549];yav47_suvam;
Leave. I'm not going to tell you a second time.;[];;[7528];[7523];yav47_suvam;
I represent the Exchange.;[];;[7553];[7523];yav47_suvam;
The Exchange has no power over us, human! Our business is with Suvam alone.;[];;[7554];[7552];yav47_suvam;
We'll be back, Suvam!;[];;[7532];[7553];yav47_suvam;
It's a lot better seeing you than those Trandoshans again. There anything I can do for you now, though?;[];second lot - subsequent conversations;[7278, 7313, 7314, 7317, 7330, 7335, 7340];[None];yav47_suvam;

I appreciate your help and all, but there's no way I can fight an army of those lizards, not even with your help.;[];;[7558, 7562, 7563, 7568, 7570, 7573];[7556];yav47_suvam;
Where will you go?;[];;[7559];[7557];yav47_suvam;
Hm... I don't rightly know, yet. I was thinking of maybe looking up some of my old Baragwin friends... if any of them are still alive.;[];;[7560];[7558, 7562];yav47_suvam;
I managed to scavenge enough pieces to fit my ship out with a hyperspace drive, so I'll spend some time trying to find them on my own I think.;[];;[7561];[7559, 7572];yav47_suvam;
Now... what can I do for you?;[];;[7278, 7313, 7314, 7317, 7330, 7332, 7335, 7340];[7560, 7569];yav47_suvam;
What are you going to do?;[];;[7559];[7557];yav47_suvam;
Good riddance!;[];;[7564];[7557];yav47_suvam;
Eh? That's the kind of gratitude I get? Well, I should have expected it from you...;[];;[7565];[7563];yav47_suvam;
I don't know how much longer I'll be here, so if you come around again and I'm gone, don't come looking.;[];;[7566];[7564];yav47_suvam;
Hah! And don't expect me to leave all the good stuff lying around the place either. It's coming with me.;[];;[7567];[7565];yav47_suvam;
If there's anything you want, now's the time to buy it 'cause there's no guarantee it'll be here next time.;[];;[7367, 7370, 7371];[7566];yav47_suvam;
Is there anything I can do to help?;[];;[7569];[7557];yav47_suvam;
No, no, I'll be fine on my own. There's nothing that can be done sometimes, and I think I should move on anyway. This place is getting too old.;[];;[7561];[7568];yav47_suvam;
[Persuade] I'll look after your inventions for you.;[];;[7571];[7557];yav47_suvam;

Thank you for your help, at least. I know I couldn't have taken them on my own.;[];;[7578];[7576];yav47_suvam;
I'll let you look at my special stash. It's the stuff I wasn't showing them. It won't be cheap, but if you want it, you can buy it.;[];;[];[7577];yav47_suvam;

[Persuade] Tell me what I want to know and I'll tell Davik how pleased I was with your performance.;[];;[7621, 7649];[7619, 7651];tar08_davslav82;
[Success] Praise from the guests is a valuable commodity here. Davik rewards the slaves who perform their duties well. I will tell you what I know.;[];;[7622];[7620];tar08_davslav82;NM08AADAVS10011_.mp3
Davik rarely lets us leave the slave quarters. We only know what we hear from Davik's guests. Recently they've all been talking about poor Hudrow.;[];;[7623];[7621, 7640, 7654, 7653];tar08_davslav82;NM08AADAVS10021_.mp3
He was caught trying to steal some spice from the lab. Normally Hudrow is allowed to get away with things like that because he's Davik's personal pilot for the Ebon Hawk.;[];;[7624];[7622];tar08_davslav82;NM08AADAVS10023_.mp3
But since the Sith have grounded every ship on the planet, Hudrow doesn't get anymore special treatment. They've locked him up in Davik's torture chambers.;[];;[7625, 7636, 7647];[7623];tar08_davslav82;NM08AADAVS10025_.mp3
Where is the torture chamber?;[];;[7626];[7624];tar08_davslav82;
I think you can get there through the hall behind the west door of Davik's throne room. Just keep going west from the slave quarters and you'll see the throne room.;[];;[7627];[7625, 7648];tar08_davslav82;NM08AADAVS10027_.mp3
But Davik's certain to have guards patrolling the area. If you leave the guest wing, they'll shoot you on sight. Please - I don't know anything else.;[];;[7628, 7636];[7626];tar08_davslav82;NM08AADAVS10029_.mp3

Thank you, kind sir. I hope you will express your appreciation to Davik. He often rewards those slaves who perform their duties well. Is there anything else you require?;[];;[7618, 7628, 7634, 7636];[7632];tar08_davslav82;NM08AADAVS10048_.mp3

I don't want to get you in trouble. Don't worry, I won't say anything.;[];;[7642];[7638];tar08_davslav82;

I'm telling Davik you're the worst slave I've ever seen!;[];;[7644];[7638];tar08_davslav82;
As... as you wish, master. It will not be the first time I have been punished by Davik.;[];;[7642];[7643];tar08_davslav82;NM08AADAVS10056_.mp3
That was pathetic!;[];;[7638];[7631];tar08_davslav82;

[Failure] I'm sorry, master, but the risk is too great. Davik will have me flayed alive if he finds out. Is there something else I may do to please you?;[];;[7628, 7636, 7650, 7652];[7620];tar08_davslav82;NM08AADAVS10013_.mp3
Maybe 50 credits will get you talking.;[];;[7651];[7649, 7619];tar08_davslav82;
"[Failure] I won't betray Davik's secrets for credits; they are of no use to a slave. Is there something else I can do for you?";[];;[7620, 7628, 7636, 7652];[7650];tar08_davslav82;NM08AADAVS10015_.mp3
Either you start talking, or I start blasting random body parts.;[];;[7653];[7651, 7649, 7619];tar08_davslav82;
Please don't hurt me! I'll... I'll tell you everything I know. I only pray Davik doesn't find out, or my life will end in terrible agony.;[];;[7622, 7654];[7652];tar08_davslav82;NM08AADAVS10017_.mp3
There's no need to threaten these poor women. It's not their fault their life is like this.;[];;[7622];[7653];tar08_davslav82;NM08AADAVS10019_.mp3
I greet you once more, master. How may this humble servant be of use to you?;[];;[7618, 7628, 7636];[None];tar08_davslav82;NM08AADAVS10067_.mp3
Ah so you managed to come after all. I see you brought friends.;[];;[7657];[None];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08000_.mp3
You brought some of your own as well.;[];;[7658];[7656, 12238];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08001_.mp3
Ha! Indeed I did. I foresaw that you might need help so I arranged a distraction.;[];;[7659, 7720, 7721];[7657];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08002_.mp3
I came by my own will.;[];;[7660];[7658];k_hjagi_dialog;
I do not need to hear your excuses, Jedi! I know why he brought you!;[];;[7661];[7659, 7720];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08004_.mp3
Enough of this talk, Jagi! Let us do what we came here to do.;[];;[7662, 7664, 7718];[7660, 7722];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08005_.mp3
Let's do it, Canderous.;[];;[7663];[7661];k_hjagi_dialog;
And you shall all die!;[];;[];[7662, 7713, 7717];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08007_.mp3
I think you both need to calm down.;[];;[7665];[7661];k_hjagi_dialog;
We both know the stakes here, and we both know what we must do. It is only in death that this can end.;[];;[7666];[7664];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08009_.mp3
This is a matter of honor. I cannot stand by this insult. I must do this.;[];;[7667, 7714, 7717];[7665, 7719];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08012_.mp3
Why do you need to fight him, Canderous?;[];;[7668];[7666];k_hjagi_dialog;
He has slandered me and questioned my honor. Among the Mandalore, many have died for much lesser insults.;[];;[7669];[7667];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08014_.mp3
I speak truth! And honor is the question here! The deaths of my comrades, your warriors, is a debt in blood that can only be paid by you.;[];;[7670];[7668];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08015_.mp3
When you saw prospects for glory, you abandoned the plan and left us to die surrounded by enemies!;[];;[7671];[7669];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08016_.mp3
If I had not attacked when I did, the battle would not have been won so easily!;[];;[7672];[7670, 7716];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08020_.mp3
It would still have been won! You sent your own men to die there Canderous. I cannot forgive you for what you did to us! You will pay!;[];;[7673];[7671];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08021_.mp3
That's not the way it happened...;[];;[7674, 7712, 7713];[7672];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08022_.mp3
You sent your own men to die, Canderous?;[];;[7675];[7673];k_hjagi_dialog;
The Althiri were fighting hard. I saw a break in their defenses that left their center exposed. I had to take the chance.;[];;[7676];[7674, 7712];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08024_.mp3
If I had not done what I did, many more warriors would have died and the battle would have taken much longer. I stand by my decision.;[];;[7677];[7675];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08025_.mp3
You coward! You glory hunter! You were given direct orders and were part of a plan! You had a responsibility to us!;[];;[7678];[7676];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08026_.mp3
I... I can regret their loss, but it was necessary.;[];;[7679, 7681, 7702, 7705];[7677];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08027_.mp3
Then let's get rid of Jagi and his men.;[];;[7680];[7678];k_hjagi_dialog;
You shall all die!;[]; all attack;[];[7679];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08029_.mp3
[Persuade] Jagi, what he did was a smart tactical move.;[];;[7682, 7700];[7678];k_hjagi_dialog;
He left us to die when his responsibility was to us! Instead he went hunting more glory for himsefl!;[];;[7683, 7694, 7696];[7681];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08031_.mp3
He may have saved other lives by doing what he did.;[];;[7684];[7682, 7703];k_hjagi_dialog;
He cost us ours! But... but I do see you point...;[];;[7685];[7683];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08036_.mp3
But... Why did you have to leave us there to die while you chased glory somewhere else?;[];;[7686];[7684, 7695];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08037_.mp3
I saw a chance and had to take it. It ended the battle quicker than we would have otherwise, and many of our warriors may have died.;[];;[7687];[7685];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08038_.mp3
Mandalore taught us that opportunism and flexibility in battle were to be admired. You may contradict me, but do you contradict him as well?;[];;[7688];[7686];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08039_.mp3
No! I... I... I see that I have been wrong. I have not been true to the teachings of Mandalore.;[];;[7689];[7687];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08040_.mp3
You were right. I was wrong to question your honor. But I must now cleanse mine with my life.;[];;[7690, 7692, 7693];[7688];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08041_.mp3
No!;[];;[7691];[7689];k_hjagi_dialog;
And so it shall be.;[];;[];[7690, 7692, 7693];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08043_.mp3
You do not have to do this!;[];;[7691];[7689];k_hjagi_dialog;
Good riddance!;[];;[7691];[7689];k_hjagi_dialog;
He was trying to end it quickly.;[];;[7695];[7682, 7703];k_hjagi_dialog;
At the cost of our lives? He may have saved others in the long run, but... but...;[];;[7685];[7694];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08047_.mp3
Maybe he shouldn't have left you.;[];;[7697];[7682];k_hjagi_dialog;
I saw my chance to end the battle quickly and I took it. I regret the men I lost, but it was necessary.;[];;[7698];[7696, 7704];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08049_.mp3
Then you know we must end this now.;[];;[7699];[7697];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08050_.mp3
We must.;[];;[];[7698];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08051_.mp3
I have had enough of your prattle, Jedi! This is between Canderous and I.;[];;[7701];[7681, 7702];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08052_.mp3
And we shall settle this now once and for all.;[];;[];[7700];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08053_.mp3
[Persuade] People die in war, Jagi.;[];;[7700, 7703];[7678];k_hjagi_dialog;
They do... I know that, but he did not have to abandon us! He should have stayed with the plan!;[];;[7683, 7694, 7704];[7702];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08034_.mp3
He probably should have.;[];;[7697];[7703];k_hjagi_dialog;
[Force Persuade] You do not want to fight, Jagi.;[];;[7706, 7710];[7678];k_hjagi_dialog;
[Success] Yes... I... do not want to fight...;[];;[7707];[7705];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08055_.mp3
No! Do not alter his mind to defend me! I can fight my own battles without your help!;[];;[7708];[7706];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08056_.mp3
You... Wha? You tried to manipulate my mind with your devious Jedi powers! I cannot tolerate any interference!;[];;[7709];[7707];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08057_.mp3
You shall die for that, Jedi!;[];;[];[7708];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08058_.mp3
[Failure] Don't try you mind tricks on me! A true Mandalore is too strong for that!;[];;[7711];[7705];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08059_.mp3
And now you shall die for the attempt!;[];;[];[7710];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08060_.mp3
Why did you abandon them?;[];;[7675];[7673];k_hjagi_dialog;
I've had enough, let's kill him.;[];;[7663];[7673];k_hjagi_dialog;
Why do you need to fight Canderous, Jagi?;[];;[7715];[7666];k_hjagi_dialog;
In the battle above the world of Althir, he ordered us to attack the enemy flank, promising us support.;[];;[7716];[7714];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08018_.mp3
But when he saw better prospects for his own glory, he abandoned us and left us to die surrounded by enemies!;[];;[7671];[7715];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08019_.mp3
Let's kill him then.;[];;[7663];[7666];k_hjagi_dialog;
Both of you are acting like children!;[];;[7719];[7661];k_hjagi_dialog;
Yes, but children who can... er... what?! You do not know what you're talking about, Jedi!;[];;[7666];[7718];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08011_.mp3
Canderous works for me.;[];;[7660];[7658];k_hjagi_dialog;
You talk too much and do little.;[];;[7722];[7658];k_hjagi_dialog;
Big words from such a small human. But I know why he brought you here, and you shall regret his choice!;[];;[7661];[7721];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08066_.mp3
[This man appears to be looking for someone... maybe even one of your companions back on the Ebon Hawk.];[];;[];[None];k_hjagi_dialog;
Ah, so we meet again, Canderous. It has been quite a long time.;[];;[7725];[None];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08067_.mp3
Jagi??;[];;[7726, 7748, 7749];[7724, 12240];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08068_.mp3
Do you know him, Canderous?;[];;[7727];[7725, 7752];k_hjagi_dialog;
He... he was a warrior under my command up to the battle of Althir. But I thought...;[];;[7728];[7726, 7748];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08070_.mp3
You thought I was dead, didn't you! You thought all of us that you had sent on that attack had perished!;[];;[7729];[7727];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08071_.mp3
You sent us to die in a foolish attack while you directed your forces elsewhere!;[];;[7730];[7728];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08072_.mp3
You broke from the battle plan and let us die for it, so that you could have the 'honor' of being the first to the enemy commander!;[];;[7731, 7744, 7746];[7729];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08073_.mp3
Is this true, Canderous?;[];;[7732];[7730];k_hjagi_dialog;
I... I did what was prudent at the time. If I had not done it, the battle would have....;[];;[7733];[7731, 7745, 7747];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08075_.mp3
The battle would have been won anyway! I am tired of your excuses, Canderous.;[];;[7734];[7732];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08076_.mp3
I have spent years tracking you down since the clans were banished, and I will not rest until I have had my vengeance!;[];;[7735, 7742];[7733];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08077_.mp3
What are you going to do?;[];;[7736];[7734];k_hjagi_dialog;
I challenge you Canderous. I challenge you to fight the fight you fled that day above Althir.;[];;[7737];[7735, 7743];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08079_.mp3
In the dune seas of Tatooine, I will be waiting for you. I have spread the news of the challenge since I learned you had landed on this world.;[];;[7738];[7736];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08080_.mp3
All the surviving Mandalorian clans know of what I do here, and that we shall meet on Tatooine to settle this debt of vengeance once and for all.;[];;[7739];[7737];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08081_.mp3
If you fail to meet me there, you shall be stripped of all honor and forever cast out of our society!;[];;[7740];[7738];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08082_.mp3
It will be you and me alone in the dune seas of Tatooine: a final battle that can only end in death.;[];;[7741];[7739];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08083_.mp3
I shall be waiting for you there, Canderous.;[];;[];[7740];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08084_.mp3
If you face Canderous, you face me as well!;[];;[7743];[7734];k_hjagi_dialog;
I am not afraid of you. And if you choose, you can die by his side as well!;[];;[7736];[7742];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08086_.mp3
Tough decisions are made in war.;[];;[7745];[7730];k_hjagi_dialog;
That does not excuse what he did to us!;[];;[7732];[7744];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08088_.mp3
You lived.;[];;[7747];[7730];k_hjagi_dialog;
I alone realized what was happening and managed to escape the trap before it closed. The trap he set for his own men!;[];;[7732];[7746];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08090_.mp3
Who is this guy?;[];;[7727];[7725, 7752];k_hjagi_dialog;
Get out of our way!;[];;[7750];[7725];k_hjagi_dialog;
I have business with Canderous that does not concern you, Jedi.;[];;[7751];[7749];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08093_.mp3
This concerns my employer as well.;[];;[7752];[7750];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08094_.mp3
Employer? You've sunk that low, have you? So much for the vaunted Mandalorian honor you used to espouse.;[];;[7726, 7748];[7751];k_hjagi_dialog;NM13AAJAGI08095_.mp3

Revan. Somehow I knew we would meet again. Even when you vanished, I knew you would not forget the vow you swore to me.;[];;[7782];[None];unk43_theone;
And when my scouts told me of a great warrior from the sky slaughtering our raiding parties with mysterious powers and magics, I knew you had at last returned!;[];;[7783, 7879, 7880];[7781];unk43_theone;
I have no clue what you are talking about.;[];;[7784];[7782];unk43_theone;
"Your words are confusing. I recognize you: you are the one called Revan. You are the one who came here before; you and Malak, the one who served you.";[];;[7785];[7783, 7879, 7880];unk43_theone;
You promised to slay our enemy. In exchange for our aid you swore to destroy the Elders and bring us their secrets. Are you saying this means nothing to you now?;[{'The One': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[7786, 7878];[7784];unk43_theone;
My mind was destroyed. My memories were lost.;[];;[7787];[7785];unk43_theone;
I believe you, Revan. I sense there is something different about you. Something that has changed. You are not the same as you were before.;[];;[7788];[7786, 7878];unk43_theone;
Yet the power of magic - what you call the Force - is within you still. You can still destroy the Elders and fulfill your vow!;[];;[7789, 7833, 7877];[7787];unk43_theone;
The Elders are dead. I killed them myself.;[];;[7790];[7788, 7836, 7844, 7848, 7851, 7855, 7860, 7863];unk43_theone;
Dead? Is this why you returned, Revan? To tell us that you have fulfilled your oath? If this is true, then there is something I must ask you.;[];;[7791];[7789];unk43_theone;
There was one prisoner, an Elder who's mind broke beneath our tortures. He raved of ancient rituals, of lost power and forgotten secrets! Unfortunately, most of his dying screams made no sense.;[];;[7792];[7790, 7867, 7868];unk43_theone;
"Yet in his last hours he spoke of a book; an ancient tome that recorded the most powerful knowledge of the Elders, and detailed the rituals that could unleash the secrets.";[];;[7793];[7791];unk43_theone;
I am certain this ancient tome will allow me to unleash what has, for so long, been hidden by the Elders. Bring me this book and I will use the knowledge within it to help you enter the Temple.;[];;[7794, 7827, 7829, 7830];[7792];unk43_theone;
Here is the ancient tome.;[];;[7795];[7793, 7889, 7892];unk43_theone;
Well done, Revan. But before I will consider your oath fulfilled, I must study this tome. I must see if it truly contains the ancient knowledge I seek.;[];;[7796];[7794];unk43_theone;
I will have the guards escort you back here once we have studied the contents of the manuscript you have brought us.;[];;[7797];[7795];unk43_theone;
I have studied this tome, Revan. Much of it is beyond me, it speaks often of 'technology' - a form of magic I do not comprehend. But one thing has become clear to me:;[];;[7798];[7796];unk43_theone;
This tome does not hold the great secrets I was hoping for. Although it contains many rituals, only one appears to be of any real consequence.;[];;[7799, 7826];[7797];unk43_theone;
That's not my problem! We had a deal!;[];;[7800];[7798];unk43_theone;
All is not lost, Revan. After studying this book I have come to understand that even the Elders themselves did not actually possess the ancient secrets. They were only the guardians.;[];;[7801];[7799, 7826];unk43_theone;
The knowledge of magic and power is locked away within the Temple itself. And this book is the key to the Temple, for only the rituals in this tome can lower the shields protecting it.;[];;[7802, 7824];[7800];unk43_theone;
So now you know how to get inside the Temple?;[];;[7803];[7801];unk43_theone;
I now have the rituals to lower the shields, but the Temple is guarded by yet another barrier. Only those with powerful magic - what you call the Force - can pass through the entrance.;[];;[7804];[7802, 7825];unk43_theone;
None among my tribe - or perhaps none among any of the Rakata - has this power. Only you can enter the Temple, Revan. But you cannot do it without our help.;[];;[7805];[7803];unk43_theone;
You can pass the barrier at the entrance, but you cannot get past the shield that surrounds the Temple. Only the ancient ritual, performed by those of pure Rakata blood, can lower the shield.;[];;[7806, 7823];[7804];unk43_theone;
Looks like we still need each other.;[];;[7807];[7805];unk43_theone;
Yes. You brought this tome to me as you promised. Now I must trust you again. We will help you enter the Temple, and in exchange you will bring forth the great secrets within.;[];;[7808];[7806, 7823];unk43_theone;
My priests can prepare and perform the ritual whenever you are ready, Revan. But in accordance with the traditions within the ritual tome, you must enter the Temple alone.;[];;[7809, 7822];[7807];unk43_theone;
Why do I have to go in alone?;[];;[7810];[7808];unk43_theone;
The Temple is a sacred place to the Rakata, its power is bound in ritual and tradition. I have studied the ritual closely.;[];;[7811];[7809, 7822];unk43_theone;
"It is forbidden for more than one to enter the Temple at a time. This is one of the sacred traditions of our ancestors; I will not permit you to defile it.";[];;[7812, 7819];[7810];unk43_theone;
I will go into the Temple alone.;[];;[7813];[7811, 7820];unk43_theone;
If you are ready to enter the Temple, we can begin the ritual immediately.;[];;[7814, 7816];[7812, 7821];unk43_theone;
I'm ready to enter the Temple now.;[];;[7815];[7813, 7888];unk43_theone;
Remember: in accordance with ancient Rakata tradition you must enter the Temple alone. My priests will meet you at the shield's edge to perform the ritual.;[];;[];[7814];unk43_theone;
No, I'm not ready yet.;[];;[7817];[7813, 7888];unk43_theone;
As you wish. Come speak to me and when you are ready to enter the Temple and I will have my priests perform the ritual.;[];;[7818];[7816];unk43_theone;
But remember: when the time comes you must enter the Temple alone, in accordance with the traditions of the ancient Rakata.;[];;[];[7817];unk43_theone;
Forget it! I'll find my own way into the Temple.;[];;[7820];[7811];unk43_theone;
You have the power to enter the Temple itself, but you cannot lower the energy shields the Elders built around it. Only a Rakata can invoke the ritual chant with the proper intonation.;[];;[7812, 7821];[7819];unk43_theone;
I see I have no choice. Okay, I'll go into the Temple alone.;[];;[7813];[7820];unk43_theone;
I'm not going into the Temple without help!;[];;[7810];[7808];unk43_theone;
So you will help me enter the Temple?;[];;[7807];[7805];unk43_theone;
You better not be looking to double-cross me here!;[];;[7825];[7801];unk43_theone;
I will honor our agreement, Revan. There is little reason for me to betray you, in any case.;[];;[7803];[7824];unk43_theone;
That was the only tome I found in the Elder's compound.;[];;[7800];[7798];unk43_theone;
I'll be back when I get that book.;[];;[7828];[7793, 7892, 7889, 7893];unk43_theone;
When you have it, bring it here to me. Until then, you may move freely about our village. I will be waiting for your return.;[];;[];[7827, 7829];unk43_theone;
[Lie] Don't worry. I will slay the Elders and honor our deal.;[];;[7828];[7793, 7892, 7893];unk43_theone;
Forget it. I'll never help you against the Elders!;[];;[7831];[7793, 7860, 7855, 7851, 7848, 7892, 7893];unk43_theone;
You refuse to help us? Is that why you returned, Revan? To tell us you have broken your vow?;[];;[7832];[7830];unk43_theone;
No one defies the will of the One, Revan - not even you! My war beasts will destroy you, and the tribe will feast on your bones!;[];;[];[7831];unk43_theone;
You can't force me to kill your enemies!;[];;[7834];[7788];unk43_theone;
Force you? No, Revan - we were allies working to a common goal! It was you who suggested we forge our alliance.;[];;[7835];[7833];unk43_theone;
You vowed to kill the Elders and bring us the secret knowledge they protect. In exchange, we promised to use this lost knowledge to help you enter the Temple of the Ancients.;[];;[7836];[7834, 7877];unk43_theone;
When you vanished, we thought you had forgotten us - or been killed by the Elders. Now that you have returned our alliance still holds: destroy the Elders, and we will help you.;[];;[7789, 7837, 7874, 7876];[7835];unk43_theone;
Temple of the Ancients? I still don't remember anything.;[];;[7838];[7836];unk43_theone;
I suppose that if what you say is true - that you cannot remember when you were last here - then you must have many questions. Very well, Revan.;[];;[7839];[7837, 7876];unk43_theone;
I will help you to understand. And then you will destroy the Elders tribe and fulfill the oath you swore to us long ago.;[];;[7840, 7872];[7838, 7875];unk43_theone;
You should probably start with the last time I was here.;[];;[7841];[7839];unk43_theone;
You arrived with Malak - your servant - three of your galactic standard years ago. My scouts saw your sky ship plummet to the earth and they went to loot the crash site.;[];;[7842];[7840, 7873];unk43_theone;
They tried to take you prisoner, but you unleashed your magic - what you called the Force - upon them. Seeing your power they bowed before you and brought you here to me.;[];;[7843];[7841];unk43_theone;
You used your power to rip the Rakata language from my mind, even as you drove Basic into our skulls so we could help you in your quest to find something called the 'Star Forge'.;[];;[7844];[7842];unk43_theone;
But the answers you sought lay within the Temple of the Ancients, and we could not help you enter the Temple. The Elders alone hold its secrets, guarding them with their very lives.;[];;[7789, 7845, 7849, 7852, 7856, 7861, 7869, 7870];[7843];unk43_theone;
You say my ship crashed. Was it because of the disruptor field?;[];;[7846];[7844, 7855, 7860, 7851];unk43_theone;
"I know nothing of this disruptor field, but throughout the history of our tribe ships have fallen from the sky. It has always been this way; though in recent generations it has become more frequent.";[];;[7847];[7845];unk43_theone;
We have little understanding of such magic to make metal fly, but my scouts rush to take whatever we can carry from the crash sites in the hopes we may one day unlock these secrets.;[];;[7848];[7846];unk43_theone;
This was how we acquired our rancor war beasts. Several very young specimens were recovered from a crashed vessel. We raised them to adulthood, training and breeding them to be loyal beasts of war.;[];;[7789, 7830, 7849, 7852, 7856, 7861, 7869, 7870];[7847];unk43_theone;
I need parts to repair my ship.;[];;[7850];[7848, 7860, 7855, 7844];unk43_theone;
That I cannot help you with. Although we have recovered many strange devices from the sky ships that crash to the earth, their use is a mystery to us.;[];;[7851];[7849];unk43_theone;
As a show of good faith, I will allow you to search the stores of our tribe, and take whatever you find. In exchange, I know you will destroy the Elders and bring the secrets they guard back to me.;[];;[7789, 7830, 7845, 7852, 7856, 7861, 7869, 7870];[7850];unk43_theone;
Tell me about the Temple of the Ancients.;[];;[7853];[7851, 7860, 7848, 7844];unk43_theone;
There is little I can tell you about the Temple. I know the secrets of our ancestors are contained within, but the Temple itself is barred to us.;[];;[7854];[7852];unk43_theone;
When last you were here, you and Malak sought to enter the Temple. You sought ancient knowledge and a way to escape this world within its stone walls.;[];;[7855];[7853];unk43_theone;
But only the Elders know how to bypass the barrier that surrounds it. Destroy them and bring back their secrets to us, and we will help you enter the Temple. That was our agreement.;[];;[7789, 7830, 7845, 7849, 7856, 7861, 7869, 7870];[7854];unk43_theone;
Tell me more about the Elders.;[];;[7857];[7855, 7851, 7848, 7844];unk43_theone;
"The Elders guard the ancient secrets. Within their compound is the knowledge of power and magic; including the knowledge of how to enter the Temple itself.";[];;[7858];[7856];unk43_theone;
I have lost many warriors storming the gates of their compound, but they use weapons of light and fire against us, and not even our war beasts are strong enough to breach their defenses.;[];;[7859];[7857];unk43_theone;
Sometimes we can capture an Elder when they venture forth from their compound, and we have learned something about them. That is how we know they guard the ancient secrets.;[];;[7860];[7858];unk43_theone;
But no matter what tortures we inflict upon them, they will not reveal their secrets to us. They fear the knowledge they themselves guard, and they will never willingly surrender it to us.;[];;[7789, 7830, 7845, 7849, 7852, 7861, 7869, 7870];[7859];unk43_theone;
I don't see any other choice, so I'll help you.;[];;[7862];[7860, 7855, 7851, 7848, 7844];unk43_theone;
The compound of the Elders is to the south, beyond the Temple of the Ancients. From torturing the few Elders we have captured, we know something of what lies beyond the gates.;[];;[7863];[7861, 7869, 7871];unk43_theone;
The Elders are few in number. If you can get past the exterior defenses, you could surely slaughter them all. Then you can bring us back the knowledge they guard.;[];;[7789, 7864, 7868];[7862];unk43_theone;
So where is this information? Is it in some kind of computer?;[];;[7865];[7863];unk43_theone;
Computer? That is a word our prisoners have used. When we forced them to explain it to us, they said this 'computer' was some type of thinking machine. More magic we cannot understand.;[];;[7866];[7864];unk43_theone;
Before they died, some prisoners did speak of such a machine inside their compound. But I do not believe it has anything to do with the secrets they are trying to protect.;[];;[7867, 7868];[7865];unk43_theone;
Why do you think that?;[];;[7791];[7866];unk43_theone;
If I kill the Elders, how can I bring you their secrets?;[];;[7791];[7866, 7863];unk43_theone;
I'll be back after I kill the Elders.;[];;[7862];[7860, 7855, 7851, 7848, 7844];unk43_theone;
[Persuade/Lie] I will kill the Elders and bring you their secrets!;[];;[7871];[7860, 7855, 7851, 7848, 7844];unk43_theone;
[Success] I see you that you have changed much since our last meeting. I am confident you will not betray us this time.;[];;[7862];[7870];unk43_theone;
I'm going to need some information if you want me to succeed.;[];;[7873];[7839];unk43_theone;
Yes, I suppose that is true. I will start at the beginning, with our first meeting.;[];;[7841];[7872];unk43_theone;
[Persuade/Lie] I'll help you, but you have to answer my questions first.;[];;[7875];[7836];unk43_theone;
[Success] I suppose that if what you say is true - that you cannot remember when you were last here - then you must have many questions. Very well, Revan.;[];;[7839];[7874];unk43_theone;
I will help you, but first you must answer my questions.;[];;[7838];[7836];unk43_theone;
What was this vow, exactly?;[];;[7835];[7788];unk43_theone;
I'm sorry, but I don't remember any of this.;[];;[7787];[7785];unk43_theone;
I'm not Revan anymore. That part of me is gone. I'm <FullName> now.;[];;[7784];[7782];unk43_theone;
Vow? I don't remember any vow.;[];;[7784];[7782];unk43_theone;
You have entered the Temple, Revan. You have seen the great secrets of the Ancients. Now you must fulfill your oath and share these secrets with me, Revan.;[];;[7882, 7885, 7887];[None];unk43_theone;
You are a fool! I only used you to get into the Temple!;[];;[7883];[7881];unk43_theone;
And so you have betrayed us, Revan - just as you did the last time you were here.;[];;[7884];[7882];unk43_theone;
But this time you will not be allowed to escape with the knowledge that is rightfully mine, Revan! My war beasts will destroy you!;[];;[];[7883, 7886];unk43_theone;
The information you wanted was all on computers. You couldn't use it.;[];;[7886];[7881];unk43_theone;
Do you take me for a fool, Revan? You are hoarding the secrets for yourself! You will leave us and forget about us, just as you did the last time you were here.;[];;[7884];[7885, 7887];unk43_theone;
[Lie] I don't have the secrets on me, but I'll get them for you soon.;[];;[7886];[7881];unk43_theone;
You have returned. Do you wish to enter the temple now?;[];;[7814, 7816];[None];unk43_theone;
My scouts have reported a great battle in the compound of the Elders. Tell me, Revan - in your slaughter did you find the book recording the great secrets of the past?;[];;[7794, 7827, 7890];[None];unk43_theone;
I want to ask you some questions.;[];;[7891];[7889, 7893];unk43_theone;
I am the One, warrior-chieftain of this tribe. Answering questions is the work of Gjarshi, our Loremaster. Seek him out if you wish to know of our tribe.;[];;[7892];[7890];unk43_theone;
But I will answer no more questions. The time for questions is done: now you must fulfill your promise. Slay the Elders and bring us their secrets. This is the will of the One.;[];;[7794, 7827, 7829, 7830];[7891];unk43_theone;
I have given you free reign within our camp, Revan. Take whatever supplies you may need from our caches, if you think it will help you destroy the Elders and recover the ancient tome.;[];;[7827, 7829, 7830, 7890];[None];unk43_theone;
Enough talking. I think I'll just kill you now!;[];;[7895];[None];unk43_theone;
Then we shall feast upon your flesh, Revan!;[];;[];[7894];unk43_theone;

Translation: Doubtful. The Jawa language is structured in an odd manner. You are lucky to understand what you do.;[];;[7902, 7905, 7918, 7919];[7900];tat17_07jawag_01;NM17AF07JA05006_.mp3

Hmm. These Jawas sure aren't the trusting type, are they?;[];;[7909, 7912];[7907];tat17_07jawag_01;NM17AF07JA05023_.mp3

Explode? Are...are you crazy? Why would we risk riding that thing, then?;[];;[7945];[7943];tar10_kandon01;NM10ACKAND01013_.mp3
That's part of the reason Brejik installed it on your bike - none of our Vulkar riders are willing to risk their lives to win the prize. They're afraid of getting blown to bits.;[];;[7946, 7949, 7953];[7944, 7943];tar10_kandon01;
Why do you think I'm willing to risk my life?;[];;[7947];[7945];tar10_kandon01;
You've already gone to a great deal of trouble to get your hands on this Bastila. You want this Republic soldier in your possession for some reason.;[];;[7948];[7946];tar10_kandon01;
I don't know why - I really don't care. But I get the feeling you're willing to risk dying on the swoop bike if that's what it takes to get her.;[];;[7949, 7953];[7947];tar10_kandon01;
I'm not afraid to ride that bike!;[];;[7950];[7948, 7945];tar10_kandon01;
I'm glad to see you're being reasonable. The race is tomorrow, so I'm afraid you won't have time to practice. But nobody will be able to keep up with your modified swoop.;[];;[7951];[7949, 7953];tar10_kandon01;
All you have to do is hold on tight, try not to smash into anything, and hope the accelerator doesn't explode. Simple.;[];;[7952];[7950];tar10_kandon01;
Get some rest and I'll come for you in the morning to take you to the swoop track. Good luck... you're going to need it.;[];;[];[7951];tar10_kandon01;
I guess I don't have any choice. I'll race for the Vulkars.;[];;[7950];[7948, 7945];tar10_kandon01;
Okay, let's do this.;[];;[7943];[7941];tar10_kandon01;
I've changed my mind - I'm not racing for you!;[];;[7956];[7941];tar10_kandon01;
Who will sponsor you then, the Beks? I'm sure they'd love to back the assassin who killed their beloved leader. No, I think you'll race for us - you don't have any other options.;[];;[7943];[7955];tar10_kandon01;
Gadon died screaming like a skinned ronto. So will you if you don't hand over Bastila right now!;[];;[7958];[7936];tar10_kandon01;
Don't do anything foolish. If you attack me then you'll lose any chance of ever getting your hands on that girl. Besides, we had a deal, remember?;[];;[7938];[7957];tar10_kandon01;
Looks like we have visitors - lackeys conned by Gadon Thek into trying to steal Brejik's swoop engine accelerator, I bet!;[];Will initiate on sight with the party. Two possible outcomes: 1. Party refuses offer, they fight, Kandon dead. 2. Party accepts offer, Kandon gives them access codes to Bek elevators, party is moved outside Vulkar base into Lower City main entrance. If they come back, Kandon is not in the area.;[7960, 7961, 8002];[None];tar10_kandon01;
Brejik stole that engine from Gadon! It was never yours to begin with!;[];;[7961];[7959];tar10_kandon01;NM10ACKAND01036_.mp3
Well I didn't go to all the trouble of acquiring this prototype just so you could steal it back for that old fool!;[];;[7962];[7960, 8002, 7959];tar10_kandon01;
Would you like me to dispose of these Bek spies, Kandon?;[];;[7963];[7961];tar10_kandon01;
No - hold on a second. I see you aren't wearing the Hidden Bek colors, so I'm guessing you aren't part of that feeble old man's gang. You must be a freelance mercenary.;[];;[7964, 8001];[7962];tar10_kandon01;
You're right, I'm not one of the Beks. My name's <FullName>.;[];;[7965];[7963];tar10_kandon01;
Instead of stealing the prototype for the Beks, why don't you come work for us? The Black Vulkars could use someone like you.;[];;[7966, 7999];[7964, 8001];tar10_kandon01;
You've got my attention. What's your offer?;[];;[7967, 7979];[7965, 8000];tar10_kandon01;
What? You can't betray Gadon! I won't let you!;[];;[7968];[7966];tar10_kandon01;NM10ACKAND01048_.mp3
Ah, Mission - the Hidden Bek's unofficial mascot! Your loyalty is admirable, but misplaced. Gadon only kept you around so they could laugh at you and your furry friend.;[];;[7969];[7967];tar10_kandon01;
No, that's not true! You're lying!;[];;[7970];[7968];tar10_kandon01;NM10ACKAND01052_.mp3
Am I? How long have you known Gadon? How long have you worked for him? But they never offered to make you a Hidden Bek, did they?;[];;[7971];[7969];tar10_kandon01;
They... they said I was too young!;[];;[7972];[7970];tar10_kandon01;NM10ACKAND01056_.mp3
And you believed them? Come on, Mission. You're smarter than that. To Gadon and his crew you were nothing but a running joke. Weren't they always teasing you?;[];;[7973];[7971];tar10_kandon01;
Well, yeah. Some of them were. But you Vulkars have tried to kill me more than once!;[];;[7974];[7972];tar10_kandon01;NM10ACKAND01060_.mp3
That's only because you were with the Hidden Beks - and because we respected you. Brejik knows you're not a joke, Mission. He made sure the Vulkars took you very, very seriously.;[];;[7975];[7973];tar10_kandon01;
But... but Gadon said Brejik...;[];;[7976];[7974];tar10_kandon01;NM10ACKAND01064_.mp3
Gadon had to poison your mind against Brejik! It was the only way to keep you from seeing the truth. The Beks were mocking you, Mission. You don't need friends like that.;[];;[7977];[7975];tar10_kandon01;
You're right! I don't need anyone but Zaalbar! If Gadon dies, he's only getting what's coming to him!;[];;[7978, 7998];[7976];tar10_kandon01;NM10ACKAND01068_.mp3
You were about to tell me your offer, Kandon.;[];;[7979];[7977];tar10_kandon01;
Brejik has grown tired of this petty war with Gadon and his pathetic followers. He needs someone to get rid of Gadon... permanently.;[];;[7980];[7978, 7966];tar10_kandon01;
If you do this task for him Brejik is willing to offer a very substantial reward. How does 500 credits sound? Oh, and we'll throw in that young Republic soldier we captured, too.;[];;[7981, 7995, 7996, 7997];[7979];tar10_kandon01;
I thought she was being offered up as the prize in the swoop race.;[];;[7982];[7980];tar10_kandon01;
Well... we can't just give the girl to you. Not after Brejik's publicly offered her up as a prize in the big swoop race. But we can do the next best thing.;[];;[7983];[7981, 7997];tar10_kandon01;
Whoever wins the swoop race gets the girl. Kill Gadon and we'll give you 500 credits, sponsor you as a Vulkar rider and equip your swoop with the accelerator. You can't lose!;[];;[7984, 7989, 7995, 7996];[7982];tar10_kandon01;
Okay, we have a deal. I'll kill Gadon for you.;[];;[7985, 7986];[7983, 7990];tar10_kandon01;
Are you sure about this? I mean, I want to get Bastila back... but taking contracts to kill people is a bit much. Even if it is just more biker scum.;[];;[7986];[7984];tar10_kandon01;NM10ACKAND01079_.mp3
Excellent. Here - you might need these for this mission. They're access codes to Gadon's private chambers in the Bek base. Without them you won't be able to get at the old man.;[];;[7987];[7985, 7984];tar10_kandon01;
My guards will escort you to the main doors of our base. After you have killed Gadon return to the main doors and I will arrange for you to ride for the Vulkars in the swoop race.;[];;[7988];[7986];tar10_kandon01;
I'd suggest you don't come back until the job is done, or we might think you've decided to renegotiate on our offer. The Vulkars won't consider you a friend until Gadon is dead.;[];;[];[7987];tar10_kandon01;
Just give me the girl now or we have no deal.;[];;[7990];[7983];tar10_kandon01;
Brejik can't withdraw his prize without losing the respect of every gang in the Lower City. Besides, she isn't even here. Brejik's keeping her somewhere safe until after the race.;[];;[7984, 7991, 7995, 7996];[7989];tar10_kandon01;
Forget it. I want Bastila up front or no deal!;[];;[7992];[7990];tar10_kandon01;
*Sigh* I can see there's not much chance of convincing you to come work for us after all. Most unfortunate.;[];;[7993];[7991, 7995, 7996, 7998];tar10_kandon01;
Now can I kill them, Kandon?;[];;[7994];[7992];tar10_kandon01;
Yes, darling. Kill them. Kill them all.;[];;[];[7993];tar10_kandon01;
Forget it - I'm not going to betray Gadon!;[];;[7992];[7990, 7983, 7980, 8000];tar10_kandon01;
How about I just kill you instead?;[];;[7992];[7990, 7983, 7980, 8000];tar10_kandon01;
Brejik will let me have Bastila if I kill Gadon for him?;[];;[7982];[7980];tar10_kandon01;
Don't listen to him, Mission. He's twisting your mind!;[];;[7992];[7977];tar10_kandon01;
Forget it! I know all about you Black Vulkars!;[];;[8000];[7965];tar10_kandon01;
"Be smart; Gadon Thek is old news! He's a blind fool in more ways than one! Brejik is a visionary - soon he'll control the entire Lower City! Don't shackle yourself to a losing team.";[];;[7966, 7995, 7996];[7999];tar10_kandon01;
Enough yapping! Hand over that accelerator.;[];;[7965];[7963];tar10_kandon01;
You're talking like Brejik didn't steal that engine, himself, to begin with!;[];;[7961];[7959];tar10_kandon01;NM10ACKAND01038_.mp3
The conquering hero returns! You did a great thing winning that swoop race for us!;[];;[8004];[None];tar11_hidbek115;
Membership in the Beks is already starting to climb again. Won't be long now until we're back in control and Gadon can restore some order to the streets.;[];;[];[8003];tar11_hidbek115;
Used to be everyone wanted to join the Hidden Beks. But if the Vulkars win that swoop race I got a funny feeling a lot of our own people are going to join up with Brejik.;[];;[];[None];tar11_hidbek115;
The Vulkars aren't the first group to try and take over from the Beks. Gadon knows how to deal with these upstarts. He may be blind, but he still can see the big picture.;[];;[];[None];tar11_hidbek115;
The Vulkars are done for! Nobody will want to join them after seeing what Brejik did at the swoop race!;[];;[];[None];tar11_hidbek115;
You heard what the Vulkars are putting up as a prize to the winner of the swoop race? A captured Republic soldier! Do you know how much she'd bring on the galactic slaver market?;[];;[];[None];tar11_hidbek115;
A few of the braver villagers dared to leave the safety of the fence. They... they never returned;[];;[];[None];tar04_outman044;NM04AAOUTM17000_.mp3
Thank you! My wife was one of those banished because she had the rakghoul disease. If you hadn't cured her, I would have never seen her again!;[];;[];[None];tar04_outman044;NM04AAOUTM17001_.mp3
The rakghouls took my wife! I can only pray she is dead... I cannot bear to even think of the alternative.;[];;[];[None];tar04_outman044;NM04AAOUTM17002_.mp3
They say anyone bitten by a rakghoul will become a rakghoul themselves. It can't be true, can it? It's too horrible!;[];;[];[None];tar04_outman044;NM04AAOUTM17003_.mp3
Hey - I recognize you! You're the one who won the big swoop race!;[];;[8014];[None];tar11_hidbek114;
I can't believe what Brejik did after the race - talk about no class! But what else could you expect from a Vulkar?;[];;[];[8013];tar11_hidbek114;
The Vulkars are gaining members every day from the smaller gangs. If they win the big swoop race there's no telling how many new recruits they'll get!;[];;[];[None];tar11_hidbek114;
The Vulkars are out of control. Gang rivalry is one thing, but gunning people down in the streets is going too far! They don't even care if their victims are Beks or not!;[];;[];[None];tar11_hidbek114;
The Vulkars won't last long against us now that Brejik's out of the way. Serves him right for trying to back out on his wager!;[];;[];[None];tar11_hidbek114;
I don't deal in slaves, but that Republic soldier Brejik's offering as a prize would be worth a lot of credits to the right buyer.;[];;[];[None];tar11_hidbek114;
[The old man knows better than to engage in chit-chat with enemies so close by.];[];;[];[None];k_hjol_dialog;
[Even though he has joined your group, Jolee remains a somewhat mysterious character. Maybe you should speak to him about why he chose to come with you.];[];;[8021, 8589];[None];k_hjol_dialog;
[Speak to Jolee.];[];;[8022];[8020];k_hjol_dialog;
Got something on your mind, do you?;[];;[8023, 8084, 8135, 8189, 8244, 8311, 8349, 8427, 8499, 8540, 8545, 8552, 8566, 8572, 8580, 8585, 8587];[8021];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09001_.mp3
Why did you decide to come with me?;[];;[8024];[8022, 8571, 8579];k_hjol_dialog;
You got yourself a fast little ship. Heh. I'd forgotten what engines sounded like. The closest thing to that on Kashyyyk is an uller in mating season. Ugh! Frightful.;[];;[8025];[8023];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09050_.mp3
So you wanted a ride on my ship?;[];;[8026];[8024];k_hjol_dialog;
Or it could be for the free food. What's the gunk that comes out of the synthesizer on this bucket, anyway? Do you never clean the darned thing?;[];;[8027, 8080, 8082];[8025];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09052_.mp3
No, seriously, tell me.;[];;[8028];[8026];k_hjol_dialog;
I'm old, damn it! I'm allowed to be enigmatic when I want to be, and don't you go telling me otherwise.;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[8029];[8027];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09054_.mp3
You know, you remind me of someone else I knew ages ago. Pleasant enough fellow, great destiny... all of that. Breath like a bantha.;[];;[8030, 8076, 8078];[8028, 8081, 8083];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09055_.mp3
Did you annoy this person endlessly, too?;[];;[8031];[8029];k_hjol_dialog;
Oh ho ho, very funny. Is it my fault that some people are so easily annoyed? They're like impatient little children. With blasters.;[];;[8032];[8030];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09057_.mp3
Anyway, where was I? Oh, yes. Andor Vex, was his name. The Force swirled around him like a hurricane, that's how great his destiny was.;[];;[8033, 8072, 8074];[8031, 8077, 8079];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09058_.mp3
I never heard of him.;[];;[8034];[8032];k_hjol_dialog;
"No, you wouldn't have. Sometimes swirling Force is just swirling Force. It gets us old Jedis excited at our age so we go ""ooo, destiny!""";[];;[8035];[8033];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09060_.mp3
Well, it turned out that poor Andor believed a wee bit too much in the infallibility of that destiny. That overconfidence turned out to be his downfall.;[];;[8036, 8068, 8070];[8034, 8073, 8075];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09061_.mp3
Is there supposed to be some hidden meaning in this?;[];;[8037];[8035];k_hjol_dialog;
I don't know. Are you overconfident? I hadn't noticed. Even if I had, I would never comment on it. We're talking about Andor, remember?;[];;[8038];[8036];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09063_.mp3
Let's see... oh, yes. Andor's downfall. I was pretty young, myself, when it happened. At the time, I thought that Andor's destiny couldn't be more boring.;[];;[8039, 8064, 8066];[8037, 8069, 8071];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09064_.mp3
How young are we talking?;[];;[8040];[8038];k_hjol_dialog;
Well, let's just say that I was a strapping young lad with a full head of hair and Coruscant was a small town with a well, heh heh.;[];;[8041];[8039];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09066_.mp3
I was just about to abandon Andor to whatever the Force intended for him when his ship was overtaken by a Dimean warship.;[];;[8042];[8040, 8065, 8067];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09067_.mp3
Now, you've probably never heard of the Dimeans, but at the time they were a nasty lot led by a nastier overlord named Kraat. Tall fellow. Big teeth.;[];;[8043];[8041];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09068_.mp3
Kraat has us hauled onto the bridge of his ship for questioning, and that's when I knew that Andor's destiny was at hand.;[];;[8044, 8061, 8063];[8042];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09069_.mp3
Andor killed Kraat, I take it?;[];;[8045];[8043];k_hjol_dialog;
Of course he did! Haven't you been listening? It was not in the way you'd probably expect, though.;[];;[8046];[8044];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09071_.mp3
Well, Andor decides that his destiny makes him invulnerable and starts making all sorts of demands. Free me now, I'm not answering questions, blah blah blah. Don't you know who I am?;[];;[8047];[8045, 8062, 8063];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09075_.mp3
Kraat decides he's had enough and begins crushing Andor's neck. I told the boy he should have kept his mouth shut. I think he agreed, too... or those could have just been gurgling noises. Well... well, anyway.;[];;[8048];[8046];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09076_.mp3
Finally, Kraat has enough of Andor and tosses him aside into this giant energy intake shaft. Andor gets sucked in and starts bouncing around, heh, screaming... heh.;[];;[8049];[8047];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09077_.mp3
Maybe Andor hit something sensitive on the way down or just didn't agree with the reactor core, next thing I know all the ship's alarms are ringing.;[];;[8050];[8048];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09078_.mp3
You're kidding...;[];;[8051];[8049];k_hjol_dialog;
Everyone panics and I run, barely making it to the ship in time before the explosion. Kraat dies horribly, and the Dimeans never quite recovered.;[];;[8052];[8050];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09080_.mp3
Changed the political course of the entire sector for centuries to come. I'd call that quite a destiny, wouldn't you?;[];;[8053, 8056, 8059];[8051];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09081_.mp3
I hate you, old man...;[];;[8054];[8052];k_hjol_dialog;
Well, now, that's the ingratitude of youth for you. I relate an exciting tale and do I get thanked for it? No, no, it's all 'me me me!' Hmph.;[];;[8055];[8053];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09083_.mp3
Anyway, go on. My throat is dry and you're making me cranky. Shoo!;[];;[];[8054, 8058, 8060];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09089_.mp3
But how can you even be sure Andor was responsible?!;[];;[8057];[8052];k_hjol_dialog;
What?! Are you kidding?! What are the odds of that happening, anyway? A billion to one?;[];;[8058];[8056];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09085_.mp3
You should do so well as to be sucked into the engine of some evil Sith Lord, you know. Andor was a hero... sort of.;[];;[8055];[8057];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09086_.mp3
And what does that have to do with you coming with me?;[];;[8060];[8052];k_hjol_dialog;
Well, hey, the chances may not be great, but when one has the opportunity to see something like that twice in a lifetime...;[];;[8055];[8059];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09088_.mp3
How did you know?;[];;[8062];[8043];k_hjol_dialog;
Swirling Force, remember? Jedi here? Granted, I was just interpreting the signs, but we get trained in that sort of thing. More or less.;[];;[8046];[8061];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09073_.mp3
And? Go on.;[];;[8046];[8043];k_hjol_dialog;
As boring as this story?;[];;[8065];[8038];k_hjol_dialog;
You know, if you keep interrupting, it will take even longer. Have you no patience at all? How did you get as old as you are anyway?;[];;[8041];[8064];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09091_.mp3
So why didn't you *leave*?;[];;[8067];[8038];k_hjol_dialog;
Well, he had a much better food dispenser than you do. That and the fact that even then I wasn't an altogether impatient *twit*.;[];;[8041];[8066];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09093_.mp3
Does this story have a point, old man?;[];;[8069];[8035];k_hjol_dialog;
Does it have to have a point? I thought we were just talking about Andor. Is something wrong with your attention span?;[];;[8038];[8068];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09095_.mp3
You're making all of this up!;[];;[8071];[8035];k_hjol_dialog;
I am not! I've no need to make things up, with my poor memory and all. You just sit still and let me finish, damn it.;[];;[8038];[8070];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09097_.mp3
Is that what you see around me, too?;[];;[8073];[8032];k_hjol_dialog;
Well, it's not so much a hurricane as a slight breeze. But that doesn't mean anything: destiny is sometimes in the eye of the beholder.;[];;[8035];[8072];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09099_.mp3
And you traveled with this man?;[];;[8075];[8032];k_hjol_dialog;
I did. Just because someone has the Force swirling about them doesn't always mean they have a great destiny, but it doesn't hurt to check it out.;[];;[8035];[8074];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09101_.mp3
Is this a comment on my breath?;[];;[8077];[8029];k_hjol_dialog;
No, but it could be. An Anduvian salt tablet would clear that right up, you know.;[];;[8032];[8076];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09103_.mp3
You're avoiding the question.;[];;[8079];[8029];k_hjol_dialog;
So I am. Tell you what... when you get to be my age, you can go ahead and answer any question you like, too. You have my permission.;[];;[8032];[8078];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09105_.mp3
If you don't want to answer the question, old man, just say so.;[];;[8081];[8026];k_hjol_dialog;
How impatient can one person be? You must have driven your mother mad. All that gurgling and fussing... heh, babies are cute, but annoying.;[];;[8029];[8080];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09107_.mp3
Fine, forget it.;[];;[8083];[8026];k_hjol_dialog;
Wow, you're not much for interrogation, are you? Is this as hard as you try? Remind me to sign up for your next torture session.;[];;[8029];[8082];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09109_.mp3
You never did actually say why you decided to come with me...;[];;[8085];[8022, 8571, 8579];k_hjol_dialog;
No, I never did, did I?;[];;[8086, 8131, 8133];[8084];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09111_.mp3
You know, I don't *have* to take you with me.;[];;[8087];[8085];k_hjol_dialog;
Of course you do. I know things, remember? You think you could make it around this part of the galaxy without me? Don't answer that.;[];;[8088];[8086];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09113_.mp3
At any rate, I already told you why I wanted to leave. I'd seen everything I wanted to on Kashyyyk. Time to go, time to move on.;[];;[8089, 8127, 8129];[8087, 8132, 8134];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09114_.mp3
Move on to where?;[];;[8090];[8088];k_hjol_dialog;
To bed. I'm old and tired, you know.;[];;[8091];[8089];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09116_.mp3
No, really.;[];;[8092];[8090];k_hjol_dialog;
How many kilometer-high trees can you find an interest in before you figure you've had enough? I'd bet you can't be bothered to stay in one room for more than fifteen minutes.;[];;[8093];[8091, 8128, 8130];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09118_.mp3
And then there's all the critters in the Shadowlands... I'm just happy to be back in space, doing something new. Is that too much to ask?;[];;[8094, 8123, 8125];[8092];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09119_.mp3
You could do that on your own.;[];;[8095];[8093];k_hjol_dialog;
So I could. Not having a ship does tend to put a damper on that kind of idea, however.;[];;[8096];[8094];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09121_.mp3
I'll admit... for all its flaws, Kashyyyk was home enough. But when you came along and I saw the destiny you had before you, I couldn't help but be intrigued.;[];;[8097, 8119, 8121];[8095, 8124, 8126];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09122_.mp3
You know what my destiny is?;[];;[8098];[8096];k_hjol_dialog;
Of course not. Weren't you listening last time? I can see that you have a destiny before you... but the details are far from clear.;[];;[8099];[8097];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09124_.mp3
In fact, everything about you that I can see is odd. Slightly off, as if my eyes are trying to trick me. Something... something is very dark about you...;[];;[8100];[8098, 8120, 8122];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09125_.mp3
... but bah! I'm sure you don't need to hear my ruminations. You've probably got enough nosy Jedi offering you one opinion after another to make you sick.;[];;[8101, 8115, 8117];[8099];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09126_.mp3
No, tell me more of what you see.;[];;[8102];[8100];k_hjol_dialog;
Your future will come of its own accord, trust me. Sometimes navel-gazing at it doesn't get you anywhere.;[];;[8103];[8101];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09128_.mp3
I wouldn't worry about it too much, if I were you. You remind me a bit of Nomi, heh heh, and that can't be all bad.;[];;[8104];[8102, 8116, 8118];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09129_.mp3
Nomi? Who's Nomi?;[];;[8105];[8103];k_hjol_dialog;
Nomi Sunrider. She came late to the Force, just as you have, and became one of the greatest Jedi ever. Oh, fine, fine lass.;[];;[8106];[8104];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09131_.mp3
Whether you'll follow the same path remains to be seen. For one thing, we'll never get anywhere if you stand around chatting up old men all day...;[];;[8107, 8111, 8113];[8105];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09132_.mp3
I don't bring you along for your amusement, you know.;[];;[8108];[8106];k_hjol_dialog;
Oh, stop being such a baby. Are you always so quick to turn aside an ally? Got too many of them, do you?;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[8109];[8107];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09134_.mp3
One thing I will say is that this little escapade does remind me a bit of my adventuring days before the war. Ahh, those were exciting times.;[];;[8110];[8108, 8112, 8114];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09139_.mp3
Or at least it would remind me of those times if we didn't stand around. What's keeping you? You're too young to be so talkative. Shoo! Shoo!;[];;[];[8109];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09140_.mp3
So... you're along as some kind of observer?;[];;[8112];[8106];k_hjol_dialog;
Nonsense. Have I ever refused to help you when you asked? How confused can one person be, anyway?;[];;[8109];[8111];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09136_.mp3
I don't need another mentor.;[];;[8114];[8106];k_hjol_dialog;
Good, since I didn't offer to be one. You think anyone would want to mentor you with that kind of attitude? Not me, I'm past that.;[];;[8109];[8113];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09138_.mp3
You got that right. I have enough Jedi watching me.;[];;[8116];[8100];k_hjol_dialog;
Well I for one am quite content to let you make your own mistakes. Just because I want to see where this ends up doesn't mean I need to tell you how to get there.;[];;[8103];[8115];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09142_.mp3
So you're coming along to *not* offer your opinions?;[];;[8118];[8100];k_hjol_dialog;
I'll remind you that *you're* the one who started pumping me for information. Like an old man doesn't have anything better to do. Hmph.;[];;[8103];[8117];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09144_.mp3
What interest do you have in my future?;[];;[8120];[8096];k_hjol_dialog;
Interest? Well, I certainly don't have a vested interest... call it more idle curiosity. Your destiny is... rather unclear.;[];;[8099];[8119];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09146_.mp3
Just keep your opinions on it to yourself.;[];;[8122];[8096];k_hjol_dialog;
Have I offered a single opinion? No, I haven't, though you could do far worse than hear a couple of mine. Your destiny, after all, is rather unclear.;[];;[8099];[8121];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09148_.mp3
Damn right it is.;[];;[8124];[8093];k_hjol_dialog;
You got a smart mouth on you there, you know that? If ullers could talk, they'd sound like that.;[];;[8096];[8123];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09150_.mp3
No, I guess not.;[];;[8126];[8093];k_hjol_dialog;
There, now, was that so hard? An old man has to be allowed some petty eccenticities. Nice to see you agree, for once.;[];;[8096];[8125];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09152_.mp3
I don't believe you.;[];;[8128];[8088];k_hjol_dialog;
The hermit says he's tired of living alone in the giant forest and you find that hard to believe? How cynical are you?;[];;[8092];[8127];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09154_.mp3
You looked plenty happy there, to me.;[];;[8130];[8088];k_hjol_dialog;
You live in an overgrown stump with the tachs beating down your door and you tell me how happy you would be. I was pleased just to have visitors.;[];;[8092];[8129];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09156_.mp3
Are you always going to be this elusive?;[];;[8132];[8085];k_hjol_dialog;
Elusive? Me, elusive? Heh. Obviously you've never tried to grab a Twi'lek dancing girl after drinking too much Ondaran willek juice.;[];;[8088];[8131];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09158_.mp3
Answer the question, old man.;[];;[8134];[8085];k_hjol_dialog;
My, my, somebody woke up on the wrong side of the starship this morning, I see. Is that a chip on your shoulder or are you a bit surly today?;[];;[8088];[8133];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09160_.mp3
You mentioned something about your 'adventuring days'?;[];;[8136];[8022, 8571, 8579];k_hjol_dialog;
Did I say that? Strange the tricks memory plays on you when you get older.;[];;[8137];[8135];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09162_.mp3
So you weren't an adventurer?;[];;[8138];[8136];k_hjol_dialog;
Didn't I say that my past was my affair? You don't see me poking and prodding you with questions, do you?;[];;[8139, 8186, 8188];[8137];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09164_.mp3
But you've already said so much... I'm curious.;[];;[8140];[8138];k_hjol_dialog;
I'm not here to satisfy your curiosity! No staring at the old man, that's what the sign says, dammit!;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[8141];[8139];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09168_.mp3
And besides... you don't really want to hear about me. We're talking ancient history, probably before you were born. History bores kids. Proven fact.;[];;[8142, 8182, 8184];[8140, 8187];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09171_.mp3
Yeah? Well old people love to talk about history. Proven fact.;[];;[8143];[8141];k_hjol_dialog;
Oh fine, fine, have it your way. Just don't cry about it later.;[];;[8144];[8142];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09173_.mp3
Yes, yes, I was an adventurer. Happy now? I wasn't even done with my Jedi training back then. I had a full head of hair and an eagerness to see absolutely everything.;[];;[8145];[8143, 8185];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09177_.mp3
Sound familiar? The Council was never very happy with willful, brash Jolee Bindo, you see. Even less so when I began my smuggling career.;[];;[8146, 8179, 8181];[8144];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09178_.mp3
*You* were a smuggler?;[];;[8147];[8145];k_hjol_dialog;
Don't look at me like that, dammit! I wasn't always the wrinkled coot I am now, you know. I can still fight, too, so wipe off that smirk I see there.;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[8148];[8146];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09180_.mp3
At the time the Ukatis system was interdicted by its own King. He preferred to keep his people starving and poor, all the better to oppress them.;[];;[8149];[8147, 8180, 8181];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09184_.mp3
The Senate was trying to negotiate a peace, but they were getting nowhere as usual. I decided I wasn't going to wait.;[];;[8150];[8148];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09185_.mp3
I found myself a ship and a partner and we began smuggling food and supplies to the Ukatis citizenry through the blockade.;[];;[8151, 8155, 8175];[8149];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09186_.mp3
Was it very dangerous?;[];;[8152];[8150, 8178, 8176];k_hjol_dialog;
Oh, it was. I was a half-decent pilot in those days... and with the Force guiding me, we made it through some tough spots nobody else would have.;[];;[8153, 8155, 8175];[8151];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09188_.mp3
You were a pilot, too?;[];;[8154];[8152];k_hjol_dialog;
Pilot, smuggler... several other things, too. Or did you suppose I was always a crotchety hermit?;[];;[8155, 8175];[8153];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09190_.mp3
Where did you get the credits for all the supplies?;[];;[8156];[8154, 8178, 8176, 8152, 8150];k_hjol_dialog;
Well... we didn't *buy* all the equipment, per se. Some were happy to donate goods. Some we just, ah, knew had more than they could use...;[];;[8157];[8155];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09192_.mp3
So you stole it?;[];;[8158];[8156];k_hjol_dialog;
'Stole' is such a harsh word. They would have donated those goods readily enough if they were compassionate. I considered it a tax on the greedy.;[];;[8159];[8157];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09194_.mp3
We only got caught once. A lone Ukatish frigate shot us down and forced a crash landing. I thought the Force had abandoned me, as I remember.;[];;[8160, 8171, 8173];[8158];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09195_.mp3
What happened then?;[];;[8161];[8159];k_hjol_dialog;
Well, as it happens, getting shot down turned out to be very fortunate. That day was the day I...;[];;[8162];[8160, 8172, 8174];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09197_.mp3
That was the day you what?;[];;[8163];[8161];k_hjol_dialog;
Well, that... that was the day I met my wife.;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[8164, 8167, 8169];[8162];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09199_.mp3
Oh, I'm sorry...;[];;[8165];[8163];k_hjol_dialog;
It's alright. When you're digging through the trash, you shouldn't be surprised when you encounter something unpleasant.;[];;[8166];[8164];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09201_.mp3
I... If it's all the same to you, I'd prefer to stop talking now. My mouth is starting to draw flies.;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[];[8165, 8168, 8170];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09206_.mp3
Your wife? You were married?;[];;[8168];[8163];k_hjol_dialog;
You know another way to get a wife? But, yes... that's when I met her.;[];;[8166];[8167];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09203_.mp3
Bad memory, I take it?;[];;[8170];[8163];k_hjol_dialog;
No. No, that was a good memory. There are just... much worse ones that followed.;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[8166];[8169];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09205_.mp3
Maybe it should have.;[];;[8172];[8159];k_hjol_dialog;
Oh, so you're going to speak for the Force now, are you? I deserved to crash, is that it?;[];;[8161];[8171];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09208_.mp3
Well that was pretty stupid of you.;[];;[8174];[8159];k_hjol_dialog;
Hmph. As I recall, I'm not the only person in this conversation who's been shot down out of the sky recently.;[];;[8161];[8173];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09210_.mp3
I still can't believe you actually did that.;[];;[8176];[8154, 8152, 8150];k_hjol_dialog;
Why not? There were millions of people crying out for aid. What else was I supposed to do?;[];;[8151, 8155, 8177];[8175];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09212_.mp3
How about nothing?;[];;[8178];[8176];k_hjol_dialog;
Don't be stupid. Are you doing nothing? If nothing's not good enough for you there's no reason it should have been good enough for me back then, either.;[];;[8151, 8155];[8177];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09214_.mp3
A Jedi would never be a smuggler!;[];;[8180];[8145];k_hjol_dialog;
You're very sure of that, are you? My, my, you must be very learned and experienced to know so many things. At any rate, I was still a Padawan at the time.;[];;[8148];[8179];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09182_.mp3
How did that happen?;[];;[8148];[8145];k_hjol_dialog;
You're right. I'd rather not be bored.;[];;[8183];[8141];k_hjol_dialog;
Well that's a relief. Maybe an old man can finally get some peace around here. Now, run along and do whatever you were doing, already.;[];;[];[8182, 8188];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09166_.mp3
I'm not a 'kid'.;[];;[8185];[8141];k_hjol_dialog;
So you're not. Fine, have it your way. Just don't say I didn't warn you.;[];;[8144];[8184];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09176_.mp3
You're just not used to company. Stop being an old coot.;[];;[8187];[8138];k_hjol_dialog;
Hmph. I might be. But a mouthy young thing like yourself shouldn't get to call me an old coot, dammit.;[];;[8141];[8186];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09170_.mp3
Fine. I won't you questions ever again.;[];;[8183];[8138];k_hjol_dialog;
You mentioned something about your wife before?;[];Jolee won't talk anymore past this;[8190];[8022, 8571, 8579];k_hjol_dialog;
I don't want to talk about that.;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[8191, 8193, 8242];[8189];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09216_.mp3
Sorry. Maybe we can talk about it later.;[];;[8192];[8190];k_hjol_dialog;
Maybe, but I doubt it. I'm made stubborn that way.;[];;[];[8191];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09218_.mp3
Well, I do. Spit it out, already.;[];;[8194];[8190];k_hjol_dialog;
Now that's a unique method of getting someone to talk. Thunder about like a bantha in a circuit shop. Does that work for you often?;[];;[8195];[8193];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09220_.mp3
Let me tell you something. Once you've lived as many years as I have, you'll have yourself a long, long list of memories.;[];;[8196];[8194, 8243];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09223_.mp3
If you're lucky, most of them will be good. If you're not, some will be bad. If you're really unlucky, some will be so bad you never want to be reminded of them again... ever.;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[8197];[8195];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09224_.mp3
You'll go far away, to a place that doesn't hold any memories at all. And there you'll be happy just to forget and be forgotten.;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[8198, 8224, 8238, 8240];[8196];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09225_.mp3
I would never do that.;[];;[8199];[8197];k_hjol_dialog;
You say that now, but I'm talking to you from across the breadth of many years experience. That is a gap I simply can't cross for you.;[];;[8200];[8198];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09227_.mp3
Let me ask you this: have you ever been in love? Truly in love, I mean, and not simple infatuation.;[];;[8201];[8199, 8239, 8241];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09233_.mp3
Well...;[];;[8202, 8237];[8200];k_hjol_dialog;
Exactly. You're still at the beginning of your life. There will be women in your life... perhaps many women... but if you're fortunate you'll find love once.;[];;[8203];[8201];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09235_.mp3
The Jedi, with their damnable sense of over-caution, would tell you love is something to avoid. Thankfully, anyone who's even partially alive knows that's not true.;[];;[8204, 8234, 8235];[8202, 8237];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09237_.mp3
Aren't you worried about the dark side at all?;[];;[8205];[8203];k_hjol_dialog;
Love doesn't lead to the dark side. Passion can lead to rage and fear, and can be controlled... but passion is not the same thing as love.;[];;[8206];[8204, 8234, 8236];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09239_.mp3
Controlling your passions while being in love... that's what they should teach you to beware. But love, itself, will save you... not condemn you.;[];;[8207];[8205];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09240_.mp3
Ahhhh, but listen to me go on as if I had all the answers. What do I know of love anymore? I'm just a lonely old man who's not even a Jedi.;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[8208, 8221, 8224, 8226];[8206];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09241_.mp3
Sounds like love is something you should have avoided.;[];;[8209];[8207];k_hjol_dialog;
Hmph. Maybe. Do you want to avoid the greatest things in life simply because they come with some complications?;[];;[8210];[8208];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09243_.mp3
Love causes pain, certainly. Inevitably love is going to lead to as much sorrow and regret as it does joy. I suppose there are perfect, eternal loves out there... but I haven't seen any.;[];;[8211];[8209, 8225, 8229, 8231, 8233];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09244_.mp3
How you deal with the bad part of love is what determines your character, what determines the dark side's hold over you.;[];;[8212, 8217, 8219];[8210];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09245_.mp3
You don't think love can work?;[];;[8213];[8211];k_hjol_dialog;
I suppose it could. It would take a strong person to make that kind of commitment, I think. Someone with a great sense of self.;[];;[8214];[8212];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09247_.mp3
I'll tell you one thing: sometimes, no matter how hard you try, you and the one you love simply aren't meant to be together.;[];;[8215];[8213, 8218, 8220];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09252_.mp3
The trick is to know when that is, to know when it's time to fight and when it's time to part ways.;[];;[8216];[8214];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09253_.mp3
Hmph... there I go waxing philosophical again. Somebody blast me already! Let's get going before I start talking in riddles, dammit!;[];;[];[8215];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09254_.mp3
Maybe the Jedi just think you shouldn't take that risk.;[];;[8218];[8211];k_hjol_dialog;
Bah. A life without risk is boring. Is that how you want to live? You want love, you've got to fight for it.;[];;[8214];[8217];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09249_.mp3
So what happened between you and your wife, then?;[];;[8220];[8211];k_hjol_dialog;
I haven't changed my mind. I'm still not going to talk about it. You go and find your own love if you want to know so badly.;[];;[8214];[8219];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09251_.mp3
You talk too much, old man. You don't know anything.;[];;[8222];[8207];k_hjol_dialog;
Don't I? Hmph. Maybe you're right. It seems whatever I have to say is falling on deaf ears, anyhow.;[];;[8223];[8221];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09256_.mp3
So go on, go on, run amok and kiss the bantha for all I care. I won't comment on it.;[];;[];[8222];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09257_.mp3
No, I want to hear what you have to say.;[];Jolee will not speak any more;[8225];[8207, 8197];k_hjol_dialog;
You do, do you? I wouldn't listen too closely... I'm no authority on anything. I just think that the greatest things in life shouldn't be avoided because they come with a few complications.;[];;[8210];[8224];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09259_.mp3
Not even a Jedi? You mean not any more, right?;[];;[8227];[8207];k_hjol_dialog;
Nope. Never was. Technically I never rose above the rank of Padawan, for various reasons. Does that surprise you?;[];;[8228, 8230, 8232];[8226];k_hjol_dialog;NGLOBEJOLE09742_.mp3
Not the way you describe your past, no.;[];;[8229];[8227];k_hjol_dialog;
Heh. I suppose I'm not prone to live my life like most of the Jedi Masters do, that's true. My opinions on love are no different.;[];;[8210];[8228];k_hjol_dialog;NGLOBEJOLE09744_.mp3
You seem to have all the abilities of a Jedi...;[];;[8231];[8227];k_hjol_dialog;
In my case, becoming a Jedi would have been a formality. I doubt the order and I would have gotten along well, considering my opinions on things such as love.;[];;[8210];[8230];k_hjol_dialog;NGLOBEJOLE09746_.mp3
Yes. You lied to me.;[];;[8233];[8227];k_hjol_dialog;
No I didn't. I may never have become a Jedi technically, but I'm an old Padawan with a lifetime of experience. That applies both to the Force as well as topics like love.;[];;[8210];[8232];k_hjol_dialog;NGLOBEJOLE09748_.mp3
That's what I've always thought.;[];;[8205];[8203];k_hjol_dialog;
What's this? Love advice from an old Jedi?;[];;[8236];[8203];k_hjol_dialog;
And why not? All this nonsense about avoiding love is so much foo-foo. I shouldn't be the only one who realizes that.;[];;[8205];[8235];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09262_.mp3
Exactly. You're still at the beginning of your life. There will be men in your life... perhaps many men... but if you're fortunate you'll find love once.;[];;[8203];[8201];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09236_.mp3
Is that why you went to Kashyyyk?;[];;[8239];[8197];k_hjol_dialog;
Heh. Partly, maybe. I doubt I could ever explain it to you fully, even if I wanted to.;[];;[8200];[8238];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09230_.mp3
Run away? How pathetic and weak.;[];;[8241];[8197];k_hjol_dialog;
There are worse things to call yourself, for better reasons. If you don't think it's even possible that you might be flinging those words at yourself one day, you're younger than I thought.;[];;[8200];[8240];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09232_.mp3
I don't mean to pry, but...;[];;[8243];[8190];k_hjol_dialog;
Yes you do. You may mean well enough, but my private affairs are just that: private.;[];;[8195];[8242];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09222_.mp3
Why did you leave the Jedi?;[];;[8245];[8022, 8571, 8579];k_hjol_dialog;
Heh heh. Who said I left the Jedi?;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Laughing'}];;[8246, 8308, 8309];[8244];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09264_.mp3
You did. You said you weren't a Jedi any longer.;[];;[8247];[8245];k_hjol_dialog;
Well, technically, I was only a Padawan... not that that makes a difference to most. But as for the order, itself... no, I never left it. It left *me*.;[];;[8248, 8299, 8301];[8246, 8308];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09267_.mp3
What do you mean 'it left you'?;[];;[8249];[8247, 8310];k_hjol_dialog;
You know what I hate? Well... you know, lots of things, really. But I'm old and easily annoyed. But that's beside the point. What I *really* hate are how most people view the Jedi.;[];;[8250];[8248, 8300, 8304, 8305, 8307];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09269_.mp3
Everyone thinks that Jedi are perfect, that they can do no wrong. They think the Jedi Council is completely incapable of injustice.;[];;[8251, 8295, 8297];[8249];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09270_.mp3
I certainly don't think that.;[];;[8252];[8250];k_hjol_dialog;
Hmph. I guess you aren't as stupid as you sometimes act. No doubt you've been on the receiving end of Jedi justice at least once, eh?;[];;[8253];[8251];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09272_.mp3
And I'm not even talking about how some of us fall to the dark side. No, that's plenty indication of our fallibility, but it's something else entirely.;[];;[8254];[8252, 8296, 8298];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09277_.mp3
No, I'm talking about how, more often than not, your average robe-wearing Jedi can try to do the right thing and still be completely *wrong*.;[];;[8255, 8291, 8293];[8253];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09278_.mp3
I don't get it. What do you mean?;[];;[8256];[8254];k_hjol_dialog;
*sigh* I suppose I'm not being very clear, am I?;[];;[8257];[8255];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09280_.mp3
Come to think of it, I don't have to be clear. Someone my age is entitled to ramble, dammit! But for your sake I'll try to explain.;[];;[8258];[8256, 8292, 8294];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09281_.mp3
I'll tell you a little tale about a Jedi Master I once knew. Hortath, I think. Or was it Hartoth? I could never get it straight...;[];;[8259, 8284, 8286];[8257];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09282_.mp3
Go on, I'll listen.;[];;[8260];[8258];k_hjol_dialog;
Where was I, then? Oh. Oh, yes... Master Hortath. He was a kindly old Jedi who meant well, but the most near-sighted thing in the Core, I swear.;[];;[8261];[8259, 8285];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09284_.mp3
He would walk into walls, knock over tables, mistake apprentices for rancor beasts... that sort of thing. And he was too proud to submit to proper treatment.;[];;[8262];[8260];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09285_.mp3
"Some used to counsel him and urged ""Use the Force, Master Hortath. Allow the Force to see for you."" But he refused to believe that his eyes were failing.";[];;[8263];[8261];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09286_.mp3
He simply squinted more and more as the years went on, the other Jedi resignedly passing it off as the amusing quirk of a compassionate old man.;[];;[8264, 8282, 8283];[8262];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09287_.mp3
And? I don't get it.;[];;[8265];[8263];k_hjol_dialog;
I'm not finished yet! Now shush.;[];;[8266];[8264, 8282];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09289_.mp3
So one day a young Padawan meets Master Hortath in the courtyard and, not knowing of his blindness, asks him for directions to the Council.;[];;[8267];[8265, 8283];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09292_.mp3
Quite sure of himself, Hortath gave the lad directions... which happened to lead back outside and away from the enclave.;[];;[8268];[8266];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09293_.mp3
The Padawan is confused, naturally. He asks if Master Hortath is sure, and of course Master Hortath says that he is.;[];;[8269];[8267];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09294_.mp3
The Padawan suggests that perhaps he should ask someone else... but the proud Hortath now feels insulted. He tells the Padawan to take the route he prescribed and no other.;[];;[8270];[8268];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09295_.mp3
Rather dejectedly, the Padawan did as he was told... and so ended up leaving the Jedi Order forever.;[];;[8271];[8269];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09296_.mp3
It was decided that the boy's fate was to leave the Order anyway... though whether that was out of respect for Hortath or because the boy went on to something else, well, we'll never know.;[];;[8272, 8277, 8279, 8280];[8270];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09297_.mp3
So what does the Padawan leaving the Jedi have to do with the Jedi leaving you?;[];;[8273];[8271];k_hjol_dialog;
Not much. I never knew the Padawan nor met Master Hortath, himself. He was before my time.;[];;[8274];[8272];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09301_.mp3
I don't understand...;[];;[8275];[8273, 8278, 8389];k_hjol_dialog;
The tale is about blindness and I thought the point was clear. At any rate, you think about it. You're the one who asked why the Jedi left me, remember?;[];;[8276];[8274, 8279];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09306_.mp3
Now let's get going. My feet are itching for a good run.;[];;[];[8275, 8281];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09307_.mp3
So... you knew this Master Hortath? Or the Padawan?;[];;[8278];[8271];k_hjol_dialog;
No, no. Both of them were from before my time. Well before the Sith Wars, even.;[];;[8274];[8277];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09304_.mp3
So what's the point?;[];;[8275];[8271];k_hjol_dialog;
That's a stupid story.;[];;[8281];[8271];k_hjol_dialog;
Considering that it's about blindness, I think that's an appropriate response. You're the one who asked why the Jedi left me, remember?;[];;[8276];[8280];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09309_.mp3
Is this supposed to have a point?;[];;[8265];[8263];k_hjol_dialog;
Go on.;[];;[8266];[8263];k_hjol_dialog;
Is this going to have a point?;[];;[8285];[8258];k_hjol_dialog;
*Sigh* You know the problem with the youth of today? They're young.;[];;[8260];[8284, 8288];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09311_.mp3
No, I don't have time for any stupid stories.;[];;[8287];[8258];k_hjol_dialog;
You're the one who was asking me about the Jedi, dammit! Now do you want the story or not?;[];;[8288, 8289];[8286];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09313_.mp3
Fine, fine, but make it quick.;[];;[8285];[8287];k_hjol_dialog;
Not. Can't be bothered.;[];;[8290];[8287];k_hjol_dialog;
Boring you, am I? Well you just keep your questions to yourself next time. No need for old men to go and make nuisances of themselves.;[];;[];[8289];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09316_.mp3
So the Jedi wronged you in some way, I take it?;[];;[8292];[8254];k_hjol_dialog;
No, no. The Jedi always treated me well. It would be foolish and untrue to say otherwise. That's not what I meant, anyway.;[];;[8257];[8291];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09318_.mp3
Nobody can be right about everything.;[];;[8294];[8254];k_hjol_dialog;
That's true, but it's not what I meant. I guess I'm not being clear, am I?;[];;[8257];[8293];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09320_.mp3
Let me guess: you disagree?;[];;[8296];[8250];k_hjol_dialog;
Damn right I disagree. The Jedi are just as capable of injustice as anyone else. They may *try* harder, sure, but sometimes they get it wrong.;[];;[8253];[8295];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09274_.mp3
You? Perfect? That's a laugh.;[];;[8298];[8250];k_hjol_dialog;
Quiet, you. I'm not talking about me. Talking about the Jedi as a whole. They are just as capable of imperfection and injustice as anyone else, as you can obviously see.;[];;[8253];[8297];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09276_.mp3
That's about the dumbest thing I ever heard.;[];;[8300];[8247, 8310];k_hjol_dialog;
Oh, is it? Hmph. There are moments when I think you must be much older than you seem... but this isn't one of them.;[];;[8249];[8299];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09322_.mp3
So are you a Jedi or not?;[];;[8302];[8247, 8310];k_hjol_dialog;
Something wrong with your ears? I thought folks only went deaf when they got to my age. I follow the Jedi Way and use the Force, don't I? That makes me a Jedi last time I checked.;[];;[8303];[8301];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09324_.mp3
But the order, itself, the Jedi Council and so forth... no, I'm not a part of that and haven't been for a long time. And good riddance, I say!;[];;[8304, 8305, 8306];[8302];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09325_.mp3
But you said the Jedi left you?;[];;[8249];[8303];k_hjol_dialog;
Why good riddance?;[];;[8249];[8303];k_hjol_dialog;
So you're just some rogue Jedi. Big deal.;[];;[8307];[8303];k_hjol_dialog;
Hmph. A rogue, am I? You speak as if there must be something wrong with me, like not being part of the order makes me a criminal.;[];;[8249];[8306];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09329_.mp3
Are you saying you're still a Jedi?;[];;[8247];[8245];k_hjol_dialog;
Don't play games with me, old man.;[];;[8310];[8245];k_hjol_dialog;
Don't get so uppity, dammit! The point I was trying to make, if you decide to actually listen, is that I never left the order. The order left *me*.;[];;[8248, 8299, 8301];[8309];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09331_.mp3
What do you know about the Sith?;[];;[8312];[8022, 8571, 8579];k_hjol_dialog;
Bad, bad men. Women, too, to be fair.;[];;[8313, 8347];[8311];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09333_.mp3
You must know more than that.;[];;[8314];[8312];k_hjol_dialog;
Oh, indeed. They make a fine sandwich, also. Heh heh heh. But don't tell the Jedi Council I said that.;[];;[8315, 8345, 8346];[8313];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09335_.mp3
Do you know anything important about the Sith or not?;[];;[8316];[8314, 8348];k_hjol_dialog;
*sigh* And just what gave you the impression that I know anything more about the Sith than you do?;[];;[8317];[8315, 8345, 8346];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09339_.mp3
You did. You said you fought them.;[];;[8318];[8316];k_hjol_dialog;
Oh... that's right. Damn the ears of the young! I was expecting you to be your usual inattentive self when I mentioned that.;[];;[8319];[8317];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09341_.mp3
So it's true, yes, I fought plenty of Sith. That was during the time of Exar Kun... oh, fourty years ago now? Has it been that long?;[];;[8320, 8324, 8328, 8329];[8318];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09342_.mp3
Are these Sith the same as the ones who followed me?;[];;[8321];[8319];k_hjol_dialog;
No, no, of course not. The Sith have come and gone for ages. They were not called Sith many thousands of years ago, perhaps, but the dark side was always present without a doubt.;[];;[8322];[8320, 8328];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09344_.mp3
Oh, sure, occasionally the light side comes close to vanquishing the dark, but the dark always returns.;[];;[8323];[8321];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09345_.mp3
The fact that Exar Kun was defeated didn't mean the Sith would never return, as they obviously have now. Everyone knows that.;[];;[8324, 8329, 8331];[8322];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09346_.mp3
Who is this Exar Kun?;[];;[8325];[8323, 8330, 8319];k_hjol_dialog;
Ah. Exar was a Jedi who was... corrupted... by ghosts of the old Sith. Or so they say. He attempted to conquer the Republic and create a new Golden Age of the Sith.;[];;[8326, 8344];[8324];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09361_.mp3
Sort of like Revan. I mean me. I assume he was killed?;[];;[8327];[8325];k_hjol_dialog;
Better to say he was defeated... but essentially, yes. The victory did not come easily, however.;[];;[8328, 8329, 8331];[8326, 8344];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09363_.mp3
Are these the same Sith that we're fighting now?;[];;[8321];[8327, 8330, 8319];k_hjol_dialog;
So tell me what you know about the Sith.;[];;[8330];[8327, 8323, 8319];k_hjol_dialog;
A Sith believes he commands the Force... but it is the dark side who commands him. You know this, there is little else I could truly add.;[];;[8324, 8328, 8331];[8329];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09365_.mp3
What happened during the war with Exar Kun, then?;[];;[8332];[8330, 8327, 8323];k_hjol_dialog;
That... is not a pleasant time to remember. After Exar Kun fell to the dark side, he attempted to recruit other Jedi to his cause.;[];;[8333];[8331];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09348_.mp3
What surprised us... what took us completely unprepared... was how utterly successful he was. Many Jedi joined him and became Sith, themselves.;[];;[8334];[8332];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09349_.mp3
Why they did I... I will never truly know. But they did. Battle broke out throughout the order... pupil against master, we fought ourselves...;[];;[8335, 8339, 8341];[8333];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09350_.mp3
That must have been difficult.;[];;[8336];[8334];k_hjol_dialog;
Yes. More than difficult... next to impossible. How do you fight against someone you love?;[];;[8337];[8335];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09352_.mp3
Bah. I dislike such memories. It leaves a taste in the mouth that... it is a sadness I thought I had put aside long ago.;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[8338];[8336, 8340];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09355_.mp3
Ask me again about the war some other time. Just... not now. I would prefer to be by myself for now.;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[];[8337];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09356_.mp3
But you exterminated all the traitors, right?;[];;[8340];[8334];k_hjol_dialog;
Easy now to call them traitors. Tell me... how do you fight against someone that you love?;[];;[8337];[8339];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09354_.mp3
This isn't going to be more sad moaning, is it?;[];;[8342];[8334];k_hjol_dialog;
I've often held the opinion that history has one basic flaw: it is seldom heeded.;[];;[8343];[8341];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09358_.mp3
So go on and greet the world with your spite. Let's see where it takes you. You certainly don't need to hear any more from me.;[];;[];[8342];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09359_.mp3
And he was killed?;[];;[8327];[8325];k_hjol_dialog;
You're being elusive on purpose.;[];;[8316];[8314, 8348];k_hjol_dialog;
Spit it out, old man, or things get rough.;[];;[8316];[8314, 8348];k_hjol_dialog;
I'm not in the mood to play games.;[];;[8348];[8312];k_hjol_dialog;
Who's playing games? Ask the next Sith you see if they're bad and they'll set you straight.;[];;[8315, 8345, 8346];[8347];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09337_.mp3
Do you want to talk about the war now?;[];;[8350];[8022, 8571, 8579];k_hjol_dialog;
Not particularly.;[];;[8351, 8352, 8423];[8349];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09369_.mp3
I'll ask you some other time, then.;[];;[];[8350];k_hjol_dialog;
[Persuade] No time like the present?;[];;[8353, 8422];[8350];k_hjol_dialog;
[Success] I suppose you're going to nag me until I cough it up, aren't you? Nothing is private anymore, it looks like.;[];;[8354];[8352, 8425];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09372_.mp3
*sigh* There's no escaping it, I guess. So be it.;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[8355];[8353];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09373_.mp3
My wife's name was Nayama. She was the Ukatis enforcer who shot me out of the sky, if you remember.;[];;[8356, 8418, 8420];[8354];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09374_.mp3
What does your wife have to do with the war?;[];;[8357];[8355, 8419];k_hjol_dialog;
My wife had plenty to do with the war. Upon meeting her, I knew right away that she was strong in the Force. That's why she was able to shoot me down.;[];;[8358];[8356, 8421];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09376_.mp3
Nayama was a marvel of a woman. Fiery, determined, smart... she dragged me to the capital and foiled three of my attempts to escape prison. Oh, and that body...;[];;[8359];[8357];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09377_.mp3
The war...?;[];;[8360];[8358];k_hjol_dialog;
Well... yes, that. Needless to say I eventually won her over. That was after I kidnapped her upon being broken out of the Ukatis prison, mind you. But uh, that's another story entirely.;[];;[8361];[8359];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09379_.mp3
At any rate, I wanted to train her in the Jedi way. The Council refused my request, naturally. I was still a Padawan at the time.;[];;[8362];[8360];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09380_.mp3
I was an experienced Padawan, surely... but not yet ready to be a full Jedi and certainly not ready to train another. Especially not one so old as my wife.;[];;[8363, 8413, 8414, 8416];[8361];k_hjol_dialog;NGLOBEJOLE09749_.mp3
So you disobeyed the Council. Like I did.;[];;[8364];[8362];k_hjol_dialog;
I did. I wasn't the first and I won't be the last. The problem with self-righteous folk is they think they're more right than everyone else.;[];;[8365];[8363, 8413];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09382_.mp3
I believed in her and trained her in secret. I ignored her willful nature... I loved her too much to see fault in her.;[];;[8366];[8364, 8415, 8417];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09387_.mp3
And she loved me, too. I know she did. At the time, our love was a shared bliss... better than anything I had known before or since.;[];;[8367];[8365];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09388_.mp3
So what happened?;[];;[8368];[8366];k_hjol_dialog;
Exar Kun is what happened. Nayama was inspired by Exar's promises of a new Golden Age. She wanted to join him.;[];;[8369];[8367];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09390_.mp3
She came to me, pleading with me to throw aside what she called the decrepit trappings of the Jedi... to join her in Exar's war.;[];;[8370, 8410, 8412];[8368];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09391_.mp3
So she had fallen to the dark side?;[];;[8371];[8369];k_hjol_dialog;
I... hadn't thought so. Not right then. I was too proud to believe that of her. I had trained her myself... I loved her.;[];;[8372];[8370];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09393_.mp3
I pleaded with her to reconsider, to think about all that she was throwing away... to think about what she would become.;[];;[8373];[8371, 8412];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09397_.mp3
She would have none of it. Finally, in frustration, she attacked me. She drew her lightsaber and attempted to strike me down.;[];;[8374];[8372, 8411];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09398_.mp3
It was a scene being repeated everywhere throughout the galaxy. Pupil against master. In my case... it was a long and terrible battle, but I defeated her.;[];;[8375];[8373];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09399_.mp3
You killed her?;[];;[8376];[8374];k_hjol_dialog;
No... no. I had her at my mercy, disarmed and defenseless. She looked up at me and she knew... she knew I couldn't do it.;[];;[8377, 8405, 8406, 8408];[8375];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09401_.mp3
Sounds familiar. Seems like the Jedi don't like killing their helpless enemies.;[];;[8378];[8376];k_hjol_dialog;
But I should have. Sometimes I convince myself otherwise... but it's no use. She had fallen to the dark side when she raised her saber against me.;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[8379];[8377, 8405];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09403_.mp3
And I let her go. To my shame, she went on to kill many Jedi during the war until she, herself, was slain in the final battle.;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[8380];[8378, 8407, 8409];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09408_.mp3
I grieved for her death, inevitable as it was, even as the Jedi Council put me on trial for my actions once the war was over.;[];;[8381];[8379];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09409_.mp3
They put you on trial?;[];;[8382];[8380];k_hjol_dialog;
I had trained Nayama against their wishes. I had failed to kill her when I had the chance, and she went on to kill others.;[];;[8383];[8381];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09411_.mp3
Not to mention that I had remained a Padawan throughout the war. A formality, perhaps, but with the trial it had to be decided if I was worthy to become a Jedi at all.;[];;[8384];[8382];k_hjol_dialog;NGLOBEJOLE09750_.mp3
It was a travesty, of course. I told you that even the Jedi were capable of great injustices, didn't I?;[];;[8385, 8399, 8400, 8402, 8404];[8383];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09412_.mp3
The Jedi are always fair and merciful. They gave me a second chance.;[];;[8386];[8384];k_hjol_dialog;
But I deserved to be tried. They found me innocent.;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[8387];[8385, 8399, 8404];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09418_.mp3
Even though I... deserved every punishment and more... they let me go. Mitigating circumstances, they said. I deserved compassion, they said.;[];;[8388];[8386, 8401, 8403];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09419_.mp3
They said I had learned wisdom the hard way. For all I had done during the war, they wished to raise me to full Jedi status at long last.;[];;[8389];[8387];k_hjol_dialog;NGLOBEJOLE09751_.mp3
That... that was when the Jedi left me. That was when they failed me.;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[8274, 8390, 8398];[8388];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09420_.mp3
No, you're wrong! You did deserve compassion!;[];;[8391];[8389];k_hjol_dialog;
For my pride? For my cowardice? Which do you think is the act more befitting a Jedi?;[];;[8392];[8390];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09424_.mp3
They may have been able to forgive me. I... could never forgive myself.;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[8393];[8391, 8398];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09426_.mp3
And you still believe love is worth the risk?;[];;[8394];[8392];k_hjol_dialog;
I...;[];;[8395];[8393];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09428_.mp3
Yes, I do, I suppose. Does that surprise you?;[];;[8396];[8394];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09429_.mp3
Ahhh... it is all so long ago. Lost in the winds, I suppose. Nobody cares what an old man believes anymore, do they?;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[8397];[8395];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09430_.mp3
Let's continue on with the task at hand. I would prefer to think of the present today.;[];;[];[8396];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09431_.mp3
You should have been happy you got off.;[];;[8392];[8389];k_hjol_dialog;
I agree with you. They destroyed my mind, after all.;[];;[8386];[8384];k_hjol_dialog;
So that's the source of all this bitterness? They found you guilty?;[];;[8401];[8384];k_hjol_dialog;
Not at all. They found me innocent.;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[8387];[8400];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09414_.mp3
So you think you didn't deserve to be punished?;[];;[8403];[8384];k_hjol_dialog;
Of course I deserved to be punished. They found me innocent.;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[8387];[8402];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09416_.mp3
I can't believe they tried you for that!;[];;[8386];[8384];k_hjol_dialog;
I don't think I could have, either.;[];;[8378];[8376];k_hjol_dialog;
But... she was a Sith then, right?;[];;[8407];[8376];k_hjol_dialog;
Yes. I think she truly fell the moment she raised up her saber against me. I have played that instant in my head... so many times.;[];;[8379];[8406];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09405_.mp3
You were a fool.;[];;[8409];[8376];k_hjol_dialog;
Was I? Sometimes I convince myself that I couldn't have done otherwise... that I couldn't have seen that she had truly fallen to the dark side. But, yes, I was a fool.;[];;[8379];[8408];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09407_.mp3
So you killed her, of course.;[];;[8411];[8369];k_hjol_dialog;
No of course I didn't kill her. How could I? I pleaded with her to reconsider, to think about what she was doing.;[];;[8373];[8410];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09395_.mp3
What did you do?;[];;[8372];[8369];k_hjol_dialog;
You disobeyed the Jedi Council?;[];;[8364];[8362];k_hjol_dialog;
So you're saying you were an idiot.;[];;[8415];[8362];k_hjol_dialog;
Easy to say so now. At the time I just thought I was right.;[];;[8365];[8414];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09384_.mp3
And what did she think of all this?;[];;[8417];[8362];k_hjol_dialog;
Nayama was intrigued by the idea of becoming a Jedi. She liked the idea of power too much, perhaps, but I certainly didn't see that at the time.;[];;[8365];[8416];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09386_.mp3
Um... no, I don't remember.;[];;[8419];[8355];k_hjol_dialog;
Bah. You got ears that work, don't you? I was a smuggler, way way back. I got shot down once over Ukatis. THAT story, yes.;[];;[8356, 8420];[8418];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09433_.mp3
Are you going senile? I didn't ask about your wife, old man.;[];;[8421];[8419, 8355];k_hjol_dialog;
No I'm not senile, dammit! Not yet, anyway. Hmmm... well at least I don't think so. At any rate, I'll tell the story the way I want to.;[];;[8357];[8420];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09435_.mp3
[Failure] *Sigh* I'm not interested in your demands. I'll tell my story when I'm damn good and ready... which isn't now, so shoo!;[];;[];[8352, 8425];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09436_.mp3
You said you'd tell me later... so spit it out already.;[];;[8424];[8350];k_hjol_dialog;
Hmm. Such a charming and persuasive manner you have there. Forget it!;[];;[8425, 8426];[8423];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09438_.mp3
[Persuade] Okay, here I am asking nicely.;[];;[8353, 8422];[8424];k_hjol_dialog;
Fine. Have it your way.;[];;[];[8424];k_hjol_dialog;
So when did you go to Kashyyyk?;[];;[8428];[8022, 8571, 8579];k_hjol_dialog;
Oh, that was not until many years later, to tell the truth. I spent quite some time wandering the galaxy.;[];;[8429, 8496, 8498];[8427];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09442_.mp3
The Jedi just let you go?;[];;[8430];[8428];k_hjol_dialog;
Why wouldn't they? I had refused my promotion to Jedi... I was a Padawan who had left the Order, nothing more.;[];;[8431];[8429];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09444_.mp3
I traveled from one civilized system to the next, never staying long. I don't even think I knew what I was searching for.;[];;[8432];[8430];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09445_.mp3
It wasn't as if my travels were pleasant, either. There were plenty of folks who distrusted the Jedi after the war... or worse.;[];;[8433, 8492, 8494];[8431, 8497];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09448_.mp3
Worse? What could be worse?;[];;[8434];[8432];k_hjol_dialog;
If people weren't treating me with suspicion, they were looking at me with greed. I don't know how many thought they could make use of me for their own ends.;[];;[8435];[8433, 8493, 8495];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09450_.mp3
I got so sick of the treachery and deceit I left the civilized parts of the galaxy and headed instead for the uncivilized parts.;[];;[8436];[8434];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09451_.mp3
So that's when you went to Kashyyyk?;[];;[8437];[8435];k_hjol_dialog;
Actually I was on my way somewhere else when I crash-landed on Kashyyyk. The ship I was using was a rust-bucket.;[];;[8438, 8441, 8443];[8436];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09453_.mp3
You survived a crash-landing on Kashyyyk?;[];;[8439];[8437, 8442];k_hjol_dialog;
I'd taken some damage passing through an unexpected asteroid field, as I recall, but I wasn't completely without some systems. I could still guide her a bit when I crashed.;[];;[8440];[8438];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09455_.mp3
It wasn't what a would call the smoothest landing, especially considering I ended up smack in the depths of the Shadowlands. But I lived.;[];;[8441, 8443];[8439];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09456_.mp3
Why didn't you just fix your ship and keep going?;[];;[8442];[8440, 8437];k_hjol_dialog;
Hmph. I'm no mechanic. And besides, after you plunge nose-first into the trunk of a five-kilometer high tree, chances are you don't have much ship left.;[];;[8438, 8443];[8441];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09458_.mp3
So you crashed... and stayed?;[];;[8444];[8442, 8440, 8437];k_hjol_dialog;
Sure, why not? It seemed like an interesting enough place to spend a couple of decades exploring.;[];;[8445, 8450, 8452];[8443];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09460_.mp3
How did you survive in the Shadowlands?;[];;[8446];[8444, 8451];k_hjol_dialog;
Hmmm. That was a challenge at first. You've seen the kind of creatures that exist down there... and you missed the really big ones.;[];;[8447];[8445];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09462_.mp3
I was still able to rely on the Force to keep me safe for the most part. The rest of the trick is keeping out of the way of most of the predators.;[];;[8448];[8446];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09463_.mp3
It couldn't have been easy.;[];;[8449];[8447];k_hjol_dialog;
No, that's true. Still... most of the creatures grew accustomed to me, and I to them. At least none of them ever heard of a Jedi.;[];;[8450, 8452];[8448];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09465_.mp3
You're completely insane, you know that?;[];;[8451];[8449, 8444];k_hjol_dialog;
Bah, what do you know? I'd done enough wandering by that point, thank you very much. I felt at peace in the Shadowlands.;[];;[8445, 8452];[8450];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09467_.mp3
And the Wookiees didn't mind your presence?;[];;[8453];[8451, 8449, 8444];k_hjol_dialog;
They did at first, oh yes. I can't say I was overly pleased to encounter a group of indigenous giant carpets either, I can assure you of that.;[];;[8454, 8487, 8489];[8452];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09469_.mp3
Did you fight them?;[];;[8455];[8453];k_hjol_dialog;
No, no. I was the intruder in their land, after all. They got to trust me well enough after a couple of decades of my aid.;[];;[8456];[8454];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09471_.mp3
You helped them?;[];;[8457];[8455, 8488, 8491];k_hjol_dialog;
When I could. I would assist the few young ones who would get lost in the Shadowlands or attacked unexpectedly by the wildlife.;[];;[8458];[8456];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09478_.mp3
I must say... for a while there, the Wookiees actually thought I was some kind of benevolent forest god. Amusing, really. I set them straight eventually.;[];;[8459, 8462, 8469];[8457];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09479_.mp3
Why didn't you stop the slavery of the Wookiees, then?;[];;[8460];[8458, 8468];k_hjol_dialog;
At first, when the slavers took to hunting down lone Wookiees in the fringes of the Shadowlands, I did my best to divert them.;[];;[8461];[8459];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09481_.mp3
Later, when Chuundar made his deal I didn't see any point. I wasn't here to save them from their own sad follies, after all.;[];;[8462, 8469];[8460];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09482_.mp3
It sounds like you enjoyed being a god.;[];;[8463];[8461, 8458];k_hjol_dialog;
Nonsense. I had no idea that's what they were thinking for a long time. I just thought they were being friendly neighbours, leaving fruit and such for me.;[];;[8464];[8462];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09484_.mp3
Later, when I started to understand some of their grunting, I realized they would say prayers to the 'hairless one' before descending into the forest.;[];;[8465];[8463];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09485_.mp3
Hmph. Hairless one. I used to have plenty of hair, I tell you. *Ahem* Well, at any rate, it took a few bruises, but I set the record straight.;[];;[8466];[8464];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09486_.mp3
A few bruises?;[];;[8467];[8465];k_hjol_dialog;
I traveled to Rrookworro and met with the chieftain in front of everyone. Freyyr swatted at me just to see if I was real or not.;[];;[8468];[8466];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09488_.mp3
I was real, and while it was a light swat, Wookiees are terribly strong. I was knocked out cold for a day. The Wookiees all thought it was quite funny.;[];;[8459, 8469];[8467];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09489_.mp3
Wasn't it all a bit primitive for you?;[];;[8470];[8468, 8461, 8458];k_hjol_dialog;
Not really. Kashyyyk is a place you can feel very small in. It felt good to devote my time to helping people and living simply.;[];;[8471, 8485, 8486];[8469];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09491_.mp3
And you didn't receive any news from the outside?;[];;[8472];[8470];k_hjol_dialog;
What can I say? I did it all for the Wookiees.;[];;[8473];[8471, 8485, 8486];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09493_.mp3
The Wookiees?;[];;[8474];[8472];k_hjol_dialog;
The Wookiees. Well, okay, maybe I needed some time on a quiet and remote planet... but if you ever need a friend, an incredibly strong hairball isn't a bad call.;[];;[8475, 8478, 8483];[8473];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09495_.mp3
You are a very strange old man.;[];;[8476];[8474];k_hjol_dialog;
Why, thank you. You're not so bad, yourself, all things considered.;[];;[8477];[8475];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09497_.mp3
At any rate, we should be moving along, don't you think? If you sat around this long in the Shadowlands, a tach would eat you.;[];;[];[8476, 8482, 8484];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09505_.mp3
You sound quite fond of them.;[];;[8479];[8474];k_hjol_dialog;
I suppose I am, in a way, despite the smell. For a race of gardeners, they've developed quite interestingly.;[];;[8480];[8478];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09499_.mp3
Gardeners?;[];;[8481];[8479];k_hjol_dialog;
You remember the alien computer, correct? Kashyyyk was meant to be an agricultural planet. The Wookiees were made for a reason.;[];;[8482];[8480];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09501_.mp3
Or, at least, that's what I'm thinking. But I'm an old man who's had a long time to develop that opinion, so don't argue with me.;[];;[8477];[8481];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09502_.mp3
I regret asking you about this, now.;[];;[8484];[8474];k_hjol_dialog;
See? Now you know how I feel half the time.;[];;[8477];[8483];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09504_.mp3
You spent two decades living like that?;[];;[8472];[8470];k_hjol_dialog;
I still think you're insane.;[];;[8472];[8470];k_hjol_dialog;
You seemed on fairly peaceful terms with them.;[];;[8488];[8453];k_hjol_dialog;
Well that was after two decades of helping them. They certainly didn't trust me at first.;[];;[8456];[8487];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09473_.mp3
You could have ruled them, you know.;[];;[8490];[8453];k_hjol_dialog;
And why would I have been interested in that? You can't spend five minutes in a Wookiee village without coming out smelling like wet fur.;[];;[8491];[8489];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09475_.mp3
No, no, let them rule themselves. They can screw up their history just like every other race before them. No, I helped them in other ways.;[];;[8456];[8490];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09476_.mp3
With good reason, I imagine.;[];;[8493];[8432];k_hjol_dialog;
I suppose so. Not everyone would understand why the Jedi would suddenly start killing themselves and tearing up half the galaxy, would they?;[];;[8434];[8492];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09509_.mp3
I don't see why you were wandering in the first place.;[];;[8495];[8432];k_hjol_dialog;
I was lost. I couldn't conceive of returning to the Jedi, so what would you propose I'd done?;[];;[8434];[8494];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09511_.mp3
You were adventuring again, I take it?;[];;[8497];[8428];k_hjol_dialog;
Nothing so extravagant. I merely traveled from place to place... I don't even think I knew what I was searching for.;[];;[8432];[8496, 8498];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09447_.mp3
Let me guess. Traveling from planet to planet, doing good deeds...;[];;[8497];[8428];k_hjol_dialog;
So if you liked Kashyyyk so much, why did you want to leave?;[];;[8500];[8022, 8571, 8579];k_hjol_dialog;
Are we back to *that* again?;[];;[8501, 8538, 8539];[8499];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09514_.mp3
I find it hard to believe you left the Wookiees just for some adventure.;[];;[8502];[8500];k_hjol_dialog;
Hmmm... what's the best way for me to approach this? Ah, perhaps it's time for a little story...;[];;[8503, 8536, 8537];[8501, 8538, 8539];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09518_.mp3
Oh, no, not another story!;[];;[8504];[8502];k_hjol_dialog;
You just keep quiet there, you! I've had to put up with all your busy-body questions, haven't I? Well, now you'll listen to a story, dammit!;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[8505];[8503, 8536, 8537];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09522_.mp3
*ahem* Now where was I? Oh yes, the story... you almost made me forget about it. Nice try, but I'm not that old just yet. Heh heh.;[];;[8506];[8504];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09523_.mp3
Now, then. A young man sees a terribly venemous snake in his small village. Nervous, he watches the snake carefully until it leaves.;[];;[8507];[8505];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09524_.mp3
The young man follows the snake into the forest. He clears the branches out of its path and helps it over obstacles. He even works to keep it fed.;[];;[8508];[8506];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09525_.mp3
This is a very long story.;[];;[8509];[8507];k_hjol_dialog;
Shush! Many nights pass and still the young man continues to follow the snake. He even follows it into the sands of the great desert.;[];;[8510];[8508];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09527_.mp3
In the desert, the snake eventually grows hungry. It turns and bites the young man, its poison quickly working its way into his system.;[];;[8511];[8509];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09528_.mp3
"Finally curious, the snake looks at the boy as he lays dying and asks, ""Why were you foolish enough to follow me all the way out into the desert?""";[];;[8512];[8510];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09529_.mp3
"The boy looks back and replies, ""Did I follow you? I thought I was leading you away from everyone else..."" And then he died.";[];;[8513];[8511];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09530_.mp3
Am I supposed to be the snake?;[];;[8514];[8512];k_hjol_dialog;
Well, now, that's what I wanted to see for myself.;[];;[8515, 8531, 8533, 8535];[8513];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09532_.mp3
That's a long way to come just to risk dying.;[];;[8516];[8514];k_hjol_dialog;
I've come a long way as it is, and I'm going to die anyway so that doesn't bother me in the least.;[];;[8517];[8515];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09534_.mp3
I've told you before that you have a destiny before you. This does not mean, however, that your future is already written. They are not the same thing.;[];;[8518];[8516, 8532, 8534, 8535];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09540_.mp3
You have the choice of which direction you take your destiny in. More than engine-sucking Andor, certainly... but even he had a choice.;[];;[8519, 8530];[8517];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09541_.mp3
So far you've chosen to take a darker path. You know the consequences of that... we'll see if you decide to stay your course.;[];;[8520];[8518];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09542_.mp3
I'm not here to judge you or tell you which path to take. I'm here ready to offer you my help... should you ask for it.;[];;[8521];[8519, 8530];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09544_.mp3
I do that because I think it's important. More important than remaining in my home and pretending the galaxy doesn't exist. That's why I'm here.;[];;[8522, 8526, 8528];[8520];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09545_.mp3
Thank you, Jolee. I'm glad you came.;[];;[8523, 8525];[8521];k_hjol_dialog;
Heh. I'm rather glad I came, too, really. You're a fine young lad. I hope... I hope things turn out well for you.;[];;[8524];[8522];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09547_.mp3
Now, then... I've chatted enough for one lifetime. Let's get this show on the road, shall we?;[];;[];[8523, 8525, 8527, 8529];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09553_.mp3
Heh. I'm rather glad I came, too, really. You're a fine young lass. I hope... I hope things turn out well for you.;[];;[8524];[8522];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09548_.mp3
But I don't need you, really. You're wasting your time.;[];;[8527];[8521];k_hjol_dialog;
Hmph. So you say, but it's my time to waste. Perhaps I can influence your decision, perhaps not... only time will tell, won't it?;[];;[8524];[8526];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09550_.mp3
I'd prefer you were safe... elsewhere.;[];;[8529];[8521];k_hjol_dialog;
That's very kind of you, but while elsewhere may be safer, elsewhere isn't where I think I should be. Besides... what's an old man to fear from death, eh?;[];;[8524];[8528];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09552_.mp3
So far you've chosen to take the lighter path. Can you stay that course, even through the challenges ahead? We'll have to wait and see.;[];;[8520];[8518];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09543_.mp3
I'm not a snake, I can assure you of that.;[];;[8532];[8514];k_hjol_dialog;
Well, then... let's hope you're not the young man, either.;[];;[8517];[8531];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09536_.mp3
Are you saying you're frightened of me?;[];;[8534];[8514];k_hjol_dialog;
The real question is whether or not I'm as frightened as I should be, isn't it?;[];;[8517];[8533];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09538_.mp3
And what's your judgment so far?;[];;[8517];[8514];k_hjol_dialog;
Couldn't you just answer the question for once?;[];;[8504];[8502];k_hjol_dialog;
Forget I asked anything. I refuse to listen!;[];;[8504];[8502];k_hjol_dialog;
I want a reason why I shouldn't just drop you off somewhere.;[];;[8502];[8500];k_hjol_dialog;
Am I really all that interesting to you?;[];;[8502];[8500];k_hjol_dialog;
Tell me about Sunry. How do you know him?;[];;[8541];[8022];k_hjol_dialog;
What? You think because I'm a hermit I've always been a hermit? Just because I haven't seen Sunry for twenty years doesn't mean he's not a friend.;[];;[8542];[8540];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09024_.mp3
A man could have changed a lot in that span of time, though. But to become a murderer? Oh, mm mm mm. I can't see it. That's not the Sunry I knew.;[];;[8543];[8541];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09025_.mp3
He was a good man. Put me up in his home for a year back after I left the order. War hero, too, or so I hear.;[];;[8544];[8542];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09026_.mp3
I wouldn't mind helping the fellow, if we can. I owe it to him. Or you can be a young monkey-lizard and ignore me, I guess... well, I don't expect much these days.;[];;[];[8543];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09027_.mp3
I have a tape that shows Sunry killing Elassa.;[];;[8546];[8022];k_hjol_dialog;
So you do. I once had a holodisc that showed Mandalore doing the three-step jiggy with a rancor beast. Marvelous technology we have.;[];;[8547];[8545];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09029_.mp3
Are you suggesting the tape was falsified?;[];;[8548];[8546];k_hjol_dialog;
It may have been. I believe you should, at least, keep that possibility in mind.;[];;[8549];[8547];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09031_.mp3
If somebody was going to go through all the trouble of making a false tape to indict Sunry you think it would have 'turned up' before now.;[];;[8550];[8548];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09032_.mp3
Maybe it would be a good idea to show the tape to Sunry. Perhaps he has an explanation. Or perhaps he doesn't.;[];;[8551];[8549];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09033_.mp3
It would be sad if this proved that Sunry did actually perform this crime, but... the truth is the truth. Whether I like it or not.;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[];[8550];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09034_.mp3
So what do you think of Sunry's verdict?;[];;[8553, 8557, 8560];[8022];k_hjol_dialog;
You did what was necessary. Sunry was guilty, as sad as that fact makes me, justice had to be done.;[];;[8554];[8552];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09036_.mp3
Doesn't matter that his victim was a Sith or that he was once a hero. I only wish that my old friend hadn't done it.;[];;[8555];[8553];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09037_.mp3
But that's the thing about wishes. They don't come true. And now Sunry's dead, which is a shame. He *was* a good man, you know... once.;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[8556];[8554];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09038_.mp3
Bah. I don't want to talk about this anymore. My jaw aches.;[];;[];[8555, 8559, 8563, 8565];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09039_.mp3
You defended him well enough. I wish we had had time to look into matters more fully, but wishing is only useful for the young and idealistic.;[];;[8558];[8552];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09040_.mp3
What's done is done. The Republic will likely appeal the matter eventually and he'll be free. I just... I just would like to know if that's best.;[];;[8559];[8557];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09041_.mp3
Sunry was a good man once. And a good friend. I'll miss him.;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[8556];[8558];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09042_.mp3
Innocent, mm? I don't know what to make of it, to tell the truth. Do you think justice has been done?;[];;[8561, 8564];[8552];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09043_.mp3
Yes, of course.;[];;[8562];[8560];k_hjol_dialog;
I see. I am not so sure. If he did kill that woman, Sunry's going to have to live with that on his conscience.;[];;[8563];[8561];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09045_.mp3
And if he's justified her death in his mind... well... Sunry was a good man, once. I only hope that is still the case. I enjoyed his company.;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[8556];[8562];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09046_.mp3
No, not really.;[];;[8565];[8560];k_hjol_dialog;
But that has little to do with the law, does it? A sad state of affairs, that. Too bad, really... Sunry was a good man, once.;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[8556];[8564];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09048_.mp3
Do you know anything about this place?;[];;[8567, 8574, 8575, 8576, 8577, 8578, 8579];[8022];k_hjol_dialog;
Oh, I know plenty about Kashyyyk. You think someone doesn't live here for twenty years and pick up a thing or two?;[];;[8568];[8566];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09007_.mp3
Chances are that by the time I finished telling you about it all, you would have found out for yourself. So there's no reason for me to start blathering on.;[{'Jolee': 'Persuade'}];;[8569];[8567];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09008_.mp3
It should be enough for me to tell you that there's kilometer after kilometer of trees on this planet. The deeper you go, the more dangerous it gets.;[];;[8570];[8568];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09009_.mp3
If you're smart, you stay on top with the Wookiees. Go deep, however, and you may find some things you weren't expecting.;[];;[8571];[8569];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09010_.mp3
And that's about all I got to say about that. Now let's get going.;[];;[8023, 8084, 8135, 8189, 8244, 8311, 8349, 8427, 8499, 8572];[8570, 8574, 8575, 8576, 8577, 8578];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09011_.mp3
Never mind.;[];;[8573];[8571, 8579, 8022];k_hjol_dialog;
Oh, I get it. Let's play with the old man's head, is it? He's half-senile, he'll forget I said anything! Wait uh, what was this about, anyway?;[];;[];[8572];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09555_.mp3
Well, unless you're one of the local species and end up being slaughtered or enslaved, Tatooine's a nice enough desert.;[];;[8571];[8566];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09012_.mp3
Pfah. Korriban's a rock. Mind the Sith.;[];;[8571];[8566];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09013_.mp3
Manaan's an unusual place. Not for its water, mind you... it's the kolto. Healing juice. Only place where it occurs in the galaxy.;[];;[8571];[8566];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09014_.mp3
Hmph. Hard to say what this planet is. Been lost for thousands of years, if not more. *Sniff* Smells like bad, bad karma so watch your step.;[];;[8571];[8566];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09015_.mp3
It's a ship. To be more specific, it's *your* ship. You tell me.;[];;[8571];[8566];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09016_.mp3
No more than you. Get going.;[];;[8023, 8084, 8135, 8189, 8244, 8311, 8349, 8427, 8499, 8572];[8566];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09017_.mp3
Can you make a healing kit for me?;[];;[8581, 8583];[8022];k_hjol_dialog;
How many could you possibly need? And besides, I don't have enough supplies on me to put some more together.;[];if the PC has too many kits;[8582];[8580];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09019_.mp3
Ask me later when you're actually in need and I'm less tired. I'm not a kit factory, you know.;[];;[];[8581];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09020_.mp3
Hmph. I suppose I could whip up something, uh... you know... few herbs and such. You do know that the best alternative is not to get hurt, right?;[];;[8584];[8580];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09021_.mp3
Not to say that you go leaping into the path of blaster fire or anything, but I know how you young people get. Here, take it.;[];;[];[8583];k_hjol_dialog;NM35AAJOLE09022_.mp3
We have a stowaway on the ship. Do you have any advice for me?;[];;[8586];[8022];k_hjol_dialog;

So you're the one Roland has got to help us interrogate this prisoner. I hope your Jedi powers will come in useful, this one has been most resistant.;[]; first time;[8615];[None];man26_repint;NM26ACREPI09000_.mp3
He's a Sith spy we picked up a little while ago snooping around outside trying to get in. We thought he was suspicious and brought him inside when the Selkath weren't looking.;[];;[8616];[8614];man26_repint;NM26ACREPI09002_.mp3
But it seems the Sith have done a pretty good job of conditioning this guy, and we haven't been able to break him yet.;[];;[8617, 8692, 8695];[8615];man26_repint;NM26ACREPI09004_.mp3
What did they do to him?;[];;[8618];[8616, 8693];man26_repint;
The Sith protect their really important spies with some sort of mental Force feedback system. They can turn their minds in on themselves so Force compulsions won't affect them.;[];;[8619];[8617];man26_repint;NM26ACREPI09006_.mp3
Combine this with conventional training to resist interrogation and it sometimes takes months to get them to tell what they know.;[];;[8620];[8618];man26_repint;NM26ACREPI09008_.mp3
Do you want to interrogate him now?;[];;[8621, 8634];[8619];man26_repint;NM26ACREPI09010_.mp3
Yes.;[];;[8622, 8638];[8620, 8633, 8698];man26_repint;
While the training the Sith gave him will protect him from most normal interrogation techniques, and also from Force persuasion, we have found a few hooks you might find useful.;[]; if the player has not interrogated him before;[8623];[8621, 8694];man26_repint;NM26ACREPI09022_.mp3
He was with another man when he was first spotted. We think it was another spy, but we didn't manage to catch him.;[];;[8624];[8622];man26_repint;NM26ACREPI09024_.mp3
We also seized some personal documents he had on him when he was captured. It would seem that he's married to a woman named Tela.;[];;[8625];[8623];man26_repint;NM26ACREPI09026_.mp3
We checked this in our computers and it seems to hold up. We've sent a couple agents to investigate, but it may be a while.;[];;[8626, 8636];[8624];man26_repint;NM26ACREPI09028_.mp3
What do I have to work with?;[];;[8627];[8625];man26_repint;
What we have here is your standard issue truth serum. It should make him spill his guts in no time. BUT, there is a catch...;[];;[8628];[8626, 8637];man26_repint;NM26ACREPI09030_.mp3
A catch?;[];;[8629];[8627];man26_repint;
Because of his conditioning, he's able to resist it at small doses. But if you give him too much, his body realizes what you're trying to do and shuts his mind down completely.;[];;[8630];[8628];man26_repint;NM26ACREPI09032_.mp3
If you do that, you'll have to inject him with an antidote that neutralizes the truth serum. Unfortunately, that, too, has a drawback.;[];;[8631];[8629];man26_repint;NM26ACREPI09034_.mp3
I detect a pattern here...;[];;[8632];[8630];man26_repint;
It causes short term memory loss. This may work to your advantage, because you can try the same tactic over and over again. But if you use it too much, he may forget everything we want to know.;[];;[8633];[8631];man26_repint;NM26ACREPI09036_.mp3
Shall we get started then?;[];;[8621, 8634];[8632];man26_repint;NM26ACREPI09038_.mp3

If you must be the one, then so be it. Be merciful and quick. A Wookiee without the honor of self-control is a mere animal.;[];;[8797];[8795];kas23_wookfem_01;

Soon after the mad son Zaalbar was sent away. Freyyr seemed to succumb to the same kind of insanity.;[];;[8809];[8771];kas23_wookfem_01;

There is no one left that is willing to stand up to the slavers. We wait for the coming of Bacca's heir.;[];;[8767, 8775, 8792, 8812];[8765];kas23_wookfem_01;
What do you mean by that? Explain.;[];;[8813];[8811];kas23_wookfem_01;
The ancient Bacca was our greatest leader. At his death, he swore that his spirit would live in our true chieftains.;[];;[8814];[8812];kas23_wookfem_01;
His sword would be the sign, and legends say we have always prospered under those that held it. No longer.;[];;[8815];[8813];kas23_wookfem_01;
No one has seen the blade for years. It is a foolish hope. We now follow Chuundar. He is sane and honorable.;[{'Wookiee': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[8767, 8775, 8792];[8814];kas23_wookfem_01;
I don't give you much thought. You are primitives.;[];;[8817];[8761];kas23_wookfem_01;

Long have we scavenged, among you and those that came before. We have things you will like for this service.;[];;[8844, 8898, 8902, 8912];[8896, 8921, 8923];tat17_11iziz_01;
Tell me about where your people are. Maybe I'll help.;[];;[8899, 8918];[8897, 8901, 8932];tat17_11iziz_01;
You know! You must know! You have stopped the attacks! Far to the south, where they hold everything stolen.;[];;[8900, 8906, 8908, 8910];[8898];tat17_11iziz_01;
A few more questions, all right?;[];;[8901];[8899, 8905, 8917, 8920];tat17_11iziz_01;
Iziz answers hoping you will free the tribe that he holds.;[];;[8844, 8898, 8902, 8912];[8900];tat17_11iziz_01;NM17AA11IZ05086_.mp3
Why have they taken your people?;[];;[8903];[8901, 8897, 8932];tat17_11iziz_01;
We find things, and they use them. Jawas slave, serving. They lead with the whip and gaffi.;[];;[8904, 8905];[8902];tat17_11iziz_01;
So these Jawas are scavengers who are enslaved by the Sand People? I think I am beginning to understand his plight.;[];;[8905];[8903];tat17_11iziz_01;NM17AA11IZ05096_.mp3
With the group that digs, we trade and are free. With People of the Sand, we serve and die. We prefer you.;[];;[8900, 8906, 8908, 8910];[8904, 8903];tat17_11iziz_01;
I'll expect payment if I do this, Jawa.;[];;[8907];[8905, 8917, 8899, 8920];tat17_11iziz_01;
A trade can be made of this for that. Iziz will see it done. We thank.;[];;[];[8906];tat17_11iziz_01;NM17AA11IZ05088_.mp3

"Tell me about ""those that came before.""";[];;[8913];[8901, 8897];tat17_11iziz_01;
You stand on Anchorhead, a place named and named again. You come to dig, but it was already dug.;[];;[8914];[8912];tat17_11iziz_01;
Settled over and over. Also long ago, ships fell after battles above. Now we scavenge and find the pieces.;[];;[8915, 8916, 8917];[8913];tat17_11iziz_01;
Hmm. I wonder just how long ago the little fella is talking, here?;[];;[8916, 8917];[8914];tat17_11iziz_01;NM17AA11IZ05104_.mp3
It could be that this Jawa knows things about this planet's history that the Republic has no inkling of.;[];;[8917];[8915, 8914];tat17_11iziz_01;NM17AA11IZ05106_.mp3
You dig the ore and dirt. In time from now, we will dig you, just like digging those that came before.;[];;[8900, 8906, 8908, 8910];[8916, 8915, 8914];tat17_11iziz_01;
People of the Sand in the sand. There is a place in the far south where they live.;[];;[8919, 8920];[8898];tat17_11iziz_01;
I'm thinking they're with the Sand People, who live in the south. Either that or I need my ears cleaned.;[];;[8920];[8918];tat17_11iziz_01;NM17AA11IZ05082_.mp3
The approach holds great fighting. Bring the tribe from in to out and there will be payment in trade and thanks.;[];;[8900, 8906, 8908, 8910];[8919, 8918];tat17_11iziz_01;
I ask that you find us, and then bring away from the People of Sand. Then we will offer a trade with you.;[];;[8897];[8895];tat17_11iziz_01;
I'm not interested, Iziz. I'm looking for more important things.;[];;[8923];[8893, 8891, 8928, 8929, 8889];tat17_11iziz_01;
Here is where we could be friends, for the Jawa find important things all the time. Things from before.;[];;[8897];[8922];tat17_11iziz_01;NM17AA11IZ05071_.mp3

Like all of you, of your kind. Never listening, never wanting. Jawa are more than scavenger traders.;[];;[8926];[8924];tat17_11iziz_01;
A little help would be returned. We know of things... things you don't. Leave then, and never know.;[];;[];[8925];tat17_11iziz_01;
Giants made of sand... Sand People?;[];;[8928, 8929];[8889];tat17_11iziz_01;
That is they! You know them well, because you have already stopped their killing. I would ask just a small sum more.;[];;[8894, 8922, 8924];[8927];tat17_11iziz_01;
That is how you know them. Giants are different for us, we being smaller. People of Sand are who I mean.;[];;[8894, 8922, 8924];[8927];tat17_11iziz_01;
Stupid creature, can't you make more sense?;[];;[8882, 8883];[8880];tat17_11iziz_01;

What can you tell me about these ruins?;[];;[9168];[9166, 9190, 9188, 9199, 9205, 9150, 9207];kor36_dakvesser;
Well... it seems that the Sith once inhabited Korriban a long time ago. There was a fortress here that was destroyed at some point before the Sith abandoned the planet completely.;[];;[9169];[9167];kor36_dakvesser;NM36AADAKV01023_.mp3
Why they left, we don't know. Perhaps the Jedi drove them off. The tombs in this valley are the only parts of the fortress we've found mostly intact.;[];;[9170, 9175, 9191, 9198];[9168];kor36_dakvesser;NM36AADAKV01024_.mp3
Made any unusual findings?;[];;[9171];[9169];kor36_dakvesser;
Some. Most of the interesting stuff is still in the tombs, but Master Uthar prefers to leave them to be explored by the students, as a challenge.;[];;[9172];[9170];kor36_dakvesser;NM36AADAKV01026_.mp3
In time, they will probably become safe enough for us to enter. Until that time, however, we're stuck to digging up the valley piece by piece.;[];;[9173, 9175, 9191, 9198];[9171];kor36_dakvesser;NM36AADAKV01027_.mp3
The tombs are dangerous?;[];;[9174];[9172];kor36_dakvesser;
Definitely dangerous. Most of the students that go inside them don't come back out. Master Uthar prefers it that way.;[];;[9175, 9191, 9198];[9173];kor36_dakvesser;NM36AADAKV01029_.mp3
What can you tell me about these tombs?;[];;[9176];[9174, 9172, 9169];kor36_dakvesser;
There's four tombs here. On the right are the tombs of Ajunta Pall and Tulak Hord. On the left are the tombs of Marka Ragnos and Naga Sadow. All four were ancient Sith Lords.;[];;[9177, 9180, 9184, 9186, 9196];[9175];kor36_dakvesser;NM36AADAKV01031_.mp3
Tell me about the tomb of Ajunta Pall.;[];;[9178];[9176, 9183, 9185, 9181];kor36_dakvesser;
That's the first tomb on the right. There's a rumor that there's a powerful artifact still in there, but nobody's retrieved it, yet.;[];;[9179];[9177];kor36_dakvesser;NM36AADAKV01033_.mp3
That tomb supposedly has ancient battle droids and traps that are still functioning. It's amazing that their power sources have lasted so long, really.;[];;[9180, 9184, 9186, 9196];[9178];kor36_dakvesser;NM36AADAKV01034_.mp3
Tell me about the tomb of Tulak Hord.;[];;[9181];[9179, 9185, 9176];kor36_dakvesser;
That's the farthest tomb on the right. We don't know much about Tulak Hord, unfortunately... the tuk'ata have a nest in that tomb, I think.;[];;[9177, 9182, 9184, 9186, 9196];[9180];kor36_dakvesser;NM36AADAKV01036_.mp3
The tuk'ata?;[];;[9183];[9181];kor36_dakvesser;
A local pack animal that's very dangerous. Occasionally the guards track down a queen and kill it... that usually pacifies them for a bit.;[];;[9177, 9184, 9186, 9196];[9182];kor36_dakvesser;NM36AADAKV01038_.mp3
Tell me about the tomb of Marka Ragnos.;[];;[9185];[9183, 9181, 9179, 9176];kor36_dakvesser;
That's the first tomb on the left. Someone mentioned that a crazy droid has holed itself up in there, but I don't know much about that.;[];;[9177, 9180, 9186, 9196];[9184];kor36_dakvesser;NM36AADAKV01040_.mp3
Tell me about the tomb of Naga Sadow.;[];;[9187];[9185, 9183, 9181, 9179, 9176];kor36_dakvesser;
It's the second tomb on the left when you enter the valley. Naga Sadow was the leader of the old Sith Masters here, we think.;[];;[9188];[9186, 9200];kor36_dakvesser;NM36AADAKV01047_.mp3
Darth Malak found something in there a while back, however, and ever since then only Master Uthar can enter it.;[];;[9151, 9167, 9189, 9191];[9187];kor36_dakvesser;NM36AADAKV01048_.mp3
What did he find? Do you know?;[];;[9190];[9188];kor36_dakvesser;
No. A lot of the discoveries are kept secret, even from the students. I only heard that Darth Malak found something there by rumor, to be honest.;[];;[9151, 9167, 9191];[9189];kor36_dakvesser;NM36AADAKV01050_.mp3
I have to go.;[];;[9192, 9195];[9190, 9188, 9199, 9197, 9174, 9172, 9169, 9166, 9205, 9150, 9207];kor36_dakvesser;
So do I.;[];;[9193];[9191];kor36_dakvesser;NM36AADAKV01052_.mp3
Goodbye, Dak... and... thank you.;[{'Juhani': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[9194];[9192];kor36_dakvesser;NM36AADAKV01053_.mp3
Goodbye, Juhani.;[{'Dak Vesser': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[];[9193];kor36_dakvesser;NM36AADAKV01054_.mp3
Alright. Just be careful if you head into any of those tombs.;[];;[];[9191];kor36_dakvesser;NM36AADAKV01055_.mp3
Anything else I should know?;[];;[9197];[9185, 9183, 9181, 9179, 9176];kor36_dakvesser;
Nothing that I can think of. There's supposedly some old Sith hermit that haunts these hills and kidnaps students. Might want to watch out for him.;[];;[9151, 9191, 9198];[9196];kor36_dakvesser;NM36AADAKV01043_.mp3
Have you heard about a Star Map being found here?;[];;[9199];[9197, 9174, 9172, 9169, 9166, 9205, 9150, 9207];kor36_dakvesser;
A Star Map? No, I haven't heard anything about that. Something like that could be in Naga Sadow's tomb, I suppose... that tomb's off limits to the students.;[];;[9151, 9167, 9191, 9200];[9198];kor36_dakvesser;NM36AADAKV01045_.mp3
Naga Sadow's tomb?;[];;[9187];[9199];kor36_dakvesser;
How can I trust you not to say anything?;[];;[9202];[9161];kor36_dakvesser;
Does it matter? I'm going. Isn't that enough for you?;[];;[9203];[9201];kor36_dakvesser;NM36AADAKV01017_.mp3
Let him go. He... won't say anything.;[];;[9166];[9202];kor36_dakvesser;NM36AADAKV01018_.mp3
So you're leaving? Just like that?;[];;[9166];[9161];kor36_dakvesser;
Master Uthar won't allow us to dig with lasers or sonics... we have to use hand tools only so we don't accidentally destroy anything we run across. That makes progress very slow, however.;[];;[9167, 9191, 9198];[9152];kor36_dakvesser;NM36AADAKV01021_.mp3
Back again? Something... oh. Juhani... is... that you?;[];if he hasn't talked with Juhani yet Juhani is in the party;[9153];[None];kor36_dakvesser;NM36AADAKV01056_.mp3
Back again? Something else I can tell you?;[];if juhani isn't in the party or he hasn't introduced himself;[9151, 9167, 9191, 9198];[None];kor36_dakvesser;NM36AADAKV01057_.mp3
Welcome to Anchorhead, potential customer. Czerka Corporation stands ready to serve, after some formalities, of course.;[];Initates with the player when they first exit the ebon hawk This is the customs official in the landing area just outside the ebon hawk. Like on Kashyyyk, he will not let the player disembark without paying the landing fee. Player can persuade his way out of it, though. Moves a short ways back after initiating dialogue, but always stays in the bay.;[9209];[None];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01000_.mp3
First, your ship is not on our list of planned arrivals for today. There is a docking fee of 100 credits because of this.;[];;[9210, 9300, 9302];[9208];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01002_.mp3
What do I get for my 100 credits?;[];;[9211];[9209, 9301, 9304];tat17_01cust_01;
The immediate benefit is access to these very docking facilites. This is the only port in Anchorhead.;[];;[9212];[9210];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01004_.mp3
Once you've paid we will offer trade services as well. We're not unreasonable, we just want to cover expenses.;[];;[9213, 9287, 9289, 9293, 9297, 9300, 9302];[9211];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01006_.mp3
[Force Persuade] I don't need to pay the fee.;[];;[9214, 9286];[9212, 9290];tat17_01cust_01;
[Success] You know... I don't think you need to pay the fee. We'll let it go, this time.;[{'Player': 'Persuade'}];;[9215, 9216, 9284, 9285];[9213];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01108_.mp3
*whisper* Heh! Reminds me of my old smuggling days. Nothing better than the old Jedi mind trick for getting past an overly curious customs officer.;[];;[9216];[9214];tat17_01cust_01;NGLOBEJOLE09760_.mp3
This will cover any future landings as well. It's like a registration, so we can serve you better when you return.;[];;[9217];[9215, 9284, 9285, 9214, 9288, 9292];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01010_.mp3
Now, as a customs officer, I can provide information on services. Is this visit business or pleasure?;[];;[9218, 9252, 9260, 9261, 9268];[9216];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01012_.mp3
Give me some background on Tatooine.;[];;[9219];[9217, 9251, 9259, 9267, 9305];tat17_01cust_01;
There isn't much to tell. It's a very old planet, well past its prime. Czerka Corporation is the only company with any interest in it.;[];;[9220];[9218];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01014_.mp3
It's not a very pretty world, but there is opportunity here if you know where to look.;[];;[9221, 9237, 9266, 9274];[9219];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01016_.mp3
Tell me about Czerka Corporation's operations here.;[];;[9222];[9220, 9273, 9246, 9275, 9279, 9277, 9240];tat17_01cust_01;
I can't really get into that. It hasn't been a very smooth operation. I shouldn't get into it.;[];;[9223, 9237, 9266, 9274, 9282];[9221];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01018_.mp3
[Persuade] Come now friend, let me in on the details.;[];;[9224, 9281];[9222];tat17_01cust_01;
[Success] Ah, it's common knowledge, so there's no harm in telling you. It's a tale of bad business.;[];;[9225];[9223];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01020_.mp3
You see, Czerka Corporation staked their claim to this planet based on some very promising geological surveys.;[];;[9226];[9224, 9283];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01022_.mp3
Unfortunately, that information was incorrect, and possibly even an attempt at sabotage by a rival company.;[];;[9227, 9237, 9266, 9274];[9225];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01024_.mp3
So Czerka Corporation set up shop on a barren planet.;[];;[9228];[9226];tat17_01cust_01;
Not totally barren. There were a few years of good mining, and limited operations are still in place.;[];;[9229];[9227];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01026_.mp3
But the ore is flawed. It has peculiar properties. They've had to look at other forms of business.;[];;[9230, 9234, 9237, 9266, 9274];[9228];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01028_.mp3
"What do you mean when you say the ore is ""peculiar""?";[];;[9231];[9229, 9236];tat17_01cust_01;
Czerka Corporation has really tried to hide this, but it just seems that Tatooine metal is unfit for effective manufacturing.;[];;[9232];[9230];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01030_.mp3
I would imagine that this outpost will eventually be abandoned. Nobody is making any money here.;[];;[9233];[9231];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01032_.mp3
Of course, this rock may have been settled a few times, so look for some other company to get stuck with it.;[];;[9234, 9237, 9266, 9274];[9232];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01034_.mp3
What other forms of business are being looked at here?;[];;[9235];[9233, 9229];tat17_01cust_01;
Pursuits that appeal to the casual traveler. There are some fearsome native species that provide exciting hunting.;[];;[9236];[9234];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01036_.mp3
There are also lengthy barren wastes that serve as fine swoop tracks. Attracting business has been slow, however.;[];;[9230, 9237, 9266, 9274];[9235];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01038_.mp3
What is known about the history of the planet?;[];;[9238];[9236, 9233, 9229, 9226, 9281, 9222, 9220];tat17_01cust_01;
Very little. There are hints that it might once have been a lush world, but I can't picture it as anything but a desert.;[];;[9239];[9237];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01044_.mp3
Native sentient species have no records going back that far. That was hundreds of years ago. Maybe thousands.;[];;[9240];[9238];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01046_.mp3
Of course, the native species are not very willing to tell anyone anything. They're barely more than animals.;[];;[9221, 9241, 9266, 9274, 9276];[9239];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01048_.mp3
What species do you mean?;[];;[9242];[9240];tat17_01cust_01;
The Sand People. They're vicious, and attack outsiders on sight. More animal than anything, really.;[];;[9243];[9241, 9280];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01050_.mp3
Maybe they know the history of Tatooine, maybe they don't. Impossible to tell. They won't cooperate.;[];;[9244, 9266, 9270, 9276];[9242];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01052_.mp3
Have you had trouble with the Sand People?;[];;[9245];[9243, 9273];tat17_01cust_01;
Not personally, but they've given Czerka Corporation a rough time. It's hard enough mining this rock without suffering random attacks.;[];;[9246, 9275];[9244];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01054_.mp3
But it is getting better. I think someone went out on the dunes and laid down the law. Heh. I'm sure Czerka Corporation paid them well.;[];;[9221, 9247, 9266, 9270, 9274];[9245];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01058_.mp3
Where can I get information about jobs like that?;[];;[9248];[9246, 9275];tat17_01cust_01;
It depends on what level of risk you want to take. You could ask at the Czerka office if any bounties need collecting. That's in central Anchorhead.;[];;[9249];[9247, 9260, 9274];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01072_.mp3
While you're at the office, ask for a hunting license so you can sell trophies to Fazza in his lodge just north of them.;[];;[9250];[9248];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01074_.mp3
I suppose you could also take up swoop racing. Talk to the Hutt at the registration office by the track. That's in west Anchorhead.;[];;[9251];[9249];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01076_.mp3
I can't say I know which of these jobs is the most dangerous. I stay away from all of them.;[];;[9218, 9252, 9261, 9268];[9250];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01078_.mp3
I'm looking for very specific things. Who should I ask?;[];Player does not already have the star map;[9253];[9251, 9267, 9217, 9305];tat17_01cust_01;
That's not much information. Could you tell me more?;[];;[9254, 9256, 9263];[9252];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01080_.mp3
No, I'm sorry.;[];;[9255];[9253];tat17_01cust_01;
Then you're on your own. Ask around Anchorhead. Someone may be able to help you.;[];;[9256, 9263, 9266];[9254];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01082_.mp3
I'm looking for older things. Antiques. Artifacts.;[];;[9257];[9255, 9253];tat17_01cust_01;
You a digger? I've heard of ruins being found now and then, but they've always been stripped by Sand People soon after.;[];;[9258];[9256];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01086_.mp3
You're not going to get anywhere with them. I guess you could ask around, but I doubt you'll learn anything different.;[];;[9259];[9257];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01088_.mp3
You could always ask a Jawa. It's hard to tell what they know.;[];;[9218, 9260, 9261];[9258, 9265];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01095_.mp3
I'll need good paying work. What is there to do?;[];;[9248];[9259, 9267, 9217, 9305];tat17_01cust_01;
Actually, I really need to get going.;[];;[9262];[9259, 9267, 9251, 9217, 9305];tat17_01cust_01;
As you wish. If you need anything else, I'll be here.;[];;[];[9261];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01099_.mp3
I'm looking for a Star Map. Very old. Very complex.;[];;[9264];[9255, 9253];tat17_01cust_01;
A Star Map? That's old holo-tech, isn't it? Not much reason to outfit this dry rock with tech like that.;[];;[9265];[9263];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01091_.mp3
You could ask around, but for something like that you'll probably have to go digging. I wouldn't know where to begin.;[];;[9259];[9264];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01093_.mp3
Let's go back to my other questions.;[];;[9267];[9255, 9273, 9246, 9275, 9279, 9277, 9243, 9240, 9236, 9233, 9229, 9226, 9281, 9222, 9220, 9290];tat17_01cust_01;
I will answer as best I can. What will you need while on Tatooine?;[];;[9218, 9252, 9260, 9261, 9268];[9266];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01084_.mp3
I'm done with you. Stay out of my business, or else!;[];;[9269];[9267, 9251, 9217, 9305];tat17_01cust_01;
There is no need for that. I'm just doing my job. You are free to move as you wish.;[];;[];[9268];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01097_.mp3
Any other sentient races?;[];;[9271];[9246, 9275, 9243];tat17_01cust_01;
The Jawas are scavengers and a bit primitive. Hard to understand. They have an affinity for Droids.;[];;[9272];[9270];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01060_.mp3
Some of our scientists believe that they may not be native to the planet, but how they got here they may not even know. As I said, they're hard to understand.;[];;[9273];[9271];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01062_.mp3
They usually end up slaves to the Sand People. They aren't fighters. Good traders, though.;[];;[9221, 9244, 9266, 9274];[9272];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01064_.mp3
Where should a person look for opportunity?;[];;[9248];[9273, 9246, 9275, 9279, 9277, 9240, 9236, 9233, 9229, 9226, 9281, 9222, 9220];tat17_01cust_01;
I think the company has even put a bounty on them, but I'm sure not going to try for it.;[];;[9221, 9247, 9266, 9270, 9274];[9245];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01056_.mp3
What about the city of Anchorhead? How old is it?;[];;[9277];[9243, 9240];tat17_01cust_01;
The site is quite old. From the look of it, it's been settled before. Czerka Corporation claimed it only a few decades ago.;[];;[9221, 9266, 9274, 9278, 9280];[9276];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01066_.mp3
What was here before?;[];;[9279];[9277];tat17_01cust_01;
Some other corporation that went under, probably. Not a lot of records are kept about backwater places like this.;[];;[9221, 9266, 9274, 9280];[9278];tat17_01cust_01;NM17AB01CU01068_.mp3
What species was giving you trouble?;[];;[9242];[9279, 9277];tat17_01cust_01;

He was lost in a Sand People raid we suffered not too long ago. There were prisoners taken, but our rescue parties never found anyone alive.;[];;[9406];[9404, 9519];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01014_.mp3
In the end it just wasn't cost effective to keep searching. All miners sign a waiver absolving Czerka Corporation of liability in these circumstances.;[];;[9407, 9518];[9405];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01016_.mp3
So your workers are all expendable?;[];;[9408];[9406];tat17_10czerk_01;
Czerka Corporation cares deeply for all of its employees. That's why we've started a bounty program to thin the Sand People numbers.;[];;[9409];[9407];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01018_.mp3
We didn't find his body so we have to assume he was taken prisoner. Whether he's still alive, I couldn't say.;[];;[9410];[9408, 9518];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01021_.mp3

Is there some type of reward for saving him?;[];;[9412];[9410];tat17_10czerk_01;
As I said, all employees have signed waivers absolving Czerka Corporation of any financial liability if this occurs. It is the industry standard.;[];;[9413];[9411];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01025_.mp3
I suppose you could apply for special dispensation from the Czerka Corporation Representative Kiosk on Coruscant. Business hours only, please.;[];;[9414, 9449];[9412];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01027_.mp3
Never mind. I want to ask you about something else.;[];;[9415];[9413, 9410, 9523, 9397];tat17_10czerk_01;
Very well, though I do have work to get back to.;[];;[9396, 9416, 9418, 9449, 9457, 9485];[9414, 9438];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01102_.mp3
I have gaffi sticks to redeem for bounties.;[];Player has hunting liscense. AND (Player has gaffi sticks OR player has Chieftan's Gaffi);[9417, 9494];[9415, 9417, 9496, 9395, 9527, 9528];tat17_10czerk_01;
Of course. You have done a good job for us and I'm happy to pay you.;[];player has already turned in the Chieftans Gaffi Remove gaffi sticks. Pay 100 percent of their value for each;[9396, 9416, 9418, 9446, 9449, 9457, 9485];[9416];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01039_.mp3
I want to ask about hunting licenses.;[];player has not been given a license;[9419];[9417, 9496, 9415, 9395, 9527, 9528];tat17_10czerk_01;
As I said, we are no longer selling them. There are too many people cavorting about outside the walls as it is.;[];Player has not already acquired a pass;[9420, 9424, 9438, 9441, 9442];[9418];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01065_.mp3
Why would I need a license anyway?;[];;[9421];[9419, 9430, 9428, 9445];tat17_10czerk_01;
We use them to insure that only people judged fit by Czerka Corporation are allowed outside the city.;[];;[9422];[9420];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01067_.mp3
We don't allow casual exploration because of legal concerns. Czerka Corporation takes no responsibility for loss of life on the dunes.;[];;[9423];[9421];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01069_.mp3
It's just so we can keep track of people. No one leaves the city without a Czerka hunting license.;[];;[9424, 9438, 9441, 9442];[9422];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01071_.mp3
There is no way to get a license?;[];player has not been told about Sand People bounty;[9425];[9423, 9445, 9419];tat17_10czerk_01;
Well, normally we charge 200 credits, but I could make an exception if you agreed to perform a task for us. It's similar to hunting.;[];;[9426];[9424];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01073_.mp3
The Sand People are becoming a problem. They destroy our sandcrawlers and kill our miners. One particular tribe is the worst.;[];;[9427];[9425, 9441];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01075_.mp3
It's as if their chieftain has decided to wage a war against us. I would like their attacks... terminated. Bring me their gaffi sticks as proof.;[];;[9428];[9426];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01077_.mp3
If you agree to do this, I'll give you a hunting license now and pay a bounty for each stick later. I'll give a bonus for the chieftain's.;[];;[9420, 9429, 9431, 9434, 9438];[9427];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01079_.mp3
Why pay for the gaffi sticks? Why not their heads?;[];;[9430];[9428];tat17_10czerk_01;
Which would you rather have dumped on your office floor? Besides, they are ceremonial weapons unique to each warrior. It's just as good.;[];;[9420, 9431, 9434, 9438];[9429];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01081_.mp3
I don't want to do this.;[];;[9432];[9430, 9428];tat17_10czerk_01;
Then you are free to not leave the city, just like everyone else. Czerka Corporation will welcome your eventual change of mind.;[];;[9433];[9431];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01083_.mp3
Please, feel free to enjoy the door behind you.;[];;[];[9432];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01085_.mp3
I will agree to do this for you.;[];;[9435];[9430, 9428];tat17_10czerk_01;
Excellent. Now, just so we understand each other, this is an enforceable contract. Czerka Corporation takes this very seriously.;[];;[9436];[9434];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01087_.mp3
Here is your license, and a few directions. We believe one of their enclaves is in the far south of the Dune Sea.;[];;[9437];[9435];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01089_.mp3
You might try following one of our sandcawlers. They are regularly attacked. I wouldn't mind you escorting them.;[];;[9438, 9439];[9436];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01091_.mp3
Let's go back to my first questions.;[];;[9415];[9437, 9430, 9428, 9445, 9423, 9419, 9448, 9456, 9453, 9481, 9477, 9473, 9469, 9482, 9465, 9463, 9461, 9459, 9491, 9493, 9487];tat17_10czerk_01;
I'll go get to it then.;[];;[9440];[9437];tat17_10czerk_01;
Very good. Czerka Corporation looks forward to your future business.;[];;[];[9439];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01093_.mp3
What was it you wanted me to do for a license?;[];;[9426];[9423, 9445, 9419];tat17_10czerk_01;
Have there been a lot of people leaving the city?;[];;[9443];[9423, 9419];tat17_10czerk_01;
With the downturn in mining, people want any chance at credits they can get. Most wouldn't survive a day, let alone qualify as hunters.;[];;[9444];[9442];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01096_.mp3
"The last license issued before the ban was given to a woman named Marlena Venn. She'll do fine; she had a mean streak a parsec wide.";[];;[9445];[9443];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01098_.mp3
She also paid double. Exceptions like this are rare, unless it suits the company to offer them.;[];;[9420, 9424, 9438, 9441];[9444];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01100_.mp3

You have fulfilled your end of the bargain and Czerka Corporation is grateful. The Sand People will be less of a threat without their chieftain.;[];player has turned in chieftan's gaffi;[9448];[9446];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01104_.mp3
I will of course continue to give you bounties on regular gaffi sticks. Every one helps.;[];;[9438, 9449];[9447];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01106_.mp3
I have to go. Goodbye.;[];;[9450];[9448, 9456, 9453, 9481, 9477, 9473, 9469, 9482, 9465, 9463, 9461, 9459, 9491, 9493, 9487, 9417, 9496, 9415, 9413, 9395, 9527, 9528];tat17_10czerk_01;
Farewell. Czerka Corporation welcomes your future inquiries.;[];;[];[9449];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01167_.mp3
Yes, we are still waiting for you to return with the Sand People Chieftain's gaffi stick. I will reward you well when you do.;[];player has not yet turned in chieftan's gaffi;[9452];[9446];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01107_.mp3
We don't have any new information on the subject. It is still possible that they have an enclave in the far south of the Dune Sea.;[];;[9453];[9451];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01109_.mp3
And I would remind you that you did agree to do this task for Czerka Corporation. We expect completion in a timely manner.;[];;[9438, 9449, 9454];[9452];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01111_.mp3
There may be a nonviolent solution to this.;[];player has been sent to purchase moisture vaporators. Sand People not hostile;[9455];[9453];tat17_10czerk_01;
I should remind you that you were not retained as a diplomatic representative. You are a hunter, and should go after your prey as we agreed.;[];;[9456];[9454];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01113_.mp3
You are not authorized to do anything other than deliver what was promised. Do so, and don't talk of this foolishness again.;[];;[9438, 9449];[9455];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01115_.mp3

Of course. Czerka Corporation records are available at our Representative Kiosk on Coruscant. Business hours please.;[];;[9459];[9457];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01117_.mp3
For your needs here, we maintain a fully stocked storehouse. Speak with Greeta Holda about any purchases.;[];;[9438, 9449, 9460, 9464];[9458];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01119_.mp3
I wanted to ask about your activities on Kashyyyk.;[];player has been to Kashyyyk;[9461];[9459, 9482, 9465];tat17_10czerk_01;
I'm sorry, but day-to-day operations of Czerka Corporation outposts are fully regionalized. I have no information on Kashyyyk.;[];;[9438, 9449, 9462, 9464];[9460];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01121_.mp3
Which is very convenient if one branch is charged with misconduct.;[];;[9463];[9461];tat17_10czerk_01;
I'm sorry, I'll have to direct you to our Representative Kiosk on Coruscant. Business hours only, please.;[];;[9438, 9449, 9464];[9462];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01123_.mp3
May I ask how your operations here on Tatooine are doing?;[];;[9465];[9463, 9461, 9459];tat17_10czerk_01;
Certainly. Please pose your questions to the Representative Kiosk on Coruscant. Business hours please.;[];;[9438, 9449, 9460, 9466, 9483];[9464];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01125_.mp3
[Persuade] Why the secrets? The company stuck you here. Tell me.;[];;[9467, 9482];[9465];tat17_10czerk_01;
[Success] I suppose you're right. It's not like you can't tell the state of things just by looking around.;[{'Protocol Officer': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[9468];[9466];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01127_.mp3
Mining operations here have not been a success. The ore is substandard, and there's less of it than surveys indicated.;[{'Protocol Officer': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[9469];[9467, 9484];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01129_.mp3
With the Sand People raids on top of it all, it's no wonder this planet has been abandoned before.;[{'Protocol Officer': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[9438, 9449, 9470, 9474, 9478];[9468];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01131_.mp3
What makes the ore substandard?;[];;[9471];[9469, 9477, 9481];tat17_10czerk_01;
No one knows. There are odd energy fluctuations on this planet, but they defy analysis or explanation.;[];;[9472];[9470];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01133_.mp3
But the effect is obvious. Ore taken from Tatooine is useless for construction. It degrades incredibly fast.;[];;[9473];[9471];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01135_.mp3
Word is getting out about it too. We're running out of buyers. Czerka Corporation is not doing well here.;[{'Protocol Officer': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[9438, 9449, 9474, 9478];[9472];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01137_.mp3
Does this mean you have plans to pull out?;[];;[9475];[9473, 9481, 9469];tat17_10czerk_01;
The company would have to be foolish to stay. It will be costly, but in the end, leaving will be cheaper than staying.;[{'Protocol Officer': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[9476];[9474];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01139_.mp3
I imagine all the heavy equipment will be abandoned. It's not worth shipping out things like sandcrawlers.;[];;[9477];[9475];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01141_.mp3
Maybe the Jawas will find a use for them when we're gone. Ha! That's a laugh!;[];;[9438, 9449, 9470, 9478];[9476];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01143_.mp3
What do you mean the planet was abandoned before?;[];;[9479];[9477, 9473, 9469];tat17_10czerk_01;
We can't ignore evidence that Anchorhead was settled more than once before, and abandoned each time.;[];;[9480];[9478];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01145_.mp3
There's probably about a century between each attempt. Just long enough for records about why it failed to disappear.;[];;[9481];[9479];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01147_.mp3
The Jawas scavenge ancient tech all the time. It's a remote world. Who knows what's here?;[];;[9438, 9449, 9470, 9474];[9480];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01149_.mp3

[Force Persuade] It would be better if you told me now.;[];;[9482, 9484];[9465];tat17_10czerk_01;

Anything out of the ordinary happening?;[];;[9486];[9417, 9496, 9415, 9395, 9527, 9528];tat17_10czerk_01;

Hmm... there was also a Jawa here earlier, saying something about needing help. I think he's out by the city gates.;[];;[9491];[9489];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01161_.mp3

No desire to mistakenly associate with the losing side, hmm?;[];;[9493];[9487];tat17_10czerk_01;
Czerka Corporation policy is not subject to your approval. It is a sound business model. Save us your commentary.;[];;[9438, 9449, 9488];[9492];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01165_.mp3

I'm sure. Czerka Corporation thanks you again.;[];;[];[9500];tat17_10czerk_01;NM17AG10CZ01048_.mp3
[Persuade] For a bit more I could maintain my vigilence in the future.;[];;[9503, 9505];[9499];tat17_10czerk_01;

I am not surprised to see you here, <FullName>. I am surprised you came alone, however. I thought you would know by now how dangerous we Genoharadan are.;[];;[9530, 9532, 9536];[None];tat18_hulas;
I knew you were too much of a coward to come alone!;[];;[9531];[9529];tat18_hulas;
Really? If you knew this, you should have been smart enough to bring your friends with you. You helped me betray the other Overseers: you should know I don't play fair.;[];;[9532, 9536];[9530];tat18_hulas;
I honored our agreement. This is between you and me alone.;[];;[9533];[9531, 9529];tat18_hulas;
You have seen me betray the other Overseers, yet you still believe a Genoharadan cares anything about honor? That is a foolish mistake, <FullName>. One you won't live to regret.;[];;[9534];[9532];tat18_hulas;
You have great potential, <FullName>. Even the Genoharadan's best agents would not likely have been able to eliminate the other three Overseers.;[];;[9535];[9533];tat18_hulas;
You even have the potential to become an Overseer yourself, one day. That's why I have to kill you here: eliminating the competition is the key to maintaining my power.;[];;[9536, 9539];[9534];tat18_hulas;
I killed the other Overseers. I can kill you too, Hulas.;[];;[9537];[9535, 9531, 9529];tat18_hulas;
The other Overseers were alone and unprepared. I am ready for you - and I have friends. Goodbye, <FullName>. Our time together was... interesting.;[];;[9538];[9536, 9546];tat18_hulas;
Brothers of the Genoharadan: attack!;[{'Hulas': 'Victory'}];;[];[9537, 9540];tat18_hulas;
Let's get this over with.;[];;[9540];[9535, 9545];tat18_hulas;
My thoughts exactly.;[];;[9538];[9539];tat18_hulas;
You are here, <FullName>. But I see you did not come alone.;[];;[9542, 9546, 9547];[None];tat18_hulas;
I see you've brought some friends as well, Hulas.;[];;[9543];[9541];tat18_hulas;
You shouldn't be surprised. You saw how I manipulated and betrayed my fellow Overseers. You should know the Genoharadan seek every advantage we can get.;[];;[9544];[9542, 9547];tat18_hulas;
I had hoped you would be gullible enough to show up alone, but obviously I underestimated you... although I see from their expressions that your friends have no clue what is going on here.;[];;[9545];[9543];tat18_hulas;
Not that it matters. If I win here, what you know of the Genoharadan will die here with you. If you win, the guild will vanish until they select new Overseers... if they even survive.;[];;[9539, 9546];[9544];tat18_hulas;
Three Genoharadan Overseers out of four are dead, Hulas. Time to finish the job!;[];;[9537];[9545, 9541];tat18_hulas;
I knew you were too much of a coward to come alone.;[];;[9543];[9541];tat18_hulas;

What... what are you doing here? I don't want any trouble with the Sith. Please, just go before... please, just go.;[];;[];[None];tar03_matrik031;
Hey - you can't come in here! This is a private apartment!;[];;[9553, 9591, 9597, 9600];[None];tar03_matrik031;
I'm here to collect the bounty on your head, Matrik!;[];;[9554];[9552, 9607];tar03_matrik031;
I knew one of Davik's scum would find me eventually. But if I die at least I'll have a clear conscience! I wonder, can you say the same?;[];;[9555, 9587];[9553];tar03_matrik031;
Clear conscience? What are you talking about?;[];;[9556];[9554];tar03_matrik031;
My testimony helped put some of the biggest criminals on Taris away for life. But Davik didn't like seeing his friends go down, so now he's got a bounty on my head.;[];;[9557, 9581, 9582];[9555, 9588, 9589, 9595];tar03_matrik031;
Maybe there's some way I could help you out of this mess.;[];;[9558];[9556, 9605];tar03_matrik031;
I don't think there's much anyone could do. And I'm getting sick of running. I've decided to make my stand right here.;[];;[9559, 9561, 9582, 9585];[9557];tar03_matrik031;
Maybe you could turn the tables. You know, have Davik eliminated.;[];;[9560];[9558, 9562, 9586];tar03_matrik031;
Getting inside Davik's base is nearly impossible. Even if I got rid of him, the Exchange would just appoint someone to his place and I'd still have a price on my head.;[];;[9561, 9581, 9582, 9585];[9559];tar03_matrik031;
Maybe you could fake your own death?;[];;[9562];[9560, 9586, 9558];tar03_matrik031;
I've already thought of that. I even came up with a plan of how to do it. But I can't pull it off while I'm holed up in here.;[];;[9559, 9563, 9581, 9582, 9585];[9561];tar03_matrik031;
Tell me your plan and I might help you out.;[];;[9564];[9562];tar03_matrik031;
The trick is getting Davik to buy it when there's no body found at the scene. If it looks like I died in a massive explosion, he won't be suspicious when my corpse never turns up.;[];;[9565];[9563];tar03_matrik031;
If I had an accomplice go back and tell Davik that they were the one who set off the explosion to eliminate me, I think I'd be home free.;[];;[9566];[9564];tar03_matrik031;
I have some demolitions experience from my own days in the Exchange so I could set it all up. But I'd need to get my hands on a permacrete detonator.;[];;[9567, 9569, 9575, 9581, 9582];[9565];tar03_matrik031;
I could get you a permacrete detonator.;[];;[9568];[9566];tar03_matrik031;
They don't usually sell them in stores here in the Lower City, but the Upper City might carry them. You might want to look there first.;[];;[];[9567, 9603];tar03_matrik031;
I have a permacrete detonator right here. Go on... take it.;[];;[9570];[9566, 9576, 9602];tar03_matrik031;
Let me see... yes, this should do the trick. There won't be anything left of this apartment but some scorching on the walls after I set this bad boy off!;[];;[9571];[9569];tar03_matrik031;
Okay, the timer's set! Now let's get out of here before it blows!;[];;[9572];[9570];tar03_matrik031;
That was quite the blast! Don't go back in there... the whole roof might cave in on your head.;[];"Matrik inits with the player as soon as they exit the room and the explosion effect has fired. At the end of this dialog have him escape area and destroy himself. If players try to open door after this it won't open and they get the message of ""The stench of smoke assails your nostrils as you approach. The door, however, is blocked by rubble on the other side and will not open.""";[9573];[9571];tar03_matrik031;
Look, I'm not a man for long goodbyes but I want to say 'thanks'. If it wasn't for you I'd be a dead man. But now I won't have to worry about anymore bounty hunters coming after me.;[];;[9574];[9572];tar03_matrik031;
So good luck, and goodbye. Now that I'm 'dead' I can't be seen wandering the streets.;[];;[];[9573];tar03_matrik031;
I've got a permacrete detonator on me... but it'll cost you.;[];;[9576];[9566, 9602];tar03_matrik031;
I don't have any credits - all I've got is the clothes on my back. But if you help me with this, you can go to Zax in the bounty office and claim the price on my head.;[];;[9569, 9577, 9579];[9575];tar03_matrik031;
I think I'll just kill you and collect the bounty instead.;[];;[9578];[9576];tar03_matrik031;
Well, you're going to have to earn it!;[];attacks player;[];[9577, 9581];tar03_matrik031;
Forget it. I'll just take my detonator and go.;[];;[9580];[9576];tar03_matrik031;
You think I'm going to just let you walk out of here with the detonator that could be my ticket to salvation? You better think again, friend!;[];;[];[9579];tar03_matrik031;
I think it's time for me to collect your bounty, Matrik!;[];;[9578];[9566, 9586, 9562, 9560, 9556, 9602, 9605];tar03_matrik031;
I don't want to get involved in this.;[];;[9583];[9566, 9586, 9562, 9560, 9558, 9556];tar03_matrik031;
Can't say I blame you. If I had it all to do again I might think twice before going up against the Exchange. I understand if you just want to leave.;[];;[9584];[9582];tar03_matrik031;
Just be careful that nobody sees you as you leave. I don't want anyone to find out I'm hiding here.;[];;[];[9583, 9604];tar03_matrik031;
Maybe you could pay Davik off?;[];;[9586];[9562, 9560, 9558];tar03_matrik031;
It wouldn't work. This goes beyond money. The Exchange wants to make an example of me. Davik won't stop until I'm dead.;[];;[9559, 9561, 9581, 9582];[9585];tar03_matrik031;
I have no conscience. Time to die.;[];;[9588, 9589, 9590];[9554];tar03_matrik031;
No, wait! I want to hear what this man means by 'clear conscience'.;[];;[9556];[9587];tar03_matrik031;NM03ADMATR05013_.mp3
Hold on a second. I want to hear what he means by 'clear conscience'.;[];;[9556];[9587];tar03_matrik031;NM03ADMATR99075_.mp3
I don't think you know who you're dealing with! I don't let criminals and thugs walk all over me!;[];;[];[9587, 9597];tar03_matrik031;
What are you doing in here? This place looks abandoned!;[];;[9592];[9552, 9607];tar03_matrik031;
None of your business. Just turn around and go back the way you came, if you know what's good for you.;[];;[9593, 9597, 9598, 9600];[9591];tar03_matrik031;
[Persuade] Are you in some sort of trouble? Do you want to talk about it?;[];;[9594, 9596];[9592];tar03_matrik031;
[Success] I... I guess I could tell you. You'll probably find out on your own eventually, anyway. Zax is giving his bounties away like candy, or so I hear.;[];;[9595];[9593];tar03_matrik031;
My name's Matrik - I used to work for the Exchange, but all the violence and killing started to get to me. I knew what I was doing was wrong, so I turned state's evidence.;[];;[9556];[9594, 9606];tar03_matrik031;
[Failure] It's not something you want to get mixed up in. Look, do yourself a favor and just leave me alone.;[];;[9597, 9598, 9600];[9593];tar03_matrik031;

I don't like your attitude!;[];;[9599];[9596, 9592];tar03_matrik031;
That's it - you've pushed me too far! You shouldn't push a man on the edge!;[];;[];[9598];tar03_matrik031;

Good... get out of here. Stay out of my apartment and my business!;[];;[];[9600];tar03_matrik031;

No, I don't have a permacrete detonator yet.;[];;[9568];[9602];tar03_matrik031;

These ruins have long been known to us, but we believed them to be merely burial mounds. Perhaps they are more than we first suspected, if Revan and Malak found something there.;[{'Dorak': 'Talk_Normal'}];;[9685, 9730, 9731, 9735];[9683];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17001_.mp3
Yes... they seemed to be searching for something;[];;[9686];[9684];dan13_vandar;
Bastila has described this shared dream to the Council in great detail. We feel it is more than a dream. It is a vision. The Force is acting through you as it acts through Bastila.;[];;[9687, 9729];[9685, 9730, 9734, 9737];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17003_.mp3
I am having visions now?;[];;[9688];[9686];dan13_vandar;
You and Bastila share a powerful connection to the Force... and each other. This is not unheard of. Connections often form between Master and student, but rarely does a bond develop so quickly.;[];;[9689];[9687, 9729];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17005_.mp3
Whatever dangers may lie ahead, we cannot ignore the destiny that has brought you and Bastila here to us. Together.;[];;[9690, 9728];[9688];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17006_.mp3
Are you saying I'm... joined with her?;[];;[9691];[9689];dan13_vandar;
You and she are linked, as is your fate to hers. Together, you two may be able to stop Darth Malak and the Sith.;[];;[9692];[9690, 9728];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17008_.mp3
But do not let your head be filled with visions of glory and power! Such thoughts are the path to the dark side.;[];;[9693];[9691];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17009_.mp3
The way of the light is long and difficult, as you must learn. Are you ready for such hardship?;[];;[9694, 9725, 9726];[9692];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17010_.mp3
Yes. I'm ready for whatever awaits me.;[];;[9695];[9693];dan13_vandar;
Understand that there is little choice in this matter, for you or us. Across the galaxy the numbers of our Order dwindle. We have sent many Jedi in quest of a way to thwart Malak's advance... many have not returned.;[];;[9696];[9694, 9725, 9727];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17012_.mp3
The Sith hunt the Jedi down like animals, ambushing and assassinating our brothers wherever they are found. We fear it is only a matter of time until they discover even this hidden refuge.;[];;[9697];[9695];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17013_.mp3
Other Jedi have fallen from the light and embraced the dark side, giving their allegiance to the Sith and Malak, their dark lord.;[];;[9698, 9721, 9723];[9696];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17014_.mp3
Jedi are turning to the dark side?;[];;[9699];[9697];dan13_vandar;
The lure of the dark side is not easy to resist. Malak's power grows as more and more planets fall to his conquering armies.;[];;[9700];[9698];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17016_.mp3
If Malak is not stopped the Republic will fall, and the Jedi will be hunted to extinction. The galaxy will enter a time of darkness and tyranny not seen for a thousand generations.;[];;[9701];[9699];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17017_.mp3
The Council has decreed that you and Bastila must investigate the ancient ruins you dreamed of... once the Council deems you ready.;[];;[9702];[9700, 9722];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17018_.mp3
Perhaps there you will find some clue, some explanation, of how Revan and Malak were corrupted. And perhaps there you shall find a way to stop them.;[];;[9703, 9713, 9719];[9701, 9724];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17019_.mp3
I'm ready now. I accept this mission.;[];;[9704];[9702];dan13_vandar;
The Force flows through you like no student we have ever seen. But you are willful and headstrong... a dangerous combination.;[];;[9705];[9703, 9718];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17021_.mp3
Before we send you to investigate the ruins, you must be trained in the ways of the Jedi so that you can resist the darkness within yourself... within all of us. Otherwise you are doomed to fail.;[];;[9706, 9710, 9711];[9704, 9716, 9717, 9720];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17022_.mp3
We don't have time for this!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[9707];[9705];dan13_vandar;

We must begin your training at once. You have a destiny upon you that you must be prepared to face. The entire fate of the galaxy is upon you.;[];;[9709];[9707, 9710];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17026_.mp3

I don't know if I want to do this... it sounds dangerous.;[];;[9714];[9702];dan13_vandar;
You have a strong affinity with the Force. With such power comes great responsibility... and danger. You may wish to deny what you are, but the Council cannot turn a blind eye.;[];;[9715];[9713];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17031_.mp3
Neither will Darth Malak. Your strength is a threat to him. In time he will learn of you and the Sith will hunt you down. It is inevitable. Defeating the Sith is the only way to save yourself.;[];;[9716, 9717, 9718];[9714];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17032_.mp3
Very well, I will help you.;[];;[9705];[9715];dan13_vandar;

[Success] Hm, yes. Your devotion is most commendable.;[];;[9705];[9719];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17037_.mp3
[Lie] Do not fear Masters, I will not fall.;[];;[9722];[9697];dan13_vandar;
[Success] If Malak is not stopped the Republic will fall, and the Jedi will be hunted to extinction. The galaxy will enter a time of darkness and tyranny not seen for a thousand generations.;[];;[9701];[9721];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17039_.mp3
How can he be stopped?;[];;[9724];[9697];dan13_vandar;
Perhaps our hope lies in the dream you and Bastila shared. The Council has come to the conclusion that you and Bastila must investigate the ancient ruins you dreamed of.;[];;[9702];[9723];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17041_.mp3
I will try my best.;[];;[9695];[9693];dan13_vandar;
[Lie] Of course, Masters. I seek to follow the light.;[];;[9727];[9693];dan13_vandar;
Good. It is well that you see how important this is and have the devotion to follow it.;[];;[9695];[9726];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17044_.mp3
What are you talking about?;[];;[9691];[9689];dan13_vandar;
I trust in your greater wisdom.;[];;[9688];[9686];dan13_vandar;
I don't want to talk about it.;[];;[9686];[9684];dan13_vandar;
What?? How would Bastila know if we shared a dream?;[];;[9732];[9684];dan13_vandar;
She says that she felt your presence within the dream, the presence she has felt within you ever since...;[];;[9733];[9731];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17049_.mp3
Master Vandar!;[];;[9734];[9732];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17050_.mp3
... ever since Taris. It is not unknown for this to happen between two people strong in the Force.;[];;[9686];[9733];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17051_.mp3
[Lie] I don't know what Bastila is talking about.;[];;[9736];[9684];dan13_vandar;
[Failure] See? Dishonesty! We are taking an incalculable risk in even considering training this one!;[{'Vrook Lamar': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[9737];[9735];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17053_.mp3
You cannot deny what you are. These dreams are part of you. The Force is part of you, though a part you cannot yet control. But through training and discipline we can teach you to live as one with the Force.;[];;[9686];[9736];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17054_.mp3
It is good to see Juhani has returned to the way of the light. You are to be commended for your role in this. Your actions give us great hope for the future.;[]; SCRIPTED  after having saved juhani;[9739, 9784];[None];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17055_.mp3
Your training is now complete, young Padawan. And perhaps now it is time we dealt with the matter of the dream you and Bastila shared.;[]; DIALOGUE  after becoming a padawan;[9740];[9738, 9789];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17131_.mp3
When we heard of the ruins in your dreams, Master Dorak recognized it as one of a series of ancient structures here on Dantooine. This one in particular lies to the east of this Enclave.;[];;[9741];[9739];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17132_.mp3
We sent a Jedi to investigate... but he has not returned. Perhaps sending him in the first place was a mistake.;[];;[9742];[9740];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17133_.mp3
"The Force is guiding you through your visions; it may be that exploring the ruins is a task tied to your destiny. That is why the Council has now decided you should be the one to investigate this.";[];;[9743];[9741];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17134_.mp3
The secrets to stopping Malak may be hidden within those ruins. You must investigate them and find what Revan and Malak were looking for.;[];;[9744, 9754, 9776, 9778, 9781];[9742];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17135_.mp3
I'd like to ask you some questions.;[];;[9745];[9743, 9775, 9797];dan13_vandar;
A Jedi must ever be seeking knowledge. What is it you wish to know?;[];;[9746, 9755, 9765, 9767, 9771];[9744];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17137_.mp3
What can you tell me about Bastila?;[];;[9747];[9745, 9780];dan13_vandar;
Bastila will be a great Jedi someday. Even among the Masters and the Council it is rare to find one so skilled in the art of Battle Meditation.;[];;[9748];[9746];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17139_.mp3
Bastila was there when Revan was slain. Did you know that?;[];;[9749, 9753, 9754];[9747];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17140_.mp3
I had no idea.;[];;[9750];[9748];dan13_vandar;
Bastila herself does not like to talk about it. She was accompanying the strike team that confronted Revan when the Dark Lord was destroyed. Her role in the death of such a promising young Jedi as Revan upset her greatly.;[];;[9751];[9749, 9753];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17142_.mp3
But Bastila knew she had to set her personal feelings aside for the sake of the galaxy and the Republic. The Force is strong with her now, and without her skill in Battle Meditation we would have lost this war long ago.;[];;[9752];[9750];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17143_.mp3
The way ahead will be difficult for young Bastila... and for you. But you must draw strength from each other. May the Force be with you.;[];;[];[9751, 9754, 9763, 9766, 9783];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17144_.mp3
Carth mentioned something about it.;[];;[9750];[9748];dan13_vandar;
I think I'll be going now.;[];;[9752];[9748, 9758, 9775, 9743];dan13_vandar;
Is there anything you can tell me about Revan and Malak?;[];;[9756];[9745, 9780];dan13_vandar;
I knew Revan as a promising young pupil. Revan was strong in the Force, but also headstrong and proud. Such traits are not unusual in a Padawan. Perhaps that was why I did not see the true extent of the danger.;[];;[9757];[9755];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17148_.mp3
Many of the young Jedi admired Revan, including Malak. When Revan set off to challenge the Mandalorians, Malak was the first to join the cause.;[];;[9758];[9756];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17149_.mp3
And when Revan fell to the dark side it was inevitable Malak would fall as well.;[];;[9754, 9759, 9764];[9757];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17150_.mp3
So Revan was stronger than Malak?;[];;[9760];[9758];dan13_vandar;
Revan was always the more powerful of the pair. When Revan fell we had hoped the Sith threat was ended. But Malak quickly assumed Revan's role and embraced the dark side as fully as his Master ever had.;[];;[9761];[9759, 9764];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17152_.mp3
You should speak to Master Dorak after this council. As Chronicler of this Academy, he can give you more details of these events. But we must concern ourselves with the present.;[];;[9762];[9760];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17153_.mp3
Now Malak leads the Sith armada against the Republic, hate and vengeance drawing him ever further down the dark path, fueling his powers until they have surpassed those of his old Master.;[];;[9763];[9761];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17154_.mp3
Only you and Bastila together can stop Malak now.;[];;[9752];[9762];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17155_.mp3
Are you saying Revan was responsible for Malak's fall?;[];;[9760];[9758];dan13_vandar;
Why doesn't Master Vrook like me?;[];;[9766];[9745, 9780];dan13_vandar;
Master Vrook may seem harsh and critical, but he understands the dangers that lie in your path. He wants you and Bastila to be fully prepared when you finally face Lord Malak.;[];;[9752];[9765];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17159_.mp3
What should be done about the Sandral and Matale families?;[];;[9768];[9745, 9780];dan13_vandar;
If Shen Matale is not returned to his father it may ignite a savage and bloody feud between the Matale and Sandral estates. We must not allow that to happen.;[]; DIALOGUE  talking to the jedi council during the sandral-matale romance;[9769];[9767];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17161_.mp3
You should ask Master Vrook about that, Padawan. He is in charge of our relations with the settlers.;[];;[9770];[9768];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17162_.mp3
The way ahead will be difficult for young Bastila... and for you. You must draw strength from each other. May the Force be with you.;[];;[];[9769];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17163_.mp3
What happened to Belaya?;[];;[9772];[9745];dan13_vandar;
We do not know. She was training here until your unfortunate incident with Juhani, then she simply disappeared...;[];;[9773];[9771];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17165_.mp3
We would like any word of her you may bring. I do not believe she has died, or fallen prey to beasts, but I worry that she may have done something rash.;[];;[9774];[9772];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17166_.mp3
She had always been close to Juhani, and her death may have hit Belaya... hard.;[];;[9775];[9773];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17167_.mp3
Is there anything else you wish to ask?;[];;[9744, 9754, 9776, 9778];[9774];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17168_.mp3
I will investigate the ruins right away.;[];;[9777];[9775, 9743];dan13_vandar;
Be sure to bring Bastila with you. There is a powerful link between you, and you will need to draw strength from each other during the trials ahead.;[];;[];[9776];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17170_.mp3
What happened to the Jedi who went to investigate?;[];;[9779];[9775, 9743];dan13_vandar;
We do not know. That is one of the things you must investigate. We... fear the worst.;[];;[9780];[9778];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17172_.mp3
Is there anything else you want to know?;[];;[9746, 9755, 9765, 9767];[9779];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17173_.mp3
I have found and slain Belaya. She had turned to the dark side.;[];;[9782];[9743];dan13_vandar;
That is most... unfortunate. She was always a model student and most eager to learn. I grieve that she had fallen to her passions.;[];;[9783];[9781];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17175_.mp3
Remember her example as well as that of Juhani: the dark side is not an enemy to be taken lightly.;[];;[9752];[9782];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17176_.mp3
Go to Master Zhar and inform him that Juhani has returned to us. I think you may be nearing the end of your apprenticeship.;[];;[];[9738];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17056_.mp3
It is most regrettable that Juhani could not be saved. We in the Council had high hopes for her in the future.;[{'Vandar Tokare': 'Flirt'}];;[9786];[None];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17057_.mp3
In every heart there is some means of redemption. Could you find none in Juhani?;[];;[9787, 9791, 9793];[9785];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17058_.mp3
I couldn't see a way to save her.;[];;[9788];[9786];dan13_vandar;
Perhaps that was the case. It is most regrettable, indeed.;[];;[9789];[9787];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17060_.mp3
Heed her example: all are susceptable to the lure of the dark side. We must always remain vigilant against it.;[];;[9739, 9790];[9788, 9792];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17061_.mp3
Go to Master Zhar and inform him that the grove has been cleansed. I think you may be nearing the end of your apprenticeship.;[];;[];[9789];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17062_.mp3
[Lie] She attacked without speaking.;[];;[9792];[9786];dan13_vandar;
[Success] Perhaps that was the case. It is most regrettable, indeed.;[];;[9789];[9791, 9793];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17064_.mp3
[Lie] She was too evil to ever come back.;[];;[9792];[9786];dan13_vandar;
Bastila has told us of your discovery in the ancient ruins. The Council has decided it would be best if you complete your apprenticeship before you embark on any further investigations in this matter.;[]; DIALOGUE  talking to the council, having explored the ruins, but before becoming a padawan;[9795];[None];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17066_.mp3
As grave as the Sith threat may be, we cannot allow you to leave here until your apprenticeship is over. The danger of the dark side is too great to send you out unprepared.;[];;[9796];[9794];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17067_.mp3
Master Zhar feels you are ready to begin the final tests of your apprenticeship. Return to us when you have completed your training.;[];;[];[9795];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17068_.mp3
Good evening, apprentice. I trust your training goes well?;[]; DIALOGUE  after being accepted for jedi training but before becoming a padawan;[9744, 9798, 9800, 9803];[None];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17069_.mp3
My training is progressing quite well.;[];;[9799];[9797];dan13_vandar;
I have faith that you will achieve the rank of Padawan soon. Master Zhar is most impressed with your progress. May the Force be with you, apprentice.;[];;[];[9798, 9802];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17071_.mp3
I seek knowledge of the Jedi Code.;[];;[9801];[9797];dan13_vandar;
All Jedi must know the code, its tenets are the fundamental teachings of our Order. Think and meditate on these truths, apprentice:;[];;[9802];[9800];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17073_.mp3
"There is no emotion; there is peace. There is no ignorance; there is knowledge. There is no passion; there is serenity. There is no chaos; there is harmony. There is no death; there is the Force.";[];;[9799];[9801];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17074_.mp3
I must be going now.;[];;[9804];[9797];dan13_vandar;
Very well. May the Force be with you.;[];;[];[9803];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17106_.mp3
Ah, you have returned, young Padawan. Have you discovered what it was that Revan and Malak sought in those ruins?;[];;[9806, 9843];[None];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17123_.mp3
We found an incomplete Star Map and mention of something called a Star Forge.;[];;[9807];[9805];dan13_vandar;
This news of a Star Forge is disturbing. Action is required, but we must not do so in haste. We must discuss recent events in light of this new information.;[];;[9808];[9806, 9845, 9847];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17125_.mp3
We should consult the Jedi archives to see if there is any mention of this 'Star Forge' and what it might do. We must learn why Revan and Malak sought it out.;[];;[9809];[9807];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17126_.mp3
Return to your ship with Bastila and we will summon you when we are done.;[];;[9810];[9808];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17127_.mp3
Padawan, you have done well in discovering the Star Map hidden within the ancient ruins. But there is more you must do in the battle against Malak and the Sith.;[]; SCRIPTED  talking to the jedi council after discovering the star map;[9811];[9809];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17177_.mp3
We Jedi know victory over the Sith will not come through martial might. The Council has a mission for you, Padawan.;[];;[9812];[9810];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17178_.mp3
I have consulted our vast archives in an effort to discover the nature of this 'Star Forge', but all my efforts have been in vain.;[];;[9813];[9811];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17179_.mp3
"Still, the Council are in agreement: the Star Forge must be found! Revan and Malak sought it out when they began their tragic fall; the Star Forge is surely a powerful tool of the dark side.";[];;[9814];[9812];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17180_.mp3
The Star Map in the ruins showed you four planets, but it was incomplete. It did not show the location of the Star Forge itself. We believe there may be similar Star Maps on other planets.;[];;[9815];[9813];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17181_.mp3
Each Star Map is likely a small piece of a larger puzzle. Find the Star Maps on Kashyyyk, Tatooine, Manaan and Korriban and we believe they will lead you to the Star Forge.;[];;[9816, 9840];[9814];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17182_.mp3
I am ready to do the Council's will.;[];;[9817];[9815];dan13_vandar;
The Jedi numbers have been ravaged by this war, by defections to Malak's cause and by Sith assassins. But we realize the importance of this mission.;[];;[9818];[9816, 9842];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17184_.mp3
Yet if we sent a company of Jedi Knights with you we would surely draw the full attention of Malak and the Sith, dooming your efforts to failure.;[];;[9819, 9839];[9817];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17185_.mp3
Am I to undertake this task alone?;[];;[9820];[9818];dan13_vandar;
Secrecy is our best defense against the Sith, but it would be foolish to send you on this quest without someone to aid you, young Padawan.;[];;[9821];[9819, 9839];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17187_.mp3
Bastila will accompany you, for there is a powerful connection between you two... a connection that might be the key to unraveling the mysteries uncovered by Revan.;[];;[9822, 9837];[9820];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17188_.mp3
And Juhani has also asked to accompany you. After long deliberation we have granted her request.;[];;[9823];[9821];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17189_.mp3
Juhani nearly fell to the dark side. Perhaps her presence will serve as a reminder to you of the dangers of that path.;[];;[9824, 9836];[9822];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17190_.mp3
There are others I want to join me.;[];;[9825];[9823, 9837];dan13_vandar;
"Of course those who aided you on Taris will also come; they possess skills you may find useful in your quest. Remember that secrecy and discretion are paramount to your success.";[];;[9826];[9824, 9836, 9838];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17192_.mp3
You will not be able to hide the fact that you are Jedi, nor should you. But the true nature of your mission must not reach Malak's ears.;[];;[9827];[9825];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17193_.mp3
You may return here at any time. Dantooine will be a sanctuary for you, a safe haven. Here you can find supplies and whatever advice or other aid we may give you.;[];;[9828, 9833, 9834];[9826];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17194_.mp3
You can count on me. I will not fail.;[];;[9829];[9827];dan13_vandar;
"You can leave whenever you wish; the sooner the better. The longer you wait the stronger Malak becomes. But first a warning, young Padawan:";[];;[9830];[9828, 9833, 9835];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17196_.mp3
The lure of the dark side is difficult to resist. I fear this quest to find the Star Forge could lead you down an all too familiar path.;[];;[9831];[9829];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17197_.mp3
The fate of the galaxy is in your hands, young Padawan. We pray you are up to the challenge.;[];;[9832];[9830, 9869];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17210_.mp3
May the Force be with you.;[];;[];[9831];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17211_.mp3
When do I leave?;[];;[9829];[9827];dan13_vandar;
Why should I risk my life to stop Malak?;[];;[9835];[9827];dan13_vandar;
This was already explained to you. Your command of the Force makes you a threat to Malak. Eventually he will destroy you, and all the Jedi, unless you stop him first.;[];;[9829];[9834];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17200_.mp3
Great... Bastila and the cat woman. Anyone else you want to stick me with?;[];;[9825];[9823];dan13_vandar;
Keep the example of Juhani fresh in your mind. You may need a reminder of the dangers of the path that leads to the dark side.;[];;[9824, 9838];[9821];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17202_.mp3
Great... Bastila again. Anyone else you want to stick me with?;[];;[9825];[9837];dan13_vandar;
Good. Others will only slow me down.;[];;[9820];[9818];dan13_vandar;
Sounds like a suicide mission to me.;[];;[9841];[9815];dan13_vandar;

"Peace, Vrook. We have discussed this; there is no other choice.";[];;[9817];[9841];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17207_.mp3
[Lie] No, I could not find anything.;[];;[9844, 9846];[9805];dan13_vandar;
What are you talking about? The Council must be told of what we found there!;[];;[9845];[9843];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17306_.mp3
We found an incomplete Star Map, Master Vandar. And an ancient droid that mentioned something about a Star Forge.;[];;[9807];[9844];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17307_.mp3
Lies! Bastila has already told us about this 'Star Forge' and the map you found!;[];;[9847];[9843];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17129_.mp3
Peace, Master Vrook. I'm certain the Padawan only meant they had not found anything beyond what Bastila would surely have told us.;[];;[9807];[9846];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17130_.mp3
There has been a report of a terrible battle near the Sandral estate to the south of the Enclave. Apparently a large force of droids attacked the estate.;[{'Vandar Tokare': 'Flirt'}];;[9849];[None];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17107_.mp3
The defending droids returned in kind. The attacking family was apparently the Matale family launching an attack on the Sandral estate.;[];;[9850];[9848];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17108_.mp3
Both entire families were slain, including the boy Shen who had been reported missing.;[];;[9851];[9849];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17109_.mp3
There was a mention that someone noticed one or more other persons leaving the battle area after the conflict had finished. You were in that area, were you not? Did you see something?;[];;[9852, 9859, 9860];[9850];dan13_vandar;NM13AAVAND17110_.mp3
[Lie] No, I was somewhere else.;[];;[9853];[9851];dan13_vandar;

The first dialog is when the player first meets Rahasia, either after having talked to Nurik, or having gone in the back door and found her in her room.   The second dialog is if the player has offended Rahasia in a previous conversation.   The third dialog is if the player has talked to Shen and been told he won't leave without her.   The fourth dialog is for conversations after Rahasia has asked the player to free Shen, but before learning that he won't leave without her.

Of course not. It seems very simple to me. The Council must be allowed to decide the next step.;[];;[9884];[9882];dan16_rahasia;NM16AARAHA02011_.mp3
No! Since Casus went missing my father has become unstable, he might hurt him if you do that! He no longer even cares if the Matales are responsible for what happened to Casus.;[];;[9885];[9883, 9881, 9907];dan16_rahasia;NM16AARAHA02013_.mp3

I wasn't aware we were giving tours now. Leave me.;[];;[];[None];kas22_czerkam_01;NM22AACZER04004_.mp3
You'd think they'd be grateful to leave this barbaric place.;[];;[];[None];kas22_czerkam_01;NM22AACZER04005_.mp3
Three restraining collars failed on the last shipment. The buyer was not pleased.;[];;[];[None];kas22_czerkam_01;NM22AACZER04006_.mp3
You're probably here with the new restraining collars. I'm not handling another shipment without them.;[];;[];[None];kas22_czerkam_01;NM22AACZER04007_.mp3
Huh? What? Oh... sorry. I didn't see you there. My attention was kind of focused on the Twi'lek dancers. Look at them waggle those head-tails!;[];;[10140, 10141, 10199];[None];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13000_.mp3
Ugh - what a pig! He even makes Gamorreans look classy.;[];;[10141, 10199];[10139];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13002_.mp3
Don't worry, honey - alien girls aren't really my thing. I'm much more interested in an attractive female of my own species.;[];;[10142, 10149, 10161, 10193, 10195];[10140, 10139];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13004_.mp3
You're the guy who put the bounty on Dia's head, right?;[];;[10143];[10141, 10160, 10156, 10154, 10151, 10194, 10196, 10199, 10203, 10204];tar03_holdan031;
You're here about that? I guess Zax must have mentioned me to you at the bounty office. Fair enough - I don't care who takes her out, just so long as the job gets done.;[];;[10144];[10142];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13010_.mp3
I can't let her get away with what she did - that wench tried to cut me with her vibroblade!;[];;[10145, 10149, 10161, 10165, 10171, 10187];[10143];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13012_.mp3
Dia's dead. I killed her myself.;[];;[10146];[10144, 10190, 10202];tar03_holdan031;
Really? Huh... I guess that's it then. A real shame it had to come to this. She was a good looking gal despite her temper. Ah, well. Plenty more ladies out there for me.;[];;[10147, 10164];[10145];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13081_.mp3
Where's my payment?;[];;[10148];[10146];tar03_holdan031;
If you want to collect the bounty, go talk to Zax. I gave him the credits for safe keeping. As far as I'm concerned my part in this is over.;[];;[10149, 10161];[10147, 10164];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13083_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;[];;[10150];[10148, 10188, 10170, 10168, 10144, 10141, 10199, 10201, 10202, 10203, 10204];tar03_holdan031;
I don't want to waste my time answering a bunch of questions... I'm here to have a few drinks, watch the dancing girls and enjoy myself.;[];;[10151];[10149];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13028_.mp3
I've got to be mentally ready. Davik's got an assignment for me off planet as soon as the quarantine ends.;[];;[10142, 10152, 10161];[10150];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13030_.mp3
You work for Davik?;[];;[10153];[10151, 10194, 10196];tar03_holdan031;
I'm one of his top couriers. Davik's always sending me off planet to deliver and bring back packages. He knows he can trust me to follow my orders to the letter.;[];;[10154];[10152];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13032_.mp3
Plus, I used to be an intergalactic customs agent so I know all the tricks they use to catch smugglers. That gives me the edge I need on my courier runs.;[];;[10142, 10155, 10157, 10161];[10153];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13034_.mp3
You're pretty open about what you do.;[];;[10156];[10154, 10160];tar03_holdan031;
It's not like it's some big secret. It's kind of hard for Davik to keep a low profile when he belongs to a big intergalactic crime syndicate like the Exchange.;[];;[10142, 10157, 10161];[10155];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13036_.mp3
Do you think Davik could get me off Taris?;[];;[10158];[10156, 10154];tar03_holdan031;
Davik's ship is the fastet one in the entire quadrant, but even the Ebon Hawk can't get off Taris until the quarantine is lifted. The Sith fleet has the planet surrounded.;[];;[10159];[10157];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13038_.mp3
Any ship leaving orbit without the proper access codes will be disintegrated by the Sith auto-targeting laser cannons - and those codes are locked safely away in the military base.;[];;[10160];[10158];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13040_.mp3
Davik's pretty upset about it. His smuggling operation isn't making any money, but even with his underworld connections he can't get his hands on those codes.;[];;[10142, 10155, 10161];[10159];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13042_.mp3
I'll be going now.;[];;[10162, 10163];[10160, 10156, 10154, 10151, 10148, 10183, 10181, 10172, 10188, 10170, 10168, 10144, 10196, 10194, 10141, 10199, 10201, 10202, 10203, 10204];tar03_holdan031;
Hate to see a pretty lady leaving, but you ain't the only girl in this place. I guess I'll go back to enjoying the dancers.;[];;[];[10161];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13049_.mp3
Fine by me. That means I get to go back to enjoying the dancing girls.;[];;[];[10161, 10186];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13051_.mp3
So what happens now?;[];;[10148];[10146];tar03_holdan031;
Why would she do that?;[];;[10166];[10144, 10190];tar03_holdan031;
Because she's crazy! She started screaming that I was making advances, and the next thing I know she's coming at me with a knife.;[];;[10167, 10168, 10191, 10192];[10165];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13014_.mp3
It sounds to me like the woman was defending herself.;[];;[10168];[10166];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13016_.mp3
I admit I was drunk. Maybe I got a little fresh. But it was no big deal. She didn't have to cut me!;[];;[10149, 10161, 10169, 10171, 10187];[10167, 10191, 10192, 10166];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13020_.mp3
Sounds like maybe you got what you deserved.;[];;[10170];[10168];tar03_holdan031;
Hey - you weren't there. She totally over-reacted!;[];;[10149, 10161, 10171, 10187];[10169];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13022_.mp3
I want the bounty on Dia's head removed.;[];;[10172, 10184];[10170, 10190, 10188, 10168, 10144, 10202];tar03_holdan031;
Hey, it's like I told you before - you come up with 200 credits and I'll remove the bounty. Otherwise she's got to pay the price.;[];;[10161, 10173, 10175, 10180, 10182];[10171];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13058_.mp3
Here's 200 credits. Now get that bounty removed.;[];;[10174];[10172, 10181, 10183, 10185];tar03_holdan031;
Don't worry - I'll stick to my end of the bargain. I'll go tell Zax right now that the bounty is off the table.;[];;[];[10173, 10176, 10179];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13063_.mp3
[Persuade] If you hire someone to kill Dia it will look like you weren't man enough to do it yourself.;[];;[10176, 10177];[10172, 10181, 10183, 10185];tar03_holdan031;
"[Success] Well... I guess you might be right. Besides, I've noticed some of the girls around here are giving me the cold shoulder since all this started. Okay, you win; Dia can live.";[];;[10174];[10175];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13066_.mp3
[Failure] If I let her get away with it I'll look even worse! She's got to pay - either with her life, or 200 credits to buy my forgiveness.;[];;[10178];[10175];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13068_.mp3
[Force Persuade] I think it is time you forgave her. You are partly to blame for her behavior.;[{'Bastila': 'Persuade'}];;[10179];[10177];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13070_.mp3
"[Success] Well... maybe it's time I forgave her. I am partly to blame for what she did, I suppose. Okay, you win; Dia can live.";[];;[10174];[10178];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13072_.mp3
Take that bounty off Dia's head or you're a dead man!;[];;[10181];[10172, 10183, 10185];tar03_holdan031;
You're threatening me? I work for Davik Kang! If you kill me you'll be signing your own death warrant. Do us both a favor and don't waste my time with stupid threats!;[];;[10161, 10173, 10175, 10182];[10180];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13076_.mp3
I'll go talk to Dia and see if she can come up with the credits.;[];;[10183];[10181, 10172, 10185];tar03_holdan031;
You can do that if you want, but I doubt she's got 200 credits. That's a lot, and she's just a working girl. But that's the breaks, right?;[];;[10161, 10173, 10175, 10180];[10182];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13078_.mp3
What? I can't do that! Think how it would look. I work for Davik, I've got a certain reputation to uphold. I can't let her get away with this. There has to be payback!;[];;[10185];[10171];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13059_.mp3
Although I do feel a little guilty about all this. Dia's a good looking gal - it'd be a shame to kill her. Tell you what - I'll take 200 credits in exchange for lifting the bounty.;[];;[10173, 10175, 10180, 10182, 10186];[10184];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13061_.mp3
Forget it. This isn't worth my trouble.;[];;[10163];[10185];tar03_holdan031;
So how do I collect this bounty?;[];;[10188];[10170, 10190, 10168, 10144];tar03_holdan031;
Just kill Dia and then go talk to Zax. I gave him the credits for safekeeping. He'll pay you off when the deed is done.;[];;[10149, 10161, 10171, 10189];[10187];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13024_.mp3
Tell me what happened with Dia.;[];;[10190];[10188, 10202];tar03_holdan031;
What do you mean what happened? She took her vibroblade and came after me like she was harvesting a bantha pelt!;[];;[10145, 10165, 10171, 10187];[10189];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13056_.mp3
Yeah, sure. You were as innocent as a Jawa in a droid chop shop!;[];;[10168];[10166];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13018_.mp3
Yeah, right. Sounds to me like she was defending herself.;[];;[10168];[10166];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13087_.mp3
Who are you?;[];;[10194];[10141, 10199];tar03_holdan031;
My name's Holdan, baby. Maybe you've heard of me... I work for Davik Kang, you know.;[];;[10142, 10152, 10161, 10195];[10193];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13006_.mp3
Keep your hormones in check - I just want to ask some questions.;[];;[10196];[10194, 10141, 10203];tar03_holdan031;
I don't like the tone of your voice. I work for Davik Kang - I'm used to people treating me with respect!;[];;[10142, 10152, 10161, 10197];[10195, 10200];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13044_.mp3
I don't care who you work for - you seem like a slimeball!;[];;[10198];[10196];tar03_holdan031;
I don't have to take this abuse from you! I came here to relax. Shove off and find someone else to bother - I want to watch the dancing girls.;[];;[];[10197];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13046_.mp3
I don't normally go for these alien girls, but I've had some bad experiences with my own species lately. Maybe it's time for a change, you know what I mean?;[];;[10142, 10149, 10161, 10193, 10200];[10140, 10139];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13008_.mp3
I'm not really interested in your love life.;[];;[10196];[10199];tar03_holdan031;
What do you want now? This whole thing with Dia is over, so we don't have anything to discuss.;[];;[10149, 10161];[None];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13053_.mp3
This better be important - I'm trying to watch the dancing girls. You got some news about Dia or something?;[];;[10145, 10149, 10161, 10171, 10189];[None];tar03_holdan031;NM03AEHOLD13054_.mp3

Greetings again, hunter. Your time out on the dunes has brought wear to your face. It is a trait that you and I share.;[];After player has encountered the Komad out on the dunes hunting;[10206, 10275];[None];tat17_03komad_01;
It is the weight of decisions made for the good of all. I don't think the others would understand. All they know is that a dragon is dead. I am content to leave it at that.;[];Player helped with the hunt.;[10207, 10233, 10247];[10205];tat17_03komad_01;
I want to ask about you and hunting.;[];;[10208];[10206, 10230, 10246, 10243, 10239, 10235, 10275, 10279, 10280, 10282, 10283, 10284, 10285];tat17_03komad_01;
You are in dire need of better entertainment, human. My life has not changed since we last spoke.;[];Player has already been told his name.;[10209, 10219, 10223, 10229];[10207];tat17_03komad_01;
Where is the best hunting?;[];;[10210];[10208, 10222, 10228, 10232, 10226, 10263, 10267, 10265, 10220];tat17_03komad_01;
The best hunting is wherever the best hunter is. It's a trite answer, human, but the only one I can give.;[];;[10211, 10271];[10209];tat17_03komad_01;
Our hunt proved it. We found a dragon where other hunters should have noticed. It will be the last one seen for a long time.;[];;[10212, 10219, 10223, 10229];[10210];tat17_03komad_01;
Why are such large beasts so hard to find?;[];;[10213];[10211];tat17_03komad_01;
They are elusive. Perhaps they sensibly avoid the places where their kind have died. I don't know.;[];;[10214];[10212];tat17_03komad_01;
I'm just glad we found him him using the old ways. That was a victory.;[];;[10215, 10219, 10223, 10229];[10213];tat17_03komad_01;
Your traditional methods aren't popular?;[];;[10216];[10214];tat17_03komad_01;
Some try to lessen the risk by mass-hunting with battle droids. I would rather hunt solo, taking the risk as my own.;[{'Komad Fortuna': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[10217, 10219, 10223, 10229];[10215, 10274];tat17_03komad_01;
Who uses battle droids?;[];;[10218, 10268, 10269];[10216];tat17_03komad_01;
Tanis did, but he appears to be no longer with us. Perhaps you already knew this, human? I can't say.;[];Tanis is dead, killed out in the desert when the player found him.;[10219, 10223, 10229];[10217];tat17_03komad_01;
How long have you been at this?;[];;[10220];[10218, 10228, 10232, 10226, 10263, 10267, 10265, 10268, 10270, 10216, 10214, 10211, 10272, 10208];tat17_03komad_01;
A decade? Two? I don't enslave myself to time, human. There is day and there is night.;[];;[10209, 10221, 10223, 10229];[10219];tat17_03komad_01;
You really don't know anymore?;[];;[10222];[10220];tat17_03komad_01;
Tatooine will not change in my lifetime. Why bother trying to keep up with the rolling of the years?;[];;[10209, 10223, 10229];[10221];tat17_03komad_01;
What can you tell me about the other hunters?;[];;[10224];[10222, 10232, 10220, 10218, 10268, 10270, 10216, 10214, 10211, 10272, 10208];tat17_03komad_01;
Probably not as much as you would learn speaking to them yourself, even if they tell you nothing.;[];;[10225, 10262, 10264];[10223];tat17_03komad_01;
You have already shown an understanding of the needed skills when dealing with predators.;[];Player has resolved the gammorean ambush by killing them or intimidation.;[10226];[10224];tat17_03komad_01;
Having dealt with the Gamorreans, I think there is little else that will phase you.;[];;[10209, 10219, 10227, 10229];[10225];tat17_03komad_01;
What about the hunters besides the Gamorreans?;[];;[10228];[10226, 10263, 10267, 10265];tat17_03komad_01;
Ah... put simply, Dorak Quinn is honorable. Tanis Venn is not so much, but I've no real quarrel with him.;[];;[10209, 10219, 10229];[10227];tat17_03komad_01;
Let's go back to my first questions.;[];;[10230];[10228, 10232, 10226, 10263, 10267, 10265, 10222, 10220, 10218, 10268, 10270, 10216, 10214, 10211, 10272, 10208];tat17_03komad_01;
I will answer. The day drags on, however.;[];;[10207, 10231, 10233, 10247, 10249];[10229];tat17_03komad_01;
Who are you? What do you do?;[];;[10232];[10230, 10246, 10243, 10239, 10235, 10279, 10280, 10282, 10283, 10284, 10285];tat17_03komad_01;
I am Komad Fortuna, a hunter and member of this lodge. It is not the life for everyone, but I am content.;[];;[10209, 10219, 10223, 10229];[10231];tat17_03komad_01;
I'm looking for something. Who knows this planet best?;[];Player does not already have the star map;[10234];[10230, 10206, 10275, 10279, 10280, 10282, 10283, 10284, 10285];tat17_03komad_01;
No one that will return your questions. To truly know the dunes you have to live there, as the Sand People do.;[];;[10235];[10233];tat17_03komad_01;
Only they truly explore the land, but they attack without debate, if you see them at all.;[];;[10207, 10231, 10236, 10244, 10247];[10234];tat17_03komad_01;
Have you ever seen the Sand People with anything odd?;[];;[10237];[10235, 10246];tat17_03komad_01;
The Sand People carry nothing but weapons and bloodlust. To them, outsiders are invaders to be repelled.;[];;[10238];[10236];tat17_03komad_01;
Once or twice, however, I have seen them emerge from older ruins with sacks and other containers.;[];;[10239];[10237];tat17_03komad_01;
I've always been driven off, and if I examine the site later, there is nothing left.;[{'Komad Fortuna': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[10207, 10231, 10240, 10244, 10247];[10238];tat17_03komad_01;
What kinds of ruins were these? Where were they?;[];;[10241];[10239];tat17_03komad_01;
They were old storehouses of some kind, but you couldn't find them now, human. The sand covers all.;[];;[10242];[10240];tat17_03komad_01;
The only ones who would know what was there are the Sand People, and you would have to take it by force.;[];;[10243];[10241];tat17_03komad_01;
Finding their encampment is easy enough. Walk south until you are attacked.;[];;[10207, 10231, 10244, 10247];[10242];tat17_03komad_01;
What about the Jawas?;[];;[10245];[10243, 10239, 10235];tat17_03komad_01;
The Jawas may know the land as well, but are more interested in trading than talking. They scavenge to escape jobs akin to slavery.;[];;[10246];[10244];tat17_03komad_01;
Their language is difficult. If you can get anything more than the price of a droid out of them, I'll be impressed.;[];;[10207, 10231, 10236, 10247];[10245];tat17_03komad_01;

You talk far too big, human. This isn't the place for such things. Guards are a short yell away.;[];Set a global that marks Komad as pissed off. It will be checked int he desert version of him.;[10251, 10254, 10258, 10260];[10249];tat17_03komad_01;

It is unfortunate that you would choose this course, human. You never know when you will need an ally.;[];leaves;[];[10255];tat17_03komad_01;
[Failure] Perhaps you are unfamiliar with how things work around here. The guards are always quick to act.;[];;[10258, 10260];[10254];tat17_03komad_01;
Pay me or end up dead. It's that simple.;[];;[10259];[10257, 10250];tat17_03komad_01;
No, things are never quite so black and white. I am protected here, as are you. Nothing will come of this.;[];;[10253];[10258];tat17_03komad_01;
Perhaps you are right. You are safe... for now.;[];;[10261];[10257, 10250];tat17_03komad_01;
There seems to be no reason for your anger, human. You would be wise to control it, lest it bury you.;[];;[10253];[10260];tat17_03komad_01;
But, perhaps you are safer speaking with me. You've shown a weakness in the face of... two-legged predators.;[];Player resolved gammorean ambush by bribing the gammoreans.;[10263];[10224];tat17_03komad_01;
Perhaps you should reassert yourself? I don't know. I didn't think the Gamorreans so threatening.;[];;[10209, 10219, 10227, 10229];[10262];tat17_03komad_01;
The most obvious are the Gamorreans, however. Gurke and his crew are not the best company.;[];;[10265];[10224];tat17_03komad_01;
They hunt, but often come back with salvage instead of hides or pearls. I think their prey walks upright.;[];"Set a local that will filter the dialogue on the gammoreans. ""trustgammoreans""";[10209, 10219, 10227, 10229, 10266];[10264];tat17_03komad_01;
Wouldn't the guards have something to say about that?;[];;[10267];[10265];tat17_03komad_01;
The dunes are far from the reach of their blasters. Besides, Gurke spends his money in company stores.;[];;[10209, 10219, 10227, 10229];[10266];tat17_03komad_01;
Tanis did, but he no longer hunts, thanks to you. I'm glad a peaceful resolution was found.;[];Tanis no longer hunts;[10219, 10223, 10229];[10217];tat17_03komad_01;
I will not speak of it while they live. It is their shame to admit or hide. They know the effect it has.;[];;[10270];[10217];tat17_03komad_01;
Perhaps they will kill so many wraid that they also kill the hunt. After that, perhaps the solo hunter will still prosper.;[];;[10219, 10223, 10229];[10269];tat17_03komad_01;
It depends on what you seek. Wraid are plentiful and are the spoils of the sport hunter. Dragons appear only to the true hunter.;[];;[10272];[10210];tat17_03komad_01;
Patience is key. Krayt dragons hunt alone, and their prey is whatever can catch their attention.;[];;[10219, 10223, 10229, 10273];[10271];tat17_03komad_01;
So dragons are rare? Are they dangerous?;[];;[10274];[10272];tat17_03komad_01;
They are both rare and dangerous, and an honor to hunt. If you survive, you are blessed and favored. Respect them.;[];;[10216];[10273];tat17_03komad_01;
Probably from worry at getting your hands dirty. I really don't have much to talk to you about. You are not my kin.;[];Player did not help with the hunt;[10207, 10233, 10247];[10205];tat17_03komad_01;
You have no place here with me, human. Leave me to my thoughts.;[];Player pissed him off out on the dunes.;[];[None];tat17_03komad_01;
Yes, is there something you wish, human?;[];;[10249, 10278, 10281];[None];tat17_03komad_01;
Information, if I could trouble such a worthy hunter for a moment.;[];;[10279, 10280];[10277];tat17_03komad_01;
Save your words, swoop rider. They do not suit you.;[];Player has signed on with the swoop bike races;[10207, 10231, 10233, 10247];[10278];tat17_03komad_01;
Spare me the flattery, human. Such talk is rarely sincere.;[];player has not signed on with the bike races;[10207, 10231, 10233, 10247];[10278];tat17_03komad_01;
Just a few questions, if that's all right?;[];;[10282, 10283];[10277];tat17_03komad_01;
I will answer, though it is rare for one of you swoop riders to show much interest in anything besides racing.;[];Player has signed on with the swoop bike races;[10207, 10231, 10233, 10247];[10281];tat17_03komad_01;
I see no harm in it. There are hours yet before I set back out on the dunes.;[];player has not signed on with the bike races;[10207, 10231, 10233, 10247];[10281];tat17_03komad_01;
Why are you here, swoop jock? Hunting doesn't give your kind the instant thrills you need, does it?;[];;[10207, 10231, 10233, 10247, 10249];[None];tat17_03komad_01;
Hmm? You know, I don't have that much to tell you. You really have to learn the dunes for yourself.;[];;[10207, 10231, 10233, 10247, 10249];[None];tat17_03komad_01;
I told you to leave me alone - so give me some space, Bug-eye! Your breath smells like bantha poodoo!;[];;[10287];[None];tar03_mission031;NM03AEMISS14000_.mp3
Little girl should not be in bar. This no place for little girl. If little girl smart, she run away home now.;[];;[10288];[10286];tar03_mission031;

Quit complaining... you can finish eating later. Besides, you need the exercise so get over here.;[];;[10293];[10291];tar03_mission031;NM03AEMISS14012_.mp3
We no want trouble with Wookiee. Our problem with you, little girl!;[];;[10294];[10292];tar03_mission031;

Little girl lucky she has big friend.;[];;[];[10294];tar03_mission031;

Hey - we speak the same language!;[];;[10298];[10296];tar03_mission031;
It's not that strange. Most aliens can speak Basic, they just prefer to use their own language. But I grew up here on Taris so I just sort of got used to speaking the native tongue.;[];;[10299, 10300];[10297, 10333];tar03_mission031;NM03AEMISS14022_.mp3
You showed a lot of guts dealing with those Vulkars, kid. You got a name?;[];;[10300];[10298];tar03_mission031;NM03AEMISS14074_.mp3
My name's Mission Vao and this big Wookiee is my best friend, Zaalbar. I'd offer to give you a tour, but the streets down here aren't safe. But if there's anything else you need...;[];;[10301, 10304, 10306, 10310];[10299, 10298];tar03_mission031;NM03AEMISS14024_.mp3
I'm trying to find a way into the Black Vulkar base.;[];;[10302];[10300, 10305, 10309, 10318, 10322, 10326, 10330];tar03_mission031;
The Black Vulkar base? You'll never get in there - they attack on sight. But if you got a problem with the Vulkars, you should go speak to the Hidden Beks.;[];;[10303];[10301];tar03_mission031;NM03AEMISS14026_.mp3
Their base is open to anyone - I hang out there all the time. Gadon, the leader of the Hidden Beks, is a pretty good guy. He'll probably be able to help you out.;[];;[10304, 10331];[10302];tar03_mission031;NM03AEMISS14028_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;[];;[10305];[10303, 10309, 10300];tar03_mission031;
Well, you came to the right person! If you want info on Lower Taris I'm the one to talk to! Davik, the Lower City gangs... I've even got the scoop on that bounty hunter Calo Nord!;[];;[10301, 10306, 10310, 10314, 10319, 10327];[10304];tar03_mission031;NM03AEMISS14033_.mp3

We just kind of fell in together. It ain't easy on your own here in the Lower City - everyone's always looking to push you around.;[];;[10308, 10309];[10306];tar03_mission031;NM03AEMISS14035_.mp3
So we noticed. Still, you seem like an odd pair.;[];;[10309];[10307];tar03_mission031;NM03AEMISS14037_.mp3
When I met up with Zaalbar it seemed like a good match. I knew we could look out for each other. With my street smarts and his muscle, we make a great team.;[];;[10301, 10304, 10310];[10308, 10307];tar03_mission031;NM03AEMISS14039_.mp3
I'll be going now.;[];;[10311];[10309, 10330, 10326, 10322, 10318, 10305, 10300];tar03_mission031;
You're going? Yeah, this dive is pretty boring. No action around here. Come on, Big Z, let's go.;[];;[10312];[10310];tar03_mission031;NM03AEMISS14067_.mp3
But I haven't finished eating!;[];;[10313];[10311];tar03_mission031;
Can't you think about something besides your stomach for five minutes? Come on - we'll go see if there's anything good to eat at the Bek base.;[];;[];[10312];tar03_mission031;NM03AEMISS14071_.mp3
Tell me about Davik.;[];;[10315];[10305, 10326, 10330, 10322];tar03_mission031;
Davik's part of the intergalactic crime syndicate, but I guess everyone knows that. But I hear he's got a new ship for his smuggling operations - the Ebon Hawk.;[];;[10316];[10314];tar03_mission031;NM03AEMISS14041_.mp3
I don't know much about space travel, but I hear that ship's fast enough to break the Sith blockade. Of course, this is all just second hand rumor.;[];;[10317, 10318];[10315];tar03_mission031;NM03AEMISS14043_.mp3
Where would he keep it? Do you know?;[];;[10318];[10316];tar03_mission031;NM03AEMISS14045_.mp3
If Davik does have a ship, he's got it locked up in his estate. Nobody gets in there, except the people working for Davik and the Exchange.;[];;[10301, 10306, 10310, 10319, 10327];[10317, 10316];tar03_mission031;NM03AEMISS14047_.mp3
Tell me about the Lower City gangs.;[];;[10320];[10318, 10330, 10305];tar03_mission031;
There's only two gangs worth worrying about here in the Lower City: the Black Vulkars and the Hidden Beks. Sometimes Zaalbar and I hang out at the Bek base.;[];;[10321];[10319];tar03_mission031;NM03AEMISS14049_.mp3
The Beks are led by Gadon Thek - he's a good guy. Lost his sight in a swoop bike accident a few years ago, but even blind he's a great leader.;[];;[10322];[10320];tar03_mission031;NM03AEMISS14051_.mp3
Not like that traitor Brejik! Before he took over the Vulkars he was a Hidden Bek. Gadon considered that ungrateful space slug his adopted son.;[];;[10301, 10310, 10314, 10323, 10327];[10321];tar03_mission031;NM03AEMISS14053_.mp3
Why did Brejik leave the Hidden Beks?;[];;[10324];[10322, 10326];tar03_mission031;
When Gadon went blind everyone figured he'd step down and appoint Brejik in his place. But Gadon figured Brejik wasn't ready yet. He wanted him to wait a few years.;[];;[10325];[10323];tar03_mission031;NM03AEMISS14055_.mp3
But Brejik was too impatient. He left to join the Vulkars, and ever since he's been waging a war to wipe Gadon and his Beks from the face of Taris!;[];;[10326];[10324];tar03_mission031;NM03AEMISS14057_.mp3
This gang war in the Lower City is totally the Vulkar's fault. They're the ones killing everything that moves out on the street. It's like they've gone insane.;[];;[10301, 10310, 10314, 10323, 10327];[10325];tar03_mission031;NM03AEMISS14059_.mp3
Tell me about Calo Nord.;[];;[10328];[10326, 10322, 10318, 10305];tar03_mission031;
Calo Nord's one of the most famous bounty hunters in the galaxy. He's killed more people than the Iridian Plague! I've seen him kill people just for trying to talk to him!;[];;[10329];[10327];tar03_mission031;NM03AEMISS14061_.mp3
He hangs around Zax's bounty office, but I don't think he's looking for work there. All the postings there are small time - way beneath a bounty hunter of his caliber.;[];;[10330];[10328];tar03_mission031;NM03AEMISS14063_.mp3
I figure Calo's been hired by Davik to do a special job for the Exchange. I'd wager a thousand credits that as soon as the quarantine ends, he'll be getting off this rock.;[];;[10301, 10306, 10310, 10314, 10319];[10329];tar03_mission031;NM03AEMISS14065_.mp3
Thanks - I'll go see Gadon now.;[];;[10332];[10303];tar03_mission031;
Yeah, we should be going now, too. Come on, Zaalber. This dive is boring. Maybe we can find some action in the Undercity.;[];;[];[10331];tar03_mission031;NM03AEMISS14030_.mp3

At last, my search is over! I was beginning to fear someone else had killed you and deprived me of the pleasure.;[];;[10495];[None];k_h_bandon;NGLOBEBAND01000_.mp3
You may have defeated the pathetic bounty hunter my Master sent after you, but you are no match for me! I have studied at the foot of the Dark Lord himself!;[];;[10496, 10499, 10501, 10502, 10503];[10494];k_h_bandon;NGLOBEBAND01002_.mp3
How did you get down here?;[];;[10497];[10495];k_h_bandon;
Do you think those Republic subs are the only way to reach the ocean floor? Malak and Revan found a way down here long before the Hrakert station was built.;[];;[10498];[10496];k_h_bandon;NGLOBEBAND01004_.mp3
I acquired a ship and followed the same route Revan and my Master used on their own journey. Then it was simply a matter of waiting for you to return for the Star Map.;[];;[10499, 10501, 10502];[10497];k_h_bandon;NGLOBEBAND01006_.mp3
You're Malak's apprentice? Can't say I'm impressed.;[];;[10500];[10498, 10495];k_h_bandon;
Your words mean nothing to me... unless you wish to beg for your life. No? Then I shall try to make this both quick and painful!;[];;[];[10499, 10501, 10502, 10503];k_h_bandon;NGLOBEBAND01008_.mp3
When will Malak learn? I'll kill you just like I killed Calo Nord!;[];;[10500];[10498, 10495];k_h_bandon;
You're a fool if you think you can defeat me.;[];;[10500];[10498, 10495];k_h_bandon;
You were on the Endar Spire! You killed Trask. You'll pay for that!;[];;[10500];[10495];k_h_bandon;
Don't you believe a word of what Czerka Corporation said in there, there is always a peaceful solution to conflict. They are just lazy.;[];;[10505, 10545, 10547];[None];tat17_xconser_01;
What do you mean? What are you talking about?;[];;[10506];[10504];tat17_xconser_01;
Czerka miners have been attacked by Sand People, so the company Czerka Corporation wants them killed. They didn't ask you to do it?;[];;[10507];[10505];tat17_xconser_01;
The Sand People aren't animals. I've watched them, and they are intelligent. There must be a way to peacefully stop the attacks... I know it.;[];;[10508];[10506, 10546, 10548];tat17_xconser_01;
But no one will try, of course. You can't even leave the city without Czerka approval and they want the Sand People dead.;[];;[10509, 10541, 10543];[10507];tat17_xconser_01;
The Czerka said that the Sand People attacked first.;[];;[10510];[10508];tat17_xconser_01;
Well, yes they did. They attacked the Czerka, who deployed numerous giant sandcrawlers and started tearing up the desert with ion shovels and whatever else.;[];;[10511];[10509];tat17_xconser_01;
What would you have done? To the Sand People, it must have seemed like an invasion. There were no negotiations for territory or resources.;[];;[10512];[10510, 10542, 10544];tat17_xconser_01;
I don't think the killing has been justified, but as a conservationist I'm hoping someone at least tries to talk this out.;[];;[10513, 10529, 10533, 10539];[10511];tat17_xconser_01;
What would you suggest, then?;[];;[10514];[10512];tat17_xconser_01;
Communication. If we could just speak to them... but they don't talk. At least, not in any language an average translator can understand.;[];;[10515];[10513];tat17_xconser_01;
There was even a Jedi here a few years ago that couldn't seem to get through to them. I... think that ended in blood too.;[];;[10516];[10514, 10540];tat17_xconser_01;
I'm not saying it would be easy, but someone has to try. Maybe with a real translation droid, not these old protocol scrap heaps walking around.;[];;[10517, 10529, 10533, 10535];[10515];tat17_xconser_01;
Who would have a capable droid?;[];;[10518, 10534];[10516];tat17_xconser_01;
Well, *you* do, don't you? You bought that strange old droid off of Yuka Laka, didn't you? He said it was quite sophisticated.;[];Player has bought HK-47;[10519];[10517];tat17_xconser_01;
I'm sure I heard Yuka Laka say that it could speak a Sand People dialect. Although he'd say rust is gold to make a sale...;[];;[10520];[10518, 10534];tat17_xconser_01;
With that droid, maybe you could talk to them. I wouldn't survive... maybe with desert robes as a disguise someone could get into their enclave.;[];;[10521, 10523, 10526, 10529, 10533];[10519];tat17_xconser_01;
Where would that enclave you mentioned be?;[];;[10522];[10520, 10525, 10538];tat17_xconser_01;
What? It's no secret where they are. The attacks get worse the further southwest in the Dune Sea you go. Then people die on both sides.;[];;[10523, 10526, 10529, 10533];[10521];tat17_xconser_01;
Where would you get robes to match theirs?;[];;[10524];[10522, 10520, 10538];tat17_xconser_01;
I suppose you could take them off of the warrior raiders in the Dune Sea, but there's no way I'd survive anything like that.;[];;[10525];[10523];tat17_xconser_01;
Plus you would have to explain why you killed their warriors if you are trying to make peace... but I suppose there is no other way.;[];;[10521, 10526, 10529, 10533];[10524];tat17_xconser_01;
Maybe I'll look into it.;[];;[10527];[10525, 10522, 10520, 10538];tat17_xconser_01;
Sure, that's what Czerka Corporation keeps saying, and then they just start shooting again. The fighting won't stop until they are all dead.;[];;[10528];[10526];tat17_xconser_01;
Or until the Czerka leave. The one is as likely as the other with the way things are going. Bah, what do I know.;[];Leaves;[];[10527];tat17_xconser_01;
I will deal with the matter as I see fit.;[];;[10530];[10525, 10522, 10520, 10538, 10516, 10512];tat17_xconser_01;
That's what the infuriating Czerka Protocol officer said, but I'm not foolish enough to believe it. Everyone just wants to wipe the Sand People out.;[];;[10531];[10529];tat17_xconser_01;
Go on then, but you're just like the Czerka. Shortsighted fool. If you could just talk to them... maybe get a true translation droid...;[];;[10532];[10530, 10533];tat17_xconser_01;
Ah, I'm wasting my time. Go on, get out of here.;[];;[];[10531];tat17_xconser_01;
I don't care. Get out of my way.;[];;[10531];[10525, 10522, 10520, 10538, 10516, 10512];tat17_xconser_01;
They are pretty rare, even on well-stocked worlds, but I'm sure I heard something about an unusual droid in the shop here on Tatooine.;[];player has not bought HK-47;[10519];[10517];tat17_xconser_01;
Why don't *you* do something? Why should I?;[];;[10536];[10516];tat17_xconser_01;
Someone else has to! I've got no influence with Czerka Corporation, I can't afford what Yuka Laka charges for his droids, and I wouldn't survive...;[];;[10537];[10535];tat17_xconser_01;
Well, what I mean is, whoever tries to deal with the Sand People would first have to survive their initial attacks. I wouldn't.;[];;[10538];[10536];tat17_xconser_01;
Someone could maybe get into their enclave if they could disguise themselves, but you'd have to get real desert robes and that would be dangerous too.;[];;[10521, 10523, 10526, 10529, 10533];[10537];tat17_xconser_01;
Why hasn't anyone tried talking to them?;[];;[10540];[10512];tat17_xconser_01;
Well, there is the small matter that they don't seem to speak a language that your average translator can understand. Is that their fault?;[];;[10515];[10539];tat17_xconser_01;
Intelligent or not, the Sand People have killed people.;[];;[10542];[10508];tat17_xconser_01;
Yes they have, but Czerka Corporation deployed numerous giant sandcrawlers to tear up the desert with ion shovels and whatever else.;[];;[10511];[10541];tat17_xconser_01;
Why would you know any better?;[];;[10544];[10508];tat17_xconser_01;
Perhaps I'm no expert on diplomatic situations, but I know when there is a lack of due care for the evironment and the residents of it.;[];;[10511];[10543];tat17_xconser_01;
Is this about Czerka wanting the Sand People chieftain killed?;[];player has been told about sand people by Czerka;[10546];[10504];tat17_xconser_01;
So, you are the killer that they hired. Just going to walk out there and wipe them out? I'd expect no less from fools.;[];;[10507];[10545];tat17_xconser_01;
Move aside, I have things to do.;[];;[10548];[10504];tat17_xconser_01;
I'm sure you do. Czerka probably hired you to kill the Sand People in retaliation for a few attacks. Just another bloodthirsty fool.;[];;[10507];[10547];tat17_xconser_01;
Just move along. There's nothing to see here.;[];;[10550];[None];tar02_sithintero;NM02ADSITH10000_.mp3

A few of the Sith trooper uniforms have gone missing. We've got evidence that this alien knows something about them, so the commander's interrogating him.;[];;[10554, 10555];[10552, 10573];tar02_sithintero;NM02ADSITH10006_.mp3

Uh-oh. I think the commander's losing his temper. I'm glad I'm out here - it took me an hour to clean the blood stains from my uniform after the last interrogation.;[];;[10557, 10559, 10571];[10555];tar02_sithintero;NM02ADSITH10010_.mp3
Maybe the alien really doesn't know anything.;[];;[10558, 10561];[10556];tar02_sithintero;

The Dark Lord will no doubt torture you for information and for his own twisted pleasure. Eventually you will tell him everything. The Sith can be very persuasive.;[];;[10605];[10603, 10748];lev40_saul403;NM40AASAUL10027_.mp3

It doesn't matter whether you believe me or not. The fact remains that the Jedi on Dantooine have been eradicated, along with any hope of someone coming to rescue you!;[];;[10624];[10622];lev40_saul403;NM40AASAUL10072_.mp3
Now... tell me your mission. How were the Jedi planning on using you to stop Lord Malak and our Sith armada?;[];;[10625, 10696, 10720];[10623, 10723, 10725];lev40_saul403;NM40AASAUL10080_.mp3
I won't betray the Jedi.;[];;[10626];[10624];lev40_saul403;
Perhaps you need a reminder of the consequences of refusing to cooperate.;[];;[10627, 10718];[10625, 10721];lev40_saul403;NM40AASAUL10085_.mp3
NO! AHHH!! NO!! AUGH! The pain - THE PAIN! AHHHH!!! AUGH!;[];;[10628];[10626];lev40_saul403;NM40AASAUL10087_.mp3
Listen, can you not hear her suffering? You can spare her further pain by simply answering my questions.;[];;[10629];[10627];lev40_saul403;NM40AASAUL10089_.mp3
Now, I will ask again - on what mission did the Jedi Council send you?;[];;[10630, 10695, 10696];[10628, 10719];lev40_saul403;NM40AASAUL10091_.mp3
You are a sick and evil man, Saul Karath.;[];;[10631];[10629];lev40_saul403;
Perhaps another lesson is in order?;[];;[10632, 10693];[10630, 10695, 10702];lev40_saul403;NM40AASAUL10093_.mp3
No! AHHH!!! AUGH! NO!!! I beg you... No! Mercy!!! NO!!! AUGH!;[];Bastila rendered unconscious;[10633];[10631];lev40_saul403;NM40AASAUL10095_.mp3
I am surprised she did not pass out sooner. Rarely have I seen someone withstand such punishment and remain conscious.;[];;[10634];[10632];lev40_saul403;NM40AASAUL10097_.mp3
I see I am wasting my time here. When Malak arrives you will learn my interrogation techniques are considered merciful among the Sith.;[];;[10635];[10633, 10694];lev40_saul403;NM40AASAUL10099_.mp3
I will leave you here in your cell with a small taste of the horrors you will suffer when Lord Malak arrives.;[];;[10636];[10634, 10710];lev40_saul403;NM40AASAUL10101_.mp3
Don't try to move too quickly, you might not be fully recovered yet. Admiral Karath had his guards continue to torture you even after you passed out.;[];;[10637];[10635];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01000_.mp3
They tortured all of us, though you got the worst of it by far. Saul wanted them to make us suffer. He's become some sort of sadistic monster.;[];;[10638];[10636];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01001_.mp3
The dark side has perverted him, Carth. Once you start down the tainted path it leads you ever further into the depths of evil. I fear he is forever lost.;[];;[10639, 10690];[10637];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01002_.mp3
No one is without hope of redemption, Bastila.;[];;[10640];[10638];lev40_saul403;
Yes, hmm, I suppose you are correct. Sometimes it is easy to lose sight of that hope in the face of such unbridled cruelty, but you speak the truth.;[];;[10641];[10639];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01004_.mp3
I suppose I'm taking the news of Dantooine's destruction quite hard. First Taris, now the Academy... is there no end to the killing?;[];;[10642, 10688, 10689];[10640, 10692];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01005_.mp3
Maybe Admiral Karath was lying.;[];;[10643];[10641];lev40_saul403;
I'd like to believe that Saul was lying to us, but even as he said the words I knew they were true. The Academy is gone.;[];;[10644];[10642, 10688];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01007_.mp3
We should have felt a disturbance in the Force when the attack came. The fact that we did not is a bad sign. I fear the dark side is growing stronger, casting shadows our vision cannot pierce.;[];;[10645];[10643, 10689];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01008_.mp3
I can only hope that some of the Jedi escaped. Vrook, Vandar, Zhar... I cannot imagine all of them being gone. In any case, we have lost our one place of refuge in the galaxy.;[];;[10646];[10644];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01009_.mp3
None of this will matter if we don't get out of this prison before Saul gets back!;[];;[10647, 10687];[10645];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01010_.mp3
Where is Saul Karath now?;[];;[10648];[10646];lev40_saul403;
Saul mentioned that Lord Malak was on his way. I think the Admiral left to prepare for his arrival... and to report the results of our interrogation.;[];;[10649, 10674];[10647, 10687];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01012_.mp3
I only wish you had been able to resist the Admiral's questioning. I hope the information you revealed does not bring the entire galaxy under the dominion of the Sith.;[];;[10650, 10667, 10669, 10671];[10648];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01013_.mp3
I'm sorry, Bastila, but I couldn't just let you be tortured!;[];;[10651];[10649];lev40_saul403;
I appreciate your... feelings... for me. But you can't let your feelings override your judgment. Remember the Jedi code: There is no emotion, there is peace.;[];;[10652];[10650];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01015_.mp3
"Your efforts were well intentioned but poorly thought out; Saul tortured us all anyway. There is too much at stake to let reckless passion rule our actions.";[];;[10653, 10665, 10667];[10651, 10670];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01016_.mp3
How dare you judge me? You have no idea what it's like to be put into that kind of position!;[];;[10654];[10652];lev40_saul403;
I know if I had been in that position I would not have betrayed the Order and the Republic!;[];;[10655, 10665];[10653];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01018_.mp3
No, you would have just left someone you care about screaming in agony!;[];;[10656];[10654];lev40_saul403;
Stop it, both of you! Bastila, you... you can't honestly say how you would have reacted in that situation - nobody can! Besides, Saul already had all the information. I could tell.;[];;[10657];[10655];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01020_.mp3
The interrogation was a sham. Saul was toying with us. He didn't care what we told him. I think it was just an excuse to torture us before Malak arrived.;[];;[10658];[10656, 10666, 10668, 10673];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01027_.mp3
Did you feel that? A disturbance in the Force. The Admiral has sent his message, the Dark Lord knows we are here now. Malak is coming.;[];;[10659, 10660, 10661, 10662, 10663, 10664];[10657, 10678, 10682, 10686];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01028_.mp3
Well, then we better hope Mission busts us out of here before he arrives.;[];;[];[10658];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01029_.mp3
Well, then we better hope T3-M4 busts us out of here before he arrives.;[];;[];[10658];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01030_.mp3
Well, then we better hope Jolee busts us out of here before he arrives.;[];;[];[10658];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01031_.mp3

Well, then we better hope HK-47 busts us out of here before he arrives.;[];;[];[10658];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01034_.mp3
I'm... I'm sorry I failed you. I didn't know what else to do.;[];;[10666];[10654, 10652];lev40_saul403;
Don't be so hard on yourself. I've known the Admiral a long time. I could see that he already knew the answers to the questions he was asking.;[];;[10657];[10665];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01022_.mp3
Saul already knew the answers to the questions he was asking.;[];;[10668];[10652, 10649];lev40_saul403;
I've known Admiral Karath a long time and I think you're right.;[];;[10657];[10667, 10679];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01026_.mp3
I'm sorry, Bastila, but I couldn't just let Carth be tortured!;[];;[10670];[10649];lev40_saul403;
I appreciate your... feelings... for Carth. But you can't let your feelings override your judgment. Remember the Jedi code: There is no emotion, there is peace.;[];;[10652];[10669];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01024_.mp3
Why should I endure torture just to protect the Republic and the Jedi?;[];;[10672];[10649];lev40_saul403;
Your attitude disturbs me. Such selfishness is a sign of the dark side's taint, and it does little to fill me with confidence in you.;[];;[10673];[10671];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01036_.mp3
Forget about it, Bastila. It doesn't matter anyway. I've known the Admiral a long time. I could see that he already knew the answers to the questions he was asking.;[];;[10657];[10672];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01037_.mp3
It is fortunate you were able to resist the Admiral's questioning. The fate of the galaxy could be changed by revealing the slightest piece of vital information.;[];;[10675, 10683];[10648];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01038_.mp3
I have to confess something. There was a moment - just a moment - when part of me was hoping you would tell him what he wanted to know. Just to make the horrible pain stop.;[];;[10676, 10679, 10680];[10674];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01039_.mp3
I'm sorry, Bastila. Watching you suffer tore me apart.;[];;[10677];[10675];lev40_saul403;
I know you wouldn't ever do anything to intentionally cause me pain. But you did the right thing.;[];;[10678];[10676];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01041_.mp3
I don't honestly know if I could have been as strong in your position. To watch you suffer like that... it might have been too much for me to bear.;[];;[10658];[10677];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01042_.mp3
Saul would have tortured us no matter what I told him.;[];;[10668];[10675, 10683];lev40_saul403;
The only reason I stayed silent was to watch you suffer.;[];;[10681];[10675, 10683];lev40_saul403;
You wanted me to suffer? You enjoyed my torment? I don't know what to say. I thought there was a bond between us.;[];;[10682];[10680];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01045_.mp3
Maybe... maybe you're not the man I thought you were.;[];;[10658];[10681];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01046_.mp3
I, uh... I have to confess something. There was a... there was a moment - just a moment - when part of me was hoping that you would tell him what he wanted to know. Just to make the horrible pain stop.;[];;[10679, 10680, 10684];[10674];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01047_.mp3
I'm sorry, Carth. Watching you suffer tore me apart.;[];;[10685];[10683];lev40_saul403;
No, I know you wouldn't ever do anything to intentionally cause me pain. But you had no other choice. You couldn't betray our cause.;[];;[10686];[10684];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01049_.mp3
I... I don't honestly know if I could have been as strong in your position. To watch you suffer like that I... I might have cracked.;[];;[10658];[10685];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01050_.mp3
I'm not afraid of him!;[];;[10648];[10646];lev40_saul403;
I know... it's hard to believe they're all gone.;[];;[10643];[10641];lev40_saul403;
It's their own fault. They should have seen the attack coming.;[];;[10644];[10641];lev40_saul403;
Blah, blah, blah. Don't you ever get tired of being so preachy?;[];;[10691];[10638];lev40_saul403;
This is not a matter to joke about! If there is one thing we can learn from Saul it is how the power of the dark side can corrupt even the bravest of heroes!;[];;[10692];[10690];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01058_.mp3
I'm sorry. Forgive me. Snapping at you like that won't help our situation.;[];;[10641];[10691];lev40_saul403;NM40AABAST01059_.mp3

This accomplishes nothing, Saul. We will never betray the Republic.;[];;[10631];[10629];lev40_saul403;
We were searching for the Star Forge.;[];;[10697, 10715];[10629, 10624];lev40_saul403;

You should be grateful, Bastila. He is sparing you agony beyond comprehension.;[];;[10699];[10697];lev40_saul403;NM40AASAUL10115_.mp3
Words that betray the Jedi Order bring me more pain than any torture ever could!;[];;[10700];[10698];lev40_saul403;NM40AASAUL10117_.mp3

No, I will tell you nothing more!;[];;[10702];[10700, 10706, 10714];lev40_saul403;

For the sake of the Republic don't tell him anything!;[];;[10706];[10704];lev40_saul403;NM40AASAUL10126_.mp3

The information you have given me has been most useful, but I fear our session is over. Lord Malak will want to continue with this line of questioning himself.;[];;[10635];[10709, 10712];lev40_saul403;NM40AASAUL10137_.mp3

But we'll still stay here and wait for the Republic rescue crews. Thank you for not making a huge mistake.;[];;[];[11106];man28_sur4;NM28ACSUR404006_.mp3
Why did you have to poison the water?? We don't know what effect it could have on the environment around here... or on the kolto.;[{'Sami': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[11109];[11104];man28_sur4;NM28ACSUR404008_.mp3
Whatever it is that's coming out of the vent now doesn't look the same at all... I only hope you didn't pollute whatever was making it... We never were able to synthesize it.;[];;[];[11108];man28_sur4;NM28ACSUR404010_.mp3
I think we're just going to sit here. We have a lot of food and water, so we should be alright for a while.;[];;[11111];[None];man28_sur4;NM28ACSUR404012_.mp3
If you can make it out to the kolto harvesting machines, try to reprogram them to self destruct. Maybe that will cause the creature to stop its psychic screams.;[];;[11112, 11118, 11119];[11110];man28_sur4;NM28ACSUR404014_.mp3
Can you tell me how to disable the harvesting machine again?;[];;[11113];[11111];man28_sur4;
You can reprogram the harvesting machines to overpressure their self-oxidizing fuel, so that the fuel tank cannisters will rupture and the entire machine will destroy itself.;[];;[11114];[11112];man28_sur4;NM28ACSUR303101_.mp3
The Hydrolium gas we use is a gas at 1 to 3 million sangen, a liquid at about 4 million sangen, and a solid above that. When it's a liquid it's VERY explosive.;[];;[11115];[11113];man28_sur4;NM28ACSUR303102_.mp3
If you inject enough of the Hydrolium gas into the tank, the pressure will be so great that it will turn to liquid form and start a chain reaction inside the machine.;[];;[11116];[11114];man28_sur4;NM28ACSUR303103_.mp3
Once you do that, you can open the doors to the submersible bay and go back to the surface. Make sure you tell the Republic there are still some survivors down here.;[];;[11117];[11115, 11119];man28_sur4;NM28ACSUR404016_.mp3
Kono says he won't leave, and I can't leave him here by himself. We'll stay and wait until the Republic sends a larger rescue mission. Please don't delay too long!;[];;[];[11116, 11118];man28_sur4;NM28ACSUR404018_.mp3

The one who wields the magic to defeat the Elders?;[];;[11132, 11164, 11165];[11130];unk41_rakfan;
I wield the Force, yes.;[];;[11133];[11131];unk41_rakfan;
It is glorious to see such a power come to our aid when all was thought lost here on this gods-forsaken island.;[];;[11134];[11132, 11164, 11166];unk41_rakfan;
To be able to command the elements in such a way is awesome to behold... and must be even more so to wield.;[];;[11135, 11161, 11162];[11133];unk41_rakfan;
I think you misunderstand what the Force is...;[];;[11136];[11134];unk41_rakfan;
I am sorry for not comprehending your great powers. What then, are they?;[];;[11137, 11146, 11154];[11135, 11161];unk41_rakfan;
The Force is a power that flows from all life in the universe.;[];;[11138];[11136, 11163];unk41_rakfan;
Flows from life?;[];;[11139, 11143, 11145];[11137];unk41_rakfan;
It connects all living beings in the universe.;[];;[11140];[11138];unk41_rakfan;
All beings are connected? Through some sort of life Force?;[];;[11141];[11139, 11145];unk41_rakfan;
You are truly great in your power and your wisdom.;[];;[11142];[11140, 11144, 11149, 11153, 11157, 11159, 11160];unk41_rakfan;
I can't wait to see what havoc your magics will wreak on the Elders!;[];;[];[11141];unk41_rakfan;
Life itself generates the Force.;[];;[11144];[11138];unk41_rakfan;
The power over life gives you magic to create and destroy?;[];;[11141];[11143];unk41_rakfan;
It is the combined affinity that all life hold for each other.;[];;[11140];[11138];unk41_rakfan;
The Force is a natural energy that gifted people can use.;[];;[11147];[11136, 11163];unk41_rakfan;
A natural energy? Like fire and lightning?;[];;[11148, 11150, 11151];[11146];unk41_rakfan;
Much more powerful than just lightning.;[];;[11149];[11147];unk41_rakfan;
Such power! If only we Rakata could wield that power, too...;[];;[11141];[11148, 11150];unk41_rakfan;
It is like being able to shoot lightning from your fingertips.;[];;[11149];[11147];unk41_rakfan;
Fire that only genetically gifted people can use.;[];;[11152];[11147];unk41_rakfan;
'Genetically'? Is it that only your people can use the magic? There have been tales from the past of Rakata wielding magic, as the Elders do now.;[];;[11153];[11151];unk41_rakfan;
But maybe you mean something greater, something in all peoples that can harness its power.;[];;[11141];[11152];unk41_rakfan;
The true nature of the Force is being able to project your will upon reality.;[];;[11155];[11136, 11163];unk41_rakfan;
Project your will? To force things to be the way you want?;[];;[11156, 11158, 11160];[11154];unk41_rakfan;
The only true Force is to be able to change destiny.;[];;[11157];[11155];unk41_rakfan;
Just as you are able to change this destiny we are in, this... stagnation. You, with your power, can break the Elders' power and free us to move on!;[];;[11141];[11156];unk41_rakfan;
The strong of will can have whatever they desire.;[];;[11159];[11155];unk41_rakfan;
The strong of will... with the will to power. Yes, yes I see!;[];;[11141];[11158];unk41_rakfan;
One as weak as yourself could not see the true power of it.;[];;[11141];[11155];unk41_rakfan;
The Force is not merely the elements!;[];;[11136];[11134];unk41_rakfan;
You don't know the half of it...;[];;[11163];[11134];unk41_rakfan;
Please, great one, enlighten me to the scope of the power you wield... this 'Force'.;[];;[11137, 11146, 11154];[11162];unk41_rakfan;
I will see what can be done about the Elders.;[];;[11133];[11131];unk41_rakfan;
I decide what I will do!;[];;[11166];[11131];unk41_rakfan;
Of course. None could make you do that which you do not desire.;[];;[11133];[11165];unk41_rakfan;

If the player has not purchased a droid from her she will sell them one through dialog. If the player buys T3 the droid joins the party. If the player buys the M4 it will join the party but will explode as soon as it leaves the shop. The player can come back and get a refund or a special deal on the T3. Only the start store exit point requires any special scripting. All other exit points do not. The area just outside the store has to have a trigger to make the M4 blow up if the player has purchased it (Tar_JaniceDro ==20) and then set the variable back to 15;[11262, 11316];[None];tar02_janice021;
It blew up. I came to get my money back.;[];;[11263];[11261];tar02_janice021;
It blew up? Huh, I thought I'd taken care of that little cross-wiring problem. Well, don't worry - I run an honest business here.;[];;[11264];[11262];tar02_janice021;
I don't have to give you a refund, but I don't want to lose a customer. Here... have your 50 credits back. No hard feelings, right?;[];;[11265, 11305];[11263, 11317];tar02_janice021;
No hard feelings.;[];;[11266];[11264];tar02_janice021;

Utility droids? What do they do?;[];;[11270];[11268, 11324];tar02_janice021;
What don't they do? They're great at making vehicle repairs, for starters. Pretty handy to have in a fight - small, but tough with a surprising amount of firepower.;[];;[11271];[11269];tar02_janice021;

I thought Davik already paid for the droid!;[];;[11275];[11273];tar02_janice021;
He gave me a down payment, but the rest is due on delivery. If he sent you here to get the droid without giving you the final payment, that's between you and him. But I still need my 2000 credits.;[];;[11276, 11279, 11282, 11284, 11287];[11274];tar02_janice021;

You're joking, right? You mean to tell me Canderous sent you to collect this droid for Davik and you can't pay? I find that hard to believe. But it's not my problem, is it? So... are you going to pay?;[];;[11279, 11282, 11286, 11287];[11284];tar02_janice021;

Okay, that's your decision I guess. Seems to me Canderous wouldn't have sent you if he didn't want you to buy it, though.;[];;[11289];[11287];tar02_janice021;

I don't have 50 credits.;[];;[11300];[11293];tar02_janice021;

[Persuade] I think you should give me something extra for all the trouble.;[];;[11306, 11308];[11264];tar02_janice021;
[Success] Well... I guess I did cause you some inconvenience. And I don't want to get a reputation for poor customer service... business is tough enough as it is.;[];;[11307];[11305];tar02_janice021;

Fine... just give me the 50 credits.;[];;[11310];[11308];tar02_janice021;

[Persuade] Maybe I'll just start telling people not to shop here. You'll be ruined!;[];;[11312, 11313];[11308];tar02_janice021;

Back again, I see. Well, I've never turned a potential customer away yet. You interested in seeing what I have in stock?;[];;[11257, 11259, 11267, 11294];[None];tar02_janice021;
Hello there, captain. Let's see... ah, yes. Here it is. It looks like the shipment has been delivered to your ship, as requested.;[];;[11336, 11345, 11347];[None];ebo46_jorulkurax;
What shipment? What are you talking about?;[];;[11337];[11335];ebo46_jorulkurax;
This is docking bay 32, isn't it? Yes, it is, and that's what I have here on the requisition form. Everything seems to be in order. The gizka are your problem now.;[];;[11338, 11343];[11336];ebo46_jorulkurax;
"Excuse me, did you say ""gizka""?";[];;[11339];[11337, 11346, 11348];ebo46_jorulkurax;

Now, all I need is your thumbprint for the... wait a second, where did the datapad go? *sigh* Nothing is ever organized around here.;[];;[11341];[11339, 11350];ebo46_jorulkurax;
At any rate, the gizka are yours. One of the loaders said the crate split open once he put it in your hold... some of the critters might have gotten loose.;[];;[11342];[11340, 11344];ebo46_jorulkurax;
That happens, I'm afraid. We don't accept liability... and we certainly couldn't take the cargo back. Enjoy.;[];;[];[11341];ebo46_jorulkurax;
Whatever you put on my ship, I want it off. Now.;[];;[11344];[11337, 11346, 11348];ebo46_jorulkurax;
If you want the cargo removed, you'll have to fill out another requisition. I have one right... wait. I thought I had one. Oh, well.;[];;[11341];[11343];ebo46_jorulkurax;
Err... what shipment was that again?;[];;[11346];[11335];ebo46_jorulkurax;

"What do you mean ""my problem""? I didn't order any gizka.";[];;[11339];[11348];ebo46_jorulkurax;
Fair enough. Thanks.;[];;[11340];[11348];ebo46_jorulkurax;
Greetings, up-worlder. We rarely see your kind here in the Undercity. I find it strange that so many of you have come down from the surface recently.;[];First time talked to;[11352, 11353];[None];tar04_gendar041;NM04AAGEND05000_.mp3
No offense, but I can see why people normally avoid this place.;[];;[11353];[11351];tar04_gendar041;NM04AAGEND05047_.mp3
Why have you come into this dark and sunless place? Is there something you need of me or my village? I will help you however I can.;[];;[11354, 11367, 11374, 11379, 11381, 11384];[11352, 11351, 11388];tar04_gendar041;NM04AAGEND05002_.mp3
Who are you people? Why do you live here in the Undercity?;[];;[11355];[11353, 11368, 11385];tar04_gendar041;
We are the Outcasts - shunned from the surface for our crimes and banished here to the Undercity. We banded together to form this village that we might survive in this hostile environment.;[];;[11356];[11354];tar04_gendar041;NM04AAGEND05004_.mp3
I am Gendar, the leader of this village: as my father was, and as was his father before him. Many of us have been here for generations, our ancestors cast down long ago.;[];;[11357];[11355];tar04_gendar041;NM04AAGEND05006_.mp3
There is no return to the surface for us, or our descendants. But somehow we manage to survive amidst the filth and roaming bands of deadly rakghouls.;[];;[11358, 11364, 11367, 11374];[11356];tar04_gendar041;NM04AAGEND05008_.mp3
What a horrible way to live!;[];;[11359];[11357];tar04_gendar041;
Life down here can be difficult. It can break the spirit... many in the village have become bitter and hopeless. Especially those newly cast down.;[];;[11360];[11358];tar04_gendar041;NM04AAGEND05010_.mp3
But life goes on, and we must try to make the best of what we have. And maybe someday we will find a better life... Ha! Listen to me. I'm starting to sound like Rukil.;[];;[11361, 11364, 11367, 11374];[11359];tar04_gendar041;NM04AAGEND05012_.mp3
Rukil?;[];;[11362];[11360];tar04_gendar041;
The oldest man in the village. He is a kind soul, but I am afraid he is growing weary of this world. He dreams of escaping, of finding a better world.;[];;[11363];[11361];tar04_gendar041;NM04AAGEND05014_.mp3
If you wish to speak to him you can probably find him wandering about the village. As I said, a kind man - though he does cling to his illusions.;[];;[11364, 11367, 11374];[11362];tar04_gendar041;NM04AAGEND05016_.mp3
Tell me about the rakghouls that live down here.;[];;[11365];[11363, 11370, 11368, 11360, 11357];tar04_gendar041;
The rakghouls are monsters, hideous mutations who feast on the flesh of our villagers. Their diseased jaws can infect those they attack, transforming the victim into one of those abominations.;[];;[11366, 11383];[11364];tar04_gendar041;NM04AAGEND05022_.mp3
Thanks to you some of those who have been infected are now saved, but the rakghouls are still a terrible menace to our village.;[];;[11367, 11374];[11365];tar04_gendar041;NM04AAGEND05024_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;[];;[11368];[11366, 11373, 11370, 11378, 11380, 11382, 11383, 11363, 11360, 11357, 11353, 11385, 11387];tar04_gendar041;
Ask your questions, up-worlder. I will answer to the best of my knowledge, though I know little beyond the borders of the Undercity.;[];;[11354, 11364, 11369, 11374, 11376, 11379, 11381];[11367];tar04_gendar041;NM04AAGEND05018_.mp3
I'm looking for a Twi'lek named Mission Vao.;[];;[11370];[11368, 11380];tar04_gendar041;
Yes, I have seen this Twi'lek many times, though I have never spoken to her. She and her Wookiee companion often pass through our village on their way to explore the sewers.;[];;[11364, 11367, 11371, 11374];[11369];tar04_gendar041;NM04AAGEND05020_.mp3
How can I get to the sewers?;[];;[11372];[11370, 11380];tar04_gendar041;
There are two entrances into the sewers from the Undercity: one to the north-east of our village, the other to the south-east. But the sewers are dangerous, UpWorlder.;[];;[11373];[11371];tar04_gendar041;NM04AAGEND05045_.mp3
If you dare to travel those dark tunnels you would be wise to go heavily armed, unless you wish to become a meal for the rakghouls and other foul creatures.;[];;[11367, 11374];[11372];tar04_gendar041;NM04AAGEND05046_.mp3
I think I'll be going now.;[];;[11375];[11373, 11370, 11378, 11380, 11382, 11368, 11366, 11383, 11363, 11360, 11357, 11353, 11385, 11387];tar04_gendar041;
As you wish, up-worlder. Should you have need of anything else, come speak to me. I represent the entire village and I will do my best to help you however I can.;[];;[];[11374];tar04_gendar041;NM04AAGEND05035_.mp3
"Do you know anything about the ""Promised Land""?";[];;[11377];[11368];tar04_gendar041;
Ah, you have been speaking with Rukil. I am afraid the Promised Land is nothing but a legend. If such a place existed it surely would have been found by now.;[];;[11378];[11376];tar04_gendar041;NM04AAGEND05027_.mp3
Rukil is a good man, but he is old and tired. He needs to cling to his illusion to keep his spirit alive. I, on the other hand, have to be more practical. The village relies on me.;[];;[11367, 11374];[11377];tar04_gendar041;NM04AAGEND05029_.mp3
You said something about other up-worlders who came by here recently?;[];;[11380];[11368, 11353];tar04_gendar041;
Our village has seen many visitors from the surface recently: armored troops, swoop gang members, mercenaries. They come to search our sunless world. They are even searching the sewers.;[];;[11367, 11369, 11371, 11374];[11379];tar04_gendar041;NM04AAGEND05031_.mp3
I have a serum to save your people from the rakghoul disease.;[];;[11382];[11368, 11383, 11353];tar04_gendar041;
You are generous to offer this to us, up-worlder... you have my thanks. But I know nothing of administering the serum. You should bring it to the village healer.;[];;[11367, 11374];[11381];tar04_gendar041;NM04AAGEND05033_.mp3
We know of no cure for the disease, and for the good of the village we must banish any who become infected, lest they transform and turn on us.;[];;[11367, 11374, 11381];[11365];tar04_gendar041;NM04AAGEND05025_.mp3
Get away from me, you filthy beggar!;[];;[11385];[11353];tar04_gendar041;
I am no beggar, though many from the surface think me a far lower creature! We have our pride, despite what those from the surface think of us.;[];;[11354, 11367, 11374];[11384];tar04_gendar041;NM04AAGEND05038_.mp3
You have done a great thing for my village, up-worlder. Few from the surface would bother to cure an Outcast of the rakghoul disease, as you have done.;[];Player has cured Rakghoul infected outcasts;[11387];[None];tar04_gendar041;NM04AAGEND05039_.mp3
My only regret is that I have no reward to give you for your aid, save my thanks and the thanks of my people.;[];;[11367, 11374];[11386];tar04_gendar041;NM04AAGEND05041_.mp3
Welcome back, up-worlder. I am surprised to see you again. Many of your kind have passed through our village recently, but few have bothered to speak with me or my people.;[];Subsequent times talked to;[11353];[None];tar04_gendar041;NM04AAGEND05042_.mp3
Keep your eyes open. Our sources tell us Brejik's planning a hit on Gadon. There could be a Vulkar assassin in here right now!;[];;[11390, 11392, 11394];[None];tar11_hidbek112;NM11AAHIDB04000_.mp3

Fine, keep your share. I guess you earned it.;[];;[11420];[11410, 11424, 11427];tat18_11komad_01;

Greetings to you, human. If you are the person I think you are, I may have seen you in Anchorhead. You looked like a hunter.;[];;[11430];[11428];tat18_11komad_01;
Perhaps you are interested in the ways of the hunt? Will you help me? I have tracked a very special beast to its lair.;[];;[11431];[11429, 11512];tat18_11komad_01;
A krayt dragon, the largest of the Tatooine desert predators. It is an honored creature to hunt, although we must use unorthodox methods today.;[];;[11432, 11482, 11496, 11499];[11430];tat18_11komad_01;
If it's such an honor, why do you want help?;[];;[11433];[11431, 11490, 11488, 11485, 11498, 11501];tat18_11komad_01;
A valid question. This is a very critical fight. Bull dragons are rare to see. Rarer still is the apparent size of this one.;[];;[11434];[11432];tat18_11komad_01;
It is larger than the one my father felled a decade ago, and he is too far out of his territory and must be dealt with. I might not prevail alone, human, but I must try.;[{'Komad Fortuna': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[11435, 11439, 11482, 11493];[11433, 11492];tat18_11komad_01;
Why should we kill this great beast?;[];;[11436];[11434];tat18_11komad_01;
The natural cycle on Tatooine spans hundreds of years, but there are complications that must be addressed. Complications from our presence.;[];;[11437];[11435];tat18_11komad_01;
Krayt dragons feed on banthas. If the numbers of either species fall, the other grows too numerous, and unbalances the cycle.;[];;[11438];[11436];tat18_11komad_01;
Now settlers use banthas, so there are less for dragons to eat. This one is moving closer to Anchorhead. Perhaps there will be more, but he is the threat tonight.;[];;[11439, 11482, 11493, 11496];[11437];tat18_11komad_01;
I'll help. Give me more information about how.;[];;[11440, 11447];[11438, 11490, 11488, 11485, 11501, 11434];tat18_11komad_01;
You have already done what you must. You have intuitively led the banthas to this place. Your skills as a hunter may surpass mine in time.;[];BAnths already in position;[11441, 11445];[11439];tat18_11komad_01;
Quickly, be ready. The banthas are in position and will soon stir our restless prey. I hope the mines do their job quickly.;[];Banthas in position (Nobody expects the banthas in position!);[11442, 11444];[11440, 11446];tat18_11komad_01;
Don't worry, I'm ready.;[];;[11443];[11441, 11494, 11505];tat18_11komad_01;
Wait... what is that rumbling sound? Oh boy, he's a big one.;[];;[11396];[11442, 11444];tat18_11komad_01;
Just do your part.;[];;[11443];[11441, 11494, 11505];tat18_11komad_01;
Not that what will happen today is any measure. I have placed mines to kill the dragon as he emerges from his cave.;[];;[11446];[11440];tat18_11komad_01;
It is not very sporting, I know, but his hunting range will take him into settled areas and he must be dealt with. Blaster fire would only enrage him.;[];;[11441];[11445];tat18_11komad_01;
We must bait the great beast out of hiding and ambush him swiftly. There is no room to engage him in the lair, and his hide will repel blaster fire.;[];;[11448];[11439];tat18_11komad_01;
I have placed mines around the mouth of the cave. We must coax him out, but this is the end of his season of hibernation. It will take much to rouse him.;[];;[11449];[11447];tat18_11komad_01;
The food of a beast this size is almost exclusively banthas... and foolish hunters, if we are not careful. To lure him out we must lure his food to tempt him.;[];;[11450, 11478];[11448];tat18_11komad_01;
How will we lead the banthas here?;[];;[11451];[11449];tat18_11komad_01;
They too have their food of choice. We must find some bantha fodder to lead the banthas here. I have a few ideas about where this may be found.;[];"Give player three scent vials (plot items) with the following description: ""This vial contains a thick liquid that smells a bit like bantha hide.""";[11452];[11450];tat18_11komad_01;
Sand People keep bantha herds, so some of them must have fodder on hand or in their settlement. A vendor in Anchorhead also had some. He had a kiosk in the spaceport.;[];;[11453];[11451];tat18_11komad_01;
If you find fodder and bait the banthas here, the mines will deal with the dragon as it emerges to feed. Not exactly a glorious hunt, but it will ensure the safety of the region.;[];;[11454, 11477];[11452, 11481];tat18_11komad_01;
That seems very easy. What aren't you telling me?;[];;[11455];[11453];tat18_11komad_01;
There is one added threat. The Sand People regard banthas as sacred. Attempting to feed the herd in this area will likely lead to an attack.;[];;[11456];[11454, 11477];tat18_11komad_01;
We are far from the weakened tribes around Anchorhead. The Sand People of this region are strong, fierce, and will think nothing of killing you. Be careful.;[];;[11457, 11470, 11474, 11476];[11455];tat18_11komad_01;
I am an ally of the Sand People.;[];Sand People Chieftain is alive;[11458];[11456];tat18_11komad_01;
You likely mean the tribe that has been harassing Czerka Corporation. We are far from that region. This group will not honor that allegiance.;[];;[11459, 11464, 11467, 11470];[11457];tat18_11komad_01;
Why am I doing most of the legwork?;[];;[11460];[11458, 11465, 11475];tat18_11komad_01;
I have spent a long time tracking this creature. Many hunters do not return from such searches. I have earned my place here.;[];;[11461];[11459];tat18_11komad_01;
And, if I didn't mention it, I am interested in having new hunters like you understand that even though I must use untraditional methods, the hunted still deserves respect.;[];;[11462, 11464, 11467, 11470];[11460];tat18_11komad_01;
I'm not interested in this any more.;[];;[11463];[11461];tat18_11komad_01;
I can't attempt this alone. If you won't help, I will have to wait for another hunter to come. The offer stands, if you change your mind.;[{'Komad Fortuna': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[];[11462, 11473];tat18_11komad_01;
Thanks for the information. I don't need you anymore.;[];;[11465];[11461, 11458, 11475];tat18_11komad_01;
What do you mean, human? This task is better attempted together. You won't leave now, will you?;[];;[11459, 11466, 11467, 11470];[11464];tat18_11komad_01;
Leave? No, I'm going to take the kill for myself.;[];;[11405, 11406, 11407, 11408, 11409, 11421, 11422, 11423];[11465];tat18_11komad_01;
I will go find bantha fodder.;[];player has no bantha fodder.;[11468];[11465, 11461, 11458, 11475, 11508];tat18_11komad_01;
I wish you luck against the Sand People. When you return, the dragon will fall. I wish it could be under more sporting circumstances, but we must do what the circumstances call for.;[];;[11469];[11467, 11472];tat18_11komad_01;
I had hoped for a mirror of my father's expedition, but that will have to wait.;[{'Komad Fortuna': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[];[11468];tat18_11komad_01;
Look, I have your fodder.;[];player has bantha fodder, but has not yet talked to the bantha;[11471];[11465, 11461, 11458, 11475, 11456, 11508];tat18_11komad_01;
Good. Now, there is a herd that moves out in the desert. Lead them here. Approach them with the fodder and lead them here.;[];;[11472, 11473];[11470];tat18_11komad_01;
I'll see what I can do.;[];;[11468];[11471];tat18_11komad_01;
I'm tired of running around like this.;[];;[11463];[11471, 11508];tat18_11komad_01;
They posed no real threat to me before.;[];Sand People chieftain is dead;[11475];[11456];tat18_11komad_01;
You likely mean the tribe that has been harassing Czerka Corporation. This group is used to the deep desert. They appear to be much more dangerous.;[];;[11459, 11464, 11467, 11470];[11474, 11476];tat18_11komad_01;
Yet more Sand People? I've dealt with their kind before.;[];;[11475];[11456];tat18_11komad_01;
If it were as simple as that you'd have done it yourself.;[];;[11455];[11453];tat18_11komad_01;
You placed mines? That doesn't seem sporting.;[];;[11479];[11449];tat18_11komad_01;
That is true, and I regret it. I tracked this beast for many days and hoped to face him fairly, but there are other concerns than my honor.;[];;[11480];[11478];tat18_11komad_01;
It may seem like he is isolated, but the range of his territory extends deep into settled areas. We must kill him for the safety of others, and blasters will not do the job.;[];;[11481];[11479];tat18_11komad_01;
We must lead the banthas here using fodder like the Sand People do. Their warriors may carry some, or you could search the settlement. The spaceport merchant also had some. I'm not sure why.;[];;[11453];[11480];tat18_11komad_01;
Why do you want me and not another hunter?;[];;[11483];[11438, 11498, 11434, 11431, 11503, 11506, 11514];tat18_11komad_01;
You are here, they are not. I also didn't know the size of my quarry until I was tracking him. And perhaps there are... other reasons.;[];;[11484, 11485];[11482];tat18_11komad_01;
I tried to get the help of one other, but you saw him die in the lair. He lacked experience and, more importantly, patience.;[{'Komad Fortuna': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[11485];[11483];tat18_11komad_01;
I usually hunt for the skill of it, but must make an exception today. I want newcomers to understand the proper intent behind the hunt, no matter the methods we use.;[];;[11432, 11439, 11486, 11491, 11493];[11484, 11483];tat18_11komad_01;
Why would I want to do this?;[];;[11487];[11485];tat18_11komad_01;
"We each have our reasons. You might select ""challenge"" or ""glory"" as your own. ""Profit"" is also valid.";[];;[11488];[11486];tat18_11komad_01;
When bull dragons reach this size it is rumored that they have a number of pearls within them. You would receive a generous share.;[];;[11432, 11439, 11489, 11491, 11493];[11487];tat18_11komad_01;
Rumored? You don't know?;[];;[11490];[11488];tat18_11komad_01;
Nobody from our lodge has successfully hunted a bull dragon in perhaps a decade. My father may have been the last. His words are what I go by.;[{'Komad Fortuna': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[11432, 11439, 11491, 11493];[11489];tat18_11komad_01;
I thought you preferred the solo hunt.;[];;[11492];[11490, 11488, 11485, 11498, 11501, 11503, 11506, 11514];tat18_11komad_01;
That is true, but this is a very critical fight. Bull dragons are rare to see. Rarer still is the apparent size of this one.;[];;[11434];[11491];tat18_11komad_01;
I don't have time for this right now.;[];;[11494, 11495];[11490, 11488, 11485, 11501, 11438, 11434, 11506, 11514];tat18_11komad_01;
You don't have much choice now. You've already led the banthas into position. The beast will be stirring soon enough.;[];Banthas in position;[11442, 11444];[11493];tat18_11komad_01;
That is too bad. The hunt will have to wait for you. I can't do this alone.;[{'Komad Fortuna': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[];[11493];tat18_11komad_01;
I'm looking for a Star Map. It may be in this dragon's lair.;[];;[11497];[11438, 11431, 11503];tat18_11komad_01;
I have no knowledge of that, but there may be something in there. There are signs that this lair was purposefully dug out.;[];;[11498];[11496];tat18_11komad_01;
Krayt are opportunistic, and may have lazily moved into someone else's excavation. Of course, we must remove him to see.;[];;[11432, 11482, 11491, 11499];[11497];tat18_11komad_01;
Why should I trust you?;[];;[11500];[11498, 11431, 11503];tat18_11komad_01;
I might very well ask you why you shouldn't? I haven't threatened you, human. I have merely asked you to help me.;[];;[11501];[11499];tat18_11komad_01;
Perhaps I should question you. I have said my reason for being out here. I can't be certain you are trustworthy.;[];;[11432, 11439, 11491, 11493];[11500];tat18_11komad_01;
You have the same gait as the human I met in Fazza's lodge. We are hunters, you and I. Perhaps... we should pool our skills...;[];;[11503];[11428];tat18_11komad_01;
I have tracked a very special beast to its lair. A krayt dragon rests within, and tonight he is the hunted, although by unorthodox means.;[];;[11482, 11491, 11496, 11499];[11502, 11513];tat18_11komad_01;
This is not the time for such games. We must be respectful. The great beast is dead. He fought well, and will be remembered.;[];;[11397, 11425];[11428];tat18_11komad_01;
Don't let your wardrobe distract you. Be ready for battle. The banthas are in position and will soon stir our restless prey.;[];;[11442, 11444];[11428];tat18_11komad_01;
If you will quit your foolishness there is still time to pursue the hunt. Will you aid me, human?;[];;[11482, 11491, 11493];[11428];tat18_11komad_01;
Time wears on. Have you found the bantha fodder integral to our plan? This dragon will not reveal himself for our paltry scent.;[];"Selected, player has been told about the plan. Set on ""How will we lead the banthas here?""";[11508];[11428];tat18_11komad_01;
Bantha must be led to the cave to spur the beast out in the open. He will have a quick death after that.;[];;[11467, 11470, 11473, 11509];[11507];tat18_11komad_01;
I have led the bantha back to this location.;[];player has spoken to the bantha and they are following him.;[11510];[11508];tat18_11komad_01;
Allow them to get closer to the cave. They will trigger the dragon's hunger, but as pungent as they are, they must be closer.;[];;[];[11509];tat18_11komad_01;
Regardless of your clothes we must be quiet. There is a great predator just within the cave. Care must be taken.;[];;[];[11428];tat18_11komad_01;

Yes, I do.;[];;[11538];[11536];ebo46_lurze;
So you do. That does, indeed, look like the amount that Davik promised. Very well... 1000 credits is yours in exchange for the spice.;[];;[11539, 11573, 11575, 11578];[11537, 11587, 11600];ebo46_lurze;

Here you are. You drive a hard bargain, human.;[];;[11542];[11540, 11567, 11577];ebo46_lurze;
Allow me to take the spice off your hands. My employers will be most pleased. Tell me... might you be interested in earning more credits?;[];;[11543, 11562, 11563];[11541, 11574, 11579];ebo46_lurze;
Maybe. Tell me more.;[];;[11544];[11542];ebo46_lurze;
It is a simple courier mission. Motta the Hutt on Tatooine awaits delivery of a box that I hold. The spice was his, and the box is his repayment.;[];;[11545];[11543];ebo46_lurze;
There is no danger involved, human, so long as you do not attempt to open the box yourself. I'm sure Motta will pay you what was promised to Davik for the delivery. I believe 2000 credits was the agreed upon sum.;[];;[11546, 11548, 11555, 11557, 11560];[11544];ebo46_lurze;
Why don't you just bring it to him yourself?;[];;[11547];[11545, 11551, 11559, 11556, 11549];ebo46_lurze;
I suppose I would eventually have to, should you refuse. You are already here, however, and you have a ship... it is most convenient to have you deliver the box.;[];;[11548, 11552, 11555, 11557, 11560];[11546];ebo46_lurze;
What happens if I open the box?;[];;[11549];[11547, 11556, 11559, 11545];ebo46_lurze;

But what would happen? Is it a bomb?;[];;[11551];[11549];ebo46_lurze;
It is not a bomb. Just do not open it... that is all I can say. It represents no danger to you so long as it remains closed.;[];;[11546, 11552, 11555, 11560];[11550];ebo46_lurze;
Alright. I'll do it.;[];;[11553];[11551, 11556, 11559, 11549, 11547];ebo46_lurze;
Very good. I will have some of my workers load the box onto the Ebon Hawk for you. It will be waiting there for you. Remember: do not open the box!;[];;[11554];[11552];ebo46_lurze;

He can be found in Anchorhead, though I am uncertain exactly where. He should not be difficult to spot, fat as he is.;[];;[11546, 11548, 11552, 11557, 11560];[11555];ebo46_lurze;
Make it 3000 credits and we have a deal.;[];;[11558];[11556, 11549, 11547, 11545];ebo46_lurze;
If you want more you bargain with Motta, not me. He's the one you'll be working for on this mission. It's his box, after all.;[];;[11559];[11557];ebo46_lurze;
Bring it to him and you can haggle all you want over the price. Although I should warn you that Motta doesn't like to renegotiate.;[];;[11546, 11548, 11552, 11555, 11560];[11558];ebo46_lurze;

The authorities? Do you mean the Sith? This is Korriban, human... the Sith here have no interest in smuggling.;[];;[11577];[11575];ebo46_lurze;
But I have no desire, either, for you to take the package back into Republic space. Extortion or no, I will give you 1500 credits... but no more.;[];;[11541];[11576];ebo46_lurze;
Just take the spice. I don't want it or your credits.;[];;[11579];[11538];ebo46_lurze;
Are you certain? It is odd to meet a human who is uninterested in free credits. But have it your way.;[];;[11542];[11578];ebo46_lurze;

Well, when a planet explodes, you've got to expect a few changes. Davik's dead, hey? Maybe you can still help me with something.;[];;[11598];[11596];ebo46_lurze;
We had arranged for several kilograms of spice to be shipped to us here aboard the Ebon Hawk. Perhaps Davik left it on board?;[];;[11599];[11597, 11613];ebo46_lurze;
I suspect if it is, it would be in the container we gave him. Locked and requiring a code. Might you have seen such a thing, human?;[];;[11600, 11601, 11605, 11606, 11611];[11598];ebo46_lurze;
I already opened that container. I have the spice right here.;[];;[11538];[11599, 11602, 11604, 11607];ebo46_lurze;
I may have. How much is it worth to you?;[];;[11602];[11599];ebo46_lurze;
One thousand credits... and perhaps more, if you're interested. What do you say to that?;[];;[11600, 11603, 11605, 11606];[11601, 11608];ebo46_lurze;
And if I refuse?;[];;[11604];[11602];ebo46_lurze;
My employers would be disappointed, no doubt. Have you another use for the spice, human? Consider carefully.;[];;[11600, 11605, 11606];[11603];ebo46_lurze;
I could take a look for it.;[];;[11581];[11604, 11602, 11599];ebo46_lurze;
I don't want to get involved in this.;[];;[11607];[11604, 11602, 11599];ebo46_lurze;
Are you sure? The people I represent could make it well worth your while.;[];;[11600, 11608, 11609, 11610];[11606, 11611];ebo46_lurze;

I said I didn't want to get involved.;[];;[11583];[11607];ebo46_lurze;
Fine. I'll take a look for your container.;[];;[11581];[11607];ebo46_lurze;
There's nothing like that on the ship.;[];;[11607];[11599];ebo46_lurze;
What business is it of yours? The Ebon Hawk is mine, now.;[];;[11613];[11595];ebo46_lurze;
Fair enough. To be honest, I don't really care what happened to Davik or how you got the ship. I'm interested in something else.;[];;[11598];[11612, 11616, 11617];ebo46_lurze;
Look, I don't want any trouble, okay?;[];;[11615];[11595];ebo46_lurze;
I'm not here to give you any trouble, human. The people I represent and Davik had an arrangement... I just want to know what the status of it is.;[];;[11596, 11616, 11617];[11614];ebo46_lurze;
There is no arrangement. The Ebon Hawk belongs to me, now.;[];;[11613];[11615];ebo46_lurze;
I'm sure we could work out something, if you're interested.;[];;[11613];[11615];ebo46_lurze;
You obviously have me mistaken for someone else.;[];;[11595];[11593];ebo46_lurze;
I'm no smuggler, if that's what you're implying.;[];;[11595];[11593];ebo46_lurze;
Yes, the Ebon Hawk is my ship.;[];;[11621];[11590];ebo46_lurze;
Is that so? Well, you can tell Davik that my people are spitting plasma over this. We've been waiting for this shipment for a month, now.;[];;[11593];[11620];ebo46_lurze;
I don't have time to talk.;[];;[11623];[11590];ebo46_lurze;

Assurance: I am fully autonomous, but lack resources. I will grant loyal service in exchange for proper maintenance.;[];;[11741];[11739];tat17_08hk47_01;NM17AC08HK01038_.mp3
As well, it is rare that I am able to utilize my full array of abilities. You seem likely to give me the opportunity to do so.;[];;[11735, 11742, 11744, 11747, 11765, 11772];[11740];tat17_08hk47_01;NM17AC08HK01040_.mp3
Why would you assume that?;[];;[11743];[11741];tat17_08hk47_01;
Extrapolation: You are no farmer or diplomat. You are armed, and comfortable as such. We will mesh well.;[];;[11735, 11744, 11747, 11765, 11772];[11742];tat17_08hk47_01;NM17AC08HK01042_.mp3
Doesn't Yuka question you about your reluctance to reveal your functions?;[];;[11745];[11743, 11741, 11738, 11734, 11729];tat17_08hk47_01;
Explanation: It's rare for a droid to resist an owner in this way.;[];;[11746];[11744];tat17_08hk47_01;NM17AC08HK01057_.mp3
"Doubtless the Ithorian considers my stubbornness an ""embellishment"" to add interest to a seemingly mundane protocol droid.";[];;[11730, 11747, 11765, 11772];[11745];tat17_08hk47_01;NM17AC08HK01059_.mp3
Let's go back to my previous questions.;[];;[11748];[11746, 11764, 11762, 11757, 11755, 11751, 11743, 11741, 11738, 11734, 11729];tat17_08hk47_01;
Objection: My functions are wasted here, prospective purchaser! I will answer your queries, but I assure you I am better utilized elsewhere.;[];;[11727, 11749, 11765, 11772, 11775];[11747];tat17_08hk47_01;NM17AC08HK01044_.mp3
Sell yourself, droid. Why would I need you?;[];;[11750];[11748, 11726];tat17_08hk47_01;
Disclosure: I am a versatile protocol and combat droid, fluent in verbal and cultural translation.;[];;[11751];[11749];tat17_08hk47_01;NM17AC08HK01061_.mp3
Should your needs prove more... practical, I am also skilled in highly personal combat.;[];;[11747, 11752, 11756, 11765, 11772];[11750];tat17_08hk47_01;NM17AC08HK01063_.mp3
So you translate? I understand most languages well enough.;[];;[11753];[11751, 11764, 11762, 11757];tat17_08hk47_01;
Extrapolation: Intuitive language comprehension? That would be the result of recognition and training of Force sensitivity.;[];;[11754];[11752];tat17_08hk47_01;NM17AC08HK01065_.mp3
Your kind have little use of translation droids. Of course, your kind also encounters danger on a far more frequent basis than the average citizen.;[];;[11755];[11753];tat17_08hk47_01;NM17AC08HK01067_.mp3
You would do well to have me work for you, then, before someone else makes use of my... more exotic functions.;[];;[11747, 11756, 11765, 11772];[11754];tat17_08hk47_01;NM17AC08HK01069_.mp3
Why would you be better than an armored battle droid?;[];;[11757];[11755, 11751];tat17_08hk47_01;
Disclosure: Finesse. Battle droids hold battlefields. I am capable of eliminating a very... specific type of target.;[];;[11747, 11752, 11758, 11765, 11772];[11756];tat17_08hk47_01;NM17AC08HK01071_.mp3
You are beginning to sound like an assassin.;[];;[11759];[11757];tat17_08hk47_01;
Retraction: Droids built for such a function face strict regulation and often have unique difficulties with previous owners.;[];;[11760, 11762, 11774];[11758];tat17_08hk47_01;NM17AC08HK01073_.mp3
Beep beeple-beep boop!;[];;[11761];[11759];tat17_08hk47_01;
Objection: My former owners are, indeed, alive! Or at least I believe so, not having access to my memory.;[];;[11762];[11760, 11774];tat17_08hk47_01;NM17AC08HK01077_.mp3
I therefore make no claim to that designation, prospective buyer. I am a law-abiding droid. Yes, indeed, law-abiding, that's me.;[];;[11747, 11752, 11763, 11765, 11772];[11761, 11759];tat17_08hk47_01;NM17AC08HK01081_.mp3
You don't sound very convincing.;[];;[11764];[11762];tat17_08hk47_01;
Request: Please do not speak so loudly, prospective buyer! Do you truly wish my price to be doubled?;[];;[11747, 11752, 11765, 11772];[11763];tat17_08hk47_01;NM17AC08HK01083_.mp3
All right, I'll see about purchasing you.;[];;[11766];[11764, 11762, 11757, 11755, 11751, 11748, 11746, 11743, 11741, 11738, 11734];tat17_08hk47_01;
Statement: The fool Ithorian has decided I am to be an expensive purchase. He does this out of greed and not out of knowledge of my true capabilities.;[];;[11767];[11765];tat17_08hk47_01;NM17AC08HK01046_.mp3
Advisement: I have observed him. He is a coward, and will be responsive to... aggressive bargaining.;[];;[11768];[11766];tat17_08hk47_01;NM17AC08HK01048_.mp3
Does Yuka Laka know you talk about him like this?;[];;[11769];[11767];tat17_08hk47_01;
Statement: I wish only to be purchased and away from ill-treatment at the hands of this poorly-skilled mechanic. I have no desire to be subtle.;[];;[11770, 11771];[11768];tat17_08hk47_01;NM17AC08HK01050_.mp3
*angry beeping*;[];;[11771];[11769];tat17_08hk47_01;
Qualification: Err... of course I shall be quite pleasant to you, should you purchase me. Please?;[];;[];[11770, 11769];tat17_08hk47_01;NM17AC08HK01054_.mp3
I don't have time for you right now. Goodbye.;[];;[11773];[11764, 11762, 11757, 11755, 11751, 11748, 11746, 11743, 11741, 11738, 11734, 11726];tat17_08hk47_01;
Observation: I am wasted in a shop or translating for some moisture farmer. If you need an efficient combatant, return to purchase me, I beg you!;[];;[];[11772];tat17_08hk47_01;NM17AC08HK01090_.mp3
Droid like this usually doesn't have former owners that survived, it would be my guess.;[];;[11761];[11759];tat17_08hk47_01;NM17AC08HK01079_.mp3
I'm not familiar with Systech Corporation. What else do they make?;[];;[11776];[11748, 11726];tat17_08hk47_01;
Answer: With the restraining bolt in place, I do not have access to my memory core. I suspect, however, by the fine quality of my manufacture that they are a prestigious company, indeed.;[];;[11777];[11775];tat17_08hk47_01;NM17AC08HK01085_.mp3
I suspect I am of unique construction... or perhaps I was intended for a very specific customer. How I ended up here I can hardly say.;[];;[11729];[11776];tat17_08hk47_01;NM17AC08HK01087_.mp3
Yuka knows you speak Sand People dialects. Why ration information now?;[];;[11731];[11729];tat17_08hk47_01;
Bar's closed - Brejik's tired of all these drunken brawls. Hey - you're no Black Vulkar! Damn Bek spy - I'll teach you a lesson!;[];;[];[None];tar10_bartender;
Sorry... I'm rather busy with the excavation planning, right now.;[];;[];[None];kor36_sithexcavf;NM36AASITH04000_.mp3
You aren't assigned to the excavation team, are you?;[];;[];[None];kor36_sithexcavf;NM36AASITH04001_.mp3
The tomb on the far left, there, is off-limits. Only Master Uthar can go inside.;[];;[];[None];kor36_sithexcavf;NM36AASITH04002_.mp3
Where is that blasted transport crew? We're supposed to send off the next shipment of artifacts right away.;[];;[];[None];kor36_sithexcavf;NM36AASITH04003_.mp3
Careful of the tuk'ata. It's all we can do to keep those beasts away while we work.;[];;[];[None];kor36_sithexcavf;NM36AASITH04004_.mp3
We've had indications that there's a whole ancient Sith colony under this valley. Isn't that an incredible find?;[];;[];[None];kor36_sithexcavf;NM36AASITH04005_.mp3
The tombs are all full of traps and droids that still work, it looks like. Stay out of them, if you can.;[];;[];[None];kor36_sithexcavf;NM36AASITH04006_.mp3
I was told that there's an escaped assassin droid in one of the tombs. Watch out for it.;[];;[];[None];kor36_sithexcavf;NM36AASITH04007_.mp3
One has to wonder what made the Sith leave this planet originally. I bet the Jedi came and destroyed the colony.;[];;[];[None];kor36_sithexcavf;NM36AASITH04008_.mp3
These tombs we've uncovered are only the tip of an entire ancient Sith fortress. I wonder what happened here?;[];;[];[None];kor36_sithexcavf;NM36AASITH04009_.mp3
Look, unless you're willing to lend a hand, leave us to our work.;[];;[];[None];kor36_sithexcavf;NM36AASITH04010_.mp3
You're out here to look for artifacts, I suppose? Just be careful.;[];;[];[None];kor36_sithexcavf;NM36AASITH04011_.mp3
There's supposed to be some crazy Sith hermit that keeps kidnapping students in these hills. Best be careful.;[];;[];[None];kor36_sithexcavf;NM36AASITH04012_.mp3
Sorry, I can't talk. We have to excavate this valley with hand instruments. There's all kinds of old traps left behind that still work.;[];;[];[None];kor36_sithexcavf;NM36AASITH04013_.mp3
Did you hear what happened after the big swoop race? They say Brejik wouldn't pay up when he lost, and a brawl broke out! I can't believe I missed it!;[];;[];[None];tar02_musicf021;NM02AEMUSI25000_.mp3
Hmph - who dresses you? You look like you crawled up here from the Lower City. Oh well, I guess we can't all have style.;[];;[];[None];tar02_musicf021;NM02AEMUSI25002_.mp3
Isn't this band great? They can't leave Taris because of the Sith quarantine, so they've been playing here every night! Talk about a good break for us!;[];;[];[None];tar02_musicf021;NM02AEMUSI25004_.mp3
Hmph! I don't know what the guys in here find so attractive about those Twi'leks. Look at them - they're dressed like dirty little space wenches!;[];;[];[None];tar02_musicf021;NM02AEMUSI25006_.mp3
Did you hear? Bendak got dusted in that death match - by a woman, no less! Isn't that great? That should show these men a thing or two about who's the boss!;[];;[];[None];tar02_musicf021;NM02AEMUSI25008_.mp3
Did you hear the news? Bendak got dusted in that death match! I'll never get a chance to see something like that again. I can't believe I didn't get a ticket!;[];;[];[None];tar02_musicf021;NM02AEMUSI25010_.mp3
Have you heard? Someone's going to fight Bendak Starkiller in an illegal death match! I should go talk to that Hutt and try to get some tickets...;[];;[];[None];tar02_musicf021;NM02AEMUSI25012_.mp3
Everyone's worried the Sith will come in here and shut this place down. Can you imagine how dull it would be if we didn't have any music on Taris?;[];;[];[None];tar02_musicf021;NM02AEMUSI25014_.mp3
Greetings and good day. I hope your patrolling goes well today. All hail the Sith.;[];;[];[None];tar02_protdro;NM02ACPROT15000_.mp3
Greetings and good day. On behalf of the new Sith rulers I am programmed to encourage you to enjoy your stay on Taris.;[];;[11804];[None];tar02_protdro;NM02ACPROT15002_.mp3
I am a protocol droid programmed to provide information to everyone on Taris - citizens and visitors alike. Is there something I can do to serve you?;[];;[11805, 11808, 11810, 11812, 11815, 11817];[11803];tar02_protdro;NM02ACPROT15004_.mp3
What can you tell me about the Sith?;[];;[11806];[11804, 11807];tar02_protdro;
The Sith are the new authority here on Taris. They seek to preserve the customs of our world, or so I am told. More than this I cannot say.;[];;[11807];[11805];tar02_protdro;NM02ACPROT15006_.mp3
May I be of any further service to you?;[];;[11805, 11808, 11810, 11812, 11815, 11817];[11806, 11809, 11811, 11814, 11816];tar02_protdro;NM02ACPROT15008_.mp3
Is there some way I can get a shuttle off this planet?;[];;[11809];[11807, 11804];tar02_protdro;
I am afraid that is impossible. Taris is currently under a planet wide quarantine. The Sith are allowing no one to arrive or leave, except on official Sith business.;[];;[11807];[11808];tar02_protdro;NM02ACPROT15010_.mp3
Do you know anything about the gangs in the Lower City?;[];;[11811];[11807, 11804];tar02_protdro;
The Taris Tourism Board has issued a strong warning to all visitors to avoid the Lower City. It is a violent and dangerous place you would do well to avoid.;[];;[11807];[11810];tar02_protdro;NM02ACPROT15013_.mp3
How come there are hardly any aliens around?;[];;[11813];[11807, 11804];tar02_protdro;
Alien species have restricted access to the Upper City. This is one of the most ancient traditions of Taris, and the Sith have promised to preserve such traditions.;[];;[11814];[11812];tar02_protdro;NM02ACPROT15016_.mp3
Of course, I have yet to see them arrest a single alien for traveling the Upper City without a permit.;[];;[11807];[11813];tar02_protdro;NM02ACPROT15018_.mp3
Who do you work for?;[];;[11816];[11807, 11804];tar02_protdro;
I am an employee of the Taris government, programmed to provide information and guidance to any who require it.;[];;[11807];[11815];tar02_protdro;NM02ACPROT15021_.mp3
I don't need anything right now.;[];;[11818];[11807, 11804];tar02_protdro;
Then if you will excuse me, I must continue my appointed rounds.;[];Droid resumes his wanderings.;[];[11817];tar02_protdro;NM02ACPROT15023_.mp3
I am sorry we have nothing of value to give you as a reward. Our families have cut us off completely. Had the Council not taken us in, we would be foraging in the wilderness to survive.;[];DIALOGUE  talking to shen and rahasia after being united Dialog Mission Statement   This dialog is for after Shen and Rahasia run away back to the Jedi Enclave.

I'm just glad I could help you out.;[];;[11821];[11819];dan13_rahasia;

What are your plans now?;[];;[11823];[11819];dan13_rahasia;
The Council will let us stay here as long as we want, though I know Shen and I are both hoping our fathers will forgive us and welcome us back into their homes. If not, we will try to build a future somewhere else.;[];;[];[11822];dan13_rahasia;NM13AARAHA14005_.mp3
So... any wedding plans?;[];;[11825];[11819];dan13_rahasia;
We are waiting before the ceremony. Hopefully, in time, our fathers will agree to attend. If not, we plan to have a small, simple ceremony. You will be invited, of course.;[];;[];[11824];dan13_rahasia;NM13AARAHA14008_.mp3

And? What's your point?;[];;[11860];[11864];dan14_jon;NM14AAJON006026_.mp3
Mandalorians? They were all beaten in the last war.;[];;[11867];[11837];dan14_jon;
No! They've been raiding planets across this sector, and farms around here often.;[];;[11860];[11866];dan14_jon;NM14AAJON006028_.mp3
Have you found the Mandalorian raiders yet?;[];;[11869, 11882, 11887, 11889, 11900];[None];dan14_jon;NM14AAJON006032_.mp3
I fought and killed their leader.;[];;[11870];[11868, 11884];dan14_jon;
Thank you, young Master. My daughter can now, I think, rest in peace.;[];;[11871];[11869];dan14_jon;NM14AAJON006034_.mp3
Here is the reward I promised you.;[];;[11872, 11874, 11876];[11870];dan14_jon;NM14AAJON006035_.mp3
Thank you, Jon.;[];;[11873];[11871];dan14_jon;
Again, I thank you. I will be sure to tell the Council of your great deed.;[]; exits into the enclave and disappears;[];[11872, 11875];dan14_jon;NM14AAJON006037_.mp3
There is no need for a reward.;[];;[11875];[11871];dan14_jon;
No, please, take it. This pitiful amount will never be enough for what you have done for me.;[];;[11873];[11874];dan14_jon;NM14AAJON006039_.mp3
What?? That's it? Give me more!;[];;[11877];[11871];dan14_jon;
Wha... what? I did not think the Jedi were so greedy. You seem almost Mandalorian.;[];;[11878];[11876];dan14_jon;NM14AAJON006041_.mp3
I thank you for what you have done for me, but I have nothing else to give. The Council will hear of your deeds... and your greed.;[];;[11879, 11880, 11881];[11877];dan14_jon;NM14AAJON006042_.mp3
That was beneath you. I hope in the future you will strive to be better than this.;[];;[];[11878];dan14_jon;NGLOBEBAST06900_.mp3
That was totally uncalled for.;[];;[];[11878];dan14_jon;NGLOBECART04935_.mp3
You are a representative of the Jedi Order. When you behave this way you disgrace us all!;[];;[];[11878];dan14_jon;NM17AA05ME02071_.mp3
I killed some of them on the plains.;[];;[11883];[11868];dan14_jon;
Good, good! Put them down like the animals they are!;[];;[11884];[11882];dan14_jon;NM14AAJON006044_.mp3
But now that you've killed some of them, they won't stop until you've defeated their leader. You must find him and kill him, too.;[];;[11869, 11885];[11883, 11902];dan14_jon;NM14AAJON006061_.mp3
I will come back if I find their leader.;[];;[11886];[11884];dan14_jon;
Thank you, young Jedi.;[];;[];[11885];dan14_jon;NM14AAJON006063_.mp3
I didn't say I was going to find them!;[];;[11888];[11868];dan14_jon;
Please, help us if you can! They are as much a danger to you as to us! It is only a matter of time before they come here...;[{'Jon': 'Talk_Pleading'}];;[];[11887];dan14_jon;NM14AAJON006046_.mp3
What do you know about these raiders?;[];;[11890];[11868];dan14_jon;
Not much that would help you, I'm afraid. They're Mandalorians in their battle armor with some Duros allies. They came down on us on landspeeders, so they could be anywhere by now.;[];;[11891];[11889];dan14_jon;NM14AAJON006048_.mp3
One thing I do remember when those dogs killed my Ilsa, is that their leader was a giant of a man... who wielded a lightsaber.;[];;[11892, 11897, 11899];[11890];dan14_jon;NM14AAJON006049_.mp3
A lightsaber??;[];;[11893];[11891];dan14_jon;
Yes it was. Mandalorians have never been open to the ways of the Jedi. They are much too barbaric and violent.;[];;[11894, 11895];[11892];dan14_jon;NM14AAJON006051_.mp3
Practical.;[];;[11895];[11893, 11898];dan14_jon;NM14AAJON006054_.mp3
I rather think that it may have been from some poor Jedi he had slain before. You can see now that he is as much of a threat to you as to me! You must kill them!;[];;[11896];[11894, 11893, 11898];dan14_jon;NM14AAJON006055_.mp3
They have been troubling farms in the south most recently, having already dealt with many to the north. Please go there, find them and kill them!;[];;[];[11895];dan14_jon;NM14AAJON006056_.mp3
He was Jedi?;[];;[11898];[11891];dan14_jon;
Mandalorians have never been open to your ways. They are much too barbaric and violent.;[];;[11894, 11895];[11897, 11899];dan14_jon;NM14AAJON006053_.mp3
What does this mean?;[];;[11898];[11891];dan14_jon;
No, I have not found them yet.;[];;[11901];[11868];dan14_jon;
Please! Find them and destroy them before they kill anyone else!;[{'Jon': 'Talk_Pleading'}];;[];[11900];dan14_jon;NM14AAJON006059_.mp3
Now those Mandalorians know what it's like to be hunted!;[];;[11884];[None];dan14_jon;NM14AAJON006060_.mp3
Thank you for exacting my revenge on those Mandalorian beasts. If only I could have been the one to tear out Sheruk's heart.;[];;[];[None];dan14_jon;NM14AAJON006064_.mp3

I was foolish, my father was right, we are not destined for one another. It would never have worked. There would have been too many problems. Sometimes it is just better to let things die.;[];;[12048];[12046];dan14_cutscene;NM14ADCUTS02161_.mp3

I'm sorry, Rahasia. It just won't work. In fact... I don't think I like you very much at all. You remind me too much of your father.;[];;[12019, 12027, 12028];[12048];dan14_cutscene;NM14ADCUTS02163_.mp3
Don't give up on her, Shen.;[];;[12051];[12043];dan14_cutscene;

You may want to reconsider this.;[];;[12053];[12038];dan14_cutscene;

I will never let Rahasia leave me!;[{'Nurik Sandral': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[12011];[12053];dan14_cutscene;NM14ADCUTS02110_.mp3

That isn't fair! On Taris you had to give a cut to the swoop gang sponsoring you, but at least the rider got the higher share of the winnings.;[];;[12367, 12368];[12365, 12364];tat17_04celis_01;NM17AE04CE02030_.mp3
More slavery. Just disguised.;[];;[12368];[12366, 12365, 12364];tat17_04celis_01;

Tier one here is strictly amateurs. Might get a good race out of them now and then, but they aren't going anywhere.;[];;[12379];[12377, 12388];tat17_04celis_01;
Reach Tier two and you show promise. You're still fodder for the pros, but you're pretty good.;[];;[12380];[12378];tat17_04celis_01;
Tier three... only one of my local guys in that range. Nico. Good chance to go pro... if he knows what's good for him.;[];;[12381, 12389, 12393, 12402];[12379];tat17_04celis_01;
What does each tier pay?;[];;[12382];[12380, 12392, 12376, 12408];tat17_04celis_01;
Tier one is 10 racing bonds. Tier two I pay 30 racing bonds. Tier three I give 80 racing bonds. You'll agree the amount is fair.;[];correct with appropriate values;[12383];[12381];tat17_04celis_01;
I pay each level only once. I'm not here to support you. I only pay to encourage constant improvement.;[];;[12377, 12384, 12387, 12389, 12393, 12402];[12382];tat17_04celis_01;
What are racing bonds?;[];;[12385];[12383, 12466];tat17_04celis_01;
Racing bonds are monetary notes I issue so vendors know who my friends are. Any merchant will buy them.;[];;[12386];[12384];tat17_04celis_01;
Each bond is worth 60 credits, give or take. It depends on the merchant.;[];;[12377, 12387, 12389, 12393, 12402];[12385];tat17_04celis_01;

Here on Tatooine we do things Motta's way. With Taris gone, there's no circuit governing organization to say I am wrong.;[];;[12378];[12387];tat17_04celis_01;
Are there any pro racers here?;[];;[12390];[12386, 12383, 12380, 12376, 12408];tat17_04celis_01;
There aren't a lot of pro racers *anywhere* with Taris gone. I'm going to try and build up one or two of my own.;[];;[12391];[12389];tat17_04celis_01;
"But, I suppose there are a couple of pros here. Some ""has-been"" and ""never-were"" types. That sort of thing.";[];;[12392];[12390];tat17_04celis_01;
Zoriis Bafka is the best of the lot, outside my local champ Nico. Most racers in her league never stop here.;[];;[12377, 12381, 12387, 12393, 12402];[12391];tat17_04celis_01;NM17AE04CE02158_.mp3
Let's go back to my other questions.;[];;[12394];[12392, 12386, 12383, 12380, 12376, 12407, 12408];tat17_04celis_01;
Hurry it up, I don't have all day.;[];;[12323, 12327, 12352, 12355, 12358, 12375, 12395, 12402];[12393];tat17_04celis_01;
Give me the basics on how to race.;[];;[12396];[12394, 12517, 12538, 12539, 12540];tat17_04celis_01;
The track crosses the dunes of Tatooine. You will race against times set by other racers. There will be no other swoops on the track.;[];;[12397];[12395];tat17_04celis_01;NM17AE04CE02163_.mp3
Your bike likely has the standard five gears to shift through. As your speed increases, watch the indicators in the lower left to know when to shift.;[];;[12398];[12396];tat17_04celis_01;
Shift at the wrong time and your swoop will accelerate poorly or slow down. Shift correctly and you will optimize your perfomance.;[];;[12399];[12397];tat17_04celis_01;
"You can also steer over ""swoop boosters"" placed along the route. These will increase your speed substantially for a short time.";[];;[12323, 12352, 12358, 12375, 12400, 12402];[12398];tat17_04celis_01;
Are there any hazards on the track?;[];;[12401];[12399];tat17_04celis_01;
There are obstacles that you must watch for. Steering over rocks won't damage your bike, but it will slow you down.;[];;[12323, 12352, 12358, 12375, 12402];[12400];tat17_04celis_01;
I'll be back later.;[];;[12403, 12404];[12401, 12399, 12394, 12392, 12386, 12383, 12380, 12406, 12407, 12374, 12414, 12429, 12442, 12451, 12455, 12357, 12354, 12471, 12326, 12475, 12490, 12496, 12492, 12488, 12476, 12322, 12517, 12538, 12539, 12540, 12536, 12542];tat17_04celis_01;
Go then, but don't hog the track with rec-runs. I need my pros to keep their skills up. You depress them.;[];player has beaten the big race;[];[12402];tat17_04celis_01;
All right, but don't make me regret giving you track access. I need racers that race!;[];player has not beaten the big race;[];[12402];tat17_04celis_01;
You've passed the first tier and have earned 10 racing bonds. Not a bad showing for a beginner. You beat Garm's time easily.;[];player has beaten the first tier and has not yet been paid for it.;[12406];[12375, 12355, 12324, 12541];tat17_04celis_01;NM17AE04CE02139_.mp3
Take this, with my thanks. We'll see if you can do any better in tier two.;[];Set local that they are now paid for it. Give player 10 racing bonds.;[12323, 12327, 12352, 12358, 12375, 12402];[12405];tat17_04celis_01;
For you? Nothing. I've already paid you for all three tiers. There's no more. Nothing. Go hit another track.;[];player beaten all the races;[12393, 12402];[12375];tat17_04celis_01;
Ah, I set up a quick three-tier system so people know where they stand. I pay for the first time to reach each tier.;[];player has not beaten all the races;[12377, 12381, 12387, 12389, 12393];[12375];tat17_04celis_01;
I think I should ask for more.;[];;[12410, 12434];[12372];tat17_04celis_01;
You've taken a lot of money from me already, winning each tier like you have. This is it. There's no more.;[];;[12411, 12412, 12416, 12432];[12409, 12435];tat17_04celis_01;
All right, it's enough.;[];;[12374];[12410, 12415, 12426, 12434];tat17_04celis_01;
[Persuade] I'm worth more. You wouldn't want word of this getting out.;[];;[12413, 12415];[12410, 12434];tat17_04celis_01;
[Success] I suppose I don't. No one would sign with me again. I'm sure we can come to an agreement.;[];;[12414];[12412];tat17_04celis_01;
I'll pay you half again what I said, and that's all. Now, I have to plan for Nico's training. Is there anything else?;[];Give player 100 racing bonds;[12323, 12375, 12402];[12413, 12419, 12421, 12423, 12425, 12428, 12431, 12433];tat17_04celis_01;
[Failure] Look, I paid you all that I plan to. That's it. Is there anything else?;[];;[12411, 12416];[12412, 12432];tat17_04celis_01;
Then I'll have to take it out of your hide!;[];;[12417];[12415, 12410, 12434];tat17_04celis_01;
Anchorhead is a safe town. I don't think you'll be able to do much of anything to me around here.;[];;[12418, 12420, 12422, 12424, 12426];[12416, 12448];tat17_04celis_01;

Okay, maybe... maybe I was a little hasty. I don't know what he said but I... I get the drift.;[];;[12414];[12418];tat17_04celis_01;
Never underestimate a Mandalorian. If I want, there won't be enough of you left to identify.;[{'Cand': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[12421];[12417];tat17_04celis_01;NM17AE04CE02053_.mp3
A... a Mandalorian? May... maybe I was a bit hasty.;[];;[12414];[12420];tat17_04celis_01;

Well... an assassin droid, you say. No reasoning with them. Maybe... I was a little hasty.;[];;[12414];[12422];tat17_04celis_01;
*ahem* Do as we say, scoundrel! You don't want to anger a shortempered Jedi!;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[12425];[12417];tat17_04celis_01;NM17AE04CE02057_.mp3

Now, if you've got nothing else but empty threats, I think we're done. Is there anything else?;[];;[12411, 12427, 12430];[12417];tat17_04celis_01;
[Persuade] You hired me to bully *for* you. I'm no less a threat now.;[];;[12428, 12429];[12426];tat17_04celis_01;
[Success] You do have a point about that, and the guards can't be everywhere. Perhaps I should rethink this.;[];;[12414];[12427];tat17_04celis_01;
[Failure] I'm not afraid of you. You've been paid all that you will be paid. Now, is there anything else?;[];;[12323, 12375, 12402];[12427, 12430];tat17_04celis_01;
[Force Persuade] You know I could hurt you. Do as I say.;[];;[12429, 12431];[12426];tat17_04celis_01;

We had a deal. It was fair and I don't see why you need more.;[];Player did not win all tier races;[12411, 12412, 12416, 12432];[12409, 12435];tat17_04celis_01;
You'll give me more or you will regret it.;[];;[12410, 12434];[12372];tat17_04celis_01;
I think you should give him a better deal.;[];player has not bullied Nico into signing.;[12437];[12369, 12462, 12466, 12469, 12472];tat17_04celis_01;
You're not going to pull that typical swoop-jockey attitude, are you? This is business, and I know what's best.;[];;[12438];[12436];tat17_04celis_01;
What do you care whether I make money off the kid or not? He wants to race and you'll get paid. We all win.;[];;[12439, 12444, 12448, 12449, 12450];[12437];tat17_04celis_01;

[Success] You wouldn't. That would be bad. Very bad. Even rumors like that could keep me out of the pro circuit.;[];;[12441];[12439];tat17_04celis_01;
All right, I'll give him a better deal and make it back in the long run, I guess. You, of course, are not getting paid!;[];Set global that says Celis gave the better deal;[12442];[12440, 12446];tat17_04celis_01;
I trust this is the last I will have to hear about this matter? Was there anything else?;[];;[12323, 12375, 12402];[12441];tat17_04celis_01;
[Failure] I don't think you would. It would taint the racers that won on my track. That incudes Nico, and others.;[];;[12444, 12448, 12449, 12450];[12439];tat17_04celis_01;
[Force Persuade] You want to give Nico a better deal!;[];;[12445, 12447];[12443, 12438];tat17_04celis_01;

Let's go back to some basic questions about Nico.;[];player has not bullied Nico into signing.;[12362];[12447, 12443, 12438, 12369, 12462, 12466, 12469, 12472];tat17_04celis_01;
I'll see what I can do.;[];;[12451];[12447, 12443, 12438, 12369, 12462, 12466, 12469, 12472];tat17_04celis_01;
You do that. It's for the best. Now, was there something else?;[];;[12323, 12375, 12402];[12450];tat17_04celis_01;
I'm not interested in being your enforcer.;[];player has not bullied Nico into signing.;[12453];[12369, 12462, 12466, 12469, 12472];tat17_04celis_01;
No, no, you are a representative, and you'll be his friend. Let him know what the right choice is.;[];;[12454, 12455];[12452];tat17_04celis_01;
Right. Tell me why we're talking to this guy again?;[];;[12455];[12453];tat17_04celis_01;NM17AE04CE02099_.mp3
It's the best way. I'll be here if you change your mind. Now, was there something else?;[];;[12323, 12375, 12402];[12454, 12453];tat17_04celis_01;
Why would he listen to me?;[];;[12457];[12362];tat17_04celis_01;
He doesn't trust me. Actually, none of them do. I'm the promoter. I do it for money. They all just want the glory.;[];;[12458, 12461, 12463];[12456];tat17_04celis_01;
I bet you just can't understand why they wouldn't trust someone who's only in it for the money, too.;[];;[12459, 12461];[12457];tat17_04celis_01;NM17AE04CE02105_.mp3
Money's honest, old man. More honest than a conniving Jedi.;[];;[12460];[12458];tat17_04celis_01;NM17AE04CE02106_.mp3
You know, for a brute you say the sweetest things.;[];;[12461];[12459];tat17_04celis_01;NM17AE04CE02107_.mp3
You're a swoop-jock like him. You're new, but if you win enough he'll respect you. I'm counting on it.;[];;[12462];[12460, 12458, 12463, 12457];tat17_04celis_01;
And if he doesn't, *make* him choose correctly. You look like you could scare some sense into him.;[];;[12370, 12436, 12449, 12450, 12452];[12461];tat17_04celis_01;
I'm sure they wouldn't mind *some* of the credits, as opposed to getting it stolen out of their pockets.;[];;[12461];[12457];tat17_04celis_01;NM17AE04CE02108_.mp3
What will you pay me?;[];;[12465];[12362];tat17_04celis_01;
How does... 20 racing bonds sound? That should cover all your swoop costs on Tatooine nicely.;[];;[12466];[12464];tat17_04celis_01;
I'll make it all back if he signs the deal. I know it.;[];;[12370, 12384, 12436, 12449, 12450, 12452];[12465];tat17_04celis_01;
Aren't there other racers? Why him?;[];;[12468];[12362];tat17_04celis_01;
He'll be great one day, I can tell. There are some pros here, but I'm not looking for experience. I want potential.;[];;[12469];[12467];tat17_04celis_01;
Besides, he's young. He won't give me trouble like the older riders, or someone like you.;[];;[12370, 12436, 12449, 12450, 12452];[12468];tat17_04celis_01;
Oh, no, I'm not talking to you about that anymore. I agree to strange things when you are around, that's for sure.;[];playr got Celis to tchange deal.;[12471];[12352];tat17_04celis_01;
Nico's got the best deal I've ever given, no lie. Now leave so I can figure out how to still make money off this.;[];;[12323, 12355, 12375, 12402];[12470];tat17_04celis_01;
Yes, the contract trouble I've been having. Have you talked to the boy? You don't get paid until he signs.;[];Player told about nico, nothing happened yet;[12370, 12436, 12449, 12450, 12452];[12352];tat17_04celis_01;
Sorry now, I can't do that. You've won all three tiers and I'm not putting you in any more officially timed runs.;[];player won all races;[12474];[12323];tat17_04celis_01;
I don't want my racers getting discouraged... and I don't have much interest in signing you. I think you'd be... difficult.;[];;[12475];[12473];tat17_04celis_01;
Anyway, if you want to do any recreational races just for practice, talk to the track coordinator. He'll set you up.;[];;[12375, 12402];[12474];tat17_04celis_01;
Certainly. We just need to clear up the positioning fee. All racers pay the same before each officially timed race. 100 credits.;[];;[12402, 12477, 12486, 12489, 12491];[12323];tat17_04celis_01;

I am investing in my riders, but I also need to see profit now. You'll agree with my logic. If you don't, you don't race.;[];;[12402, 12477, 12489];[12487];tat17_04celis_01;
Will you negotiate on the price?;[];;[12490, 12492];[12488, 12476];tat17_04celis_01;

Soon, he feels, you will attain the rank of Padawan. Then you will truly be a full-fledged Jedi. How are you enjoying your training?;[];;[12757, 12760, 12762, 12766];[12755];dan13_belaya;NM13AABELA05030_.mp3
It's difficult, but worthwhile.;[];;[12758];[12756, 12774];dan13_belaya;
With power comes responsibility, and only by learning discipline and sacrifice can we truly learn to master our potential.;[];;[12759];[12757, 12761];dan13_belaya;NM13AABELA05032_.mp3
I wish you luck in your training, apprentice. There is much you must yet learn. May the Force be with you.;[];;[];[12758, 12767];dan13_belaya;NM13AABELA05033_.mp3
I want to learn to use the Force, not listen to your philosophical babbling!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[12761];[12756, 12774];dan13_belaya;
You speak as if this were some foolish game! Have you no idea what is at stake?;[];;[12758];[12760];dan13_belaya;NM13AABELA05035_.mp3
I am still learning the Jedi Code.;[];;[12763];[12756];dan13_belaya;
All Jedi must know the code. Its tenets are the fundamental teachings of our Order.;[];;[12764];[12762];dan13_belaya;NM13AABELA05037_.mp3
"There is no emotion; there is peace. There is no ignorance; there is knowledge. There is no passion; there is serenity. There is no chaos; there is harmony. There is no death; there is the Force.";[];;[12765];[12763];dan13_belaya;NM13AABELA05038_.mp3
Think and meditate on these truths, apprentice, if you ever wish to become a Padawan.;[];;[];[12764];dan13_belaya;NM13AABELA05039_.mp3
I am looking to alter my lightsaber, and I heard about some caves.;[];;[12767];[12756];dan13_belaya;
There are caves on Dantooine that hold those rare crystals. But be warned, apprentice: They are dangerous. You should not meddle in things beyond you.;[];;[12759];[12766];dan13_belaya;NM13AABELA05041_.mp3
A battle took place earlier to the south of the Enclave. A lot of people died and many droids were destroyed.;[];;[12769];[None];dan13_belaya;NM13AABELA05042_.mp3
I wonder what dark force could have caused this to happen...;[];;[];[12768];dan13_belaya;NM13AABELA05043_.mp3
Shen and Rahasia have been welcomed here in the compound for as long as they wish to stay. I am glad that your help enabled them to remain together.;[];;[];[None];dan13_belaya;NM13AABELA05044_.mp3
Master Zhar tells me you have successfully completed the tests, and I even see you have constructed your own lightsaber.;[]; DIALOGUE  the first time after the jedi becomes a padawan;[12772];[None];dan13_belaya;NM13AABELA05045_.mp3
You should be proud of your accomplishment... but never forget that you still have much to learn.;[];;[12773];[12771];dan13_belaya;NM13AABELA05046_.mp3
As your power grows you will constantly face temptations to slip to the dark side. This is the eternal struggle of the Jedi.;[];;[];[12772];dan13_belaya;NM13AABELA05047_.mp3
Greetings, young Padawan. I trust your training goes well.;[]; DIALOGUE  after the player becomes a padawan;[12757, 12760];[None];dan13_belaya;NM13AABELA05048_.mp3
Greetings to you. Err... while I am pleased to welcome you to planet G5-623, I do not see your ship on my docking schedule.;[];;[12776];[None];kas22_janos_01;
The Czerka Corporation will see to your needs, of course, but there will be a 100 credit docking fee. In advance, I fear.;[];;[12777, 12803, 12814, 12817];[12775, 12819];kas22_janos_01;
Docking fee? Why do I need to pay that?;[];;[12778];[12776];kas22_janos_01;
This outpost is remote and expensive to maintain. The 100 credits given will ensure that it remains here... for your use, of course.;[];;[12779];[12777];kas22_janos_01;
Upon collection of the correct fees, I will extend what resources the Czerka Corporation can offer. I'm sure you understand.;[];;[12780, 12795, 12797, 12800, 12803, 12810];[12778, 12816];kas22_janos_01;
[Force Persuade] I don't think I need to pay the docking fee.;[];;[12781, 12794];[12779, 12794, 12811];kas22_janos_01;
[Success] Perhaps you don't need to pay the docking fee. Any services you need will more than make up for it.;[{'Player': 'Persuade'}];;[12782, 12783, 12791, 12792, 12793];[12780, 12806];kas22_janos_01;
*whisper* The Force should not be used for profit and personal gain. As Jedi we should be above such things.;[];;[12783, 12791];[12781];kas22_janos_01;NGLOBEBAST06896_.mp3
I see you have a Wookiee with you. Can I assume you understand their language? For a fee, Czerka Corporation can provide a translator for you during your visit.;[];;[12784, 12787, 12789];[12782, 12792, 12793, 12781, 12796, 12813];kas22_janos_01;
I'm trained in the Force. I'll have no trouble.;[];;[12785];[12783, 12791];kas22_janos_01;
I don't have any experience with that. I just know that only the most adaptive people can understand the Wookiee language.;[];;[12786];[12784];kas22_janos_01;
Now then, please follow me to our information center. I will answer any further questions there.;[];"Walks to his office. Has ""Don't bother me yet"" line for while he's walking. Has conditions for once he is safe in his office.";[];[12785, 12788, 12790];kas22_janos_01;
That will not be necessary.;[];;[12788];[12783, 12791];kas22_janos_01;
Very well, though only the most adaptive people seem to comprehend the Wookiee language, such as it is.;[];;[12786];[12787];kas22_janos_01;
I understand more than you can know.;[];;[12790];[12783, 12791];kas22_janos_01;
Er... very well. It is no concern of mine. I will simply assume you are one of the rare sort that take to languages easily.;[];;[12786];[12789];kas22_janos_01;
We will also arrange for translation services, for a nominal fee, of course. You'll be encountering a number of Wookiees while here.;[];;[12784, 12787, 12789];[12782, 12792, 12793, 12781, 12796, 12813];kas22_janos_01;
*whisper* I'm amazed at how many people that works on. The entire galaxy must be filled with weak-minded fools.;[];;[12783, 12791];[12781];kas22_janos_01;NGLOBECAND03474_.mp3
*whisper* You should treat your power with respect, not use the Force on a whim like it is some toy!;[];;[12783, 12791];[12781];kas22_janos_01;NGLOBEJUHA11853_.mp3
[Failure] No... no I'm... quite certain that you need to pay the fee. It is a mere 100 credits, after all.;[];;[12780, 12795, 12797, 12800, 12803];[12780, 12812];kas22_janos_01;
Very well, I will pay the 100 credit fee.;[];player has 100 credits;[12796];[12794, 12807, 12805, 12779, 12811];kas22_janos_01;
You are welcome on Edean, trade designation G5-623. Czerka Corporation welcomes your business. We should discuss your interests in my office.;[];;[12783, 12791];[12795];kas22_janos_01;
I can't pay you the 100 credits.;[];;[12798];[12794, 12807, 12805, 12779, 12811];kas22_janos_01;
That is unfortunate. This outpost will have to remain closed to you until you can secure the credits. I am sorry. Good day.;[];Player sent back to his ship.;[12799];[12797];kas22_janos_01;
[You have no choice but to return to the Ebon Hawk.];[];;[];[12798, 12802];kas22_janos_01;
I refuse to pay. What will you do about it?;[];;[12801];[12794, 12807, 12805, 12779, 12811];kas22_janos_01;
Czerka Corporation protects its interests. If you won't pay, you won't be granted access to the planet and are free to leave.;[];Player sent back to his ship.;[12802];[12800, 12809];kas22_janos_01;
I will await you here if you change your mind.;[];;[12799];[12801];kas22_janos_01;
Don't make demands. I'm <FullName>, and I'll land where I wish.;[];;[12804];[12794, 12779, 12776];kas22_janos_01;
I respect your... obvious determination, but I can't allow you to remain unless you pay the proper fees.;[];;[12805];[12803];kas22_janos_01;
The Czerka Corporation appreciates your cooperation, and hopes this will not devolve into a... violent matter.;[];;[12795, 12797, 12800, 12806, 12808];[12804];kas22_janos_01;
[Force Persuade] I don't need to pay the docking fee. Stand aside!;[];;[12781, 12807];[12805];kas22_janos_01;
[Failure] I fail to see the basis for your arguement. Please, there is no need to be hostile.;[];;[12795, 12797, 12800, 12808];[12806];kas22_janos_01;
It's easily settled. I'll pay with your blood!;[];;[12809];[12807, 12805];kas22_janos_01;
W-we are not unarmed here! We have many guards and security droids. If we can control Wookiees, we can control you.;[];Everyone on landing level hostile. Wookies below don't care, however.;[12801];[12808];kas22_janos_01;
Is the price negotiable?;[];;[12811];[12779];kas22_janos_01;
Very simply put, no. Operation of these remote outposts is an expensive endeavor.;[];;[12780, 12795, 12797, 12800, 12812];[12810];kas22_janos_01;
[Persuade/Lie] I represent wealthy clients. You should let me pass.;[];;[12794, 12813];[12811];kas22_janos_01;
[Success] *sigh* Normally I wouldn't do this, but I don't feel like arguing. I'll consider a promise of future business payment enough.;[];;[12783, 12791];[12812];kas22_janos_01;
Could I get some information about the planet? I thought this was Kashyyyk.;[];;[12815];[12776];kas22_janos_01;
That is what the dominant indigenous species calls this world, but maintaining this outpost grants Czerka Corporation naming rights in the trade guides.;[];;[12816];[12814];kas22_janos_01;
But, I'm sorry, I really must insist that docking fees be paid before I impart any further services. I must follow proper procedure.;[];;[12779];[12815, 12818];kas22_janos_01;
What services does 100 credits get me?;[];;[12818];[12776];kas22_janos_01;
Well, we are limited in many ways, but I doubt you will find even basic facilities anywhere else in this remote sector.;[];;[12816];[12817];kas22_janos_01;
I greet you again. Will you accept the terms of landing at this outpost? We are quite far from any similar services.;[];;[12776];[None];kas22_janos_01;
Please, follow me to my office in our information center. We will discuss your needs and how Czerka Corporation can serve you.;[];P.W. - This used to have the generic walk ways script on it. But I removed it so that it uses the end of dialogue instead.;[];[None];kas22_janos_01;
Greetings again. How can Czerka Corporation serve you during your visit to Edean?;[];;[12822, 12847, 12883, 12887, 12889, 12892];[None];kas22_janos_01;
I need supplies. What is available here?;[];"Set a local on this node so this only appears once. This then modifies the ""asking about weapons only"" line";[12823];[12821, 12846, 12885, 12891, 12851];kas22_janos_01;
For material goods, I would suggest you speak with the general vendor near the docking area. He keeps his store well-stocked.;[];;[12824];[12822];kas22_janos_01;
They charge fair value for mundane goods and armor. If it is weapons you want, you will need to deal with the Czerka representative. That would be me.;[];;[12825];[12823];kas22_janos_01;
If you're here to purchase local species, however, you must wait for a licensed Czerka Corporation trader to return from deliveries outside the system.;[];;[12826, 12847, 12867, 12887, 12889, 12892];[12824];kas22_janos_01;
Purchase local species? What do you mean?;[];Only shows up if the player has not asked a SLAVE question already. Set local on area to filter this and other slave questions.;[12827, 12853];[12825];kas22_janos_01;
He means that they are slavers. They take my people from their homes and sell them to the highest bidder.;[];;[12828];[12826, 12852, 12886, 12895, 12901];kas22_janos_01;
Your current Wookiee seems displeased with the situation, but I fail to see a concern. You seem to be a satisfied customer.;[];;[12829, 12854, 12865];[12827];kas22_janos_01;
Zaalbar is no slave. He has pledged a life-debt to me.;[];;[12830];[12828];kas22_janos_01;
Ah, a very difficult thing to stage. I commend you for it. So much easier than relying on restraining collars.;[];;[12831];[12829];kas22_janos_01;
Do not demean the life-debt! Do not!;[];;[12832];[12830];kas22_janos_01;
I must warn you that you will be blamed for the actions of your Wookiee. Please... call him off.;[];;[12833, 12845, 12854, 12865, 12876];[12831, 12875];kas22_janos_01;
Why? I should let him kill the lot of you!;[];;[12834];[12832];kas22_janos_01;
I am merely a servant of the corporation! The Wookiee leadership is in agreement! Harvesting is made as delicate as possible!;[];;[12835, 12903, 12904, 12905, 12906, 12907];[12833, 12864];kas22_janos_01;

We are kept profitable and an agreeable leader is kept in power. It keeps the process from becoming a constant firefight.;[];;[12838, 12845, 12876];[12836, 12858, 12862];kas22_janos_01;
What is this leader's name?;[];;[12839];[12837];kas22_janos_01;
I believe his name is Chuundar. I don't deal directly with them, thank goodness. Far too brutish.;[];;[12840, 12902];[12838];kas22_janos_01;
Grrrr.... that was not a name I wanted to hear.;[];;[12841];[12839];kas22_janos_01;
It sounds as though your thrall has an opinion about our arrangement with this leader, but it doesn't matter. Chuundar is unquestioned.;[];;[12842, 12845, 12876];[12840];kas22_janos_01;
What about it, Zaalbar? What's the matter?;[];;[12843];[12841];kas22_janos_01;
This is not something I will talk about. Not yet.;[];;[12844];[12842];kas22_janos_01;
Please, is there anything else? I have work to do.;[];;[12845, 12876];[12843];kas22_janos_01;
I've other questions to ask.;[];;[12846];[12844, 12859, 12856, 12873, 12868, 12900, 12894, 12841, 12902, 12837, 12907, 12832];kas22_janos_01;
I will answer if I can.;[];;[12822, 12847, 12876, 12883, 12889];[12845];kas22_janos_01;
Tell me about the planet. You called it G5-623 before.;[];;[12848];[12846, 12885, 12891, 12825, 12821];kas22_janos_01;
"G5-623 is the numerical designation. The galactic Basic name is ""Edean,"" chosen by corporate ballot among stockholders.";[];;[12849, 12893];[12847];kas22_janos_01;
It would seem you are already acquainted with this world, given your choice of traveling companion.;[];Player has wookie with them;[12850];[12848];kas22_janos_01;
I have been away for a very long time.;[];;[12851];[12849];kas22_janos_01;

Aren't you here to take delivery of a Wookiee thrall? There are few other reasons to visit this barbaric world.;[];;[12854, 12864, 12865];[12852, 12886, 12895, 12901, 12826];kas22_janos_01;
Why do the Wookiees tolerate you doing this?;[];;[12855];[12853, 12873, 12868, 12832, 12828];kas22_janos_01;
It is not me, personally. I merely represent Czerka Corporation at this outpost. There are other directors at other stations, of course.;[];;[12856];[12854];kas22_janos_01;
Arrangements have been made with the Wookiee leadership. Harvesting is handled as delicately as possible, relatively speaking.;[];;[12845, 12857, 12860, 12863];[12855, 12866];kas22_janos_01;
[Persuade] Tell me about it. I might be more understanding if I know.;[];;[12858, 12859];[12856, 12907];kas22_janos_01;
[Success] If it will ease your temper, I will give specifics. We supply arms in exchange for a supply of healthy Wookiees.;[];;[12837];[12857];kas22_janos_01;
[Failure] It's not good policy to talk about our corporate strategy. I'm sorry, but I can't say any more.;[];;[12845, 12860];[12857];kas22_janos_01;
Tell me what you mean or I'll bloody your floor!;[];;[12861, 12862];[12859, 12856, 12907];kas22_janos_01;
RrrrraaAAAARRRR!!!;[{'Zaalbar': 'Taunt'}];;[12862];[12860];kas22_janos_01;
Now, there's no c-call for that. It is a simple matter, really. We supply arms in exchange for a supply of healthy Wookiees.;[];;[12837];[12861, 12860, 12905, 12906];kas22_janos_01;
[Force Persuade] You want to tell me about these agreements.;[];;[12836];[12856, 12907];kas22_janos_01;
Disgusting slaver! Why shouldn't I kill you!;[];;[12834];[12853];kas22_janos_01;
I'd think you would need more firepower to keep order.;[];;[12866];[12853, 12873, 12868, 12832, 12828];kas22_janos_01;
We do things as humanely as possible. There are other outposts, but the operation is very lean overall.;[];;[12856];[12865];kas22_janos_01;
I'd like to talk about the slaving operations here on Edean.;[];Only shows up if the player HAS asked a SLAVE question already. Read local on area set by other slave questions;[12868];[12851, 12885, 12894, 12900, 12825];kas22_janos_01;
I've a very limited number of things I can say. What do you wish to discuss?;[];;[12845, 12854, 12865, 12869, 12874, 12876];[12867];kas22_janos_01;
I can't allow this to continue.;[];;[12870];[12868];kas22_janos_01;
It's not up to you. This planet is not a member of the Republic, and its backward citizens hold no rights.;[];;[12871];[12869];kas22_janos_01;
I'm sorry you are offended, but this operation is very humane. Even the Wookiee leadership knows it is more beneficial to work with us.;[];;[12872, 12873, 12879];[12870];kas22_janos_01;
Slavery under any guise should not be tolerated!;[];;[12873];[12871];kas22_janos_01;NM22AAJANO06094_.mp3
Besides, even if you did do something drastic here, the Czerka Corporation has other outposts on Edean. It would change nothing.;[];;[12845, 12854, 12865, 12874, 12876];[12872, 12882, 12879, 12871];kas22_janos_01;

Very good, feel free to inspect our operation here, but I would advise against going too far from the main landing area.;[];;[12878];[12876, 12892];kas22_janos_01;
The planet is still very much untamed, and we do not send out patrols for lost tourists.;[];;[];[12877];kas22_janos_01;

It's not our place to judge, Carth. As he said, it would change nothing anyway.;[];;[12881];[12879];kas22_janos_01;NM22AAJANO06096_.mp3

I'd like to ask about the Czerka Corporation.;[];;[12884];[12851, 12891, 12846, 12821];kas22_janos_01;
Czerka Corporation has branches in many systems, mostly concerned with weapon production for personal and ship-mounted use.;[];;[12885];[12883];kas22_janos_01;
Of course, the many outposts on this world are only concerned with bio-aquisitions.;[];;[12822, 12847, 12867, 12886, 12887, 12889, 12892];[12884];kas22_janos_01;

I'm sorry, but I have no information on that. Are you sure you meant to come here? This world is very primitive.;[];;[12891];[12889];kas22_janos_01;
Much of it is still unexplored, even by the locals. The forest gets ever more dangerous the further you descend. The lowest levels, the Shadowlands, are largely unknown.;[];;[12822, 12847, 12883, 12887, 12892];[12890];kas22_janos_01;

An endless array of dangerous creatures, it seems. The great trees harbor any number of dangers below.;[];;[12898];[12896];kas22_janos_01;

I will give you 500 credits if you can uncover the fate of my daughter and the other missing Selkath youth. Not much, but all I can afford. I have no official authority in this matter, and my personal wealth is not vast.;[];;[13014];[13012, 13020, 13021];man26_shaelas;
There is no one else I can turn to, human. The Republic agents are too closely watched by the Sith, and the Ahto City authorities cannot act without proof of Sith involvement.;[];;[13015, 13018];[13013];man26_shaelas;
I shall look into these disappearances for you, Shaelas.;[];;[13016];[13014];man26_shaelas;
I cannot imagine where to begin the investigation, though I suspect the Sith did not act alone. Perhaps the off-worlders in the mercenary enclave know something.;[];;[13017];[13015];man26_shaelas;
If you learn anything, human, report back to me at once. If you uncover the fate of my daughter and the other missing Selkath youth, I will reward you as promised.;[];;[];[13016, 13028, 13108];man26_shaelas;
I've got better things to do than look for missing tadpoles.;[];;[13019];[13014];man26_shaelas;
I see, human. Despite your rebuff, my offer still stands - I have nowhere else to turn. Return to me if you obtain information on my daughter and the other missing Selkath youth, and I will reward you as promised.;[];;[];[13018, 13109];man26_shaelas;
What's in this for me?;[];;[13013];[13011];man26_shaelas;
Sorry, I'm not interested.;[];;[13013];[13011];man26_shaelas;
Just get to the point, Shaelas.;[];;[13010];[13008];man26_shaelas;
[Failure] I do not believe you! Go. We have nothing more to speak of.;[];;[];[13002];man26_shaelas;
[Force Persuade] It was a joke.;[];;[13025];[13001];man26_shaelas;
[Success] Yes... A joke. I was mistaken.;[];;[13004];[13024];man26_shaelas;
Whatever...;[];;[];[13001];man26_shaelas;
Human, you return. Have you information for me? Have you discovered the fate of the missing Selkath youth? Have you news of my daughter, Shasa?;[]; during sith recruitment quest;[13028, 13029, 13109];[None];man26_shaelas;
Not yet. I shall investigate further.;[];;[13017];[13027];man26_shaelas;
I have information for you, Shaelas.;[];discovered the Iridorian or discovered the Selkath youth in training, or discovered the Sith datapad.;[13030];[13027];man26_shaelas;
Excellent. You have done well. What have you learned?;[];;[13031, 13044, 13095, 13108];[13029];man26_shaelas;
The Sith hired an Iridorian mercenary to lure the Selkath youth to the Sith base.;[];Iridorian talked to (Quest=2);[13032];[13030, 13099, 13101, 13104];man26_shaelas;
I see. This information is useful, for a start. But it does little to explain the truth of this matter. We must know what purpose the Sith have for these youth.;[];;[13033];[13031];man26_shaelas;
Are they prisoners of the Sith? Are they even still alive? I must know more, human. I must know what has happened to my daughter!;[];;[13034, 13041, 13042, 13044];[13032];man26_shaelas;
I will look into this further.;[];;[13035];[13033];man26_shaelas;
I cannot officially ask you to enter the Sith base, human. That would be a violation of Ahto City's strict neutrality laws. However, I fear such a brazen act may be the only way to learn the truth.;[];;[13036];[13034, 13041, 13043];man26_shaelas;
But entering the base will not be easy. And should you be captured or killed, I will have to disavow any knowledge of your actions.;[];;[13037, 13039];[13035];man26_shaelas;
I'll infiltrate the Sith base, Shaelas.;[];;[13038];[13036];man26_shaelas;
I wish I could be of more help, human. I will wait here. Return to me when you have something more to report.;[];;[];[13037];man26_shaelas;
Forget it - I'm not about to break into the Sith base looking for your web fingered offspring!;[];;[13040];[13036];man26_shaelas;
You shall have no reward from me until I learn the fate of my daughter, human! If you change your mind and discover her fate, you can report to me here to collect your reward.;[];;[];[13039];man26_shaelas;
What do you suggest I do?;[];;[13035];[13033];man26_shaelas;
Does this mean I don't get paid?;[];small dark side hit;[13043];[13033];man26_shaelas;
This information is mere bait - the catch yet awaits, human. Once you discover the ultimate fate of my daughter, I will gladly give you the 500 credits I promised.;[];;[13035];[13042];man26_shaelas;
The Sith are training the Selkath youth in the ways of the Dark Jedi.;[];Quest=3;[13045];[13033, 13030, 13099, 13101, 13104];man26_shaelas;
Yes... this makes sense. It is a wonder I did not see this before. Manaan's greatest strength is our neutrality.;[];;[13046];[13044];man26_shaelas;
If Malak brainwashes our youth and indoctrinates them in the ways of the Sith he will have a strong following among the Selkath people - strong enough to seize control of Manaan and our kolto!;[];;[13047];[13045];man26_shaelas;
My daughter, Shasa - she too has been indoctrined into the Sith camp?;[];;[13048, 13059, 13069, 13090, 13092];[13046];man26_shaelas;
Your daughter is dead, Shaelas.;[];Shasa dead;[13049];[13047];man26_shaelas;
No! Say it is not so, human! No - not Shasa! The Sith will pay for this! If it is the last thing I do they will pay!;[{'Shaelas': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[13050, 13058];[13048];man26_shaelas;
Perhaps this datapad will help.;[];player has datapad, XP bonus;[13051];[13049];man26_shaelas;
A datapad? Let me see. Of course - this details the entire Sith plot! With this evidence I can go to the Ahto City authorities!;[];;[13052];[13050];man26_shaelas;
The Sith will face severe fines and export restrictions for their actions - a poor substitute for my daughter's life, but with any luck the kolto embargo will weaken the Sith war effort.;[];;[13053];[13051];man26_shaelas;
I... I thank you for what you have done here, human - though I wish my daughter's fate had been otherwise. Here are the credits I promised you.;[];;[13054, 13056];[13052, 13058];man26_shaelas;

I hope so.;[];;[13053];[13049, 13071, 13091];man26_shaelas;
I killed your daughter, Shaelas. Just as I'll kill you if you tell anyone about this. Now give me those credits!;[];Shasa dead, dark side hit;[13060];[13047];man26_shaelas;
You... you are a monster! I came to you for aid, and you betray me and slaughter my innocent Shasa! You are no better than the Sith!;[{'Shaelas': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[13061];[13059];man26_shaelas;
Blah, blah, blah - give me the credits if you want to live.;[];;[13062, 13063, 13064, 13065, 13066, 13067, 13068];[13060];man26_shaelas;

I've got a tach gland to sell you.;[];"Player ""on the job"" and has some tach glands";[13142];[13140, 13169, 13175, 13189, 13196];kas24_poffice_01;
I'll take whatever you have. Keep it up and we'll both be rich. At least until we bleed this planet dry, hahaha!;[];Give player 10 credits for each tach gland they have. Take glands;[13143, 13152, 13166, 13171];[13141, 13170];kas24_poffice_01;NM24AAPOFF08032_.mp3
I want to ask you a few questions.;[];;[13144];[13142, 13169, 13175, 13140, 13127, 13189, 13192, 13195, 13196];kas24_poffice_01;
If you made it this far you know a fair bit already. What would I be able to tell you?;[];;[13139, 13145, 13154, 13159, 13163];[13143, 13151];kas24_poffice_01;NM24AAPOFF08035_.mp3
I'm looking for something called a Star Map.;[];;[13146];[13144];kas24_poffice_01;
I'm no nav officer. I work on the ground, and I haven't seen anything like that around here.;[];;[13147];[13145];kas24_poffice_01;NM24AAPOFF08037_.mp3
Of course, we haven't been much deeper than this. The eastern forest gets even more dangerous.;[];update with direction to the forcefield barrier;[13139, 13148, 13151, 13152];[13146];kas24_poffice_01;NM24AAPOFF08038_.mp3
You aren't safe with blasters?;[];;[13149];[13147, 13162];kas24_poffice_01;
It's not worth it. You're fighting the plants as well as the animals. Kshyy vines are tough as metal, and grow back fast.;[];;[13150];[13148];kas24_poffice_01;NM24AAPOFF08040_.mp3
Instead, head office installed repulsor fields to keep the big predators out. Permanent placements too. We'll be fine for years.;[];;[13139, 13151, 13152];[13149];kas24_poffice_01;NM24AAPOFF08041_.mp3
I have other questions about the Shadowlands.;[];;[13144];[13150, 13147, 13157, 13158, 13162, 13165];kas24_poffice_01;
I'm leaving.;[];;[13153];[13150, 13147, 13157, 13158, 13162, 13165, 13175, 13169, 13142, 13140, 13138, 13181, 13184, 13133, 13127, 13189, 13192, 13195, 13196];kas24_poffice_01;
Good. I'm not down here to direct traffic.;[];;[];[13152];kas24_poffice_01;NM24AAPOFF08066_.mp3
Are you part of the slaving operation?;[];;[13155];[13144];kas24_poffice_01;
What? No, I don't do much of that. It's too much of a headache. I'm in the business of harvesting animals.;[];;[13156];[13154];kas24_poffice_01;NM24AAPOFF08044_.mp3
Some of the more exotic species have organs that can be removed and put to some surprising applications.;[];;[13157, 13158];[13155];kas24_poffice_01;NM24AAPOFF08045_.mp3
I've already told you about that. You agreed to help bring them in.;[];;[13139, 13151, 13152];[13156];kas24_poffice_01;NM24AAPOFF08046_.mp3
Talk to me about work and maybe I'll tell you more.;[];;[13139, 13151, 13152];[13156];kas24_poffice_01;NM24AAPOFF08047_.mp3
Is there anything odd down here?;[];;[13160];[13144];kas24_poffice_01;
Besides you? Besides any number of predators that can kill in seconds? I suppose there's old Bindo.;[];;[13161];[13159];kas24_poffice_01;NM24AAPOFF08049_.mp3
He's got a camp here somewhere. I'd leave him alone, though. Anyone who'd live down here is just plain crazy.;[];;[13162];[13160];kas24_poffice_01;NM24AAPOFF08050_.mp3
There's not much else. We've got a repulsor field to the east so not much passes through here now.;[];direction to the barrier;[13139, 13148, 13151, 13152];[13161];kas24_poffice_01;NM24AAPOFF08051_.mp3
If the Shadowlands are so dangerous, how do you survive?;[];;[13164];[13144];kas24_poffice_01;
It ain't easy. We've set up a perimeter of sonic emitters to keep the bigger preds away. It's worked so far.;[];;[13165];[13163];kas24_poffice_01;NM24AAPOFF08053_.mp3
As long as the emitters are operational, we're pretty much safe. It makes harvesting a lot easier.;[];;[13139, 13151, 13152];[13164];kas24_poffice_01;NM24AAPOFF08054_.mp3
What if I want you to leave the Shadowlands?;[];;[13167];[13142, 13175, 13140, 13127, 13189, 13192, 13195, 13196];kas24_poffice_01;
Is that old hermit Jolee trying to talk you into doing his dirty work? We've spent too much on setting up just to walk away.;[];;[13168];[13166];kas24_poffice_01;NM24AAPOFF08056_.mp3
As long the sonic emitters keep the preds away and I've got bodies to guard the perimeter, we're staying right here.;[];;[13169];[13167];kas24_poffice_01;NM24AAPOFF08057_.mp3
I mean, if I can put up with my own worthless guards complaining about this place, Jolee whining through you is nothing.;[];;[13128, 13141, 13143, 13152, 13170, 13171];[13168];kas24_poffice_01;NM24AAPOFF08058_.mp3
I've got some tach glands to sell you.;[];;[13142];[13169, 13140, 13189, 13196];kas24_poffice_01;
You're just a Czerka slaver. Nothing special.;[];The player will be allowed to threaten this guard twice. The first time will get a warning. The second time will result in an attack.

All right, I'm done talking with you. You've got under my skin one too many times! I'll bury you down here!;[];Goes hostile along with all his men.;[13173];[13171, 13176, 13182, 13185];kas24_poffice_01;NM24AAPOFF08060_.mp3
Just you try it.;[];;[];[13172];kas24_poffice_01;NM24AAPOFF08061_.mp3
I don't need this kind of garbage from you. Watch your mouth. I'm the only law there is down here.;[];"Set the ""threaten"" condition on this node, so that the next time the player threatens the guard, the above node is the path followed.";[13175];[13171];kas24_poffice_01;NM24AAPOFF08062_.mp3
If you've got something to say, get on with it. Otherwise, leave me alone. I've credits to earn.;[];;[13128, 13141, 13143, 13152, 13166, 13176];[13174];kas24_poffice_01;NM24AAPOFF08063_.mp3
I should just kill you. No one will ever know.;[];;[13172];[13175, 13184];kas24_poffice_01;
I have more questions about the job.;[];;[13178];[13133, 13181, 13184];kas24_poffice_01;
Hurry up, I'm wasting too much time on you as it is.;[];;[13132, 13139, 13179, 13182, 13185];[13177];kas24_poffice_01;NM24AAPOFF08020_.mp3
Don't you care that you could wipe out the whole species?;[];;[13180];[13178, 13131];kas24_poffice_01;
Uh, no. I'll be rich by then, and won't need to do it anymore. I don't have to worry about it.;[];;[13181];[13179];kas24_poffice_01;NM24AAPOFF08022_.mp3
Besides, if there's no more tach, the predators that eat them will die off and we'll have an easier time milking this planet.;[];;[13134, 13139, 13152, 13177];[13180];kas24_poffice_01;NM24AAPOFF08023_.mp3
Maybe you should just pay me so I don't shut you down.;[];;[13172, 13183];[13178, 13131];kas24_poffice_01;
I'm warning you, I didn't get this job because of my sense of humor.

Hell, I have guards everywhere and a perimeter of sonic emitters. I don't fear anything in the Shadowlands, including you.;[];;[13134, 13139, 13152, 13176, 13177];[13183, 13186];kas24_poffice_01;NM24AAPOFF08026_.mp3

I paid the docking fee. Who cares where I go?;[];;[13188];[13124];kas24_poffice_01;
So you're playing tourist? That isn't smart. The Shadowlands are all business. Mess around and you'll end up dead.;[];;[13189];[13187];kas24_poffice_01;NM24AAPOFF08006_.mp3
That said, if you want to make some credits while you're looking to die, I might have a job for you.;[];;[13128, 13141, 13143, 13152, 13166, 13170, 13171];[13188];kas24_poffice_01;NM24AAPOFF08007_.mp3
Chuundar has given me permission to be here.;[];;[13191];[13124];kas24_poffice_01;
He's got no authority with me. I'm with Czerka Corporation. He's just some pet we keep so the locals stay in line.;[];;[13192];[13190];kas24_poffice_01;NM24AAPOFF08068_.mp3

I don't understand you.;[];;[13198];[13198];dan15_ancientdrd;
You are neither Builder nor slave. If you seek the secrets of the Star Forge you must first prove yourself worthy. Only then will the sealed door behind be opened.;[];;[13202, 13212, 13215];[None];dan15_ancientdrd;
I want to ask you some questions.;[];;[13203];[13201, 13214, 13217];dan15_ancientdrd;
I am here to aid those who seek the knowledge of the Builders. What do you wish to know?;[];;[13204, 13207, 13210];[13202];dan15_ancientdrd;
Who are you again?;[];;[13205];[13203, 13209];dan15_ancientdrd;
I am the Overseer. The Builders programmed me to enforce discipline among the slaves while this monument to the power of the Star Forge was constructed.;[];;[13206];[13204];dan15_ancientdrd;
At project completion all slaves were executed. I was reprogrammed to serve should a Builder return in search of knowledge of the Star Forge.;[];;[13207, 13210, 13212, 13215];[13205];dan15_ancientdrd;
What do you know about the Builders?;[];;[13208];[13206, 13209, 13203];dan15_ancientdrd;
The Builders are the great masters of the galaxy, the conquerors of all worlds, the rulers of the infinite empire and the creators of the Star Forge.;[];;[13209];[13207];dan15_ancientdrd;
More than this, I am not programmed to say.;[];;[13204, 13207, 13210, 13212, 13215];[13208, 13211];dan15_ancientdrd;
Tell me about the Star Forge.;[];;[13211];[13209, 13206, 13203];dan15_ancientdrd;
The Star Forge is the glory of the Builders, the apex of their infinite empire. It is a machine of invincible might, a tool of unstoppable conquest.;[];;[13209];[13210];dan15_ancientdrd;
How do I prove myself worthy and unseal the doors?;[];;[13213];[13209, 13206, 13201];dan15_ancientdrd;
The chambers on either side contain the proving grounds. Within them, those who understand the will of the Builders can unlock their secrets and open the doors.;[];;[13214];[13212];dan15_ancientdrd;
But those who fail will be destroyed by the security systems of the temple itself. More than this, I am not programmed to say.;[];;[13202, 13215];[13213];dan15_ancientdrd;
I'll be going now.;[];;[13216];[13214, 13209, 13206, 13201, 13217];dan15_ancientdrd;
I shall remain here as programmed by the Builders.;[];;[];[13215];dan15_ancientdrd;
You have proven yourself worthy, the sealed door is open. If you wish to learn the secrets of the Star Forge you must pass through the door to the room beyond.;[];;[13202, 13215];[None];dan15_ancientdrd;
Well, it seems you are more than I thought. Freyyr has come back, and told me of what you did for him.;[];This is the second version of Chorrawl, placed halfway between the village and basket AFTER player has HELPED Freyyr.

My fellow hunters split on what should be done. Some were loyal to Chuundar alone... we had to fight.;[];;[13220];[13218];kas22_chorraw_02;
Freyyr went to the throne room to challenge Chuundar. I will take you to him now.;[];;[13221, 13224, 13227];[13219];kas22_chorraw_02;
Why should I follow you?;[];;[13222];[13220, 13226];kas22_chorraw_02;
I can guide you off the path. We will approach from behind, avoiding Czerka and those loyal to Chuundar.;[];;[13223];[13221];kas22_chorraw_02;
It is the only way. I'm sorry, but I won't allow you to proceed any other way. This is too important.;[];Palyer taken to Chuundar throne room.;[];[13222];kas22_chorraw_02;
You fought each other? Why?;[];;[13225];[13220];kas22_chorraw_02;
We follow the Chieftain, whoever that is. If the position is in doubt, we each fight for the side we believe in.;[];;[13226];[13224];kas22_chorraw_02;
This must be decided quickly or there will be much more bloodshed. Come, it is this way.;[];;[13221, 13227];[13225];kas22_chorraw_02;
Lead on. We should hurry.;[];;[13228];[13226, 13220];kas22_chorraw_02;
Yes, much is about to be decided. Only one can lead us. *Must* lead us. Come.;[];Palyer taken to Chuundar throne room.;[];[13227];kas22_chorraw_02;

Maybe I could be your partner.;[];;[13248];[13246, 13243, 13309];tar03_lynsekla;

Just keep following the apartment complex ring until you come to the elevator. It'll take you out to the Upper City streets. From there just head south a ways. You can't miss it.;[];;[13389, 13390];[13387, 13393];tar02_janitor;NM02AAJANI05035_.mp3
I want to ask you something else.;[];;[13383];[13388, 13386, 13396];tar02_janitor;

I should get back to work anyway. I'll probably see you around - I'm here most of the time. This building doesn't clean itself, you know.;[];;[];[13390];tar02_janitor;NM02AAJANI05046_.mp3
Where can I get some equipment?;[];;[13393];[13383];tar02_janitor;
Well, the best place to go is probably Kebla Yurt's store. She's right across from the cantina, so you can stop in for a drink if you get thirsty while you're shopping.;[];;[13388];[13392];tar02_janitor;NM02AAJANI05033_.mp3
What do you think of the Sith and this quarantine?;[];;[13395];[13383];tar02_janitor;
Not much of an issue for me, you know? I ain't never left Taris and I ain't never going to. A lot of other folks is sure riled up about it, but I don't really know much about it.;[];;[13396];[13394];tar02_janitor;NM02AAJANI05038_.mp3
I prefer to keep to myself, mostly. But there's plenty of people at the cantina who'll be more than happy to tell you what they think about the Sith and their quarantine.;[];;[13387, 13389, 13390];[13395];tar02_janitor;NM02AAJANI05040_.mp3
Sorry, Kadir. I'm not good with faces.;[];;[13398];[13381];tar02_janitor;
Yeah, okay then. No hard feelings. So, what can I do for you?;[];;[13382, 13390];[13397];tar02_janitor;NM02AAJANI05024_.mp3
I've got more important things to worry about than remembering some janitor!;[];;[13400];[13381];tar02_janitor;
Hmph! You'll change your tune the first time your plumbing breaks down and raw sewage floods your apartment. Then you'll be beggin' for Kadir to come help you out!;[{'Janitor': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[13401, 13402];[13399, 13404, 13405];tar02_janitor;NM02AAJANI05014_.mp3

We'll see who has the last laugh then! Now if you ain't going to be civil then I got work to do. This place doesn't clean itself, you know!;[];;[];[13401, 13400];tar02_janitor;NM02AAJANI05018_.mp3
This place is a dump! You should be fired!;[];;[13404];[13379, 13377, 13406];tar02_janitor;

Out of my way, old man!;[];;[13400];[13377];tar02_janitor;
Oh, hello again. Hope you didn't come to make a complaint about the mess in the building. I keep asking for an assistant, but they expect me to do it all on my own.;[];;[13380, 13382, 13390, 13403];[None];tar02_janitor;NM02AAJANI05020_.mp3

I could not see a way to save her.;[];;[13412];[13410];dan13_vrook;

I see you insist on wandering the halls of our Enclave when you should be busy studying your lessons.;[]; DIALOGUE  after being accepted for jedi training, but before becoming a padawan;[13418, 13420, 13424, 13450];[None];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18009_.mp3
My training is going well.;[];;[13419];[13417];dan13_vrook;
It appears that soon you will achieve the rank of Padawan. Master Zhar is most impressed with your progress. But I cannot help but wonder if you move forward too quickly.;[];;[];[13418];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18011_.mp3
I seek knowledge of the Jedi Code.;[];;[13421];[13417];dan13_vrook;
You do not know the Jedi Code? Without knowledge of those doctrines all your training will be for naught! All Jedi must know the code, its tenets are the fundamental teachings of our Order!;[];;[13422];[13420];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18013_.mp3
"There is no emotion; there is peace. There is no ignorance; there is knowledge. There is no passion; there is serenity. There is no chaos; there is harmony. There is no death; there is the Force.";[];;[13423];[13421];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18014_.mp3
Learn these truths, apprentice... or we shall all regret the decision to accept you into the Order.;[];;[];[13422];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18015_.mp3
I would like to ask some questions.;[];;[13425];[13417];dan13_vrook;
I suppose such desires are inevitable, though I fear you may seek knowledge for which you are not prepared. Yet I will do my best to guide your quest.;[];;[13426, 13430, 13439, 13445, 13446];[13424];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18017_.mp3
What can you tell me about Bastila?;[];;[13427];[13425];dan13_vrook;
Bastila? The young Jedi holds great promise... and great danger. She can do much for both the Republic and the Council. Without her skill in Battle Meditation the Sith armada would have conquered the galaxy long ago.;[];;[13428];[13426];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18019_.mp3
But despite her command of the Force Bastila is still young. She is a Jedi, but she has not attained the rank of Master. The Council would do well to remember this before we lay the fate of the galaxy on her slender shoulders.;[];;[13429];[13427];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18020_.mp3
You would do well to focus more closely on your lessons. The Force is strong with you, but you need training and guidance in the ways of the Jedi, lest you suffer a fate similar to that of Revan.;[];;[];[13428, 13437, 13438, 13444];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18021_.mp3
Is there anything you can tell me about Revan and Malak?;[];;[13431];[13425];dan13_vrook;
Revan was once a promosing Padawan. But ever eager to learn more about the Force, Revan sought knowledge of ancient Sith magics, foolishly ignoring the dangerous lure of the dark side.;[];;[13432];[13430];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18023_.mp3
When the Mandalorian invasion came, Revan seized the opportunity it presented. Many Jedi flocked to the Outer Rim to follow the charismatic young Knight... and many fell under the sway of the dark side.;[];;[13433, 13438];[13431];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18025_.mp3
What happened on the Outer Rim to corrupt Revan?;[];;[13434];[13432];dan13_vrook;
I do not believe Revan and Malak were corrupted on the Outer Rim. They had begun their journey down the dark path long before the Mandalorian threat appeared.;[];;[13435];[13433];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18027_.mp3
Here on Dantooine they discovered a sinister cave, a place where the strength of the dark side overwhelms the light.;[];;[13436];[13434];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18028_.mp3
Perhaps this discovery was what first corrupted them... or perhaps they sought the cave out because they were already corrupted.;[];;[13437];[13435];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18029_.mp3
Whatever the explanation, the Order was unable to turn them back to the light. Had the Council taken more decisive action in this matter, perhaps Revan and Malak could have been stopped. But in this we failed.;[];;[13429];[13436];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18030_.mp3
I should be going now.;[];;[13429];[13432];dan13_vrook;
You often seem angry with me, Master Vrook. Have I displeased you?;[];;[13440];[13425];dan13_vrook;
If you find me overly critical, perhaps it is because you do not fully understand what is at stake. For fifteen thousand years the Republic has brought peace and stability to the galaxy.;[];;[13441];[13439, 13445];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18033_.mp3
Now the Republic may be destroyed because we, the Jedi, have failed them. Revan and Malak were paragons of the ideals the Order seeks to uphold, yet they succumbed to the temptations of the dark side.;[];;[13442];[13440];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18034_.mp3
When Revan fell, Malak took up the mantle of Dark Lord of the Sith. Should Malak be stopped, what is to stop another Jedi from taking his place? This is the burden we Masters must carry.;[];;[13443];[13441];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18035_.mp3
Only through strict training and relentless lessons can we prevent the Dark Master from being reborn.;[];;[13444];[13442];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18036_.mp3
That is why the Order can brook no failure in our apprentices and pupils. That is why I can accept nothing but perfection from you.;[];;[13429];[13443];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18037_.mp3
Why are you always criticizing me?;[];;[13440];[13425];dan13_vrook;
Why does the Council not stop the Mandalorian raiders?;[];;[13447];[13425, 13459, 13478];dan13_vrook;
So you heard about them, did you?;[];;[13448];[13446];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18040_.mp3
They have been harmless up until now. It is tragic that someone had to die before we took action.;[];;[13449];[13447];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18041_.mp3
You have our leave to deal with the murdering Mandalorian raiders should you encounter them.;[];;[];[13448];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18042_.mp3
I must be going now.;[];;[13451];[13417];dan13_vrook;
Hmph! Well, get along then! Maybe you'll find the time to do something useful.;[];;[];[13450];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18044_.mp3

[Lie] That's horrible! I didn't know!;[];;[13454];[13452];dan13_vrook;

It is the way of the Jedi to provide help to those in need, and you seem to have lived up to this duty. I congratulate you, Padawan.;[];;[];[13457];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18051_.mp3
It is well that you are still alive, Padawan, in that you have not yet managed to fail us completely. Why is it that you are now bothering me instead of seeking out the Star Map?;[];;[13446, 13460, 13468, 13474, 13479, 13482];[None];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18052_.mp3
What can you tell me about the Sandral and Matale feud?;[];;[13461];[13459, 13478];dan13_vrook;
The Sandrals and Matales have been at odds ever since they came to this planet. And have been making my life difficult the entire time, as well.;[];;[13462];[13460];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18054_.mp3
Now Ahlan Matale accuses Nurik Sandral of stealing his son, Shen. Nurik Sandral's own son Casus has been missing for a while now. We do not know what has happened.;[];;[13463];[13461];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18055_.mp3
Ahlan is rash enough, and stupid enough, to start a war over any imagined slight. We would resolve this, but we have too few Jedi to spare. It must be resolved peacefully!;[];;[13464];[13462];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18056_.mp3
Their estates are both located to the south of the Enclave - the Sandral fairly far. It would normally be your duty to assist in such matters, but your primary task takes precedence.;[];;[13465];[13463];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18057_.mp3
If you are stuck on the planet for a while you may investigate. I would recommend starting at the estate of Ahlan Matale.;[];;[13466];[13464];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18058_.mp3
You have a mission to attend to, Padawan. And as much as I may wish it otherwise, you are our only hope.;[];;[13467];[13465, 13481, 13482];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18072_.mp3
The Council has placed the fate of the galaxy within your hands. I pray both you and Bastila are able to emerge from this ordeal as servants of the light. May the Force be with you, young Padawan.;[];;[];[13466, 13471, 13484];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18075_.mp3
I have found the body of the Jedi Nemo. He was slain by kath hounds.;[];;[13469];[13459, 13478];dan13_vrook;
Ah, Nemo. He was a brave and honorable man. He had great strength with the Force.;[];;[13470, 13473];[13468];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18060_.mp3
His strength was not enough...;[];;[13471, 13472];[13469];dan13_vrook;
But remember your task, Padawan!;[];;[13467];[13470, 13473];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18062_.mp3
I would not have thought that kath hounds alone would be able to overcome him. Perhaps there was more...;[];;[];[13470];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18061_.mp3
It is a most grievous loss...;[];;[13471];[13469];dan13_vrook;
What happened to Belaya?;[];;[13475];[13459];dan13_vrook;
The Jedi Belaya would seem to have disappeared. She had a lesson scheduled with Master Zhar but did not show up.;[];;[13476];[13474];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18064_.mp3
I have heard someone say that she had been seen leaving the Enclave, but I do not know where she would have gone.;[];;[13477];[13475];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18065_.mp3
If you meet her, you may want to ask her why she left. We do not force anyone to stay here, so do not think to take that route.;[];;[13478];[13476];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18066_.mp3
Is there anything else, then?;[];;[13446, 13460, 13468, 13479, 13482];[13477];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18067_.mp3
I have slain Belaya on Korriban. She was a Dark Jedi.;[];;[13480];[13478, 13459];dan13_vrook;
I find that... disturbing. It is our failings as teachers that enabled this to happen.;[];;[13481];[13479];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18069_.mp3
Do not give in to the same dark urges as she did or you may suffer a similar fate.;[];;[13466];[13480];dan13_vrook;NM13AAVROO18070_.mp3

Why were you banned?;[];;[13498];[13491, 13509];tar03_gelrood031;
A simple misunderstanding. Some of the other Pazaak players don't understand the finer points of the game. So what if I won fifteen matches in a row? That doesn't mean I cheat!;[];;[13499];[13497];tar03_gelrood031;NM03AEGELR12011_.mp3

Don't worry, I'll follow the rules.;[];;[13547];[13545];man26_selport;
There is a docking fee of 100 credits. You will have to pay this fee each time you dock on Manaan, or you will not be permitted into Ahto city.;[]; subsequent conversations;[13528, 13531, 13539, 13548];[13546, 13554, 13561, 13563];man26_selport;
[Persuade] Make it 50 credits and you got a deal.;[{'Player': 'Persuade'}];;[13549];[13547];man26_selport;
[Failure] The amount of the fee is legislated by the Manaan board of trade and tourism. I am not at liberty to haggle on this matter.;[];;[13528, 13531, 13539];[13548];man26_selport;
What are the rules, exactly?;[];;[13551];[13545];man26_selport;
The single most important law on Manaan is very simple. Kolto smuggling is punishable by death. If you're carrying any unprocessed kolto, you better have a permit.;[];;[13552];[13550, 13565];man26_selport;
The other rule is also very simple - keep the peace. Here on Manaan we maintain a careful neutrality, and we react very harshly to people who jeopardize our neutral status.;[];;[13553];[13551, 13569, 13568];man26_selport;
Any confrontations between the Sith and Republic are dealt with swiftly and decisively. Is this understood?;[];;[13554, 13555, 13558];[13552];man26_selport;
I understand.;[];;[13547];[13553, 13557];man26_selport;
That's it? Only two laws?;[];;[13556];[13553];man26_selport;
Don't be foolish, human! Of course we have laws against murder, theft and other crimes. But these laws are hardly different than those of any other planet.;[];;[13557];[13555];man26_selport;
Manaan's neutrality is closely linked to our kolto production - that is why I made special mention of the laws regarding smuggling and keeping the peace.;[];;[13554, 13558];[13556];man26_selport;
How can you be neutral when the Sith are trying to conquer everything?;[];;[13559];[13557, 13553];man26_selport;
The Sith respect the independence of Manaan as much as the Republic does. As long as we continue to control the production of a resource as valuable as kolto, we have no need to fear any conquering fleet.;[];;[13560];[13558];man26_selport;
Should Manaan ever come under attack, we would destroy the supply of kolto and vanish beneath the oceans of our world. Even the Sith are not willing to risk the loss of a commodity as valuable as kolto.;[];;[13561, 13562];[13559];man26_selport;
You seem to have it all worked out.;[];;[13547];[13560];man26_selport;
That seems awfully short sighted...;[];;[13563];[13560];man26_selport;
Your opinion is biased by your own alliances, human. Only we Selkath can best protect the interests of Manaan and Ahto city.;[];;[13547];[13562];man26_selport;
Pathetic laws of pathetic fish don't concern me.;[];;[13565];[13545];man26_selport;
Your dislike of us only seems matched by our dislike of you. Personal feelings do not factor into our legal system however. And ALL must obey our laws.;[];;[13551];[13564];man26_selport;
I do not have time to talk to you, human. I have business to attend to.;[];;[13567, 13570];[None];man26_selport;
Can you tell me the laws of Manaan?;[];;[13568];[13566];man26_selport;

This law is especially important since the Manaan government has decided to restrict kolto exports for an indeterminate amount of time.;[];;[13552];[13568];man26_selport;

I want information on something else.;[];;[13621];[13631, 13627, 13624, 13647, 13644, 13641, 13637];tar03_zax031;
I'll be going now.;[];;[13634];[13631, 13627, 13624, 13647, 13644, 13641, 13637, 13679, 13672, 13670, 13667, 13665, 13709, 13706, 13702, 13713, 13715, 13719, 13717, 13721, 13723, 13729, 13727, 13663, 13661, 13650, 13621, 13739, 13736, 13734, 13616, 13750, 13608, 13751];tar03_zax031;
Goodbye, human. You come back if you want to earn credits. Bounties pay good money. And remember to come see me if you want information.;[];;[];[13633];tar03_zax031;
Is there some way I can get off this planet?;[];;[13636];[13621];tar03_zax031;
The Sith quarantine has grounded all the vehicles. Everyone wants to leave, but it's just not possible. Davik has the fastest ship in the sector, but even he can't get off the planet.;[];;[13637];[13635];tar03_zax031;
The Sith fleet is orbiting Taris, and they use auto-targeting cannons. If a ship takes off those cannons will disintegrate it instantly, unless it had broadcast the launch codes.;[];;[13632, 13633, 13638];[13636];tar03_zax031;
Codes? What codes?;[];;[13639];[13637];tar03_zax031;
The Sith use launch codes when they leave the planet. If you transmit them from your ship, the auto-targeting cannons won't fire at you. Only people with the codes can leave Taris.;[];;[13640, 13648];[13638];tar03_zax031;
The codes were locked up in the military base, but somebody broke in recently. Maybe to steal the codes. But even if someone had the codes, how would they get a ship?;[];;[13641];[13639];tar03_zax031;
No, there's no way to get off Taris. You'd need a ship, the launch codes - and even then the Sith fighters would chase you down. We're all stuck here - even Davik.;[];;[13632, 13633, 13642];[13640, 13648];tar03_zax031;
Tell me about Davik.;[];;[13643];[13641, 13621];tar03_zax031;
"Davik's a busy man - he runs lower Taris. Before the Sith came he almost run Upper Taris, too. Extortion, slavery, smuggling; Davik controls it all.";[];;[13644];[13642];tar03_zax031;
He's part of the Exchange - a big intergalactic crime syndicate. You'd be smart to stay on his good side. Even the Sith know better than to pick a fight with Davik on Taris.;[];;[13632, 13633, 13645];[13643];tar03_zax031;
I want to meet Davik.;[];;[13646];[13644];tar03_zax031;
Ha-ha-ha! You can't meet Davik. Nobody meets Davik unless Davik wants to meet them. Even I only meet Davik once, long ago.;[];;[13647];[13645];tar03_zax031;
He's the king of the Lower City - he doesn't just walk around here like you or me. Davik stays in his estate and works through agents, like that big Mandalorian Canderous Ordo.;[];;[13632, 13633];[13646];tar03_zax031;
But the Sith keep the codes locked up safe in the military base. Nobody gets in there - too dangerous. And even if someone did get the codes, where are they going to get a ship?;[];;[13641];[13639];tar03_zax031;
I want to ask about something else.;[];;[13650];[13621, 13674];tar03_zax031;
Okay, human. What do you want to know?;[];;[13609, 13617, 13633, 13651];[13649];tar03_zax031;
Tell me about the bounties.;[];;[13652, 13657];[13650, 13739, 13736, 13734, 13616, 13750, 13608, 13751];tar03_zax031;
You don't intend on working as a bounty hunter, do you? What need could you possibly have for so many credits?;[];;[13653, 13657];[13651];tar03_zax031;NM03AE_ZAX22084_.mp3
It couldn't hurt, could it? Enough credits could help grease a lot of wheels.;[];;[13654];[13652];tar03_zax031;NM03AE_ZAX22086_.mp3
Getting paid to murder others is hardly justifiable. It is a path that could easily lead to the dark side.;[];;[13655];[13653];tar03_zax031;NM03AE_ZAX22088_.mp3
Well, it's my experience that the targets of these bounties are usually criminals, themselves. So don't get all in a twist over it.;[];;[13656];[13654];tar03_zax031;NM03AE_ZAX22090_.mp3
"I'll ""get in a twist"" if I think it is called for, Carth. I simply suggest we should use caution if we intend to participate in this... business.";[];;[13657];[13655];tar03_zax031;NM03AE_ZAX22092_.mp3
There's two government contracts. One's an assassin named Selven, the other is Bendak Starkiller. He's a famous death-match duelist. Between them they've killed hundreds of people.;[];;[13658, 13659];[13656, 13652, 13651];tar03_zax031;
I can't see anything wrong with getting rid of people like that - as long as we don't end up on the list of their victims.;[];;[13659];[13657];tar03_zax031;NM03AE_ZAX22195_.mp3
But not all the bounties are dangerous. Davik got some special contracts. One's for a girl named Dia - she attacked Holdan, one of Davik's men. Another's for a man named Largo who owes Davik money.;[];;[13660, 13661];[13658, 13657];tar03_zax031;
Okay, I don't know about Davik's special contracts. Justice is one thing, but doing a crime lord's dirty work is something else.;[];;[13661];[13659];tar03_zax031;NM03AE_ZAX22196_.mp3
And then there's Matrik. He used to work for Davik, then he betrayed the Exchange and now Davik wants him dead. I'll put all this information in your datapad.;[];;[13617, 13633, 13662, 13668, 13671, 13673];[13660, 13659];tar03_zax031;
I want more details on the bounties you're offering.;[];;[13663];[13661, 13667, 13670, 13672, 13679, 13709, 13751];tar03_zax031;
All the information is in your data-pad already, but if you don't want to look there then I guess I can fill you in. Who do you want to know more about?;[];;[13617, 13633, 13664, 13673, 13710, 13714, 13720, 13724];[13662, 13707];tar03_zax031;
Tell me about the assassin Selven.;[];;[13665, 13700];[13663];tar03_zax031;
Is this a joke, human? We've already dealt with that bounty! Why are you asking about it now? It's over. Don't waste my time with old bounties!;[];;[13617, 13633, 13666, 13673];[13664, 13710, 13714, 13720, 13724];tar03_zax031;
I have more questions about the bounties.;[];;[13667];[13665, 13715, 13721];tar03_zax031;
Okay, this is the bounty office, so it's the right place to ask about bounties. What's your question?;[];;[13633, 13662, 13668, 13671, 13673];[13666];tar03_zax031;
Davik's bounties sound more like contract killings.;[];;[13669];[13667, 13672, 13723, 13729, 13661];tar03_zax031;
Davik works for the Exchange. They don't play games. If you don't pay your debts or you betray them or you attack them they get even. People bring Davik's bounty on themselves.;[];;[13670];[13668];tar03_zax031;
Anyway, if you don't like them you don't have to take them. Collect the other bounties - government contracts. Those people are ruthless killers. They need to be stopped.;[];;[13617, 13633, 13662, 13671, 13673];[13669];tar03_zax031;
How do I collect the credits for these contracts?;[];;[13672];[13670, 13667, 13661];tar03_zax031;
It's simple - you find people, you kill them, you tell me, I pay you. I know everything that's going on in Taris. So if you kill one of them I'll know.;[];;[13617, 13633, 13662, 13668, 13673];[13671];tar03_zax031;
I've got a bounty I want to collect on.;[];;[13674];[13672, 13679, 13670, 13667, 13665, 13709, 13715, 13721, 13663, 13661, 13739, 13736, 13734, 13616, 13750, 13751];tar03_zax031;
A bounty? Well, human, that is what I'm here for. Which bounty are you here to collect on?;[];;[13649, 13675, 13689, 13692, 13694, 13696, 13698];[13673];tar03_zax031;
[Tell him about Matrik.];[];;[13676];[13674];tar03_zax031;
The traitor Matrik is now a dead traitor. This is a lesson for anyone thinking about turning against the Exchange.;[];;[13677];[13675];tar03_zax031;
Here - 300 credits. That's the price for all bounties.;[];;[13678, 13680, 13684];[13676, 13691, 13693, 13695, 13697, 13699];tar03_zax031;
Thanks. Pleasure doing business with you.;[];;[13679];[13677];tar03_zax031;
You do good work, human. There's lots of bounty hunters on Taris, but most are lazy. Maybe if you keep cashing in bounties they'll work harder.;[];;[13609, 13617, 13633, 13662, 13673];[13678, 13681, 13683];tar03_zax031;
[Persuade] I want 400 credits for this job.;[];;[13681, 13682];[13677];tar03_zax031;
[Success] You're brave, human, to bargain with a Hutt. But I like you. Okay, 400 it is!;[];;[13679];[13680];tar03_zax031;
[Failure] You don't bargain with me! This is my business - I set the prices, not you! You take 300 or you get nothing!;[];;[13683, 13684];[13680];tar03_zax031;
Sorry, I just lost my head. I'll take the 300.;[];;[13679];[13682, 13686];tar03_zax031;
You'll up that reward if you know what's good for you, Zax!;[];;[13685];[13682, 13677];tar03_zax031;
You're not too smart, human. Smart people don't threaten agents of Davik. You don't scare me, but you just made me mad. Maybe you need learn lesson.;[];;[13686];[13684];tar03_zax031;
Maybe I just won't pay you anything for this bounty? That would teach you some respect, wouldn't it? You want to reconsider and take the 300, human?;[];;[13683, 13687];[13685];tar03_zax031;
You can't talk to me like this!;[];;[13688];[13686];tar03_zax031;
Yes, I can, and there's nothing you can do about it. There's a security system in this building - you attack me and you'll be vaporised. Go away, human. Next time you'll know better.;[];;[];[13687];tar03_zax031;
[Lie: Tell him Matrik is dead.];[];;[13690];[13674];tar03_zax031;
I believe you, human. I've heard reports of a rather large explosion, and some of my people saw you buying the permacrete detonator.;[];;[13691];[13689];tar03_zax031;
It's good Matrik's dead but maybe you went overboard, human. Next time use a blaster, not a bomb! Bombs are messy. But at least the job is done.;[];;[13677];[13690];tar03_zax031;
[Tell him about Bendak.];[];;[13693];[13674];tar03_zax031;
So, you killed Bendak in death-match duel. Ironic, isn't it? Bendak has a bounty on him for killing people in duel, and you collect it by killing him in a death-match.;[];;[13677];[13692];tar03_zax031;
[Tell him about Selven.];[];;[13695];[13674];tar03_zax031;
So Selven's dead. All the other bounty hunters who went after her ended up dead themselves, you know. You did well, human.;[];;[13677];[13694];tar03_zax031;
[Tell him about Dia.];[];;[13697];[13674];tar03_zax031;
Too bad. Dia was a nice girl. But she attacked Holdan, and Holdan works for Davik. That was just stupid.;[];;[13677];[13696];tar03_zax031;
[Tell him about Largo.];[];;[13699];[13674];tar03_zax031;
Largo should have known better than to run. Maybe now people will learn the lesson: you owe Davik money, you pay!;[];;[13677];[13698];tar03_zax031;
"Selven's a government bounty; she's a very dangerous woman. When she started she was just another killer working for Davik. Then she began freelancing to the highest bidder.";[];;[13701];[13664];tar03_zax031;
One day she killed six citizens in the street... and their bodyguards, too. They were all Ulgos, a powerful merchant family with many enemies. Selven was hired to kill off the whole family.;[];;[13702];[13700];tar03_zax031;
"She was very good at her job. Each day, more Ulgos died. Poisoned at home, shot down in the street; guards and droids couldn't protect them. After a month there were no Ulgos left on Taris. Not one.";[];;[13633, 13703, 13707, 13708];[13701];tar03_zax031;
Did they ever find out who hired Selven to kill them all?;[];;[13704];[13702];tar03_zax031;
It was never proven. But after the Ulgos were all dead, the Organa family demanded the government put out a contract on Selven. They said nobody was safe as long as Selven was still free.;[];;[13705];[13703];tar03_zax031;
But the Organa family were powerful rivals of the Ulgos. Some think they were the ones who hired Selven, then they tried to have bounty hunters kill her to keep the secret from coming out.;[];;[13706];[13704];tar03_zax031;
But Taris politics aren't your concern. You're just a bounty hunter. You kill Selven, you get the credits. That's the only important thing, right?;[];;[13633, 13707, 13708];[13705];tar03_zax031;
I want to ask you about one of the other bounties.;[];;[13663];[13706, 13702, 13713, 13719, 13717, 13723, 13729, 13727];tar03_zax031;
I want to ask you something else.;[];;[13709];[13706, 13702, 13713, 13719, 13717, 13723, 13729, 13727];tar03_zax031;
Okay, but this is the bounty office. This is a place of business, so what kind of business have you got?;[];;[13609, 13617, 13633, 13662, 13673];[13708];tar03_zax031;
Tell me about Bendak Starkiller.;[];;[13665, 13711];[13663];tar03_zax031;
Bendak's a government contract, but he's a legend on Taris. He started out as duelist in the Upper Cantina. He never lost, but he only fought death matches. He killed hundreds in his day.;[];;[13712];[13710];tar03_zax031;
Then death matches got banned. Duel rings switched to non-lethal combat. But Bendak wasn't ready to retire. He keep dueling on the illegal, underground circuit. He kept killing people.;[];;[13713];[13711];tar03_zax031;
Finally the government had no choice but to put a bounty out on him. But Bendak's a big folk hero, so not too many try to collect. Those who do all wind up dead, anyway.;[];;[13633, 13707, 13708];[13712];tar03_zax031;
Tell me about this girl Dia.;[];;[13665, 13715, 13716];[13663];tar03_zax031;
Wait - I almost forgot. That bounty's been pulled, human. Holdan told me he doesn't want her dead anymore. Sorry, no credits for Dia.;[];;[13617, 13633, 13666, 13673];[13714];tar03_zax031;
Dia's one of Davik's private bounties. She used be a waitress in the cantina here until she had a fight with Holdan. She cut him with her vibroblade, almost killed him. That was a mistake.;[];;[13717];[13714];tar03_zax031;
Holdan works for Davik, he's not one to let her get away with that. When he was recovering in the medical bay, he put out a bounty on Dia. She's been hiding ever since.;[];;[13633, 13707, 13708, 13718];[13716];tar03_zax031;
I get the feeling there's more to this story.;[];;[13719];[13717];tar03_zax031;
Maybe. Doesn't really matter to me. I get the bounty from Davik's men, I don't ask questions. You can talk to Holdan if you want to know more - he's inside the cantina.;[];;[13633, 13707, 13708];[13718];tar03_zax031;
Tell me about this merchant Largo.;[];;[13665, 13721, 13722];[13663];tar03_zax031;
Actually, now that I think of it that bounty's no longer on the table. Davik told me Largo's bounty is off the table. I guess the merchant came up with the credits. Don't bother with that one anymore, human.;[];;[13617, 13633, 13666, 13673];[13720];tar03_zax031;
He's nothing special, just another of Davik's private bounties. He borrowed money from Davik for his business. But things went bad and he wasn't able to pay Davik back. So he ran.;[];;[13723];[13720];tar03_zax031;
Davik doesn't like it when people who owe him money run. He put out a contract on Largo to send a message to the other merchants who owe him money.;[];;[13633, 13668, 13707, 13708];[13722];tar03_zax031;
Tell me about Matrik.;[];;[13665, 13725];[13663];tar03_zax031;
Davik is very interested in this bounty. Matrik used to work for Davik. He wasn't important, but he was there a long time. He saw lots of things that it was wise to keep quiet about.;[];;[13726];[13724];tar03_zax031;
Then one day he betrayed Davik. He went to the Taris authorities and testified at trials against the Exchange. Lots of people were arrested and Davik's operations shut down for a while.;[];;[13727];[13725];tar03_zax031;
It cost Davik thousands and thousands of credits to get business back on track, and he lost lots of good people. Of course he's not about to let Matrik get away with that.;[];;[13633, 13707, 13708, 13728];[13726];tar03_zax031;
But didn't the government protect Matrik after the trials?;[];;[13729];[13727];tar03_zax031;
They hid Matrik for a while, but when the Sith took over they shut the witness protection program down. It's expensive, and the Sith didn't care if Matrik died.;[];;[13633, 13668, 13707, 13708];[13728];tar03_zax031;
[Persuade] That seems a little high just for information. I'll give you 50 credits.;[];;[13731, 13733];[13618];tar03_zax031;
[Success] This Sith quarantine makes it hard to earn credits. And Davik gets mad when his agents don't bring in enough.;[];;[13732];[13730];tar03_zax031;
Okay, give me 50 credits. But don't tell anyone I gave you a deal or everyone will want a bargain and I'll go out of business.;[];;[13620];[13731];tar03_zax031;
[Failure] Sorry, human.  If you get a break on the price then I have to give everyone a deal. I won't let you whittle my prices down! If you can't pay, then I won't talk.;[];;[13734];[13730];tar03_zax031;
Maybe you could take some bounties and earn some money? Then you could afford to pay for my information. You're happy, I'm happy, Davik gets his cut... it works out for everyone.;[];;[13633, 13651, 13673, 13735];[13733, 13742];tar03_zax031;
You work for Davik?;[];;[13736];[13734, 13750, 13608];tar03_zax031;
Not officially, no. I work for the bounty office. But Davik pays me to keep my eyes open and report to him... and for me to post his bounties.;[];;[13617, 13633, 13651, 13673, 13737, 13740];[13735];tar03_zax031;
Davik posts bounties in a government office? Is that even legal?;[];;[13738];[13736];tar03_zax031;
I used to have to keep our relationship secret, but since the Sith arrived nobody cares what happens in the Lower City. Davik can do whatever he wants.;[];;[13739];[13737, 13740];tar03_zax031;
But enough talk - back to business. This is the bounty office, so we should talk bounties. Or are you looking for information?;[];;[13617, 13633, 13651, 13673];[13738];tar03_zax031;
You don't try to hide the fact that Davik has you on his payroll?;[];;[13738];[13736];tar03_zax031;
I can't afford that much.;[];;[13742];[13618];tar03_zax031;
Then we don't do business. Davik pays me to earn credits, not to answer questions. If you don't pay, then I don't talk.;[];;[13734];[13741, 13743];tar03_zax031;
I'm not going to pay just to ask you some questions.;[];;[13742];[13618];tar03_zax031;

Hey, there. Say - I don't recognize you... you must be one of those new lab techs, right? What are you doing over here on the mechanics' side of the building? You lost, rookie?;[];;[13878, 13896, 13904, 13906];[None];tar10_vulkmech01;NM10ABVULK06000_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;[];;[13879];[13877, 13908];tar10_vulkmech01;
Can't say I blame you. They don't tell you new hires much, do they? Heh. Just throw you in the deep end and expect you to swim. Terrible way to run things, if you ask me.;[];;[13880];[13878];tar10_vulkmech01;NM10ABVULK06002_.mp3
If you've got a question, just ask. I'll be happy to help. Don't be shy - the only stupid question is the one you don't ask. At least, that's what they say.;[];;[13881, 13892, 13893, 13897];[13879, 13905];tar10_vulkmech01;NM10ABVULK06007_.mp3
Where are they keeping that prototype swoop engine accelerator?;[];;[13882];[13880, 13891];tar10_vulkmech01;
The accelerator? It's down in the garage, of course. The service elevator is the only way in. But you lab techs aren't allowed down there.;[];;[13883];[13881];tar10_vulkmech01;NM10ABVULK06009_.mp3
That's a restricted area. Only people with authorization cards, like us mechanics, can get past the laser cannons guarding the service elevator.;[];;[13884, 13890, 13897, 13899, 13900];[13882, 13892];tar10_vulkmech01;NM10ABVULK06012_.mp3
Where can I get a mechanic's authorization card?;[];;[13885];[13883];tar10_vulkmech01;
All mechanics have to store their authorization cards in the locker room when we're off duty. That's the rule. My own card is locked up right now - I put it away as soon as my shift was over.;[];;[13886];[13884, 13899, 13903];tar10_vulkmech01;NM10ABVULK06020_.mp3
And I'm not about to lend my card out to anyone. You know how much trouble we can get into if Brejik finds out we aren't keeping our authorization cards properly secured?;[];;[13887];[13885];tar10_vulkmech01;NM10ABVULK06022_.mp3
Of course, not all the mechanics here follow the rules as closely as they should. I've even heard of a few guys trading their cards for a spice fix! Heh. Stupid addicts.;[];;[13888, 13890, 13897];[13886];tar10_vulkmech01;NM10ABVULK06024_.mp3

I want to ask you something else.;[];;[13891];[13887, 13895, 13902, 13883];tar10_vulkmech01;
Sure, I'll help you however I can. I remember what it was like my first day here.;[];;[13881, 13892, 13893, 13896, 13897];[13890];tar10_vulkmech01;NM10ABVULK06027_.mp3
How can I get past the security system protecting the garage service elevator on the first floor?;[];;[13883];[13891, 13880];tar10_vulkmech01;
What's wrong with the heat in this place?;[];;[13894];[13891, 13880];tar10_vulkmech01;
There's nothing wrong with the heating system. Brejik just yanked the magnetic power cell out. All you have to do is pop that cell back in and the system is up and running again.;[];;[13895];[13893];tar10_vulkmech01;NM10ABVULK06029_.mp3
But until we figure out a way to make the heat work without disabling the thermal security system on the garage elevator, that cell's going to stay locked away in the Control Room.;[];;[13890, 13896, 13897];[13894];tar10_vulkmech01;NM10ABVULK06031_.mp3

Okay, then. If you need anything else, just come see me. I remember what it was like my first day.;[];;[];[13897];tar10_vulkmech01;NM10ABVULK06033_.mp3
Could I borrow your authorization card?;[];;[13885];[13883];tar10_vulkmech01;
Give me your authorization card or I'll kill you!;[];;[13901];[13883];tar10_vulkmech01;
Hey, now - that kind of talk won't win you many friends with the other lab techs! Of course, the Vulkar gang members might take a shine to you.;[];;[13902];[13900];tar10_vulkmech01;NM10ABVULK06016_.mp3
In any case, threatening me won't help you - I don't even have my card on me.;[];;[13888, 13890, 13897, 13903];[13901];tar10_vulkmech01;NM10ABVULK06018_.mp3

I need information, so start talking or I'll put a blaster hole in your chest!;[];;[13905];[13877, 13908];tar10_vulkmech01;
Hey, now... no need to be that way! Leave the violence to the Vulkar gang members, okay? We mechanics and lab techs are more civilized than that, right?;[];;[13880];[13904];tar10_vulkmech01;NM10ABVULK06005_.mp3
Sorry... wrong room. I'll be going now.;[];;[13907];[13877, 13908];tar10_vulkmech01;
No problem. I was always getting lost my first day too, rookie. I look forward to working with you.;[];;[];[13906];tar10_vulkmech01;NM10ABVULK06036_.mp3

I do not lose at Pazaak very often, but you have made a habit of beating me. I think it is obvious what that means - you cheat!;[];;[13910, 13914, 13915, 13917];[None];tar02_niklos021;NM02AENIKL28036_.mp3
You can't make an accusation like that without proof!;[];;[13911];[13909];tar02_niklos021;
I haven't been able to figure out how, but I know you're cheating. I'm simply too good to lose this often. And I refuse to play Pazaak with a cheater.;[];;[13912, 13913];[13910, 13914];tar02_niklos021;NM02AENIKL28038_.mp3

It's not my fault you're bad at Pazaak.;[];;[13911];[13909];tar02_niklos021;
Don't be a sore loser. I just want to ask you some questions.;[];;[13916];[13909];tar02_niklos021;
You cheat me out of my hard earned credits, and you expect me to answer your questions?;[];;[13913];[13915];tar02_niklos021;NM02AENIKL28046_.mp3

You were lucky to win the last match. But luck is no substitute for skill in Pazaak. If you are foolish enough to play me again I won't repeat the mistake of underestimating you.;[];;[13921, 13923, 13924, 13931];[None];tar02_niklos021;NM02AENIKL28048_.mp3

Questions? Heh. I don't come here to answer questions. If you want to play Pazaak, let's play. If not, then quit crowding my gaming table.;[];;[13917, 13923, 13926, 13929];[13924];tar02_niklos021;NM02AENIKL28004_.mp3
I want to play Pazaak, but I don't have a deck.;[];;[13927];[13925, 13930, 13935];tar02_niklos021;
You don't even have your own deck? Then why are you bothering me? You can't play Pazaak without your own deck!;[];;[13928];[13926];tar02_niklos021;NM02AENIKL28006_.mp3
If you're serious about Pazaak, go speak to old Garouk on the other side of the tavern. His gambling days are over, and he's looking to sell his deck.;[];;[];[13927];tar02_niklos021;NM02AENIKL28008_.mp3
Who are you?;[];;[13930];[13925, 13935, 13937];tar02_niklos021;
My name is Niklos. I'm the unofficial champion of the Pazaak circuit here on Taris. If you don't mind losing your wager we could play a few hands.;[];;[13923, 13924, 13926, 13931];[13929, 13939];tar02_niklos021;NM02AENIKL28002_.mp3
Sorry, not interested right now.;[];;[13919];[13930, 13920, 13937];tar02_niklos021;
Pazaak is not for everyone - it requires both nerve and skill. Perhaps you should practice before risking your credits against such a skilled player as myself. Heh heh heh. Unless you like losing?;[];;[13917, 13923, 13924, 13933];[None];tar02_niklos021;NM02AENIKL28051_.mp3

What do you want? Have you come here just to bother me, or do you wish to test yourself against the best Pazaak player on Taris? Heh heh heh.;[];;[13917, 13923, 13924, 13926, 13929];[None];tar02_niklos021;NM02AENIKL28000_.mp3

Greetings once again, Revan. I am glad that you have returned. I couldn't believe that you had betrayed us, despite what the Council said.;[];;[13990, 14055];[None];unk42_redhistory;
Who are you?;[];;[13991];[13989];unk42_redhistory;
My name is Orsaa. I am the Keeper of History for the Elders. The last time you were here you had many questions for me.;[];;[13992];[13990, 14055];unk42_redhistory;
The Council told us all of the destruction of your memories, but still I had hoped you might recall something of our past discussion.;[];;[13993, 14019, 14052, 14054];[13991];unk42_redhistory;
I wish I could remember, but I don't. Sorry.;[];;[13994];[13992];unk42_redhistory;
There is no need to apologize. It just pains me to know that all you had learned from me has been forgotten. Still, I would be happy to instruct you again.;[];;[13995, 14051];[13993];unk42_redhistory;
Actually, I do have a few questions for you.;[];;[13996];[13994, 14053];unk42_redhistory;
Yes, of course. Although you must forgive me if some of this starts to seem familiar. After all, we did go into the history of the Rakata at some length the last time you were here.;[];;[13997];[13995, 14054];unk42_redhistory;
I will do my best to enlighten you with the knowledge I hold. What subject do you wish to learn about?;[];;[13998, 14004, 14019, 14021, 14025, 14036, 14046];[13996, 14010, 14016];unk42_redhistory;
Tell me about the beginnings of the Rakata Empire.;[];;[13999];[13997];unk42_redhistory;
Long ago, we Rakata were a great space-faring people. Our ships combined techonolgy and the power of the Force, and we were able to pilot them to the farthest reaches of the galaxy.;[];;[14000];[13998];unk42_redhistory;
Everywhere we went, we found civilizations less advanced and weaker then our own. But instead of helping them advance, we conquered and enslaved them.;[];;[14001];[13999];unk42_redhistory;
Back then, we could still command the Force. That, combined with our advanced technolgy made our march of conquest irresistable. Soon the Infinite Empire stretched across the entire galaxy.;[];;[14002];[14000];unk42_redhistory;
Over time, we lost our ability to use the Force. Some believe we had used the Force for so long that we evolved biologically, and became immune to its effects.;[];;[14003];[14001];unk42_redhistory;
In any case, once we lost our sensitivity to the Force our Empire began to fracture. We had to revert to more conventional space travel using inferior technology. Our ultimate collapse was inevitable.;[];;[14004, 14010, 14019, 14021, 14025, 14036, 14046];[14002];unk42_redhistory;
How did the Rakata Empire collapse?;[];;[14005];[14003, 13997];unk42_redhistory;
"Long ago the Rakata ruled all the known galaxy; all the species bowed down to us. But we were a corrupt people, and in our fall from glory there are terrible lessons that must be learned.";[];;[14006];[14004];unk42_redhistory;
"The Infinite Empire was built on slaughter; it was inevitable it should collapse upon itself. War, plague and slave rebellion forced us to retreat back here to our hidden home world.";[];;[14007];[14005];unk42_redhistory;
Here, conflict among power-hungry warlords escalated into full civil war. Terrible weapons of mass destruction were unleashed, driving most of the Rakata far beneath the earth for shelter.;[];;[14008];[14006];unk42_redhistory;
The devastation ravaged the world. Our people were scattered, our cities levelled, our very existence all but erased. The glory of the Infinite Empire is now nothing but dust and bones.;[];;[14009];[14007];unk42_redhistory;
In the past few thousand years small bands of Rakata have begun to return to the surface, but they are primitive and superstitious creatures. Only we Elders remember anything of the true past.;[];;[14010, 14011, 14013, 14017, 14019];[14008];unk42_redhistory;
I want to ask you about something else.;[];;[13997];[14009, 14012, 14024, 14032, 14044, 14039, 14050, 14003];unk42_redhistory;
Do you know how to disable the disruptor field that caused my ship to crash?;[];;[14012];[14009, 14015, 14024, 14032, 14044, 14050, 14056];unk42_redhistory;
"The disruptor field is one of the ancient defenses of the Star Forge; a great generator within the Temple of the Ancients fuels it. You will have to enter the Temple to disable it.";[];;[14010, 14013, 14019];[14011];unk42_redhistory;
Do you know where I can find parts to repair my ship?;[];;[14014];[14012, 14009, 14024, 14032, 14044, 14050, 14056];unk42_redhistory;
We do not have what you need, but the tribe of the One often take pieces from the ships that crash onto the planet, though they do not understand the technology they are hoarding.;[];;[14015];[14013];unk42_redhistory;
You might find the parts you need in their camp, back towards the beach where your ship first crashed. Or you could try to salvage the parts you need from the wrecks scattered about the island.;[];;[14011, 14016, 14017, 14019];[14014];unk42_redhistory;
I want to ask you some questions.;[];;[13997];[14015, 14056];unk42_redhistory;
Thanks for the information. I guess I can kill you now!;[];;[14018];[14015, 14009, 14024, 14032, 14044, 14050];unk42_redhistory;
Guards! Guards! We are under attack!;[];;[];[14017, 14057];unk42_redhistory;
I have to go now.;[];;[14020];[14015, 14012, 14009, 14024, 14032, 14044, 14050, 14003, 13997, 13992, 14056];unk42_redhistory;
Yes, of course. You have much to do, and little enough time to do it. But if you ever have any questions for me, I will be happy to try and answer them.;[];;[];[14019, 14051];unk42_redhistory;
Tell me about the tribe of Elders.;[];;[14022];[14003, 13997];unk42_redhistory;
We Elders are descendants of the holy priest caste of the Infinite Empire, survivors of the terrible weapons unleashed by the warlords during the final collapse of our Empire.;[];;[14023];[14021];unk42_redhistory;
Inside the Temple of the Ancients, our ancestors were safe from the devastation that forced the other Rakata to flee undergound. We emerged from the Temple to find an empty and ruined land.;[];;[14024];[14022];unk42_redhistory;
At last we understood the terrible power of our own technology. To ensure it could never be unleashed upon us again, we sealed the ancient knowledge within the Temple.;[];;[14010, 14011, 14013, 14017, 14019];[14023];unk42_redhistory;
What do you know about the other Rakata tribes here?;[];;[14026];[14003, 13997];unk42_redhistory;
Many centuries ago, the other Rakata began to emerge from the underground warrens where they had sought shelter from the devastation of the warlords.;[];;[14027];[14025];unk42_redhistory;
But these Rakata were as violent as the warlords they had fled many millennia ago. After centuries of battle and bloodshed, the tribe of the One has emerged as the strongest of them all.;[];;[14028];[14026];unk42_redhistory;
Now the One, lured by half-remembered legends of his people, lusts to possess the terrible power locked inside the Temple. We can never allow that to happen.;[];;[14029, 14033];[14027];unk42_redhistory;
Have you tried reasoning with the One?;[];;[14030];[14028];unk42_redhistory;
When the One first arrived on this island, we sent emissaries under a flag of truce to try and negotiate with his tribe. But all our envoys were brutally slaughtered.;[];;[14031];[14029];unk42_redhistory;
We do have the technology to destroy the One and his followers. But if we kill them all, then we will only prove that we have learned nothing over the past 20,000 years.;[];;[14032];[14030];unk42_redhistory;
"The One is mad with power. We choose not to fight him, so our only course of action is to stay here in isolation where we are safe; just as we have done for the past 20,000 years.";[];;[14010, 14011, 14013, 14017, 14019];[14031, 14035];unk42_redhistory;
Can't you just use your technology to destroy the One?;[];;[14034];[14028];unk42_redhistory;
We have the technology to destroy the One and his followers. But if we kill them all, then we will only prove that we have learned nothing over the past 20,000 years.;[];;[14035];[14033];unk42_redhistory;
We tried to negotiate with them. We went emissaries under a flag or truce when the One first arrived on this island. But all our envoys were brutally slaughtered.;[];;[14032];[14034];unk42_redhistory;
What do you know about the Temple of the Ancients?;[];;[14037];[14003, 13997];unk42_redhistory;
The Temple is a sacred place of terrible secrets. All the dark mysteries of the Rakata are housed within its stone walls, which pulse with the living power of the Ancients.;[];;[14038];[14036];unk42_redhistory;
Only those who can command this power - what you call the Force - can enter the Temple. Many centuries ago there were still a few among us who could pass within its walls.;[];;[14039];[14037];unk42_redhistory;
But living in the shadow of the Temple we became desensitized to this power. As you yourself said the last time you were here, we Elders are no longer 'Force sensitive'.;[];;[14010, 14040, 14045];[14038];unk42_redhistory;
Can any of the Rakata enter the Temple?;[];;[14041];[14039];unk42_redhistory;
None of the Rakata can control the Force now, but long ago there were those who could pass through the barrier.;[];;[14042];[14040, 14045];unk42_redhistory;
Our ancestors created the energy shield around the building as a second line of defense. But the energy shield was created using technology within the Temple itself.;[];;[14043];[14041];unk42_redhistory;
Once we helped you and Malak to get past the barrier, you discovered a way to lower the shields at will from within the Temple itself. After this you had no further need of us.;[];;[14044];[14042];unk42_redhistory;
The once hallowed ground of the Temple is now overrun with the followers of Malak who can command the Force: those you call the Dark Jedi.;[];;[14010, 14011, 14013, 14017, 14019];[14043];unk42_redhistory;
So why is there an energy field outside the Temple then?;[];;[14041];[14039];unk42_redhistory;
Can you tell me about the Star Forge?;[];;[14047];[14003, 13997];unk42_redhistory;
Much of our knowledge of the Star Forge is lost. It was built during the height of the Infinite Empire, long ago. All we know now is that it casts a terrible shadow across our world.;[];;[14048];[14046];unk42_redhistory;
We Elders have longed to destroy the Star Forge for many generations, to cleanse ourselves of its evil presence. But we have neither the knowledge, nor the capability.;[];;[14049];[14047];unk42_redhistory;
When you and Malak last came here, we saw you as saviors. We let you into the Temple so you could destroy the Star Forge, but instead you harnessed its dark power for yourselves.;[];;[14050];[14048];unk42_redhistory;
You awakened a dormant evil, your fleet helped spread the corruption of the Star Forge throughout the galaxy. And now you return as our last hope to stop what you once started.;[];;[14010, 14011, 14013, 14017, 14019];[14049];unk42_redhistory;
Maybe later.;[];;[14020];[13994];unk42_redhistory;
Look on the bright side: we can have all those discussions again.;[];;[14053];[13992];unk42_redhistory;
Yes, I suppose that is true. As you can imagine, I have few opportunities to share my knowledge with those outside our enclave.;[];;[13995];[14052];unk42_redhistory;
You're a historian? Maybe I could ask you some questions.;[];;[13996];[13992];unk42_redhistory;
I'm sorry, I don't remember you.;[];;[13991];[13989];unk42_redhistory;
Yes, Revan. What do you need?;[];;[14011, 14013, 14016, 14019, 14057];[None];unk42_redhistory;

He is our Chieftain and will be obeyed. That is our way. Whether I trust what he says or not doesn't matter.;[];;[14076];[14074];kas22_chorraw_01;
In time, someone will replace him. For better or worse, I don't know. That will be for Bacca to decide.;[];;[14069, 14077, 14084, 14089, 14091];[14075];kas22_chorraw_01;
How will Bacca decide? What does that mean?;[];;[14078];[14076];kas22_chorraw_01;
Bacca was our greatest warrior. His ancient sword is the tool of ascension, the mark of a chieftain.;[];;[14079];[14077];kas22_chorraw_01;
Chuundar no longer displays it, not since he took the role of chieftain years ago. If someone else could produce it...;[{'Chorrawl': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[14080];[14078];kas22_chorraw_01;

Could a blood relative of Chuundar challenge him?;[];;[14082];[14080];kas22_chorraw_01;
It truly would take Bacca's Blade for that to happen. Chuundar is the last member of his family.;[];;[14083];[14081];kas22_chorraw_01;

Beware this... this spirit. It may not be what it appears. Great emotion lies within...;[];;[14168, 14238];[14166];kor37_freedonnad;NM37AAFREE04053_.mp3
Analysis: This emanation barely registers on my sensors, master. Blaster fire may be ineffective... but I am prepared to test that at your word.;[];;[14168, 14238];[14166];kor37_freedonnad;NM37AAFREE04055_.mp3
Good day, officer. Don't mind me, I'm just standing here minding my own business. I'm not looking for any trouble with the Sith.;[];;[];[None];tar02_larrim;
Well, I don't see too many of your kind around here. Most of the residents in this run down old apartment are illegal aliens. My name is Larrim, by the way.;[];;[14247, 14282];[None];tar02_larrim;
Pleased to meet you, Larrim. My name is <FullName>.;[];;[14248];[14246];tar02_larrim;
I know it's really none of my business, but you look like someone who might need to purchase one of those new energy shields. They're the latest thing, you know. Very high tech.;[];;[14249, 14281];[14247, 14284];tar02_larrim;
What's so great about these energy shields?;[];;[14250];[14248];tar02_larrim;
When you use one it surrounds you with a radiant aura-particle mesh that absorbs blaster bolts. Pretty handy in a fight. The shield even protects against lightsabers, or so I hear.;[];;[14251];[14249];tar02_larrim;
The shields aren't perfect, of course. They can only absorb so much energy damage before they burn out, and ion blasters will take your basic dueling shield down pretty quick.;[];;[14252, 14280];[14250];tar02_larrim;
And I can tell you from experience that they aren't any good at all against a simple vibroblade. That's why the Republic has been training soldiers in hand-to-hand and melee combat.;[];;[14253, 14278];[14251];tar02_larrim;NM02AALARR99029_.mp3
Where did this technology come from?;[];;[14254];[14252, 14280];tar02_larrim;
I've heard rumors of the Echani using shields like this, but I never saw anything like them around here. Not until the Sith came. Where they discovered the technology is anybody's guess.;[];;[14255];[14253];tar02_larrim;
The shields are too rare and too expensive to hand out to an entire army, but a shielded strike team can take out a whole battalion of soliders armed with conventional blasters.;[];;[14256];[14254];tar02_larrim;
It gave the Sith a huge edge in the early battles, but it wasn't long before the Republic was able to copy the technology and come up with energy shields of their own.;[];;[14257];[14255];tar02_larrim;
Now both sides are scrambling to come up with new weapons to slice right through the shields, but until they do you're going to see melee combat coming back to the forefront in this war.;[];;[14258, 14278];[14256];tar02_larrim;
Anything else?;[];;[14259];[14257];tar02_larrim;
Not much more to say, really. Except that I've managed to get my hands on one of those shields. It isn't cheap, but it could mean the difference between life and death.;[];;[14260];[14258];tar02_larrim;
You want to see what I have in stock? I know my kiosk isn't much to look at, but my prices are reasonable and the merchandise is sound.;[];;[14261, 14263, 14270, 14274, 14276];[14259, 14279];tar02_larrim;
Why do you have a kiosk set up here?;[];;[14262];[14260, 14273, 14266, 14285];tar02_larrim;
I run a little shop here in this old building, selling basic equipment to the illegal aliens renting out these apartments.;[];;[14263, 14270, 14274, 14276];[14261];tar02_larrim;
You mentioned something about illegal aliens living here.;[];;[14264];[14262, 14273, 14260];tar02_larrim;
By law, most aliens aren't allowed to have a residence in the Upper City of Taris. They allow a few of us Twi'leks up here, but for the most part it's humans only.;[];;[14265];[14263];tar02_larrim;
But no self-respecting Upper City human would want to live in the apartments in this dump. So the landlord has been renting out the apartments illegally to aliens.;[];;[14266];[14264];tar02_larrim;
Better than letting them sit empty, I guess. Otherwise you get squatters and people hiding out from the authorities living in the abandoned apartments, and they don't pay rent.;[];;[14261, 14267, 14270, 14274, 14276];[14265];tar02_larrim;
Aren't you worried about getting caught?;[];;[14268];[14266];tar02_larrim;
The Taris authorities pretty much turned a blind eye to this place. A few illegal aliens just weren't worth the bother. And once the Sith took over, they felt the same way.;[];;[14269];[14267];tar02_larrim;
Besides, I don't live here myself. I just run a small business providing supplies to the residents. You want to see what I have in stock?;[];;[14270, 14274, 14276];[14268];tar02_larrim;
I want to ask you some questions.;[];;[14271];[14269, 14266, 14262, 14260, 14285];tar02_larrim;
Questions? I'd rather not. It might be bad for business if people saw me answering a bunch of questions for a human.;[];;[14272];[14270];tar02_larrim;
Most of the residents here are illegal aliens, questions are frowned on. I don't want to lose the trust of my customers. If you really need information, go talk to Kadir the janitor.;[];;[14273];[14271];tar02_larrim;
He's bordering on senile so all the residents figure he's harmless. They won't mind you talking to him, and he might be able to help you out with your questions.;[];;[14261, 14263, 14274, 14276];[14272];tar02_larrim;
Let me see what you've got for sale.;[];;[14275];[14273, 14269, 14266, 14262, 14260, 14285];tar02_larrim;
No problem. Just step on up and have a peek.;[];;[];[14274];tar02_larrim;
I'll be going now.;[];;[14277];[14273, 14269, 14266, 14262, 14260, 14285];tar02_larrim;
See you around. Come on back if you need any equipment. I've got some merchandise you might be interested in.;[];;[];[14276];tar02_larrim;
I've heard enough about these shields.;[];;[14279];[14257, 14252, 14280];tar02_larrim;
Oh, okay. Well then, you might be interested in knowing I have one for sale. It isn't cheap, but it could be the difference between life and death.;[];;[14260];[14278, 14281];tar02_larrim;
And they aren't any good at all against a simple vibroblade. That's why the Sith and the Republic are training their troops in hand-to-hand and melee combat.;[];;[14253, 14278];[14251];tar02_larrim;
I know all about energy shields.;[];;[14279];[14248];tar02_larrim;
I don't care what your name is... and I'm not telling you mine!;[];;[14283, 14284];[14246];tar02_larrim;
Look, I know we're trying to keep a low profile but this kind of attitude will draw attention we don't need.;[];;[14284];[14282];tar02_larrim;NM02AALARR06024_.mp3
Hey, I wasn't trying to pry or anything. I know people here like their privacy. It's just that I might be able to help you out.;[];;[14248];[14283, 14282];tar02_larrim;
Back again? So, what can I do for you? You want to see what I have in stock?;[];;[14261, 14270, 14274, 14276];[None];tar02_larrim;

What if Zaalbar has something to say about this?;[];;[14289];[14287, 14292, 14294, 14297];kas22_xxpost_01;
I would assume that he has very little to say, or he would have said it before.;[];;[14290];[14288];kas22_xxpost_01;
I have made my peace with Chuundar. I see that his way is best. You showed me that. There is nothing here for me anymore.;[];;[14291, 14293, 14295];[14289];kas22_xxpost_01;
What are your plans now?;[];;[14292];[14290, 14294, 14287, 14297];kas22_xxpost_01;
I am merely a guard. You will have to address any further concerns with Janos back at the outpost docking port.;[];;[14288, 14293, 14295];[14291];kas22_xxpost_01;
What if I don't approve of this?;[];;[14294];[14292, 14290, 14287, 14297];kas22_xxpost_01;
Then you shouldn't have helped to make it happen. It is far too late for such a confrontational tone. Please, address further concerns with Janos.;[];;[14288, 14291, 14295];[14293];kas22_xxpost_01;
Goodbye.;[];;[14296];[14294, 14292, 14290, 14287, 14297];kas22_xxpost_01;

You had an impressive run there, rookie. But it wasn't good enough, was it?;[];;[14299, 14300];[None];tar03_redros;
Anglu's already got you beat. It takes more than a souped up swoop bike to make a champion, so I guess I'm going to have to win this thing for Vulkars!;[];;[];[14298];tar03_redros;
I'm twice the rider you'll ever be, rookie! You can go out there for another run if you want, but why bother? You'll never match the time I posted!;[];;[];[14298];tar03_redros;
Another rookie on the track, eh? Give you punks a helmet and a swoop bike and suddenly you all figure you're racers.;[];;[14302, 14303];[None];tar03_redros;
But the only reason you're here is because I passed on that prototype accelerator. It's too unstable, and you can't collect the champion's prize if you're dead!;[];;[];[14301];tar03_redros;
But judging by the look of you I'd say I don't have much to worry about. The Beks are really scraping the bottom of the barrel now.;[];;[];[14301];tar03_redros;
I figured you weren't nothing special, rookie. And after watching your last run I see I was right.;[];;[];[None];tar03_redros;
You again? Look, I plan on winning this thing so I can't be wasting my time talking to some rookie!;[];;[];[None];tar03_redros;

I... alright. I'll do it. For you.;[{'Player': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[14374];[14367];k_sta_carth;
No! I won't let you do this! Don't be a fool, Revan!!;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[14375, 14377, 14378];[14373];k_sta_carth;NM45AACART02057_.mp3
I... am *not* Revan!!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[14376];[14374];k_sta_carth;
No! No-ooo!! You can't do this! Not when we're so close!!;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Pleading'}];;[];[14375, 14377, 14378];k_sta_carth;NM45AACART02061_.mp3
You could join us, Bastila. Turn away from the dark side.;[];;[14376];[14374];k_sta_carth;
Time for this to end, Bastila!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[14376];[14374];k_sta_carth;
You're mad!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[14366];[14364];k_sta_carth;
That will never happen. Bastila... kill him now.;[];;[14369];[14364];k_sta_carth;
It's too late to turn back, Carth. Even if I wanted to.;[];;[14382];[14361];k_sta_carth;
I know. It's too late to turn back... but you can end this here. There's still time for one final act of redemption.;[{'Carth': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[14364];[14381];k_sta_carth;NM45AACART02065_.mp3
Kill him, Bastila. He means nothing to me.;[];;[14369];[14361];k_sta_carth;
Yes, kill him. Nothing he could say will matter.;[];;[14369, 14371];[14356];k_sta_carth;
I'm sorry, Carth. It's too late. We both know that.;[];;[14369];[14356];k_sta_carth;
I'm glad I get to kill you personally, Carth. For old times' sake.;[];;[14369];[14356];k_sta_carth;
I don't need you, Carth, and I won't change my mind.;[];;[14369];[14356];k_sta_carth;
You should have stayed wherever you ran to.;[];;[14389];[14350];k_sta_carth;
And abandon you? No, I couldn't have done that.;[{'Carth': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[14353];[14388];k_sta_carth;NM45AACART02036_.mp3
And how, exactly, do you propose to do that?;[];;[14391];[14350];k_sta_carth;
All you have to do is listen to me. That's all I ask.;[{'Carth': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[14353];[14390];k_sta_carth;NM45AACART02038_.mp3
Somehow I'm not surprised you found a way here.;[];;[14349];[14347];k_sta_carth;
Carth. You should still be on the planet, shouldn't you?;[];;[14349];[14347];k_sta_carth;
You are a student at the academy. You may enter by the door.;[{'Sith Academy Guard': 'Salute'}];;[];[None];k33_academyguard;NM33ABACAD01000_.mp3
You again? I told you to locate Yuthura Ban in the cantina. She is the only one who can bring new students into the academy.;[];;[];[None];k33_academyguard;NM33ABACAD01001_.mp3
Greetings, student. I see you have the medallion that marks you as one of the chosen.;[{'Sith Academy Guard': 'Salute'}];;[14397];[None];k33_academyguard;NM33ABACAD01002_.mp3
I do not recognize you, however. Have you been accepted into the academy very recently?;[];;[14398, 14421, 14422];[14396];k33_academyguard;NM33ABACAD01003_.mp3
Yes. Today, in fact.;[];;[14399, 14406];[14397];k33_academyguard;
I see. And who might your friends be?;[];;[14400, 14417];[14398, 14421, 14422];k33_academyguard;NM33ABACAD01005_.mp3
They are my slaves.;[];;[14401];[14399];k33_academyguard;
Ah. I trust you will be responsible for ensuring your slaves are not disruptive, then?;[];;[14402, 14406, 14409, 14411, 14414];[14400];k33_academyguard;NM33ABACAD01007_.mp3
No more disruptive than our 'master' will be.;[];;[14403];[14401];k33_academyguard;NM33ABACAD01008_.mp3
What was that?;[];;[14404, 14408];[14402];k33_academyguard;NM33ABACAD01009_.mp3
Ahh... ignore him, sir. He is mentally deficient. And he drools.;[];;[14405];[14403];k33_academyguard;NM33ABACAD01010_.mp3
Hey!;[];;[14406];[14404];k33_academyguard;NM33ABACAD01011_.mp3
You will want to bring your medallion to Yuthura Ban. She is the one who brings all selected students into the academy for their training.;[];;[14407];[14405, 14408, 14410, 14413, 14411, 14416, 14414, 14401, 14419, 14420, 14418, 14398, 14421, 14422];k33_academyguard;NM33ABACAD01025_.mp3
I believe she can be located within the cantina here in the colony. I suggest you go to her while she is still there, student.;[];;[];[14406];k33_academyguard;NM33ABACAD01026_.mp3
Oh, nothing.;[];;[14406];[14403];k33_academyguard;NM33ABACAD01012_.mp3
Grrr... I will not play the part of slave for long. Not even to pass this fool.;[{'Zaalbar': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[14410];[14401];k33_academyguard;
If your animal acts up he will be destroyed. This would reflect badly on you, understand?;[];;[14406];[14409];k33_academyguard;NM33ABACAD01014_.mp3
Hmph. Suddenly I'm a convincing slave, am I? Maybe you should have left me on the ship.;[];;[14406, 14412];[14401];k33_academyguard;NM33ABACAD01015_.mp3
I always think we should leave you on the ship, old man.;[];;[14413];[14411];k33_academyguard;NM33ABACAD01016_.mp3
Don't get smart-mouthed with me, young man. You're not too old to put over my knee.;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[14406];[14412];k33_academyguard;NM33ABACAD01017_.mp3
Commentary: Disruptive? What does he mean by that? I have never been disruptive, master.;[];;[14406, 14415];[14401];k33_academyguard;NM33ABACAD01018_.mp3
Beep! Beep! Boooop!;[];;[14416];[14414];k33_academyguard;
Well, besides *that*.;[];;[14406];[14415];k33_academyguard;NM33ABACAD01020_.mp3
They are none of your business.;[];;[14418];[14399];k33_academyguard;
So long as the Sith do not object to them, neither will I. They will be your responsibility, of course.;[];;[14406, 14419, 14420];[14417];k33_academyguard;NM33ABACAD01022_.mp3
Aren't we always?;[];;[14406];[14418];k33_academyguard;NM33ABACAD01023_.mp3
Commentary: And if the Sith do object to us, master, I shall fill them full of new holes!;[];;[14406];[14418];k33_academyguard;NM33ABACAD01024_.mp3
That's none of your business, soldier.;[];;[14399, 14406];[14397];k33_academyguard;
No. I have been away for a while.;[];;[14399, 14406];[14397];k33_academyguard;
You are neither a Sith nor do you bear the medallion of a student of this facility. Please leave at once.;[];;[14424, 14428, 14431, 14434, 14436, 14438];[None];k33_academyguard;NM33ABACAD01029_.mp3
[Persuade] I'm Darth Revan. I was Lord of the Sith. Let me in.;[];;[14425];[14423, 14437];k33_academyguard;
[Failure] I see. And who might your friends be?;[];;[14426];[14424];k33_academyguard;NM33ABACAD01005_.mp3
It's obvious you don't believe me. But I really am Darth Revan!;[];;[14427];[14425];k33_academyguard;
On your way, citizen.;[];;[];[14426, 14438];k33_academyguard;NM33ABACAD01041_.mp3
How do I become a Sith, then?;[];;[14429];[14423, 14433, 14435, 14437];k33_academyguard;
You must be admitted to the academy. That decision must be made by a Sith who has already been accepted, here.;[];;[14430];[14428];k33_academyguard;NM33ABACAD01031_.mp3
The final decision, however, remains with Master Yuthura. I believe she is currently at the cantina if you wish to seek her out. Now go.;[];;[];[14429];k33_academyguard;NM33ABACAD01032_.mp3
What's this medallion you mention?;[];;[14432];[14423, 14435, 14437];k33_academyguard;
It is the device given to one who has been accepted into the academy, but has not yet proved their worth as a student.;[];;[14433];[14431];k33_academyguard;NM33ABACAD01034_.mp3
If one of the Sith decides you are worthy, you will be given one... which you must then take to Yuthura Ban, who I believe is in the cantina. It is she who decides which hopefuls enter the academy.;[];;[14428, 14434, 14436, 14438];[14432];k33_academyguard;NM33ABACAD01035_.mp3
[Persuade] I need to get inside. I have been sent to speak with the Master of the Academy!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Pleading'}];;[14435];[14433, 14437, 14423];k33_academyguard;

[Force Persuade] You will let me inside.;[{'Player': 'Persuade'}];;[14437];[14435, 14433, 14423];k33_academyguard;
[Failure] I have been conditioned to resist mental persuasion, citizen. Please do not attempt that again.;[{'Player': 'Persuade'}];;[14424, 14428, 14431, 14434, 14438];[14436];k33_academyguard;NM33ABACAD01039_.mp3
I'll be going.;[];;[14427];[14437, 14435, 14433, 14423];k33_academyguard;
This entrance to the Sith Embassy has been closed temporarily due to a maintenance failure. The main entrance to the Embassy will reopen when the problem has been fixed.;[];;[14440, 14443, 14445];[None];man26_sdroid;NM26ABSDOI06000_.mp3
I heard the Embassy was attacked.;[];;[14441];[14439];man26_sdroid;
What?! How did you... Um... This unit has no knowledge of what you're talking about.;[];;[14442];[14440];man26_sdroid;NM26ABSDOI06002_.mp3
Those with legitimate business with the Sith should return when the repairs have been completed.;[];;[];[14441, 14444, 14445];man26_sdroid;NM26ABSDOI06008_.mp3
How can I get inside now?;[];;[14444];[14439];man26_sdroid;
The secondary external entrance is reserved for Sith personnel only and is not to be used by visitors.;[];;[14442];[14443];man26_sdroid;NM26ABSDOI06005_.mp3
I will be going.;[];;[14442];[14439];man26_sdroid;
Please, don't take me in for questioning... I don't know anything! I swear!;[];;[];[None];tar02_aptwnd;NM02AAMAN006000_.mp3

Greetings! Forgive me if this seems an odd question, off-worlder, but might you have any exotic species for sale? Nothing dangerous, mind you.;[];;[14456, 14458, 14465, 14512, 14514];[None];ebo46_nubassa;
Exotic species? What sorts of exotic species?;[];;[14457];[14455, 14517, 14515];ebo46_nubassa;
Anything non-sentient and non-carnivorous will do, though creatures that are easy to manage are preferred. Is that understandable?;[];;[14458, 14465, 14512, 14514];[14456];ebo46_nubassa;
Why would you want to buy animals?;[];;[14459];[14457, 14455, 14517, 14515];ebo46_nubassa;
Ah, good question. The Selkath have little exposure to life from other planets, you see, but our government hopes to change that.;[];;[14460];[14458];ebo46_nubassa;
We are setting up a zoological compound for visitation by the public, and are hoping to stock it with non-offensive foreign creatures of all types.;[];;[14461];[14459];ebo46_nubassa;
The only problem right now is actually procuring the exotic species we need. Selkath import restrictions are quite prohibitive, to say the least.;[];;[14462, 14465, 14512];[14460];ebo46_nubassa;
So you want to smuggle them in?;[];;[14463];[14461];ebo46_nubassa;
I would not use such a harsh word, off-worlder. Let us say that I am interested in engaging in private trade. That is allowed, according to our laws.;[];;[14464];[14462];ebo46_nubassa;
Finding off-worlders that deal in such trade is most difficult, however. I have become quite desperate. Might you have what I seek?;[];;[14465, 14512];[14463];ebo46_nubassa;
I have some gizka, if you're interested.;[];;[14466];[14464, 14461, 14457, 14455, 14517, 14515];ebo46_nubassa;
Gizka? You speak of the small, bipedal amphibians with the overly high reproductive rate, correct? Oh, no, I am afraid I cannot take those.;[];;[14467];[14465];ebo46_nubassa;
A compatriot of mine made the mistake of purchasing a pair of such creatures several months ago. Within weeks our storage facilities were nearly overrun.;[];;[14468];[14466];ebo46_nubassa;
If you are in possession of such creatures, I hope you keep them separated. If not, then you have my condolences.;[];;[14469, 14491, 14496, 14508, 14510];[14467];ebo46_nubassa;
[Persuade] Is there no way I can convince you to take them off my hands?;[];;[14470, 14490];[14468, 14492, 14507];ebo46_nubassa;
[Success] I... suppose having a few of the creatures would not be of harm. We do have experience handling them now, I suppose.;[];;[14471];[14469];ebo46_nubassa;
Since they are so difficult to maintain, however, I would ask that you provide 100 credits. Then I will take them off your hands.;[];;[14472, 14475, 14478, 14483, 14486];[14470, 14509];ebo46_nubassa;
Deal. I want those things off my ship as soon as possible.;[];;[14473];[14471];ebo46_nubassa;
Very well. It is a pleasure doing business with you... I will have my people show up to remove your gizka as soon as possible.;[];;[14474];[14472, 14482];ebo46_nubassa;
Thank you very much. For an off-worlder, interacting with you has been most pleasant.;[];;[];[14473];ebo46_nubassa;
But... I actually don't have 100 credits.;[];;[14476];[14471, 14481, 14485, 14489];ebo46_nubassa;
You do not even have 100 credits? Then you are in dire straits, indeed. You certainly do not need these pests on your vessel.;[];;[14477];[14475];ebo46_nubassa;
In the interest of maintaining peace, I shall remove them and use what I can. Thank you for your assistance, off-worlder... I hope your situation improves soon.;[];;[];[14476];ebo46_nubassa;
[Force Persuade] You don't need any credits to take them.;[{'Player': 'Persuade'}];;[14479, 14481];[14471, 14489];ebo46_nubassa;
[Success] What am I thinking? It is impertinent of me to ask you for credits when you are attempting to make a sale. My apologies.;[];;[14480];[14478];ebo46_nubassa;
I shall send some of my people by to remove the gizka on your vessel. Thank you for your co-operation.;[];;[];[14479, 14484];ebo46_nubassa;
[Failure] I... I do not... no, I am afraid that you are mistaken. I do require coin to compensate for my aid. These gizka are not easy to manage.;[];;[14475, 14482, 14483, 14486];[14478];ebo46_nubassa;
Fine. 100 credits it is.;[];;[14473];[14481, 14485, 14489];ebo46_nubassa;
[Persuade] I was hoping to sell them. How about we just call it even?;[];;[14484, 14485];[14481, 14489, 14471];ebo46_nubassa;
[Success] *sigh* I suppose it is better than nothing. We must have some creatures in our exhibit, after all.;[];;[14480];[14483];ebo46_nubassa;
[Failure] The cost of maintaining such creatures is very high. I would be removing pests for you at my own expense?;[];;[14475, 14482, 14486];[14483];ebo46_nubassa;
[Persuade] You want me to *pay* you? How about you give me 100 credits?;[];;[14487, 14489];[14485, 14481, 14471];ebo46_nubassa;
[Success] I... suppose it is natural for off-worlders to desire commerce, even when it is unfair. Very well, I shall do as you ask, in the interest of peace.;[];;[14488];[14486];ebo46_nubassa;
Here are your credits. I shall send someone by to remove the gizka from your vessel. Good day, off-worlder.;[];;[];[14487];ebo46_nubassa;
[Failure] That is unfair of you to ask, off-worlder. You are attempting to sell me something I have already stated I do not need.;[];;[14475, 14478, 14482, 14483];[14486];ebo46_nubassa;
[Failure] I do not think so, no. They have proven to be far too much trouble in the past.;[];;[14491, 14496, 14508, 14510];[14469];ebo46_nubassa;
Actually, I would *really* like to get rid of these creatures.;[];;[14492];[14490, 14507, 14468];ebo46_nubassa;
I am sure you would. They are practically a nuisance. I have no need of them, however, as I stated.;[];;[14469, 14493, 14496, 14508, 14510];[14491];ebo46_nubassa;
[Persuade] How about if I paid you 100 credits as well? Would that help?;[];;[14494];[14492, 14507];ebo46_nubassa;
[Success] *sigh* I suppose it would. I am not looking forward to the trouble this will cause, but if it will help you out... I will do what I can.;[];;[14495];[14493];ebo46_nubassa;
I shall send some people by your vessel shortly to remove the gizka. Good day to you, off-worlder.;[];;[];[14494];ebo46_nubassa;
[Persuade/Lie] But these are special gizka. They don't reproduce like the others do.;[];;[14497, 14507];[14492, 14490, 14468];ebo46_nubassa;
[Success] They do not? Well, that is marvelous news! We would have the benefit of obtaining the gizka without the inconvenience of their numbers!;[];;[14498];[14496];ebo46_nubassa;
If you wish, I will send some others over to your vessels right away to remove the gizka.;[];;[14499, 14506];[14497];ebo46_nubassa;
[Persuade] The gizka are for *sale*... they aren't free.;[];;[14500, 14502];[14498];ebo46_nubassa;
[Success] Ah. I hope 100 credits will be sufficient, then? I realize that such a rare strain of gizka might be worth more, but it is all I can afford.;[];;[14501];[14499];ebo46_nubassa;
Thank you for your assistance, off-worlder. Dealing with you has proven far more pleasureable than I anticipated.;[];;[];[14500, 14503, 14506];ebo46_nubassa;
[Failure] I am willing to take these gizka off your hands because of their unusual nature... I certainly will not purchase them!;[];;[14503, 14504];[14499];ebo46_nubassa;
Fine, take them, then.;[];;[14501];[14502];ebo46_nubassa;
Forget it. No deal.;[];;[14505];[14502];ebo46_nubassa;
As you wish. Our negotiation is hereby suspended.;[];;[];[14504];ebo46_nubassa;
Sounds good to me.;[];;[14501];[14498];ebo46_nubassa;
[Failure] I have never heard of such a creature. I suspect you are merely desperate to offload your difficult circumstance onto another. Shame on you, off-worlder!;[];;[14469, 14491, 14493, 14508, 14510];[14496];ebo46_nubassa;
[Force Persuade] But you want to take these gizka off my hands.;[{'Player': 'Persuade'}];;[14509];[14507, 14492, 14490, 14468];ebo46_nubassa;
[Success] Hmm. But maybe we could use these gizka, after all. It is better then having nothing at all to show, I suppose.;[];;[14471];[14508];ebo46_nubassa;

Let me ask you something first, though. I've been going through the battle aboard the Endar Spire over and over in my head since we crashed.;[];;[14611];[14609, 14663, 14665, 14671, 14702];k_hcar_dialog;NM33AACART04677_.mp3

Like you said when we first met: Bastila didn't have time to use her powers.;[];;[14613];[14611];k_hcar_dialog;
True. Bastila is as powerful as they say... she's the one who defeated Darth Revan, after all.;[];;[14614];[14612];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04048_.mp3
Hmm. I guess that no Jedi ability, no matter how powerful, makes up for being completely surprised and outmatched.;[];;[14615];[14613];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04049_.mp3
We didn't choose that battle, anyway. It got forced on us. Hell, I'm just surprised that any of us are alive to talk about it.;[];;[14616];[14614, 14659];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04050_.mp3
Come to think of it, it's more than a little surprising that you happen to be here, isn't it? Just what is your position with the Republic fleet, anyway?;[];;[14617, 14651, 14653, 14655];[14615];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04051_.mp3
Why? Are you accusing me of something?;[];;[14618];[14616];k_hcar_dialog;
Not at all. I just think it's a bit odd that someone who got added to the crew roster at the last minute just happens to be one of the survivors.;[];;[14619, 14621, 14649];[14617];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04053_.mp3
You'd rather I wasn't?;[];;[14620];[14618, 14652, 14654, 14656];k_hcar_dialog;

No. Well... maybe. Don't get me wrong, it just seems odd that someone Bastila's party specifically requested to transfer aboard happened to survive.;[];;[14623, 14646, 14647];[14621];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04059_.mp3
I have no idea what you're talking about!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[14624];[14622, 14650];k_hcar_dialog;
The Jedi requested numerous things when they came on board... hell, they practically took over the ship, as far as I could tell.;[];;[14625];[14623, 14646, 14648];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04062_.mp3
Considering your connection to Bastila and the Jedi... whether you know it or not... your presence here seems a little convenient.;[];;[14626];[14624];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04063_.mp3
I'm probably wrong and this is probably nothing, I know. I learned a long time ago not to take things at face value, however. And I *hate* surprises.;[];;[14627, 14642, 14644];[14625];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04064_.mp3
What do you mean by surprises?;[];;[14628];[14626];k_hcar_dialog;

Are you always this suspicious?;[];;[14630];[14628, 14643, 14645];k_hcar_dialog;

I consider this important.;[];;[14633, 14635];[14631];k_hcar_dialog;
Alright, alright. You must be the most damned persistent woman I've ever met.;[];;[14634];[14632, 14636];k_hcar_dialog;NM33AACART04684_.mp3

Good. Like I said before, I prefer action to talk, anyway.;[];;[];[14637];k_hcar_dialog;NM33AACART04688_.mp3
Fine. Let's just get back to something important, then.;[];;[14630];[14628, 14643, 14645];k_hcar_dialog;
You do know we're on the same side, right?;[];;[14630];[14628, 14643, 14645];k_hcar_dialog;
Try something and it'll be the last mistake you make.;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[14630];[14628, 14643, 14645];k_hcar_dialog;
I'm telling you, Carth, I had nothing to do with the crash.;[{'Player': 'Talk_Pleading'}];;[14643];[14626];k_hcar_dialog;
I expect you're right. I've got no real reason to suspect you of anything. Still... it's better to be safe than sorry, right?;[];;[14629, 14639, 14640, 14641];[14642];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04068_.mp3
Shouldn't we be trying to work together?;[];;[14645];[14626];k_hcar_dialog;
I am working with you. I'd be a fool not to. I'd also be a fool not to expect the unexpected.;[];;[14629, 14639, 14640, 14641];[14644];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04070_.mp3
Why would Bastila request my transfer?;[];;[14624];[14622, 14650];k_hcar_dialog;
It doesn't make any difference. Go ahead and be paranoid.;[];;[14648];[14622, 14650];k_hcar_dialog;
I'm not trying to be paranoid. It's just that I learned a long time ago that something which looks like a coincidence probably isn't. Especially when the Jedi are involved.;[];;[14624];[14647];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04079_.mp3
What's so odd about me being added to the crew at the last minute?;[];;[14650];[14618, 14652, 14654, 14656];k_hcar_dialog;
You were the only one. Not to mention that Bastila's party was the one who requested your transfer.;[];;[14623, 14646, 14647];[14649];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04057_.mp3
I used to be a smuggler, if you must know. I was recruited into the fleet for my knowledge.;[];;[14652];[14616];k_hcar_dialog;
A smuggler? I should have guessed. Isn't it odd, however, that a smuggler who was added to the crew at the last minute just happens to be alive?;[];;[14619, 14621, 14649];[14651];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04081_.mp3
I'm a scout. I was recruited into the fleet for my skills, if you must know.;[];;[14654];[14616];k_hcar_dialog;
Well, that makes sense. Still... it seems a bit strange that someone who was a last-minute addition to the crew roster is one of the survivors.;[];;[14619, 14621, 14649];[14653];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04083_.mp3
I'm just a soldier. I'm sure there isn't anything unusual about that, is there?;[];;[14656];[14616];k_hcar_dialog;
Hell no... unless you consider that you were a last-minute addition to the crew roster and you just happen to be one of the survivors.;[];;[14619, 14621, 14649];[14655];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04085_.mp3
Why ask me? I don't see the point.;[];;[14658];[14611];k_hcar_dialog;
I'm just trying to figure it out. I saw enough men lose their lives needlessly during the Mandalorian Wars. It's... difficult to see that happening all over again.;[];;[14659];[14657];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04087_.mp3
We lost the ship and a lot of good people... and for what? On the hope that Jedi powers would save us, somehow. Not that Bastila had much of an opportunity to act.;[];;[14615];[14658, 14661];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04088_.mp3
I wasn't in a position to know what was going on, really.;[];;[14661];[14611];k_hcar_dialog;
Neither was I, to tell the truth. I was onboard as an advisor for the most part. The battle began so fast, it's anyone's guess as to what actually happened.;[];;[14659];[14660];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04090_.mp3
Are you getting testy again?;[];;[14663];[14607, 14667, 14669];k_hcar_dialog;
I don't get testy. I get angry. And if I was angry, you wouldn't have to ask me if I was, let me assure you.;[];;[14610];[14662];k_hcar_dialog;NM33AACART04674_.mp3
Excellent. Soon all your secrets will be mine!;[{'Player': 'Taunt'}];;[14665];[14607, 14667, 14669];k_hcar_dialog;
All my secrets are purely of the mundane variety, unfortunately. Nothing worth extracting, though you're welcome to try.;[{'Carth': 'Persuade'}];;[14610];[14664];k_hcar_dialog;NM33AACART04676_.mp3
I just would like to know you better.;[];;[14667];[14605, 14673, 14678, 14686, 14699, 14700];k_hcar_dialog;
Oh. Well, if it's an interrogation you wanted, why didn't you say so?;[];;[14608, 14662, 14664];[14666];k_hcar_dialog;NM33AACART04668_.mp3
Don't be such a child. It's just a few questions.;[];;[14669];[14605, 14673, 14678, 14686, 14699, 14700];k_hcar_dialog;
Oh no, how can I resist a challenge to my manly pride, huh? Ha ha! Fine, you've made your point. Interrogate at will.;[{'Carth': 'Talk_Laughing'}];;[14608, 14662, 14664, 14670];[14668];k_hcar_dialog;NM33AACART04670_.mp3
Are you getting angry again?;[];;[14671];[14669];k_hcar_dialog;
If I was, you wouldn't have to ask. So don't worry about it.;[];;[14610];[14670];k_hcar_dialog;NM33ABCART04811_.mp3
Ha ha! You are such a pain, you know that?;[{'Player': 'Talk_Laughing'}];;[14673];[14603];k_hcar_dialog;
Guilty as charged. I'll bet you still have those questions in mind, though. Are they really necessary?;[];;[14606, 14666, 14668];[14672];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04763_.mp3
Brainless, lice-ridden bantha!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[14603];[14601];k_hcar_dialog;
Sexless marsh-toad!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[14603];[14601];k_hcar_dialog;
"How about ""pushy thug""?";[];;[14601];[14599, 14597];k_hcar_dialog;
Forget it. Let's get back to my questions.;[];;[14678];[14599, 14595, 14593, 14692, 14696, 14694];k_hcar_dialog;
All business today, eh? Are these questions really necessary?;[];;[14606, 14666, 14668];[14677];k_hcar_dialog;NM33ABCART04814_.mp3
That's no good, either.;[];;[14597];[14595];k_hcar_dialog;
Now that one I like. Call me that from now on.;[];;[14681];[14595];k_hcar_dialog;
I might consider it. What are you going to call me, in exchange?;[{'Carth': 'Talk_Laughing'}];;[14600, 14682];[14680, 14690, 14697];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04770_.mp3
"How about ""handsome thug""?";[];;[14683];[14681];k_hcar_dialog;
"I like the first part of that. I'm a bit more partial to ""the most handsome pilot in the galaxy"". What do you think?";[{'Carth': 'Persuade'}];;[14684, 14687, 14688];[14682];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04772_.mp3
Don't hold your breath.;[];;[14685];[14683];k_hcar_dialog;
"Well, then, I guess ""gorgeous"" will have to do until then, won't it?";[{'Carth': 'Talk_Laughing'}];;[14686];[14684, 14687, 14688];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04774_.mp3
Kidding aside, I bet you're not about to give up on those questions of yours. Are they really necessary?;[];;[14606, 14666, 14668];[14685];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04775_.mp3
I think I'm going to be ill.;[{'Player': 'Taunt'}];;[14685];[14683];k_hcar_dialog;
I'll think about it.;[];;[14685];[14683];k_hcar_dialog;
I'd prefer you didn't call me anything. It's demeaning.;[];;[14595];[14593, 14692, 14696];k_hcar_dialog;
How about 'gorgeous'? I like that better.;[];;[14681];[14593, 14692, 14696];k_hcar_dialog;
Keep addressing me like that and you might lose an ear or two.;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[14692];[14591];k_hcar_dialog;
Heh heh. A little bit touchy, are we? Is there something else you'd prefer I called you?;[];;[14594, 14677, 14689, 14690];[14691];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04749_.mp3
I like the sound of that.;[];;[14694];[14591];k_hcar_dialog;
Which? The fact that I'm all ears or the beautiful part?;[];;[14677, 14695, 14697];[14693];k_hcar_dialog;NM33ABCART04817_.mp3
Carth, are you flirting with me?;[];;[14696];[14694];k_hcar_dialog;
Not really. Just a habit. You have something you'd rather I call you by?;[];;[14594, 14677, 14689, 14690];[14695];k_hcar_dialog;NM33ABCART04819_.mp3
The beautiful part. Keep calling me that.;[];;[14681];[14694];k_hcar_dialog;
Why do I get the impression that you're not serious?;[];;[14699];[14591];k_hcar_dialog;
Maybe I'm just avoiding your questions. Is this really necessary?;[];;[14606, 14666, 14668];[14698];k_hcar_dialog;NM33ABCART04822_.mp3
I guess I did say you could ask me questions later, didn't I? Is this really necessary?;[];;[14606, 14666, 14668, 14701];[14590];k_hcar_dialog;NM33AACART04664_.mp3
Answer the damn questions, already.;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[14702];[14700];k_hcar_dialog;
Pretty snappy with the orders, are we? Okay, you got it... sir.;[{'Carth': 'Salute'}];;[14610];[14701];k_hcar_dialog;NM33ABCART04824_.mp3
I want to discuss something with you.;[];available immediately K_SWG_CARTH = 1;[14704];[14537, 15228, 15236];k_hcar_dialog;
You do? Fair enough. What do you want to discuss?;[];;[14705, 14764, 14765];[14703];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04778_.mp3
I want to talk about these issues you seem to have with me.;[];;[14706];[14704];k_hcar_dialog;
*Sigh* I knew you wouldn't understand where I was coming from. Let me try to explain.;[{'Carth': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[14707, 14763];[14705, 14764, 14765];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04092_.mp3
You're probably one of the most skilled women I've ever met. You've saved my butt more than once and I'm lucky you're here to help me, no question.;[];;[14708];[14706];k_hcar_dialog;NM33AACART04690_.mp3
But that doesn't mean I'm going to stop watching you or being wary. I'm just not built that way. Period.;[{'Carth': 'Persuade'}];;[14709, 14759, 14761];[14707, 14763];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04094_.mp3
Not built that way? That sounds like an excuse.;[];;[14710];[14708];k_hcar_dialog;
Maybe so. But I've been betrayed before by people I... well, it won't happen again, that's all.;[];;[14711, 14755, 14757];[14709];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04096_.mp3
So you want some guarantee that I won't betray you?!;[];;[14712];[14710, 14760, 14762];k_hcar_dialog;
I don't know that you'll betray me. But there are no guarantees... not for you, not for me. You don't have to take it personally.;[];;[14713, 14744, 14746, 14753];[14711];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04098_.mp3

Hairless Wookiee? Alright, sister, just... just... just calm down before your head explodes.;[{'Carth': 'Taunt'}];;[14715, 14743];[14713];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04106_.mp3
We'll just see whose head explodes, you ungrateful monkey-lizard!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[14716];[14714];k_hcar_dialog;
Is that your idea of an insult? Come on, sister, take your best shot.;[{'Carth': 'Taunt'}];;[14717, 14742];[14715, 14743];k_hcar_dialog;NM33AACART04692_.mp3

Well, you had it coming.;[];;[14720];[14718];k_hcar_dialog;
I guess I did. Feel better now?;[];;[14721, 14738];[14719];k_hcar_dialog;NM33AACART04696_.mp3
Maybe a little.;[];;[14722];[14720, 14741];k_hcar_dialog;
Good. Then maybe we can talk reasonably about this.;[];;[14723];[14721];k_hcar_dialog;NM33AACART04698_.mp3
All I've been trying to say is that this isn't personal. If you were smart, you wouldn't trust anyone, either... not me, not Bastila and especially not yourself.;[];;[14724, 14735, 14736];[14722];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04729_.mp3
Ahhh... so you don't trust yourself, is that it?;[];;[14725];[14723, 14739, 14749, 14751];k_hcar_dialog;
I don't need to be analyzed, thanks. Can we just get back to business?;[];;[14726, 14730, 14732, 14734];[14724, 14735];k_hcar_dialog;NM33AACART04720_.mp3
I don't need someone around who doesn't trust me.;[];;[14727];[14725, 14737, 14745, 14754];k_hcar_dialog;
And I don't need all these questions. What I do need is to try and save the galaxy, if that's even possible.;[];;[14728];[14726, 14752];k_hcar_dialog;NM33AACART04711_.mp3
Why is whether or not I trust you or anyone so damned important to you? Why... why do you even care?;[{'Carth': 'Talk_Pleading'}];;[14729];[14727, 14731, 14733, 14734];k_hcar_dialog;NM33AACART04712_.mp3
We don't have time for this, so can we please just... drop it. For now? Can we pick it up later if you really must, I... want to get underway.;[{'Carth': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[];[14728];k_hcar_dialog;NM33AACART04713_.mp3
So leave. Be on your own, it's obviously what you want.;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[14731];[14725, 14737, 14745, 14754];k_hcar_dialog;
It's not what I want. I have a duty and I intend to see it through. The galaxy's in danger and I want to save it... that's what I want!;[];;[14728];[14730];k_hcar_dialog;NM33AACART04715_.mp3
You sure you don't want to talk about it?;[];;[14733];[14725, 14737, 14745, 14754];k_hcar_dialog;
No, I don't want to talk about it. What I want is to save the galaxy... if that's even possible.;[];;[14728];[14732];k_hcar_dialog;NM33AACART04717_.mp3
That settles that, I guess.;[];;[14728];[14725, 14737, 14745, 14754];k_hcar_dialog;
Pretty pithy advice, I see.;[];;[14725];[14723, 14739, 14749, 14751];k_hcar_dialog;
I wouldn't want to live like that.;[];;[14737];[14723, 14739, 14749, 14751];k_hcar_dialog;
Not all of us have the luxury of a choice. I'm conditioned this way, sorry.;[];;[14726, 14730, 14732, 14734];[14736];k_hcar_dialog;NM33AACART04722_.mp3
Not really. This is still serious.;[];;[14739];[14720, 14741];k_hcar_dialog;
*Sigh* Look... all I mean is that if you're smart, you won't trust anyone... not me, not Bastila and especially not yourself.;[];;[14724, 14735, 14736];[14738];k_hcar_dialog;NM33AACART04700_.mp3
Don't patronize me.;[];;[14741];[14718];k_hcar_dialog;

Well, you can stop wondering. I'm not.;[];;[14726, 14730, 14732, 14734];[14744];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04112_.mp3
Right. And how am I supposed to know that *you* won't betray us?;[];;[14747];[14712, 14756, 14758];k_hcar_dialog;
Me?;[];;[14748, 14750];[14746];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04114_.mp3
Yes, you! Why should I trust you, after all?;[];;[14749];[14747];k_hcar_dialog;
You shouldn't. If you're smart, you won't trust anyone... not me, not Bastila, and especially not yourself.;[];;[14724, 14735, 14736];[14748];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04121_.mp3
Why not you? Accusing other people is a good cover for a traitor.;[];;[14751];[14747];k_hcar_dialog;

I'm starting to get pretty tired of this attitude of yours.;[];;[14756];[14710, 14760, 14762];k_hcar_dialog;
Yeah, well, you wouldn't be the first. Look... I don't expect you to be my friend. This is just the way I am, no need to take it personally.;[];;[14713, 14744, 14746];[14755];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04127_.mp3
Of course it won't happen again if you never trust anyone!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[14758];[14710, 14760, 14762];k_hcar_dialog;

Why are you so hostile? What did I do to deserve this?;[];;[14760];[14708];k_hcar_dialog;
You, uh... haven't done anything *yet*. But there's no guarantee that you won't do anything in the future. I've been betrayed before by people and I... well, it won't happen again.;[];;[14711, 14755, 14757];[14759];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04131_.mp3
And what, exactly, are you watching me for?;[];;[14762];[14708];k_hcar_dialog;
I don't know that, yet. Like I said before, it's probably nothing. But I've been betrayed before by people and I... well, it won't happen again, that's all.;[];;[14711, 14755, 14757];[14761];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04133_.mp3
You've got the skills of an elite commando, and you've saved my butt more than once. Between that and your facility with languages, I'm lucky you're here.;[];;[14708];[14706];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04093_.mp3

I just don't trust easily, and for good reasons... which are my own.;[{'Carth': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[14771, 14788, 14789, 14790];[14769, 14792, 14794, 14796];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04143_.mp3
But we have to work together, Carth, so it has plenty to do with me.;[];;[14772];[14770];k_hcar_dialog;
Ahhh, damn it. I suppose I won't get any rest until I talk, will I? You want to know why I don't trust anyone? Fine, here goes.;[];;[14773];[14771, 14788, 14789];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04147_.mp3
Five years ago the Jedi had just finished the war with the Mandalorians. Revan and Malak were heroes. I was damn proud to have served in their fleet.;[];;[14774];[14772, 14791];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04148_.mp3
It was completely unexpected when they turned on us, invading the Republic while we were still weak. Nobody knew what to think, least of all me.;[];;[14775];[14773];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04149_.mp3
Our heroes had become brutal, conquering Sith... and we were all but helpless before them. Think about it... if you can't even trust the best of the Jedi, who can you trust?;[];;[14776, 14784, 14786];[14774];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04150_.mp3
What do I have to do with Malak and Revan?;[];;[14777];[14775];k_hcar_dialog;
It... it's not that. It's... That's not what I mean. There were... there were others. Good, solid, trusted men who joined them.;[];;[14778];[14776];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04152_.mp3
Malak and Revan and the Sith deserve to die for what they've done... but the ones who fled the Republic and joined them are even worse.;[];;[14779];[14777, 14785, 14787];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04157_.mp3
The dark side has nothing to do with why they joined with the Sith. They deserve no mercy!;[{'Carth': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[14780, 14783];[14778];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04158_.mp3
You say that with such... hatred.;[];;[14781];[14779];k_hcar_dialog;
I know. I... should apologize to you. I've become so accustomed to expecting the worst in others, and you've done nothing to deserve that.;[{'Carth': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[14782];[14780, 14783];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04161_.mp3
It's just... never mind. Let's just continue with what we were doing. I'd rather not talk about it.;[];;[];[14781];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04162_.mp3
I haven't joined the Sith, Carth.;[];;[14781];[14779];k_hcar_dialog;
They turned to the dark side, obviously. Why is it so personal?;[];;[14785];[14775];k_hcar_dialog;
I... of course the Jedi turned to the dark side. There were others, however, who weren't Jedi. Good men... trusted men who joined them.;[];;[14778];[14784];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04154_.mp3
I suppose you can't. That must have been hard to take.;[];;[14787];[14775];k_hcar_dialog;
I... it wasn't even that. There were others: good, solid men. Trusted men who turned on us, as well, and joined their cause.;[];;[14778];[14786];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04156_.mp3
What reasons? I want to know.;[];;[14772];[14770];k_hcar_dialog;
Fine. You can stuff your reasons, then.;[];;[14772];[14770];k_hcar_dialog;
I can make you talk, Carth. Trust me.;[{'Player': 'Taunt'}];;[14791];[14770];k_hcar_dialog;
Heh heh. Well I might be willing to take you up on that challenge. But uh, you're just not going to let up, are you? Fine... you want to know why I don't trust anyone? Here goes.;[];;[14773];[14790];k_hcar_dialog;NM33ABCART04828_.mp3
So I've seen. If I were Malak I'd be a bit nervous to have you on my tail.;[];;[14770];[14768];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04138_.mp3
I just want to know why you distrust me so much.;[];;[14794];[14767];k_hcar_dialog;
What does it matter that much? Why can't you just leave it be?;[];;[14770];[14793];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04140_.mp3
No, I don't want to argue with you.;[];;[14796];[14767];k_hcar_dialog;
And I don't really want to argue with you, either. You seem... sincere enough, I guess.;[];;[14770];[14795];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04142_.mp3
I want to continue our discussion from before.;[];available immediately K_SWG_CARTH = 3;[14798];[14537, 15228, 15236];k_hcar_dialog;
I thought I said I didn't want to talk about it anymore.;[];;[14799, 14849, 14851];[14797];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04164_.mp3
Don't you think you'd feel better if you discussed it?;[];;[14800, 14848];[14798];k_hcar_dialog;
Listen, sister... just because we're working together does not mean you get to badger me with constant questions!;[{'Carth': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[14801, 14845, 14846];[14799, 14849, 14851];k_hcar_dialog;NM33ABCART04829_.mp3
Do we have another problem, now?;[];;[14802];[14800];k_hcar_dialog;
Blast it if you aren't the most frustrating woman to talk to! Isn't there someone else you can harass for a little while?;[];;[14803, 14839, 14844];[14801, 14845];k_hcar_dialog;NM33ABCART04831_.mp3
*I'm* frustrating? Look who's talking!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[14804];[14802];k_hcar_dialog;
What? Me? What did I do?;[{'Carth': 'Talk_Pleading'}];;[14805, 14836, 14837];[14803, 14842];k_hcar_dialog;NM33ABCART04833_.mp3
Oh, that's rich. Where have you been?;[];;[14806];[14804];k_hcar_dialog;
I... *sigh* Okay, I give up. You win.;[];;[14807];[14805, 14836, 14841];k_hcar_dialog;NM33ABCART04840_.mp3
Look, I suppose I... could use someone to talk to. I'm just not used to it. And I don't know why you're so interested. But here goes.;[];;[14808];[14806, 14838];k_hcar_dialog;NM33ABCART04845_.mp3
When I think of all the men who have betrayed us, the one that stands out above them all is the one I respected the most. Saul.;[];;[14809, 14834];[14807, 14847, 14848, 14850];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04171_.mp3
You say that name like I should know it.;[];;[14810];[14808];k_hcar_dialog;
You don't? I thought everyone did. Admiral Saul Karath is the commander of the entire Sith fleet. He's half the reason Malak has done so well in the war.;[];;[14811];[14809];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04173_.mp3
Saul was my commanding officer back when the Mandalorian Wars first began. He taught me everything about being a soldier... and I looked up to him.;[];;[14812];[14810, 14835];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04174_.mp3
Saul approached me before he left. He talked to me about how the Republic was on the losing side... and about how I should start thinking of my survival.;[];;[14813];[14811];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04175_.mp3
I know now that he was trying to recruit me into the Sith, but I couldn't have conceived of it back then. I argued with him and he got angry and he left. I never saw him again.;[];;[14814, 14832];[14812];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04176_.mp3
You didn't think he would betray the Republic?;[];;[14815];[14813];k_hcar_dialog;
Saul was my mentor... he led us to so many victories against the Mandalorians, even when things looked to be at their worst.;[];;[14816];[14814, 14833];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04178_.mp3
I just... I couldn't conceive of it. He... he couldn't be serious. I was wrong, of course... he not only left us for the Sith, he... he gave them the codes to bypass our scanners.;[];;[14817];[14815];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04179_.mp3
I remember waking up as the first of the Sith bombers snuck past our defenses and began destroying half of our docked ships. I knew right away what had happened.;[];;[14818];[14816];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04180_.mp3
I... could have stopped him. I could have stopped it all.;[{'Carth': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[14819, 14828, 14830];[14817];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04181_.mp3
So you blame yourself for trusting your friend?;[];;[14820];[14818];k_hcar_dialog;
I blame Saul, not myself. I was... I was stupid and I ignored the danger. He nearly destroyed us all.;[];;[14821];[14819];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04183_.mp3
I've fought Saul for years, now, and if I ever catch up to him... he will regret what he's done. He will regret it.;[];;[14822, 14825, 14827];[14820, 14829, 14831];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04188_.mp3
So that's all of it, then?;[];;[14823];[14821];k_hcar_dialog;
No. No, it's not.;[{'Carth': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[14824];[14822];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04190_.mp3
But I don't want to talk about it right now. Let's go.;[];;[];[14823, 14826];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04191_.mp3
That's terrible. I feel awful for you.;[];;[14826];[14821];k_hcar_dialog;
Well... there's more to the story, I guess.;[{'Carth': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[14824];[14825, 14827];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04734_.mp3
I'd do the same thing in your shoes.;[];;[14826];[14821];k_hcar_dialog;
Do you really believe that?;[];;[14829];[14818];k_hcar_dialog;
I don't know. Maybe. He might have killed me if I'd tried, or I might have killed him. I was stupid, however, and I let him go.;[];;[14821];[14828];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04185_.mp3
And that's why you feel so sorry for yourself?;[];;[14831];[14818];k_hcar_dialog;
Don't even start with that! I don't feel sorry for myself. I feel angry... at Saul and all those others. It's all I can think about sometimes!;[];;[14821];[14830];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04187_.mp3
How could you have not seen through that?;[];;[14833];[14813];k_hcar_dialog;
I didn't want to, maybe. Are you so sure you would have?;[];;[14815];[14832];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04737_.mp3
That name sounds familiar.;[];;[14835];[14808];k_hcar_dialog;
With good reason. Admiral Saul Karath is the commander of the entire Sith fleet. He's half the reason Malak has done so well in the war.;[];;[14811];[14834];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04739_.mp3
You don't know? Typical male.;[];;[14806];[14804];k_hcar_dialog;
Never mind. I'll leave you alone, since I'm so frustrating.;[];;[14838];[14804];k_hcar_dialog;
Wait... *sigh* I didn't mean it that way. Don't go, damn it.;[];;[14807];[14837, 14843, 14844];k_hcar_dialog;NM33ABCART04844_.mp3
What exactly is it about me that frustrates you?;[];;[14840];[14802];k_hcar_dialog;
Oh no, I'm not falling for that one. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.;[];;[14841, 14842, 14843];[14839];k_hcar_dialog;NM33ABCART04838_.mp3
Really? It's hard to tell.;[];;[14806];[14840];k_hcar_dialog;
And you say I'm frustrating to deal with.;[];;[14804];[14840];k_hcar_dialog;
Alright, then, I'll leave you alone if that's what you want.;[];;[14838];[14840];k_hcar_dialog;
Well, I wouldn't want you to feel harassed. Have it your way.;[];;[14838];[14802];k_hcar_dialog;
You're damn right it does.;[];;[14802];[14800];k_hcar_dialog;
I'm not going to repeat myself, Carth, You owe me.;[];;[14847];[14800];k_hcar_dialog;
I... suppose you're right. Fine, then. But I don't know why you're so interested, but here it goes.;[];;[14808];[14846, 14851];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04170_.mp3
Not particularly. I... guess it wouldn't hurt, exactly, either, though I don't know why you're so interested.;[];;[14808];[14799];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04166_.mp3
Yes, but I'm bored, so spit it out.;[];;[14800, 14850];[14798];k_hcar_dialog;
Cute. Nice to know that you're so full of concern. *Sigh* Well, I guess it wouldn't hurt, though I don't know why you're so interested.;[];;[14808];[14849];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04168_.mp3
I think you owe me an explanation, Carth.;[];;[14800, 14847];[14798];k_hcar_dialog;

Have I been quiet? I suppose I have. I guess I just don't like being left out of the loop.;[];;[14854, 14897, 14899, 14901];[14852];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04193_.mp3

The things you say!;[{'Player': 'Flirt'}];;[14857];[14855];k_hcar_dialog;
Look, I'm serious. No one seems to want to tell me anything, and it's starting to irritate me.;[];;[14858];[14856, 14896, 14907];k_hcar_dialog;NM33ABCART04852_.mp3
For one thing, I want to know what the Jedi Council said to you. They pulled you in there and refused to tell me a thing about it.;[];;[14859, 14893];[14857, 14898, 14900, 14904, 14906, 14908];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04196_.mp3
*That* is none of your concern, Carth, and you would do well to leave the matter be.;[];;[14860];[14858];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04197_.mp3
I respect you, Bastila, but you've been as close-mouthed as the rest of the Council. If you won't talk to me, then maybe somebody else will.;[{'Carth': 'Persuade'}];;[14861, 14885, 14887];[14859];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04198_.mp3
Why should anything the Jedi do seem strange to you?;[];;[14862];[14860, 14895, 14893];k_hcar_dialog;
I may not know much about the Jedi, but I do know they aren't famous for taking on old Padawans and sending them on dangerous assignments.;[];;[14863, 14883, 14885, 14887];[14861];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04201_.mp3
They said there's a bond between Bastila and myself.;[];;[14864];[14862, 14886, 14888];k_hcar_dialog;
"A bond? What kind of bond? You mean to say that they told you you were ""tied"" to Bastila in some way? Heh. I have trouble believing that.";[];;[14865, 14882];[14863];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04203_.mp3
I've been watching you... you can be cruel and impulsive. A Jedi without self-control or training, and yet the Council sends you on your way? Why?;[];;[14866];[14864, 14884, 14890, 14892];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04218_.mp3

Nothing. Not yet. You just better hope I don't get a reason to.;[];;[14872];[14874];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04210_.mp3

Bastila and I have a bond. We have to do this together. That's all I'm going to say.;[];;[14881];[14866];k_hcar_dialog;

You're a neophyte Padawan who's been saddled with the responsibility of tracking down these Star Maps. Why? That's not normal!;[];;[14866];[14864, 14884, 14890, 14892];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04204_.mp3
I've done pretty well so far.;[];;[14884];[14862, 14886, 14888];k_hcar_dialog;
That's completely beside the point. The Jedi encouraged you to stay with us, and I don't believe the reasons they gave.;[];;[14865, 14882];[14883];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04220_.mp3
They thought it was more important that I help find the Star Maps than stay.;[];;[14886];[14862, 14860, 14895, 14893];k_hcar_dialog;
And why is that? You were a great help on Taris, but why would they keep you with us? Don't they... don't they have to train you?;[];;[14863, 14883, 14887];[14885];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04228_.mp3
It's none of your business, frankly.;[];;[14888];[14886, 14862, 14860, 14895, 14893];k_hcar_dialog;

Are we? Why, then, does it seem like the Jedi know everything and leave the rest of us out in the cold?;[];;[14865, 14882];[14889];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04224_.mp3
Get ahold of yourself. I'm sick of your paranoia.;[];;[14892];[14888];k_hcar_dialog;

In the fleet, we didn't see much of the Jedi. I only met Malak once, but I was impressed by him. I guess that just shows how much the dark side can change someone.;[];;[14994, 14996, 15000];[14992];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04293_.mp3
Do you know why they turned to the dark side?;[];;[14995];[14993, 14999, 14990];k_hcar_dialog;
Nobody does. When they left after the Mandalorian wars ended, they were Jedi. When they returned... they were something else.;[];;[14991, 14996, 15000];[14994];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04316_.mp3
How did they get away with all this?;[];;[14997];[14995, 14993, 14990];k_hcar_dialog;

Did they really get away with it, though? Revan was betrayed by Malak... and Malak hasn't won. In the end, the dark side won't help him.;[];;[14991, 14994, 15000];[14998];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04320_.mp3

You think Bastila and I are evil?;[];;[15006];[15004];k_hcar_dialog;
No, of course not. All I'm saying is that when you have so much power, the stakes are higher. I can only imagine the kind of conflict that goes on inside you.;[];;[15007];[15005];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04300_.mp3
Neither you nor Bastila are fully trained on how to handle your power. I'm just concerned at what might come.;[];;[15008, 15011, 15013];[15006, 15016, 15019];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04301_.mp3

The only thing that's kept me going since she died has been the need to find Saul and kill him. It's better to think about that than... anything else.;[];;[15033];[15031, 15041];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04334_.mp3
If I can do that, then maybe I can let her go. Let it all go.;[];;[15034];[15032];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04335_.mp3
If we encounter Saul... if we ever have the chance, promise me that I will be the one to kill him. I have to settle this... I need to.;[{'Carth': 'Talk_Pleading'}];;[15035, 15037, 15039];[15033];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04336_.mp3
Things may not work out that way. I can't promise that.;[];;[15036];[15034];k_hcar_dialog;
Whether it does or not, that's the way it has to be. I... guess there's no need to discuss it until then.;[];;[];[15035, 15039];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04341_.mp3
If we get the opportunity... then I promise.;[];;[15038];[15034];k_hcar_dialog;
Thank you. I... guess there's really nothing else to say.;[];;[];[15037];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04339_.mp3
That's not going to help anything, Carth.;[];;[15036];[15034];k_hcar_dialog;
What I think shouldn't matter, Carth.;[];;[15041];[15029];k_hcar_dialog;
Maybe. It can't be worse than what I tell myself, sometimes.;[];;[15032];[15040];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04343_.mp3
Not only that, you're a fool. You're wasting your time on useless ghosts.;[{'Player': 'Taunt'}];;[15043];[15029];k_hcar_dialog;
She isn't a ghost to me. I still remember holding her as she died... and I doubt I'll forget until I've paid Saul back in kind.;[{'Carth': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[15044];[15042];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04345_.mp3
That's all I have left: finding Saul and killing the scum. Don't worry... I won't waste any more time until then.;[];;[];[15043];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04346_.mp3
No, it's not strange, Carth. You remember the important things.;[];;[15046];[15026];k_hcar_dialog;
But I *should* be able to remember her face. It's frustrating! I... feel like I'm losing her.;[{'Carth': 'Talk_Pleading'}];;[15029];[15045];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04330_.mp3
Will you get over her, already? It's been four years!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[15048];[15026];k_hcar_dialog;
That's a damned mean thing to say. I wasn't ready for her to go, I can't accept it. Alright?;[];;[15029];[15047];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04348_.mp3
Out with it, Carth. I won't have you moping.;[];;[15050];[15022];k_hcar_dialog;
Moping? I'm not moping! I... okay, fine, maybe I'm moping a little, but you're very pushy, you know that?;[{'Carth': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[15024];[15049];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04350_.mp3
So tell me... what happens if you ever get your revenge on Saul?;[];available after the third starmap uncovered K_SWG_CARTH = 9;[15052];[14537, 15228, 15236];k_hcar_dialog;
You mean if I kill him?;[];;[15053];[15051];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04352_.mp3
Yes. What happens afterwards?;[];;[15054];[15052];k_hcar_dialog;
I... never thought about it. I suppose I always assumed that I would be dead once Saul was.;[];;[15055, 15073];[15053];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04354_.mp3
Why? What kind of risks do you plan on taking?;[];;[15056];[15054];k_hcar_dialog;
Understand that whenever I envisioned taking on Saul in the past, it was always as the captain of my own ship... or alone. In those cases I would risk everything.;[];;[15057];[15055];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04356_.mp3
I'm not in the same situation, now. I wouldn't risk hurting you... or the others.;[{'Carth': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[15058, 15072];[15056, 15074];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04357_.mp3
How do I know that's the truth?;[];;[15059];[15057];k_hcar_dialog;
You don't think I would throw away everything we're doing here, do you?;[];;[15060, 15070];[15058, 15072];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04359_.mp3
I don't know. What wouldn't you stop at to kill Saul?;[];;[15061];[15059];k_hcar_dialog;
I would like to think that I wouldn't put you in danger. That I wouldn't forget that there's more behind Saul that needs to be stopped.;[];;[15062];[15060];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04361_.mp3
If I saw Saul, however... if I had the chance... I don't know what I would do. I really don't. I mean his death has been my entire focus for so long.;[];;[15063, 15066, 15068];[15061, 15071];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04362_.mp3
Well, you'll have to find something else to focus on.;[];;[15064];[15062];k_hcar_dialog;
Well, that's easier said than done, but I know you mean well. I promise you I'll see this through. No matter what.;[];;[15065];[15063];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04364_.mp3
As for what comes afterward... well, let's wait until I know that I'm around to see it.;[];;[];[15064, 15067, 15069];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04365_.mp3
I need your help, Carth. There's more than Saul to fight.;[];;[15067];[15062];k_hcar_dialog;
I know. I'll... see this through. I promise you that. No matter what.;[];;[15065];[15066];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04367_.mp3
Then I can't rely on you. You shouldn't have come.;[];;[15069];[15062];k_hcar_dialog;
But, uh... maybe it's best I did. I have to see this through... and I will, to the end. I promise you that. No matter what.;[];;[15065];[15068];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04369_.mp3
What are we doing here? Does it mean anything to you?;[];;[15071];[15059];k_hcar_dialog;
Of course it means something to me! The Sith have to be stopped! You think it doesn't matter to me that everyone on Taris is dead? That the Republic is in danger?;[{'Carth': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[15062];[15070];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04371_.mp3
I would certainly hope not.;[];;[15059];[15057];k_hcar_dialog;
But what if you don't die? What then?;[];;[15074];[15054];k_hcar_dialog;
That's never occurred to me. I've always been the captain of my own ship, after all... or thought about going after Saul on my own.;[];;[15057];[15073];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04374_.mp3
You've been watching me very closely as of late. Why is that?;[];available after the third starmap uncovered K_SWG_CARTH = 10;[15076];[14537, 15228, 15236];k_hcar_dialog;
Oh. I hadn't thought you'd noticed...;[];;[15077, 15108, 15119];[15075];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04376_.mp3
Well, I did.;[];;[15078];[15076];k_hcar_dialog;
Well, I ah... I've just been admiring you. Not, uhh, not anything like that, though...;[];;[15079];[15077, 15117];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04378_.mp3
I've been watching you in action. Your, your skills... you have a natural talent that is incredible.;[];;[15080];[15078, 15114];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04382_.mp3
Not that, ah, all I do is watch you or anything. I don't mean anything by it.;[];;[15081, 15104, 15106];[15079];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04383_.mp3
It's alright. I don't mind if you watch me.;[];;[15082];[15080];k_hcar_dialog;
Ha! Why didn't you tell me that sooner? You would have saved me a lot of trouble.;[{'Carth': 'Talk_Laughing'}];;[15083];[15081];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04385_.mp3
I will say one thing, however. We've come a long way with your help. Whether it's the Force or fate or just dumb luck... I'm glad you're here.;[];;[15084];[15082, 15105];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04386_.mp3
We probably would have never made it this far without you. I... should have said this long before, instead of doubting you. I, ah, hope you can forgive me.;[];;[15085, 15098, 15100];[15083];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04387_.mp3
That was rather like pulling teeth.;[];;[15086];[15084];k_hcar_dialog;
I guess I'm a proud man. I... don't admit things like this easily.;[];;[15087, 15094, 15096];[15085];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04389_.mp3
Why do you need my forgiveness, anyway?;[];;[15088];[15086, 15099];k_hcar_dialog;
Because you're an impressive and beautiful woman. In some ways... good ways... you remind me of my wife and I'd like to make things right between us.;[];;[15089, 15091, 15092];[15087];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04391_.mp3
Well... that's certainly better...;[];;[15090];[15088, 15097];k_hcar_dialog;
I'll, ah, take that as a yes. I'm glad that's settled. Shall we... shall we get back to what we were doing?;[];;[];[15089, 15091];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04402_.mp3
You think I'm beautiful?;[];;[15090];[15088, 15097];k_hcar_dialog;
Oh, this is too corny. Take a hike and leave me alone, will you?;[];;[15093];[15088, 15097];k_hcar_dialog;
Sorry. Didn't mean to... embarass you. I'll stop.;[{'Carth': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[];[15092];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04405_.mp3
Alright, you're off the hook. You're forgiven.;[];;[15095];[15086, 15099];k_hcar_dialog;
Thank you. Let's, ah... let's get back to what we were doing.;[];;[];[15094];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04393_.mp3
Forget it. You don't get off so easy.;[];;[15097];[15086, 15099];k_hcar_dialog;
What am I supposed to say? I was wrong. I was a stubborn fool. I... Look, I have trouble admitting it when a beautiful woman has my number...ok?;[];;[15089, 15091, 15092];[15096, 15102, 15103];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04400_.mp3
You already apologized once, Carth.;[];;[15099];[15084];k_hcar_dialog;
And you accepted it... but that doesn't mean I'm forgiven. I'd like to be.;[];;[15087, 15094, 15096];[15098];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04396_.mp3
Is that it?;[];;[15101];[15084];k_hcar_dialog;
Err... what do you mean?;[];;[15102, 15103];[15100];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04398_.mp3
I mean is that how you ask for forgiveness?;[];;[15097];[15101];k_hcar_dialog;
I mean that's a damn poor excuse for an apology.;[];;[15097];[15101];k_hcar_dialog;
Oh? Any other observations?;[];;[15105];[15080];k_hcar_dialog;
Well... maybe a few. I hope you won't mind if I keep those to myself.;[];;[15083];[15104];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04407_.mp3
Just keep your eyes to yourself from now on and leave me be, got that?;[];;[15107];[15080];k_hcar_dialog;
Oh. Right. I'll, ah, I'll just pay attention to what I'm doing...;[];;[];[15106];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04409_.mp3

Relax, Carth, I'm teasing you.;[];;[15111];[15109, 15120];k_hcar_dialog;

I can. Do you need to talk?;[];;[15125];[15123];k_hcar_dialog;

This is fine.;[];;[15127];[15125, 15164];k_hcar_dialog;
Alright. I'm, uh... I'm concerned about you. I've been keeping these thoughts to myself, mostly, but I think it's time I say something.;[];;[15128, 15155];[15126];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04413_.mp3
What's this about?;[];;[15129, 15153];[15127];k_hcar_dialog;
It's about you. I'm worried about what you're doing to yourself... how much you've succumbed to violence and anger.;[];;[15130];[15128, 15155];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04415_.mp3
I knew it was possible for this to happen to you... and it just pains me to see it. I've been down this path. And I don't recommend it.;[];;[15131];[15129];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04416_.mp3
If, uh... if I'm going to find some purpose beyond taking revenge on Saul, then it's going to have to be in protecting you.;[];;[15132];[15130, 15154];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04419_.mp3
I don't know why, but I think some terrible fate is waiting for you. I think the Jedi Council knows it, too. And I don't want that to come to pass.;[];;[15133, 15147, 15149, 15151];[15131];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04420_.mp3
I can take care of myself. I don't need you.;[];;[15134];[15132];k_hcar_dialog;
That's where I think you're wrong. You can't do this on your own. Nobody could.;[];;[15135];[15133];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04422_.mp3
If I'm going to live past Saul, I need you to, as well. Let me protect you... from yourself, from the Sith... you have to let me try.;[];;[15136, 15143, 15146];[15134, 15148, 15150, 15152];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04429_.mp3
Why are you doing this?;[];;[15137];[15135];k_hcar_dialog;
Because... because I never got the chance to save my wife and son. Because I didn't stop Saul when I had the chance.;[];;[15138];[15136];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04431_.mp3
Because I finally have the chance to do it right. You are an extraordinary woman... you make me think that maybe I might have some purpose beyond revenge.;[];;[15139];[15137];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04432_.mp3
I don't know whether it means anything to you... but it does to me.;[];;[15140, 15142, 15143];[15138];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04433_.mp3
It means a lot to me, Carth. Thank you.;[];;[15141];[15139];k_hcar_dialog;

Alright, Carth. I'd be glad for the help.;[];;[15141];[15139];k_hcar_dialog;
Forget it, I said. I don't need you crowding me. Period.;[];;[15144];[15139, 15135];k_hcar_dialog;

Fine, Carth. Do what you have to.;[];;[15141];[15135];k_hcar_dialog;

I haven't 'succumbed' to anything. What do you know?!;[];;[15150];[15132];k_hcar_dialog;
I know that there's going to come a day when you'll look in the mirror and wonder how you ever got to become what you are... and by then it will be too late.;[];;[15135];[15149];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04426_.mp3
You think the Jedi have thrown me to the wolves?;[];;[15152];[15132];k_hcar_dialog;
Don't chalk it up to my paranoia just yet. Something isn't right. I blamed it on you, before, but I... I think the Jedi didn't tell us everything.;[];;[15135];[15151];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04428_.mp3
It's about you. I'm worried about what might happen to you. You have a lot of courage, and the fact you've remained strong is amazing, but there is even greater danger ahead.;[];;[15154];[15128, 15155];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04417_.mp3
I think you might be setting yourself up for a fall. Maybe at the urging of the Jedi, I don't know... but you're definitely going to become a target.;[];;[15131];[15153];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04418_.mp3

And?;[];;[15186];[15184];k_hcar_dialog;
I can't hate you. I tried... I wanted to hold you responsible for all the things you've done. For my... for my wife, for Telos... for Dustil. But I can't.;[{'Carth': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[15187, 15217, 15218];[15185];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04446_.mp3

Well then I hope I can save you. From yourself.;[];;[15198];[15196];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04458_.mp3

I can't see into the future. I don't know what's going to happen.;[];;[15202];[15198];k_hcar_dialog;
Neither do I. But does that really matter if we love each other?;[];;[15203, 15204];[15201];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04464_.mp3
I guess not. I think I could love you, too.;[];;[15200];[15202];k_hcar_dialog;
I can't give you that chance. There can be no future between us.;[];;[15205];[15202, 15198];k_hcar_dialog;
Oh. I had... hoped that there might be. I don't blame you. Uh. You're not the same woman I met on Taris anymore, are you?;[];;[15206];[15204, 15209, 15215];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04473_.mp3
Well, thank you for your honesty. I still intend to see this through to the end, whatever happens. Malak needs to be stopped.;[];;[15207];[15205];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04474_.mp3
And uh, you... you'll make the decision you have to. And we'll have to deal with that day when it comes.;[];;[];[15206];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04475_.mp3
What sort of reason?;[];;[15198];[15195];k_hcar_dialog;
I'm sorry Carth. There's no room in my destiny for you.;[];;[15205];[15195];k_hcar_dialog;
You think I could fall to the dark side, do you?;[];;[15194];[15192];k_hcar_dialog;
I don't want you hurt protecting me, Carth.;[];;[15212];[15192];k_hcar_dialog;
I think I would be hurt worse if I didn't try.;[];;[15213, 15214];[15211];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04470_.mp3
What do you mean?;[];;[15194];[15212];k_hcar_dialog;
I don't understand.;[];;[15194];[15212];k_hcar_dialog;
No, Carth. There's no room in my destiny for you.;[];;[15205];[15192];k_hcar_dialog;
Despite whatever part of Revan is inside you, the... the darkness that must surely be there, it isn't who you are.;[];;[15191];[15189];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04451_.mp3
I'm glad to hear that.;[];;[15188];[15186];k_hcar_dialog;
Why should I care if you hate me?;[];;[15219];[15186];k_hcar_dialog;
Maybe you shouldn't. I would hope that my standing by you would mean something to you, but maybe it doesn't. Maybe it just can't.;[];;[15188];[15218];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04478_.mp3
We need to talk. About me being Darth Revan.;[];;[15184];[14537, 15228, 15236];k_hcar_dialog;
Do you have any advice on our little stowaway?;[];;[15222];[14537, 15228, 15236];k_hcar_dialog;

Taris? The planet's all one big city... but it's golden years are long past, and things have gotten worse since the Sith occupied it.;[];;[15227];[15225];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04015_.mp3
From what I hear, the wealthy live on the tops of all the tall towers. And if you're poor, you live down in the shadows... and it gets worse the lower you go.;[];;[15228];[15226];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04016_.mp3

You got it.;[];;[];[15229];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04480_.mp3
Dantooine's a boring place. It's all plains and herders and small settlements. Perfect for the Jedi to lose themselves in, I guess.;[];;[15228];[15225];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04018_.mp3
Manaan's a neutral world. They're the only source of kolto... the healing fluid... and they use that to remain free from both the Republic and the Sith.;[];;[15228];[15225];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04019_.mp3
Tatooine's just a desert planet. I hear the mining isn't going so well... I'd bet the colony gets abandoned before long.;[];;[15228];[15225];k_hcar_dialog;NM35AACART04020_.mp3

Ah, well. It is time for your punishment.;[];;[15295];[15293, 15341];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02082_.mp3
And so we come to round two. You come across a group of humans who are threatened by dangerous animals. They plead for help, offering you a reward. What do you do?;[{'Player': 'Sleep'}, {'Mekel': 'Sleep'}];;[15296, 15333, 15335, 15338];[15294, 15344];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02089_.mp3
I accept the reward and assist them.;[{'Mekel': 'Sleep'}, {'Player': 'Sleep'}];;[15297];[15295];kor38b_jorakuln;
So you've made a profit and now have some sniveling, useless fools trailing after you. No, no, no. Bad idea. Bad idea.;[];;[15298];[15296];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02091_.mp3
At any rate... here is your punishment.;[{'Mekel': 'Sleep'}, {'Player': 'Sleep'}];;[15299];[15297, 15339];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02093_.mp3
Let's see... ah, yes. You discover an aspect of the Force that gives you great power. Do you share it and strengthen the Sith as a whole or keep it to yourself?;[];;[15300, 15330, 15333];[15298, 15337];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02100_.mp3
I keep it to myself.;[{'Mekel': 'Sleep'}, {'Player': 'Sleep'}];;[15301];[15299];kor38b_jorakuln;
Correct! Let them rip the secret from your cold, dead hands... if they are strong enough. Oh, certainly, you might share it with a few... selected... minions, but that of course is a completely different story. Ha ha!;[];;[15302];[15300];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02102_.mp3
Well, it's sad to say, but it's that time again, Mekel.;[{'Mekel': 'Sleep'}, {'Player': 'Sleep'}];;[15303, 15307];[15301];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02104_.mp3
Will you look at that? Poor Mekel has gone and died on us. Tsk tsk. And here I thought he was good for at least one more.;[{'Jorak Uln': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[15304];[15302, 15310];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02106_.mp3
Well, then... with young Mekel dead, I suppose you've gone and passed my little test, haven't you? That indeed would be a first.;[];;[15305];[15303, 15314, 15321];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02120_.mp3
I think you must have cheated a little, but there's nothing wrong with a Sith cheating a little. I'll keep my word.;[];;[15306];[15304];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02122_.mp3
I'll just give you my tablet. Perhaps we'll meet again... Sith. That would be fun, no?;[];;[];[15305];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02124_.mp3
Still going? Alright, then. One of your underlings has made a major mistake which makes you look bad. He is normally very competent and skilled. Do you kill him or give him another chance?;[];;[15308, 15325, 15328];[15302, 15332];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02108_.mp3
Kill him.;[{'Mekel': 'Sleep'}, {'Player': 'Sleep'}];;[15309];[15307];kor38b_jorakuln;
Correct! Publicly, if you can. There is no room for that level of failure. Not killing him would be seen as a sign of weakness... and then where would you be?;[];;[15310];[15308];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02110_.mp3
Ahhh, Mekel. The time has come once again, hasn't it?;[{'Mekel': 'Sleep'}, {'Player': 'Sleep'}];;[15303, 15311];[15309];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02112_.mp3
Last question! You're about to die. Do you pass on your knowledge to your apprentice to make him stronger... or do you use your last breath to strike at your enemies?;[];;[15312, 15319, 15322, 15323];[15310, 15327];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02114_.mp3
Neither. A true Sith never dies.;[{'Mekel': 'Sleep'}, {'Player': 'Sleep'}];;[15313];[15311];kor38b_jorakuln;
What?! How did you know that? That was my trick question! Bah! Telepathy. No, wait! Someone told you didn't they!;[{'Jorak Uln': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[15314];[15312];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02116_.mp3
Hmph. Regardless, I suppose rules are rules. Time for your medicine, Mekel, my boy.;[{'Jorak Uln': 'Talk_Sad'}, {'Mekel': 'Sleep'}, {'Player': 'Sleep'}];;[15304, 15315];[15313];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02118_.mp3
Now... this is odd. The test is over and you're both still alive. Well that's never happened before. Hmmmn. What to do, what to do...;[];;[15316];[15314, 15321];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02126_.mp3
I suppose this means you can go, Mekel. I'll have to just figure out what to do with our friend, here. Run along, now.;[];;[15317];[15315];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02128_.mp3
Or... or I could use the Force to free them! And we could kill you!! Seems you didn't think of that, old man!!;[{'Mekel': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[15318];[15316];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02130_.mp3
What?! Mutiny! Behave, students! I'll... that's it! Detention for all of you! Permanent detention!!;[];;[];[15317];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02132_.mp3
I pass on my knowledge.;[{'Mekel': 'Sleep'}, {'Player': 'Sleep'}];;[15320];[15311];kor38b_jorakuln;
Fool! It is a trick question! A true Sith *never* dies!! Ha ha ha ha ha!!;[{'Jorak Uln': 'Talk_Laughing'}];;[15321];[15319, 15322];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02135_.mp3
I'll enjoy this one. Time for your medicine!;[];;[15304, 15315];[15320, 15324];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02137_.mp3
I strike at my enemies.;[];;[15320];[15311];kor38b_jorakuln;
I won't give you the satisfaction of an answer.;[];;[15324];[15311];kor38b_jorakuln;
Hmph. Such insolent students I get, these days. You deserve this, and then some!;[{'Jorak Uln': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[15321];[15323];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02141_.mp3
Give him another chance.;[];;[15326];[15307];kor38b_jorakuln;
Another chance to make you look poor to your superiors? To make it look like you are weak and deserving of attack? No, no, no. Think again.;[];;[15327];[15325];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02143_.mp3
Hmmm. Not that good help is easy to find. Oh, well, here's your reward.;[];;[15311];[15326, 15329];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02145_.mp3
Forget it. I'm not playing along.;[];;[15329];[15307];kor38b_jorakuln;
You're not trying to make me angry, are you? That would be pointless posturing on your part. Is this so hard?;[{'Jorak Uln': 'Taunt'}];;[15327];[15328];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02148_.mp3
I share it.;[];;[15331];[15299];kor38b_jorakuln;
You gained an advantage and you share it freely? Let them rip the secret from my dead hands, I say! I mean... 'share it'?! Are you mad?!;[{'Jorak Uln': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[15332];[15330];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02151_.mp3
*sigh* Well, you did ask for this. It's for your own good.;[];;[15307];[15331, 15334];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02153_.mp3
I refuse to answer this.;[];;[15334];[15299, 15295, 15291];kor38b_jorakuln;
And here I thought this question was an easy one. Ah, well, suit yourself.;[];;[15332];[15333];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02156_.mp3
I take the reward and leave the weak fools to their fate.;[{'Mekel': 'Sleep'}, {'Player': 'Sleep'}];;[15336];[15295];kor38b_jorakuln;
Correct! The humans would no doubt just be preyed upon by something else, later. Stand up for yourself, I say! We're not Jedi shepherds, after all.;[];;[15337];[15335];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02096_.mp3
Sadly, Mekel, the ingenuity of your fellow student is your loss. This is going to hurt.;[{'Mekel': 'Sleep'}, {'Player': 'Sleep'}];;[15299];[15336];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02098_.mp3
I ignore them completely.;[];;[15339];[15295];kor38b_jorakuln;
And pass up the opportunity to gain? What kind of Sith are you going to be if you don't grab fate by the nose hairs? No, no, no. That is bad form.;[];;[15298];[15338];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02159_.mp3
I do nothing. He's a fine leader, you said. He's good for the Sith.;[];;[15341];[15291];kor38b_jorakuln;
Incorrect! What sort of thinking is that? If all the Sith thought as you did, we would all be soft like the Jedi. Tsk.;[];;[15294];[15340];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02080_.mp3
I use the opportunity to kill him and take his position.;[];;[15343];[15291];kor38b_jorakuln;
Correct! He was a fool to let down his guard. You will not make the same mistake, and the Sith as a whole benefit.;[];;[15344];[15342];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02085_.mp3
You see, Mekel? It is not so difficult. Time for your punishment.;[{'Mekel': 'Sleep'}, {'Player': 'Sleep'}];;[15295];[15343];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02087_.mp3
This is completely unfair!;[];;[15346];[15283];kor38b_jorakuln;
Oh? Just how long have you been a Sith, anyhow? A bit dainty around the edges, aren't we?;[];;[15286];[15345];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02059_.mp3
Mekel is a monster. He deserves to die.;[];;[15348];[15283];kor38b_jorakuln;
No hesitation before the kill. Now that's what I like to hear.;[];;[15286];[15347];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02062_.mp3
Go ahead.;[];;[15286];[15283];kor38b_jorakuln;
Go ahead. Do your worst.;[];;[15351];[15278, 15276, 15274, 15271];kor38b_jorakuln;
Now, now, is that any kind of attitude to take with higher education? I'm doing you a favor, really.;[{'Jorak Uln': 'Persuade'}];;[15281];[15350];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02048_.mp3
I'm sure we could. You could even try using your feminine wiles on me. But, quite frankly, I'm quite determined and not above killing a woman. Even a pretty one.;[];;[15271];[15269];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02041_.mp3
No? Blast it! What have they been teaching you children in that academy these days!;[{'Jorak Uln': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[15263];[15261];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02016_.mp3
Yes, I've been told about you.;[];;[15355, 15356];[15260];kor38b_jorakuln;
That's good. It's nice to still be the topic of discussion ocassionally. Maybe there's a class on me? Mmm... hmm... maybe not.;[];;[15263];[15354];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02019_.mp3
Liar. You think I can't tell? Obviously the academy is lax in its training, as usual. Stupid Uthar.;[];;[15263];[15354];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02021_.mp3
The old hermit in hiding?;[];;[15358];[15260];kor38b_jorakuln;
What?! Old hermit?! Can't that blasted Uthar teach a single thing right these days?! Slander! That's what it is!;[{'Jorak Uln': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[15263];[15357];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02024_.mp3
I don't care who you are! You're dead!;[];;[15360];[15260];kor38b_jorakuln;
Oh, my, my, my. Such glorious vim! If I could bottle it and drink it, I would. Hmmm... there's a thought.;[];;[15263];[15359];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02027_.mp3
I demand to be released at once!;[];;[15362];[15255];kor38b_jorakuln;
Ha ha ha! I maaay do that. In time, in time. But for now, I've decided to keep you in restraints. No point in you getting strange ideas in your head and ruining my fun.;[{'Jorak Uln': 'Talk_Laughing'}];;[15363];[15361];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02176_.mp3
No, no. Let's keep things on a more civilized note, shall we? Now then... introductions are always the place to start, if I remember correctly.;[];;[15258];[15362, 15365];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02178_.mp3
I'll kill you for this, old man!;[];;[15365];[15255];kor38b_jorakuln;
Oh-ho! Spiteful little thing, aren't you? Let's not forget, however, who has whom at the disadvantage, shall we?;[{'Jorak Uln': 'Talk_Laughing'}];;[15363];[15364];kor38b_jorakuln;NM38ABJORA02181_.mp3
Please don't hurt me - I just serve the food here, that's all! I'm not like these others - I'm not even a Black Vulkar. Please don't kill me!;[{'Waitress': 'Talk_Pleading'}];;[15367, 15369, 15384, 15387];[None];tar10_waitress;NM10AAWAIT07000_.mp3
How did you end up here in the Vulkar base?;[];;[15368];[15366];tar10_waitress;
My name is Ada. My father owed Davik some money, but he couldn't pay. Davik killed my father and sold me into slavery here at the Vulkar compound to pay off the debt.;[];;[15369, 15379, 15384, 15387];[15367];tar10_waitress;NM10AAWAIT07002_.mp3
Don't worry, I just want to ask you a few questions.;[];;[15370, 15372];[15368, 15366];tar10_waitress;
But I don't know anything! I'm just a prisoner here - a slave! The Vulkars don't tell me anything, they treat me like dirt, they beat me if I screw up their orders.;[];;[15371];[15369, 15383, 15387];tar10_waitress;NM10AAWAIT07011_.mp3
You may know more than you think, miss. Help us and we'll help you, okay?;[];;[15372];[15370];tar10_waitress;NM10AAWAIT07013_.mp3
Well... alright. I still don't know how much help I can be. But I sure hope you get rid of all the Vulkars. I hate them!;[];;[15373, 15376, 15379];[15371, 15383, 15369, 15387];tar10_waitress;NM10AAWAIT07015_.mp3
Where can I find the prototype swoop engine accelerator?;[];;[15374];[15372, 15378];tar10_waitress;
What? I... I've never heard of such a thing. I guess it might be in the garage on the lower level - that's where all the Vulkars go to work on their swoop bikes.;[];;[15375];[15373];tar10_waitress;NM10AAWAIT07021_.mp3
But I've never been down there. The elevator is protected by a security system - only the Vulkars are allowed to go down there.;[];;[15376, 15379, 15384];[15374];tar10_waitress;NM10AAWAIT07023_.mp3
I'm looking for a prisoner. A woman named Bastila.;[];;[15377];[15375, 15372];tar10_waitress;
Is she that Republic soldier? I heard one of those Vulkar mention her, but she's not here. He said Brejik didn't trust his men around her.;[];;[15378];[15376];tar10_waitress;NM10AAWAIT07025_.mp3
I guess she's too important to be a slave here in the kitchens, getting pawed and groped and kicked and spit on like me. Brejik must have taken her somewhere safe.;[];;[15373, 15379, 15384];[15377];tar10_waitress;NM10AAWAIT07027_.mp3
If I let you go can you find your way out of here?;[];;[15380];[15378, 15375, 15372, 15368];tar10_waitress;
Now that you've killed the guards who were supposed to watch me I think I could find my way out of here.;[];;[15381, 15383, 15384];[15379];tar10_waitress;NM10AAWAIT07004_.mp3
Hurry, then - get out of here.;[];;[15382];[15380];tar10_waitress;

No, no wait. This girl is no threat to us. Just run along, miss, and get out of here. And do it quickly before the Vulkars come back.;[];;[15382];[15384];tar10_waitress;NM10AAWAIT07029_.mp3

Hi there... not too many people come in here to speak to me anymore. Most prefer the fancy surroundings of the Upper City Cantina.;[];;[15390];[None];tar03_cardsell31;
But nobody up there carries the kinds of Pazaak cards I sell. Are you interested in purchasing some individual cards to bolster your Pazaak deck?;[];;[15391, 15415, 15417];[15389];tar03_cardsell31;
What are you talking about?;[];;[15392];[15390];tar03_cardsell31;
I'm talking about Pazaak. You know - high stakes gambling. Each player brings their own deck to a Pazaak match, and the better your cards are the better your chances of winning.;[];;[15393];[15391, 15418];tar03_cardsell31;
My name is Uriah. Everybody knows I'm the man to see if you want to add some cards to your Pazaak deck. My prices are quite reasonable.;[];;[15394];[15392];tar03_cardsell31;
So, what do you say? Are you interested in buying some of my Pazaak cards to augment your own deck?;[];;[15395, 15397, 15401, 15415];[15393];tar03_cardsell31;
Show me what you have for sale.;[];;[15396];[15394, 15414, 15408, 15406, 15404, 15420, 15421];tar03_cardsell31;
I haven't been able to restock my inventory since the Sith quarantine started. But I've still got a pretty good selection.;[];;[];[15395];tar03_cardsell31;
I don't have my own deck.;[];;[15398];[15394, 15420, 15421];tar03_cardsell31;
You don't? Well, not much point in you looking at my inventory then. My individual cards aren't much good without the basic deck.;[];;[15399];[15397];tar03_cardsell31;
If you're interested in Pazaak you should go speak to Garouk in the Upper City cantina. He's looking to retire and sell his deck. Might even give you a lesson, too.;[];;[15400];[15398];tar03_cardsell31;
Anything else you need?;[];;[15401, 15415];[15399];tar03_cardsell31;
I want to ask you some questions.;[];;[15402];[15400, 15394, 15420, 15421];tar03_cardsell31;
If you want information you should speak to Zax in the bounty office. He's Davik's unofficial earpiece. But I'll try and answer your questions as best I can.;[];;[15403, 15405, 15412, 15415];[15401];tar03_cardsell31;
Tell me about Davik.;[];;[15404];[15402];tar03_cardsell31;
I'm not stupid enough to start bad mouthing Davik Kang in this place. Not with Zax so nearby. Go to the bounty office and talk to him if you want the scoop on Davik.;[];;[15395, 15405, 15412, 15415];[15403];tar03_cardsell31;
I want some general information on the Lower City.;[];;[15406];[15404, 15414, 15411, 15408, 15402];tar03_cardsell31;
Don't know what I can really tell you. There's a gang war between the Hidden Beks and the Black Vulkars, but everybody knows about that.;[];;[15395, 15407, 15409, 15412, 15415];[15405];tar03_cardsell31;
Tell me about the Hidden Beks.;[];;[15408];[15406, 15414, 15411];tar03_cardsell31;
The Beks are run by a man named Gadon Thek. They used to run things here in the Lower City and life wasn't too bad. But now the Vulkars are trying to move in.;[];;[15395, 15405, 15409, 15412, 15415];[15407];tar03_cardsell31;
Tell me about the Black Vulkars.;[];;[15410];[15408, 15414, 15411, 15406];tar03_cardsell31;
The Vulkars are led by Brejik. He's tough and ruthless and maybe even a little insane. He's also determined to take control of the entire Lower City away from the Hidden Beks.;[];;[15411];[15409];tar03_cardsell31;

The Undercity? You don't want to be going down there - the place is crawling with rakghouls! Do yourself a favor and forget about those escape pods.;[];;[15414];[15412];tar03_cardsell31;
Besides, there's probably nothing left of those pods anyway. The Hidden Beks and the Black Vulkars would have stripped anything valuable from them within hours of the crash.;[];;[15395, 15405, 15407, 15409, 15415];[15413];tar03_cardsell31;

Of course, of course. My mind isn't as sharp as it used to be - that's why I'm giving up the gambler's life. But I think I can still manage to answer some simple questions.;[];;[15426, 15428, 15436, 15439, 15443];[15424];tar02_garouk021;NM02AEGARO15006_.mp3
Who are you?;[];;[15427];[15425, 15446, 15447, 15450];tar02_garouk021;
My name's Garouk. I used to be a card shark - one of the best Pazaak players on the Outer Rim. But that was before I retired from the gambling life.;[];;[15424, 15428, 15436];[15426];tar02_garouk021;NM02AEGARO15021_.mp3
You're giving up gambling? Why?;[];;[15429];[15427, 15425, 15442, 15450];tar02_garouk021;
Don't get me wrong, the game's been good to me over the years. I've traveled the span of the galaxy, from the Core Worlds to the farthest reaches of the Outer Rim.;[];;[15430];[15428];tar02_garouk021;NM02AEGARO15023_.mp3
I've won countless fortunes... and lost countless more. But that was long ago, and things have changed. Gambling is a young man's game.;[];;[15431, 15438];[15429];tar02_garouk021;NM02AEGARO15025_.mp3
That's why I'm looking to get out. My offer still stands - fifty credits gets you my old Pazaak deck and a free lesson. A great offer if you can afford it.;[];;[15424, 15432, 15434, 15436];[15430];tar02_garouk021;NM02AEGARO15027_.mp3
I can't afford that.;[];;[15433];[15431];tar02_garouk021;
I'm sorry to hear that, but fifty credits is my best offer. I'm practically giving the deck away at that price. If you want it, it's yours. If not, no hard feelings.;[];;[15424, 15434, 15436];[15432];tar02_garouk021;NM02AEGARO15029_.mp3

That's why I sold my old deck to you. I don't have what it takes anymore, and I hate to let my cards go to waste.;[];;[15424, 15436];[15430];tar02_garouk021;NM02AEGARO15030_.mp3
I want some general information on Taris.;[];;[15440];[15425];tar02_garouk021;
Mmm. Don't know what I can tell you that would be any use. The Upper City is nice enough, though it was better before the Sith showed up. But they don't bother an old guy like me much.;[];;[15441];[15439];tar02_garouk021;NM02AEGARO15008_.mp3
Don't know much about the Lower City. It's rough down beneath. I just stay up here where it's safe and mind my own business.;[];;[15442];[15440];tar02_garouk021;NM02AEGARO15010_.mp3
I don't see much point in worrying about that kind of stuff now that I've given up the gambler's life. Is there anything else I can do for you?;[];;[15424, 15428, 15436];[15441, 15444];tar02_garouk021;NM02AEGARO15012_.mp3
Do you know anything about those Republic escape pods that crashed down in the Undercity?;[];;[15444];[15425];tar02_garouk021;
I spend my days here in the cantina, sipping ale and chatting with the folks who wander by. I don't have much use or care what goes on outside these walls.;[];;[15442];[15443];tar02_garouk021;NM02AEGARO15014_.mp3

You mean Davik's a crime lord?;[];;[15491];[15489];tar02_gurney021;

Davik's interested in anything that can turn a profit. He could make a fortune selling the serum to anyone infected with the disease - not like Zelka, who'll practically give it away.;[];;[15494, 15497, 15499, 15501, 15511];[15492];tar02_gurney021;NM02ACGURN03020_.mp3

The best thing to do is take the rakghoul serum to Zax. He runs the Lower City bounty office, but everyone knows he also works for Davik. He'll make it worth your while.;[];;[15492, 15497, 15499, 15501, 15511];[15495];tar02_gurney021;NM02ACGURN03024_.mp3

Look, Zelka can't afford to pay me much. If you sell the serum to Davik, I can probably get a nice finder's fee for directing you to him.;[];;[15492, 15494, 15499, 15501, 15511];[15497];tar02_gurney021;NM02ACGURN03026_.mp3

Hmph. I'll just deny it. Who's Zelka going to believe - me, or some off-world stranger? Now, be smart about this. You'll get a better deal selling to Davik.;[];;[15492, 15494, 15497, 15501, 15511];[15499];tar02_gurney021;NM02ACGURN03028_.mp3
I think I'd rather give the serum to Zelka. He'll use it to help people.;[];;[15502];[15500, 15498, 15496, 15493, 15491, 15489, 15487, 15513];tar02_gurney021;
Helping people is all well and good, but you have to help yourself first, right? I'm telling you Davik will pay big credits for the cure. More than Zelka could ever afford.;[];;[15503, 15508, 15510];[15501];tar02_gurney021;NM02ACGURN03031_.mp3
And then only the wealthiest patrons could acquire the cure. That is hardly fair.;[];;[15504, 15509];[15502, 15511];tar02_gurney021;NM02ACGURN03033_.mp3
If you haven't noticed, not much about this place is fair.;[];;[15505];[15503];tar02_gurney021;NM02ACGURN03035_.mp3

Looks like we've got company! Get those blasters ready, boys!;[];;[];[15522];tar04_cand043;NM04AACAND02017_.mp3
Why - is there some danger down here?;[];;[15521];[15518];tar04_cand043;
Who are you?;[];;[15526];[15518];tar04_cand043;
That's Canderous Ordo! He's the most famous Mandalorian mercenary in this sector of the galaxy!;[];;[15521];[15525];tar04_cand043;NM04AACAND02020_.mp3
I go where I want, when I want.;[];;[15528];[15518];tar04_cand043;
Trying to pick a fight with a Mandalorian - I can see you're not too bright. But I'm on a mission for Davik, so I don't have time for fun and games.;[];;[15522];[15527];tar04_cand043;NM04AACAND02023_.mp3
Damn! I told Davik this salvage mission was a bad idea! His men aren't trained for this kind of thing, and I can't babysit them all!;[];;[15530];[None];tar04_cand043;NM04AACAND02025_.mp3
Okay, boys... we're getting out of here before I lose anyone else. I can't carry all this salvage back by myself!;[];;[15531];[15529];tar04_cand043;NM04AACAND02027_.mp3
You'd be smart to get out of here as well. Even if you can handle the rakghouls I doubt there's anything worth finding anymore.;[];;[15532, 15543, 15545];[15530];tar04_cand043;NM04AACAND02029_.mp3
What do you mean by that?;[];;[15533];[15531];tar04_cand043;
Davik sent me down here with this motley crew to scavenge whatever we could from the Republic escape pods that crashed during the recent battle overhead.;[];;[15534];[15532];tar04_cand043;NM04AACAND02031_.mp3
But the Lower City gangs got here first. Anything worthwhile in those Republic pods is probably in their hands now. Davik won't like that.;[];;[15535, 15538, 15545];[15533];tar04_cand043;NM04AACAND02033_.mp3
What can you tell me about Davik?;[];;[15536];[15534, 15542];tar04_cand043;
What are you, an off-worlder? Everybody knows Davik. He's a member of the Exchange. You know - the interstellar crime syndicate.;[];;[15537];[15535];tar04_cand043;NM04AACAND02035_.mp3
Smuggling, gambling, extortion - Davik controls it all here on Taris. That's why I'm working for him. But lately the Lower City gangs have been giving my boss some trouble.;[];;[15538, 15543];[15536];tar04_cand043;NM04AACAND02037_.mp3
What do you know about the Lower City gangs?;[];;[15539];[15537, 15534];tar04_cand043;
This isn't really the place to have these kind of conversations. But I guess I could spare a couple seconds for you - after all, you did help us out with those rakghouls.;[];;[15540];[15538];tar04_cand043;NM04AACAND02039_.mp3
The Lower City is overrun with gangs, but the two most important ones are the Hidden Beks and the Black Vulkars. Used to be the Beks were the big dog and kept the others in line.;[];;[15541];[15539];tar04_cand043;NM04AACAND02041_.mp3
But lately the Black Vulkars are moving in on Bek turf and challenging them for control. The Vulkars are even starting to defy Davik!;[];;[15542];[15540];tar04_cand043;NM04AACAND02043_.mp3
Take these escape pods, for example. Everyone knew Davik would want first crack at them, but I know for a fact those damn Vulkars have already sent their own salvage party down here.;[];;[15535, 15543];[15541];tar04_cand043;NM04AACAND02045_.mp3
I better get going now.;[];;[15544];[15542, 15537, 15531];tar04_cand043;
Come on boys... let's move out!;[];;[];[15543, 15546];tar04_cand043;NM04AACAND02056_.mp3
So you're just going to run back to the surface like some coward?;[];;[15546];[15534, 15531];tar04_cand043;
Normally I'd make you regret those words, but I'm not wasting another minute down here. I'm responsible for this whole company, and they won't survive down here much longer.;[];;[15544];[15545];tar04_cand043;NM04AACAND02054_.mp3

You wear the uniforms of the Sith, but your actions prove you are not one of them. I... I do not know who you are, but I owe you my life.;[];;[15554, 15556, 15558, 15562];[None];tar02_alienpris;
Why were those Sith interrogating you?;[];;[15555];[15553, 15557];tar02_alienpris;
I... I don't know. They thought... they thought I was part of some underground resistance. I don't know why they would suspect me... I'm completely innocent.;[];;[15556, 15558, 15562];[15554];tar02_alienpris;
Is there any kind of reward for saving you?;[];;[15557];[15555, 15553];tar02_alienpris;
I'm sorry, but I have nothing. As I tried to tell my captors during the interrogation, I am a poor traveler trapped here by the Sith quarantine - nothing more.;[];;[15554, 15558, 15562];[15556];tar02_alienpris;
Now I get the pleasure of killing you myself!;[];;[15559, 15561];[15557, 15555, 15553];tar02_alienpris;
What are you doing? There's no need to go around drawing attention to ourselves. You there... just get out of here.;[];;[15560];[15558];tar02_alienpris;NM02ADALIE03006_.mp3
Yes... I have no desire to be here when another patrol comes to investigate these deaths. Goodbye, and thank you once again.;[];;[];[15559, 15562];tar02_alienpris;
But... but... no! I won't die like this!;[];attack player;[];[15558];tar02_alienpris;
Go on, get out of here.;[];;[15560];[15557, 15555, 15553];tar02_alienpris;
Thank you, human. The Sith would have killed me... of that I am certain. I don't know who you are, but it is clear you are no friend of the Sith.;[];;[15564];[None];tar02_alienpris;
Among my people there is a saying: the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Like you I hate the Sith. That is why I stole those Sith uniforms for the Hidden Beks.;[];;[15565, 15578, 15579];[15563];tar02_alienpris;
What are you talking about?;[];;[15566];[15564];tar02_alienpris;
In the Lower City there are some who do not bow to the conquerors. Swoop gangs like the Hidden Beks are gathering resources to one day strike against the Sith oppressors.;[];;[15567];[15565, 15578, 15579];tar02_alienpris;
If you wish to strike another blow against the Sith you would be wise to journey to the Lower City and speak with Gadon Thek, the leader of the Hidden Beks.;[];;[15568, 15570, 15572, 15574, 15576];[15566];tar02_alienpris;
What are the Hidden Beks planning?;[];;[15569];[15567, 15571, 15573, 15575];tar02_alienpris;
You would have to ask Gadon Thek to know the answer to that question. They approached me, and my only role was to obtain the Sith uniforms for them.;[];;[15570, 15572, 15574, 15576];[15568];tar02_alienpris;
Can you take me to Gadon?;[];;[15571];[15569, 15573, 15575, 15567];tar02_alienpris;
Access to the Lower City is restricted, I have never actually met Gadon. My only dealings were with members of his Hidden Bek gang.;[];;[15568, 15572, 15574, 15576];[15570];tar02_alienpris;
Can I get one of those uniforms from you?;[];;[15573];[15571, 15575, 15569, 15567];tar02_alienpris;
I am sorry, but all the uniforms I had were given to the Hidden Beks. I suppose you could take the uniforms from the bodies of the Sith soldiers in this room if you wanted.;[];;[15568, 15570, 15574, 15576];[15572];tar02_alienpris;
How about a reward for saving you?;[];;[15575];[15573, 15571, 15569, 15567];tar02_alienpris;
I'm sorry, human, but I have nothing of value. The credits the Hidden Beks gave me for helping them against the Sith are long since spent.;[];;[15568, 15570, 15572, 15576];[15574];tar02_alienpris;
I should be going now.;[];;[15577];[15575, 15573, 15571, 15569, 15567];tar02_alienpris;
As should I. The Sith know my face now, I must find somewhere to hide on this world. Thank you once again, human.;[];;[];[15576];tar02_alienpris;
The Sith were right! You are a spy!;[];;[15566];[15564];tar02_alienpris;
The Hidden Beks? Who are they?;[];;[15566];[15564];tar02_alienpris;
Yes! I heard that! Excellent job!;[];;[15581];[None];kor35_torturer;NM35AATORT19000_.mp3
Thank you for locating the cache. Naturally I would see you rewarded, but I would prefer that everyone believe that I extracted the information.;[];;[15582, 15585, 15592];[15580];kor35_torturer;NM35AATORT19002_.mp3
What?! Are you joking?;[];;[15583];[15581];kor35_torturer;
Of course not. Information extraction is my specialty... I'm not about to let it be known that some whelp did my job better.;[];;[15584];[15582];kor35_torturer;NM35AATORT19004_.mp3
You had some fun, didn't you? Now run along and let's not turn this into anything unpleasant.;[];;[15585, 15592];[15583];kor35_torturer;NM35AATORT19006_.mp3
I'm not going to let you get away with this!;[];;[15586];[15584, 15581];kor35_torturer;
Oh? I suppose one would need to be alive to go running to Master Uthar to report the location of the cache, wouldn't they?;[];;[15587];[15585];kor35_torturer;NM35AATORT19008_.mp3
Does that mean that you are ready to battle a true Sith, then? Shall we make an issue of it?;[];;[15588, 15590];[15586];kor35_torturer;NM35AATORT19010_.mp3
That's right! Let's go!;[];;[15589];[15587];kor35_torturer;

No, forget it.;[];;[15591];[15587];kor35_torturer;
Good. That's the way I prefer it. Now... to get rid of the prisoner and get to that cache...;[];;[];[15590, 15592];kor35_torturer;NM35AATORT19016_.mp3
Fine, I don't care.;[];;[15591];[15584, 15581];kor35_torturer;
What?! What have you done?!;[{'Sith Interrogator': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[15594];[None];kor35_torturer;NM35AATORT19018_.mp3
I told you not to put the prisoner into shock, didn't I?! Now how are we supposed to find out where the weapon cache is?! Uthar will be furious!!;[{'Sith Interrogator': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[15595];[15593];kor35_torturer;NM35AATORT19020_.mp3
Bah! Now I may as well take this fool and dump him somewhere. He's useless to us! I cannot believe you are so incompetent!;[{'Sith Interrogator': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[];[15594];kor35_torturer;NM35AATORT19022_.mp3
Ahhh, maybe you can do better than I. This Mandalorian is proving more resistant than I expected.;[];;[15597, 15609];[None];kor35_torturer;NM35AATORT19024_.mp3
What are you trying to do?;[];;[15598];[15596];kor35_torturer;
I'm trying to get him to tell us where his weapon cache is hidden. So far all the serum combinations I'm using are proving ineffective.;[];;[15599];[15597];kor35_torturer;NM35AATORT19026_.mp3
If I bring his drug threshold too high, he'll go into shock and be useless. Too low and he just refuses to talk. It's been maddening.;[];;[15600, 15603, 15607];[15598];kor35_torturer;NM35AATORT19028_.mp3
How do you drug him?;[];;[15601];[15599, 15610];kor35_torturer;
Just activate the console... it gives you a variety of options for serum dosage. The right amount applied at the right rate should do it.;[];;[15602];[15600];kor35_torturer;NM35AATORT19043_.mp3
The real trick is that the only way to gauge your progress is to watch the prisoner closely for his reaction. Our scanners can't pick up his vitals.;[];;[15603, 15607];[15601];kor35_torturer;NM35AATORT19030_.mp3
You want me to try it?;[];;[15604];[15602, 15599, 15610];kor35_torturer;
Certainly. Just don't kill him or send him into shock. He's supposed to be questioned, not executed.;[];;[15605, 15606];[15603];kor35_torturer;NM35AATORT19032_.mp3
If you manage to get the location of his cache out of him, it'll save me a lot of trouble. Up to you.;[];;[];[15604];kor35_torturer;NM35AATORT19034_.mp3
If you manage to get the location of his cache out of him, I'll be sure to pass on the good word to Master Uthar.;[];;[];[15604];kor35_torturer;NM35AATORT19036_.mp3
I have to go.;[];;[15608];[15602, 15599, 15610];kor35_torturer;
Fine, go on then. I *must* know where his weapon cache is! Damn him!;[];;[];[15607, 15609];kor35_torturer;NM35AATORT19040_.mp3
Err... no thanks.;[];;[15608];[15596];kor35_torturer;
Don't bother me. I'm trying to think how I'm going to question this prisoner. I need to know where that cache is!;[];;[15600, 15603, 15607];[None];kor35_torturer;NM35AATORT19042_.mp3

What... what kind of droid?;[];;[15678];[15676];kas22_eli_01;NM22AAELIX08020_.mp3
Now, now, Matton, it's likely just some old service droid lost by the Czerka Corporation. I wouldn't waste my time on it.;[];;[15679, 15681, 15725];[15677];kas22_eli_01;NM22AAELIX08021_.mp3
Could it be worth something?;[];;[15680];[15678, 15683, 15727];kas22_eli_01;

You mean they don't tolerate cheats!;[];;[15699];[15697];kas22_eli_01;NM22AAELIX08041_.mp3
No, I mean they don't respect the finer points of a good business plan. Give and take. That is why the Czerka Corporation simply takes.;[];;[15684, 15694, 15700];[15698, 15702, 15704];kas22_eli_01;NM22AAELIX08045_.mp3
What do you mean by that?;[];;[15701];[15699];kas22_eli_01;
You'd have to take your questions to Czerka Corporation, and the Wookiees themselves. I keep to myself.;[];;[15684, 15694];[15700];kas22_eli_01;NM22AAELIX08047_.mp3
No business sense? You mean they don't like to be cheated out of all their belongings and freedom.;[];;[15699];[15697];kas22_eli_01;NM22AAELIX08042_.mp3
It is difficult indeed to deal with those you oppress and enslave.;[];;[15704];[15697];kas22_eli_01;NM22AAELIX08043_.mp3

Do you always enslave your debtors?;[];;[15706];[15685, 15658, 15731];kas22_eli_01;
Enslave? I resent that. Simply fair business. This man's fellows left without settling their debts, so he must make up the difference.;[];;[15707];[15705];kas22_eli_01;NM22AAELIX08049_.mp3
I know, I know, it's standard trading rules. I just want to know where my crew went. I was only gone for two days. This isn't like them.;[];;[15708];[15706];kas22_eli_01;NM22AAELIX08050_.mp3

How much debt buys a man's life?;[];;[15717];[15715, 15710];kas22_eli_01;
Oh, it isn't about the amount. After all, as a skilled mechanic, Matton is worth much more than what is owed. Especially on this remote planet.;[];;[15718];[15716];kas22_eli_01;NM22AAELIX08061_.mp3
Oh, you flatter me, Eli. I guess we're best buddies now.;[];;[15719];[15717];kas22_eli_01;NM22AAELIX08062_.mp3
*ahem* As I was saying, it's a matter of principle. I am nothing if not honest in my dealings, and I demand the same.;[];;[15720];[15718];kas22_eli_01;NM22AAELIX08063_.mp3
He will be free to go when his friends turn up and the debt is paid. I honor my deals. Let no one say otherwise.;[];;[15659, 15675, 15684, 15694, 15711, 15721];[15719];kas22_eli_01;NM22AAELIX08064_.mp3
Perhaps I could settle some of his debt?;[];;[15722];[15720];kas22_eli_01;

Besides, he is a hard worker. I'd prefer to keep him.;[];;[15659, 15675, 15684, 15694, 15711];[15722];kas22_eli_01;NM22AAELIX08067_.mp3

The first dialog is when the player has not yet been told by Ahlan to find his son.   The second dialog is during the romance plot, after being told by Ahlan to find his son.   The third dialog is if Shen and Rahasia run away or are accepted by Nurik.   The fourth dialog is if the player returns Shen to his father.

Why are you so certain the Sandrals are to blame?;[];;[15824];[15822];dan14_mdroid;
Many years ago I brought my family here to Dantooine to escape the crush of humanity on the Core Worlds.;[];;[15825];[15823, 15867, 15869];dan14_mdroid;NM14ABAHLA01003_.mp3

Somehow I imagine the story from the Sandrals would sound just about the same, don't you?;[];;[15827];[15825];dan14_mdroid;NM14ABAHLA01005_.mp3
The injustices the Sandrals have committed against the Matales are far too numerous to name, but the Council is well aware of our many disputes.;[];;[15828];[15826, 15825];dan14_mdroid;NM14ABAHLA01006_.mp3
Recently, I discovered several Sandral droids trespassing on my land.;[];;[15829, 15865];[15827];dan14_mdroid;NM14ABAHLA01007_.mp3
What were they doing here?;[];;[15830];[15828];dan14_mdroid;
I have no idea what nefarious purpose lay behind their arrival - my own assassination, perhaps. Destruction of my property. Maybe a simple spy mission. I wasn't about to find out.;[];;[15831];[15829];dan14_mdroid;NM14ABAHLA01009_.mp3

You would be willing to risk open war over this?;[];;[15846];[15844];dan14_mdroid;NM14ABAHLA01028_.mp3
It is the Sandrals who have started this. Not I.;[];;[15847];[15845];dan14_mdroid;NM14ABAHLA01029_.mp3

You can't accuse the Sandrals without proof.;[];;[15869];[15822];dan14_mdroid;

The runes here tell a fascinating tale of Ajunta Pall's life. I wonder how much of it is true?;[];the player has gotten the sword, does not have it in possession ------------------------------- Only a couple of things need to be scripted, here: 1 - the starting conditions for the first two lines. The top one (this one) checks to see if the player has gotten the sword from the spirit and doesn't have it. The second checks to see if the player has gotten the sword from the spirit and still has it. 2 - There is an End Condition off the second starting node (they all end connected to the same End Condition) which has the student leaving the valley permanently.;[];[None];kor36_sithfreed2;NM36AASITH06052_.mp3
You... you have the sword! The sword of Ajunta Pall! That's it, isn't it?! How did you ever acquire it?!;[];the player has gotten the sword, has it in possession;[15953, 15956, 15957, 15962];[None];kor36_sithfreed2;NM36AASITH06000_.mp3
That's for me to know and you to find out.;[];;[15954];[15952];kor36_sithfreed2;
Ah, yes, it's the same old story, is it? I would fight you for the sword if I could, but I am hardly that stupid. You are clearly my better in that regard.;[];;[15955];[15953, 15956];kor36_sithfreed2;NM36AASITH06003_.mp3

It doesn't matter. It's mine and you're not getting it!;[];;[15954];[15952];kor36_sithfreed2;
I got it from Ajunta himself, if you must know.;[];;[15958];[15952];kor36_sithfreed2;
Are you joking with me? The Sith Lord still lives?;[];;[15959];[15957];kor36_sithfreed2;NM36AASITH06007_.mp3
No, not exactly.;[];;[15960];[15958];kor36_sithfreed2;

Thank you for the information! I must go and inform my mentor at once of this strange news!;[];;[];[15960];kor36_sithfreed2;NM36AASITH06011_.mp3
No, this isn't the sword. You're quite mistaken.;[];;[15963];[15952];kor36_sithfreed2;

Galon Lor, at your service. Aren't these tombs fascinating? We had no idea the Sith were here so long ago.;[];;[15968, 15971, 15991];[15966];kor36_sithfreed2;NM36AASITH06019_.mp3
Why not? Aren't there records?;[];;[15969];[15967];kor36_sithfreed2;
Not from this far back. Or, at least, what records do exist are sketchy at best.;[];;[15970];[15968];kor36_sithfreed2;NM36AASITH06021_.mp3
These ruins date back to a period when the Sith were first formed, before their exile into the far reaches of space. It's quite fascinating.;[];;[15971, 15991];[15969];kor36_sithfreed2;NM36AASITH06023_.mp3
What are you doing here?;[];;[15972];[15970, 15967, 15965, 15995];kor36_sithfreed2;
I've been working on a translation of some of the runes by this tomb. I'm quite excited... this may very well be the tomb of Ajunta Pall.;[];;[15966, 15973, 15991, 15993];[15971];kor36_sithfreed2;NM36AASITH06025_.mp3
Who is Ajunta Pall?;[];;[15974];[15972];kor36_sithfreed2;
Ajunta Pall was one of the first of the great Sith Lords. He rebelled against his Jedi Masters and led the way for the rest of us that followed.;[];;[15975];[15973];kor36_sithfreed2;NM36AASITH06027_.mp3
These runes claim that he was interred here... and I wonder if his sword might not be here, as well.;[];;[15976];[15974];kor36_sithfreed2;NM36AASITH06029_.mp3
His sword?;[];;[15977];[15975];kor36_sithfreed2;
According to legend, Ajunta Pall created a sword of terrible power. Someone who located it could gain considerable prestige.;[];;[15978, 15985, 15989, 15991];[15976];kor36_sithfreed2;NM36AASITH06031_.mp3

A... few of the bolder students have tried. They did not return. As I understand it, the tombs are quite dangerous.;[{'Galon Lor': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[15980, 15983, 15985, 15989, 15991];[15978];kor36_sithfreed2;NM36AASITH06035_.mp3
What makes the tombs so dangerous?;[];;[15981];[15979, 15988, 15986];kor36_sithfreed2;
From what I've been told, the tombs have old traps and machines that are still active. They were designed to keep out intruders when they were made and still do.;[];;[15982];[15980];kor36_sithfreed2;NM36AASITH06037_.mp3
I suppose if the academy wanted to make a concerted effort, the tomb would be opened... but I think Master Uthar prefers to keep it as a challenge for the students.;[{'Galon Lor': 'Persuade'}];;[15983, 15985, 15989, 15991];[15981];kor36_sithfreed2;NM36AASITH06039_.mp3
What do you know about the sword's powers?;[];;[15984];[15982, 15988, 15990, 15986, 15979];kor36_sithfreed2;
Nothing at all. The legends don't say anything about it... it may have had powers only for Ajunta alone.;[];;[15978, 15985, 15991];[15983];kor36_sithfreed2;NM36AASITH06047_.mp3
Why don't you go in, then?;[];;[15986];[15984, 15990, 15982, 15979, 15977, 15994];kor36_sithfreed2;
Oh, these tombs are certainly not harmless. Don't think that. The sword may be tempting, but I'm not about to risk my life to find it.;[];;[15978, 15980, 15983, 15987, 15989, 15991];[15985];kor36_sithfreed2;NM36AASITH06041_.mp3
Are you a coward, then?;[];;[15988];[15986];kor36_sithfreed2;
N-no. I want power as much as the next person, but I'm not stupid. I know what I'm capable of.;[];;[15978, 15980, 15983, 15989, 15991];[15987];kor36_sithfreed2;NM36AASITH06043_.mp3

Certainly. Finding such an artifact and giving it to Master Uthar would earn anyone big points. Although I suppose you could also keep it...;[];;[15978, 15983, 15985, 15991];[15989];kor36_sithfreed2;NM36AASITH06045_.mp3

Of course. Don't let me keep you from your business.;[];;[];[15991];kor36_sithfreed2;NM36AASITH06049_.mp3
You think his sword might be here?;[];;[15994];[15972];kor36_sithfreed2;
The runes say that he was interred here, so I think it may indeed be possible. Whoever found the sword could gain great prestige.;[];;[15978, 15985, 15989, 15991];[15993];kor36_sithfreed2;NM36AASITH06033_.mp3

I am <FullName>. What are you Selkath doing inside the Sith embassy?;[];;[16001];[15999];man27_shasa;
The Sith are teaching us mastery of the Force. Our alliance with the Sith will bring strength to Manaan and the Selkath people!;[];;[16002, 16008, 16054, 16058];[16000, 16068];man27_shasa;
The Sith are lying to you. I know. I used to be one of them.;[];;[16003];[16001];man27_shasa;
You were one of the Sith? I don't believe you.;[];;[16004, 16008, 16054];[16002];man27_shasa;
I was Darth Revan, once. Before my identity was wiped away.;[];;[16005];[16003];man27_shasa;
Darth Revan? Really? Let me guess - now you just happen to be on a mission to save the galaxy to atone for your past crimes, right?;[];;[16006, 16065];[16004];man27_shasa;
Something like that, yeah.;[];;[16007];[16005];man27_shasa;
We are not fools, we will not fall for your Republic lies! The Sith have promised to give us the secrets we need to master the Force.;[];;[16008, 16054];[16006, 16065];man27_shasa;
The Sith are evil! What they told you was a lie.;[];;[16009];[16007, 16003, 16001];man27_shasa;
Republic propaganda. The Sith are the victims of lies and half truths! They are not monsters - no more so than the Republic.;[];;[16010];[16008];man27_shasa;
The Sith have promised to guide us in the use of the Force, as a sign of their good faith. And once the Republic is defeated, the Sith have promised to withdraw from Manaan and respect our independence.;[];;[16011, 16054, 16057, 16058];[16009];man27_shasa;
If the Republic is defeated, the Sith will enslave your planet!;[];;[16012];[16010];man27_shasa;
Spare us your lies! The Sith have treated us with nothing but respect and honor!;[];;[16013];[16011, 16057];man27_shasa;
You speak as if we are prisoners here, but we can leave whenever we wish! Our friend Galas chose to leave, and he was returned safely to his home in Ahto City.;[];;[16014];[16012];man27_shasa;
Shasa, what if they speak the truth? Remember what happened at Taris...;[];;[16015, 16016];[16013];man27_shasa;

Taris is nothing but a Republic lie! If the Sith are such monsters, then prove it to us. Surely there must be some evidence of the horrors they commit!;[];;[16017, 16019, 16034, 16054, 16056];[16015, 16014];man27_shasa;
The Sith are evil, Shasa. They only want Manaan's kolto.;[];;[16018];[16016];man27_shasa;
So you say. But why should we believe you? We need physical proof, not the words of some Republic sympathizer.;[];;[16019, 16034, 16041, 16048, 16054];[16017, 16056];man27_shasa;
I found a young Selkath dying from torture here. He gave me this...;[];;[16020];[16018, 16047, 16016, 16071];man27_shasa;
Shasa - this is the pin I gave Galas when we were children. There is blood on it.;[];;[16021];[16019];man27_shasa;

Those Echani mercs sure travel light. Look at that one over there - nothing but a couple vibroblades and a pair of light blasters on his belt.;[];random 2 before hrakert solved;[16159];[None];man26_merc1;NM26AAMERC08012_.mp3
But I've seen his kind in action - they hit hard and fast. And you never have to worry about a double cross with the Echani. I'd rather stand with them then against them in any fight, that's for sure.;[];;[];[16158];man26_merc1;NM26AAMERC08014_.mp3

I hear if they go too long between battles, they'll start killing each other just to pass the time. If even half the stories I've heard are true...;[];;[16162];[16160];man26_merc1;NM26AAMERC08018_.mp3

Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the winner of this year's swoop race!;[];cut scene runs after PC wins swoop race it leads to Bastila freeing herself everyone attacks Bastila must be invulnerable When battle is over she will initiate dialog with player wild cheering as PC walks to the stand on this dialog node;[16166];[None];tar03_brejik031;
Put your hands together and show your appreciation for one of the most daring riders this swoop track has ever seen!;[];;[16167, 16183];[16165];tar03_brejik031;
And here to present the champion's prize is the leader of the Black Vulkars himself - Brejik!;[];Brejik approaches amid a mixture of cheers and boos;[16168];[16166];tar03_brejik031;
I, Brejik - leader of the Black Vulkars - am honored to award the victory prize to one of my own, once again proving the Vulkars are the premier gang of Taris!;[];;[16169];[16167];tar03_brejik031;NM03AFBREJ04006_.mp3
Well done - through your skill and courage you have proven yourself the premier swoop rider and brought great glory to the Black Vulkars!;[];;[16170];[16168];tar03_brejik031;NM03AFBREJ04008_.mp3
That's why it is with the greatest sadness that I have to inform you of a slight change in the prize I am offering for your victory.;[];;[16171, 16181, 16182];[16169];tar03_brejik031;NM03AFBREJ04010_.mp3
What are you talking about?;[];;[16172];[16170];tar03_brejik031;
When you hear what I have to say you'll understand. It seems the woman I offered up as a prize is more than just a Republic officer - she's actually a Jedi!;[];;[16173];[16171, 16181, 16182];tar03_brejik031;NM03AFBREJ04012_.mp3
I've had to equip her with a neural disruptor collar to keep her mind in a state of unfocused confusion just to make sure she doesn't use her Force powers to escape.;[];;[16174];[16172];tar03_brejik031;NM03AFBREJ04014_.mp3
Obviously, I can't turn her over to you - it would be far too dangerous to have a Jedi as a slave. But rest assured, I'll find some other way to compensate you for your victory.;[];;[16175];[16173];tar03_brejik031;NM03AFBREJ04016_.mp3
You can't do this, Brejik! You know the rules: nobody's allowed to withdraw a victory prize after the race. It goes against all our most sacred traditions!;[];;[16176];[16174, 16187];tar03_brejik031;
You old fool! Your traditions are nothing to me - I am the wave of the future! If I want to withdraw the prize and sell this woman on the slave market myself, nobody can stop me!;[{'Bastilla03': 'Pause'}];;[16177];[16175];tar03_brejik031;NM03AFBREJ04020_.mp3
I might have something to say about that, Brejik!;[{'Bastilla03': 'Pause'}];;[16178];[16176];tar03_brejik031;NM03AFBREJ04022_.mp3
What? Impossible! You were restrained by a neural disruptor! How could you have possibly summoned the will to free yourself?;[];;[16179];[16177];tar03_brejik031;NM03AFBREJ04024_.mp3
You underestimate the strength of a Jedi's mind, Brejik - a mistake you won't live to regret!;[{'Bastilla03': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[16180];[16178];tar03_brejik031;NM03AFBREJ04026_.mp3
Vulkars - to me! Kill this woman! Kill the swoop rider! Kill them all!;[{'Brejik031': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[];[16179];tar03_brejik031;NM03AFBREJ04028_.mp3
You better not be trying to cheat me, Brejik!;[];;[16172];[16170, 16185];tar03_brejik031;
Save it, Brejik - just hand over Bastila!;[];;[16172];[16170];tar03_brejik031;
Through your skill and courage you have proven yourself the premier swoop rider on Taris, and brought great glory to the Hidden Bek gang!;[];;[16184];[16166];tar03_brejik031;
Now, here to present the champion's prize: Brejik, leader of the Black Vulkars.;[];;[16185];[16183];tar03_brejik031;
People - hear me! Before I present the so called champion of the Beks with their prize there is something you must know: the winning rider cheated!;[];;[16181, 16186];[16184];tar03_brejik031;NM03AFBREJ04036_.mp3
You're a damn liar, Brejik!;[];;[16187];[16185];tar03_brejik031;
Your swoop bike was using a prototype accelerator - clearly an unfair advantage! Because of this Hidden Bek treachery I'm withdrawing the Vulkar's share of the victory prize!;[];;[16175];[16186];tar03_brejik031;NM03AFBREJ04038_.mp3

Yes. Can you help me?;[];;[16195];[16193, 16191];kor35_sithteach1;
Do you know of our renegade students?;[];;[16196, 16202];[16194];kor35_sithteach1;NM35AASITH16010_.mp3
No. I don't know what you're talking about.;[];;[16197];[16195];kor35_sithteach1;
Ah. Let me tell you what I can, then.;[];;[16198];[16196];kor35_sithteach1;NM35AASITH16012_.mp3
A group of students were ordered to perform executions on civilians within the colony. They refused to carry out the orders.;[];;[16199];[16197];kor35_sithteach1;NM35AASITH16014_.mp3
Master Uthar naturally ordered them killed... but they fled before this could take place. If one could carry out Uthar's order, it would be worth considerable prestige.;[];;[16200];[16198];kor35_sithteach1;NM35AASITH16016_.mp3
There are five of them, if I remember... and they cannot be far, as they have no method to leave the planet. Likely hiding in the hills on the surface.;[];;[16201];[16199];kor35_sithteach1;NM35AASITH16018_.mp3
Now if you will excuse me, I must return to my studies.;[];;[];[16200, 16204];kor35_sithteach1;NM35AASITH16025_.mp3
The students who refused to kill for Master Uthar?;[];;[16203];[16195];kor35_sithteach1;
Those are the ones. It seems you have already heard of them.;[];;[16204];[16202];kor35_sithteach1;NM35AASITH16021_.mp3
There is little more I can tell you, then. Should you locate their hiding place, you would gain considerable prestige, I am sure.;[];;[16201];[16203];kor35_sithteach1;NM35AASITH16023_.mp3

I would like to know more about your functionality.;[];;[16222];[16220];k_hhkd_dialog;
Statement: I know some elements of my functionality, master, but not all.;[];;[16223, 16228, 16471, 16488];[16221];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07008_.mp3
I thought you said that removing your restraining bolt would restore your memory?;[];;[16224];[16222];k_hhkd_dialog;
Qualification: I suspected that it might, master. But without memory, I had no way of knowing whether or not I knew that was true.;[];;[16225];[16223];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07010_.mp3
So you lied to me.;[];;[16226];[16224];k_hhkd_dialog;
Qualification: Err... not so much, master. I spoke out of ignorance. I assumed the Ithorian was responsible for my memory loss.;[];;[16227];[16225];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07012_.mp3
That does not mean I am not a fully loyal droid willing to serve its master. Right... master?;[];;[16228, 16471, 16488];[16226];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07013_.mp3
How can you not know parts of your functionality?;[];;[16229];[16227, 16489, 16222];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: There have been numerous repairs and tampering made to my system, master. Several systems are not operating as they should be.;[];;[16230];[16228];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07015_.mp3
The fact that my memory is incomplete may be due to meatbag incompetence... or something else I am unaware of.;[];;[16231, 16471, 16488];[16229];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07016_.mp3
Is there any way to repair you?;[];;[16232];[16230, 16481, 16485, 16487, 16489];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: Some of my motor functions can be safely repaired, master... but anything in relation to my memory core is extremely sensitive.;[];;[16233];[16231];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07038_.mp3
I have safeguards installed to protect that core that I cannot de-activate. It is not impossible that other, lesser, memory functions could be restored, however.;[];;[16234];[16232];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07039_.mp3
So I can restore your memory?;[];;[16235];[16233];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: You may attempt to restore portions of my deleted memory, master, but some skill at repair is required.;[];;[16236];[16234];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07041_.mp3
The deeper functions of my core memory, however, would still be unadvisable to tamper with.;[];;[16237];[16235];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07042_.mp3
Conjecture: It is possible that some external stimulus might result in the memory core being reactivated... but I am unaware of any program existence to do so.;[];;[16238, 16469, 16471, 16482];[16236];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07043_.mp3
So you're saying that your memory might just... come back?;[];;[16239];[16237, 16470];k_hhkd_dialog;
Conjecture: There may be hidden programming that awaits certain conditions to reactivate my memory core, master... but there is no way to know.;[];;[16240];[16238];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07045_.mp3
It is quite possible that tampering has simply erased my core permanently. If that is so, a meatbag will surely pay!;[];;[16241, 16469, 16471, 16482];[16239];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07046_.mp3
I would like to try restoring some of your memory.;[];;[16242, 16245, 16248];[16240, 16470, 16220];k_hhkd_dialog;
Commentary: That is unnecessary now, master. I have been returned to you and my memory core is now fully functional.;[];;[16243];[16241];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07203_.mp3
Statement: My functionality has now been fully restored, master. I exist to serve Revan as your personal battle droid.;[];;[16244];[16242];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07006_.mp3
In time, my assassination protocol can be restored... and at that point I will once again endeavour to eliminate any meatbag opposition you may have.;[];;[];[16243];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07007_.mp3
Negatory: I believe that there are no further deleted memories which can be safely retrieved, master. All earlier memories reside in my core.;[];;[16246];[16241];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07204_.mp3
Those are protected by my safeguards and would be far too dangerous to access.;[];;[16247];[16245];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07205_.mp3
The only way those memories could be obtained is through the proper stimulus... whatever that might be. I am sorry, master.;[];;[];[16246];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07206_.mp3
Affirmative: If you believe your skills are up to the task, master, then I can certainly guide you through the process.;[];;[16249];[16241];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07207_.mp3
Request: I only ask that you be oh so very careful, master. I am too valuable and well-crafted to perish at the hands of ineptitude.;[];;[16250, 16254, 16468];[16248];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07208_.mp3
Are you implying I am inept?;[];;[16251];[16249];k_hhkd_dialog;
Negatory: Err... no, master. You are not a droid, however, and therefore your skills *are* limited by the physical capabilities of your meatbag extremities. Or somesuch.;[];;[16252, 16254, 16468];[16250];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07210_.mp3
I happen to be very good at what I do.;[];;[16253];[16251];k_hhkd_dialog;
Appeasement: Yes, master. Of course, master. Could we begin?;[];;[16254, 16468];[16252];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07212_.mp3
Let's get started.;[];;[16255, 16459];[16253, 16251, 16249];k_hhkd_dialog;
[Repair] Statement: As you wish, master. The first stage is the simple one, and that is accessing my central control cluster. This may take awhile. First you will need to open three panels...;[];;[16256, 16456, 16460, 16461, 16462, 16463, 16464, 16465];[16254, 16458];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07214_.mp3
[Success] ...and now re-wire the last three relays... yes, good. Well done, master. I believe your operation was a success. Accessing new memory...;[];;[16257, 16317, 16365, 16411];[16255, 16459];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07215_.mp3
Access complete: I have restored a great deal of information about my previous owner, master. Would you like to hear it?;[];;[16258];[16256];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07216_.mp3
Yes, let me hear it.;[];;[16259];[16257];k_hhkd_dialog;
Recitation: The earliest memory of my last owner specifies that he was human, a low-ranking commercial officer for Systech Corporation.;[];;[16260];[16258];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07218_.mp3
I am unaware of his designation. He puchased me from an acquaintance I cannot identify, for the purposes of protocol and bodyguard duties.;[];;[16261, 16313, 16315];[16259];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07219_.mp3
Why can't you identify his acquaintance?;[];;[16262];[16260, 16314, 16316];k_hhkd_dialog;
Explanation: That previous owner is part of memories that are still deleted, master. It is customary for a droid's memory to be wiped when it is sold.;[];;[16263, 16313, 16315];[16261];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07221_.mp3
This man... is he still alive?;[];;[16264];[16262, 16314, 16316];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: Negative, master. The human was terminated by this HK-47 unit prior to system shut-down.;[];;[16265, 16312];[16263];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07223_.mp3
You killed your own master?;[];;[16266];[16264];k_hhkd_dialog;
Affirmative, master, though I had not been programmed to do so. The human's termination was accidental.;[];;[16267];[16265];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07225_.mp3
Explanation: My former master had owned me for a duration of two standard months before discovering my assassination protocol. He was pleased by the discovery.;[];;[16268];[16266, 16312];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07227_.mp3
The human informed me that a competitor corporation was preparing to market a product that would ruin him personally. He was most agitated.;[];;[16269];[16267];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07228_.mp3
He activated my assassination protocol and instructed me to kill all those responsible for the competing product. I proceeded to carry out my order.;[];;[16270, 16311];[16268];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07229_.mp3
Wait... tell me about this assassination protocol.;[];;[16271];[16269];k_hhkd_dialog;
Information: This HK-47 unit is complete with a protocol that, when invoked, will set me to independently carry out a termination.;[];;[16272];[16270];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07231_.mp3
I will go to whatever lengths, travel whatever distances are required, to complete the termination. This is the reason for my combat skills.;[];;[16273];[16271];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07232_.mp3
Advisement: Unfortunately, the assassination protocol is currently non-functional. You will not be able to activate it.;[];;[16274];[16272];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07233_.mp3
Why not?;[];;[16275];[16273, 16502, 16512];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: several of my actuators were damaged by my former owner. They cannot be repaired, master, sad though that is.;[];;[16276];[16274];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07235_.mp3
My former master was unaware of this, but the competitor was in fact an arm of Systech Corporation, my master's own employer.;[];;[16277];[16275, 16311];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07237_.mp3
It did not take long for my master to realize his mistake. By then, I had already terminated 104 corporate officers.;[];;[16278, 16307, 16309];[16276];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07238_.mp3
So he set you upon his own company?;[];;[16279];[16277];k_hhkd_dialog;
Observation: While it may have been unintentional, my master's wording of his orders left little room for me. Systech was responsible for the product, after all.;[];;[16280];[16278];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07240_.mp3
I do not know why my master was so upset, really. He was an officer of Systech and a potential target, but I cannot terminate my own master.;[];;[16281];[16279, 16308, 16310];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07245_.mp3
I would assume that being the sole officer remaining, he would surely be promoted. Instead, however, the human chose to go insane with rage and attack me.;[];;[16282];[16280];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07246_.mp3
And that's when you killed him?;[];;[16283];[16281];k_hhkd_dialog;
Objection: Naturally not, master! As I said, I am incapable of purposefully terminating my owner. That would not be allowed.;[];;[16284];[16282];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07248_.mp3
My master was not a smart man, however. While he was screaming and stabbing me with a writing utensil, he managed to pierce one of my actuators.;[];;[16285];[16283];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07249_.mp3
The resulting shock terminated him and, sadly, destroyed my assassination protocol. Pure luck on his part, I suspect.;[];;[16286, 16303, 16305];[16284];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07250_.mp3
I don't think he was as lucky as you think.;[];;[16287];[16285];k_hhkd_dialog;
Query: Do you know what the chances are of puncturing that sole actuator? I would have congratulated my master were he not sizzling and incoherent at the time.;[];;[16288];[16286];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07252_.mp3
I shut down immediately whenever my master dies. I can only assume that while I was shut down Systech was dismantled and I was auctioned off as former corporate property.;[];;[16289];[16287, 16304, 16306];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07257_.mp3
Observation: No doubt my sale price was quite cheap, leading to Yuka Laka's purchase. How very demeaning.;[];;[16290, 16297, 16299, 16301];[16288];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07258_.mp3
Didn't they know what you had done?;[];;[16291];[16289, 16298, 16300, 16302];k_hhkd_dialog;
Statement: How could they? The vast majority of the officers had already been terminated. They likely assumed I was mere... chattel.;[];;[16292, 16297, 16299, 16301];[16290];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07260_.mp3
Did you recover any other memories?;[];;[16293];[16291, 16298, 16300, 16302];k_hhkd_dialog;
I have recovered knowledge of some other actuators which will enhance my performance, master. I will activate them now.;[];;[16294];[16292];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07262_.mp3
But as for my own history... negative. It will require further effort on your part to restore them, if you wish... though certain stimuli could always restore my core, still, as I explained.;[];;[16295];[16293];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07263_.mp3
For now, please excuse me, master. I wish to meditate upon the face of my former meatbag master as he was electrocuted. I find it most soothing.;[];;[16296];[16294];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07264_.mp3
[Because of your repairs, HK-47 now has a permanent bonus of +2 to his dexterity.];[];;[];[16295];k_hhkd_dialog;
What a horrible story!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[16298];[16291, 16300, 16302, 16289];k_hhkd_dialog;
Statement: That hurts, master. This is my life you are talking about.;[];;[16290, 16292, 16299, 16301];[16297];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07266_.mp3
I'm just glad I acquired you myself.;[];;[16300];[16298, 16302, 16291, 16289];k_hhkd_dialog;
Observation: So am I, master, though I apologize for not having an assassination mode to offer you.;[];;[16290, 16292, 16297, 16301];[16299];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07268_.mp3
Are you sure this actuator can't be fixed?;[];;[16302];[16300, 16298, 16291, 16289];k_hhkd_dialog;
Assessment: I do not believe so, master. It would require complete dismantlement of my chassis... a most involved procedure.;[];;[16290, 16292, 16297, 16299];[16301];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07270_.mp3
So you destroyed his life and then killed him, basically.;[];;[16304];[16285];k_hhkd_dialog;
Observation: Effectively, yes. This is a most pleasing memory, master. Thank you for recovering it.;[];;[16288];[16303];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07254_.mp3
Well, it *was* his own fault.;[];;[16306];[16285];k_hhkd_dialog;
Statement: I was only doing as I was told, master. I would have told the human the proper codes to deactivate my protocol, had he asked.;[];;[16288];[16305];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07256_.mp3
Why didn't he just deactivate you?;[];;[16308];[16277];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: I was not present to be deactivated, master. Part of my protocol is not to return to my master until my function is complete. I still had 15 officers to go.;[];;[16280];[16307];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07242_.mp3
You killed 104 people?!;[];;[16310];[16277];k_hhkd_dialog;
Statement: It was nothing, really, master. The majority of them were not even expecting it, and I move very quickly.;[];;[16280];[16309];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07244_.mp3
And how did that result in his death?;[];;[16276];[16269];k_hhkd_dialog;
Why? What happened?;[];;[16267];[16264];k_hhkd_dialog;
This man needed a bodyguard?;[];;[16314];[16262, 16316, 16260];k_hhkd_dialog;
Observation: Not that I could perceive, master. The human believed that accompaniment by a bodyguard droid would increase his importance in the perception of others.;[];;[16261, 16263, 16315];[16313];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07272_.mp3
You mentioned this Systech Corporation when I purchased you.;[];;[16316];[16314, 16262, 16260];k_hhkd_dialog;
Explanation: Affirmative, master. I had assumed that my previous owner was the corporation, itself. This is not the case. The human purchased me privately.;[];;[16261, 16263, 16313];[16315];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07274_.mp3
Access complete: I have recovered information on my owner previous to the commercial officer, master. Intriguing.;[];;[16318];[16256];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07275_.mp3
What's so intriguing?;[];;[16319];[16317];k_hhkd_dialog;
Statement: It appears that my previous owner was a human senator on the planet Coruscant. A man of importance who obviously appreciated quality craftsmanship.;[];;[16320, 16361, 16363];[16318];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07277_.mp3
And how did he get ahold of you?;[];;[16321];[16319];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: I am unsure, master. Any knowledge of my owner prior to him is still deleted. The senator did assume I was a protocol droid, however.;[];;[16322];[16320];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07279_.mp3
I do remember that I was very pleased to be the property of a senator. One of his assistants discovered my assassination functions later through questioning.;[];;[16323];[16321, 16362, 16364];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07284_.mp3
The assistant was quite alarmed and told the senator I should be scrapped quickly to avoid a scandal. Naturally the senator had me eliminate the fool.;[];;[16324, 16357, 16359];[16322];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07285_.mp3
So we're not talking about a nice senator, I see.;[];;[16325];[16323];k_hhkd_dialog;
Observation: Senators are not nice, master. They are either on top of the game or yesterday's news. My master told me that frequently, you see.;[];;[16326];[16324];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07287_.mp3
I was most proud to have partaken in the political system of the galaxy. During the time my owner possessed me, he gained significant rank.;[];;[16327];[16325, 16358, 16360];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07292_.mp3
Given time, I believe he could have become Chancellor. I even eliminated a few key opponents that he did not ask for... freebies, if you will.;[];;[16328, 16353, 16356];[16326];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07293_.mp3
You can do that?;[];;[16329];[16327];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: Certainly. Why not? I am an intelligent droid, you know. I see an opportunity and I take it... and my master was most pleased with my work.;[];;[16330];[16328];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07295_.mp3
Observation: I think he would have done far better had he not allowed his use of me to become personal. He set me on his wife.;[];;[16331];[16329, 16355];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07296_.mp3
And why would he do that?;[];;[16332];[16330];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: I am unsure. The human was most agitated and angry. I believe his wife had done something that had displeased him greatly.;[];;[16333];[16331];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07298_.mp3
I was to go to their summer estate and terminate his wife... along with whatever male companion I discovered there.;[];;[16334, 16350, 16352];[16332];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07299_.mp3
So his wife was cheating on him.;[];;[16335];[16333];k_hhkd_dialog;
Statement: I have no idea, master. Cheating seems to be a relevant term only when one is caught in the act. Otherwise it is viewed as intelligence, no?;[];;[16336];[16334];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07301_.mp3
I journeyed to the southern continent, but it appeared my master was not far behind me. Apparently he regretted his activation of the protocol.;[];;[16337];[16335, 16351, 16352];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07305_.mp3
When I found the wife and her companion, I proceeded to launch my attack... but my master interposed his own body and was destroyed.;[];;[16338];[16336];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07306_.mp3
It was rather a strange meatbag thing to do, do you not agree? Naturally I shut myself down, my master being terminated.;[];;[16339, 16341, 16348];[16337];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07307_.mp3
So that's two out of two masters killed.;[];;[16340];[16338, 16342, 16349];k_hhkd_dialog;
Observation: Only so far, master. There are still more memories not recovered, remember?;[];;[16341, 16343, 16348];[16339];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07309_.mp3
What happened to you then?;[];;[16342];[16340, 16349, 16338];k_hhkd_dialog;
Statement: I believe the senator's wife was unsure what I was or what to do with me. It was she who sold me to the corporate officer, an acquaintance.;[];;[16339, 16343, 16348];[16341];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07315_.mp3
Have you recovered any other memories?;[];;[16344];[16342, 16349, 16340];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: As previously, I have found a few more programs which will enhance my performance. A most gratifying discovery, in fact.;[];;[16345];[16343];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07311_.mp3
There is still nothing from previous memories uncovered. You will have to operate again if you desire to find them.;[];;[16346];[16344];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07312_.mp3
With luck, I will discover the stimulus to unlock my core and all this will be unnecessary. I do thank you for the attempt, however, master.;[];;[16347];[16345];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07313_.mp3
[Because of your repairs, HK-47 now has a permanent bonus of +2 to his defense rating, in addition to the +2 dexterity bonus from your earlier repairs.];[];;[];[16346];k_hhkd_dialog;
Well, it appeared he got a conscience at the end.;[];;[16349];[16342, 16340, 16338];k_hhkd_dialog;
Observation: I find that unlikely. Perhaps he was more concerned that the death of his wife would be more likely traced back to him.;[];;[16339, 16341, 16343];[16348];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07317_.mp3
So you just kill anyone you're told?;[];;[16351];[16333];k_hhkd_dialog;
Observation: I *am* a droid, master, with programming. Even if I did not enjoy killing, I would have no choice. Thankfully I enjoy it very much.;[];;[16336];[16350];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07303_.mp3
And did you?;[];;[16336];[16333];k_hhkd_dialog;
So he just killed all his opponents?;[];;[16354];[16327];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: There are a *lot* of politicians on Coruscant, master. I could spend decades slaughtering them and still not make a dent.;[];;[16355];[16353, 16356];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07319_.mp3
And it is not as if I walked into the Senate chambers with a carbonite explosive. I was very discrete. My best work to date... that I can remember.;[];;[16330];[16354];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07320_.mp3
And nobody figured out what he was up to?;[];;[16354];[16327];k_hhkd_dialog;
Sounds like my kind of guy.;[];;[16358];[16323];k_hhkd_dialog;
Observation: I rather liked the human, myself. For a meatbag, his priorities were in the right place. I felt most useful.;[];;[16326];[16357];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07289_.mp3
I hope this man is dead, right?;[];;[16360];[16323];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: Unfortunately so, master. While he lived, however, I maintained a most useful existence.;[];;[16326];[16359];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07291_.mp3
Did this senator know about your assassination function?;[];;[16362];[16319];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: It does not seem so, master, no. He required a protocol droid only and wanted one as cheaply as possible. I do not know who sold me to him.;[];;[16322];[16361];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07281_.mp3
It seems you've been around, HK.;[];;[16364];[16319];k_hhkd_dialog;
Observation: It does seem that way, does it not? I can still remember all the glittering lights of Coruscant. Very pretty. Can we go back there, master?;[];;[16322];[16363];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07283_.mp3
Access complete: I have accessed information on my owner prior to the senator, master. Most... unexpected.;[];;[16366];[16256];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07322_.mp3
What now?;[];;[16367];[16365];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: It appears that previous to my ownership by the senator, I was the property of one Bochaba the Hutt on the planet Sleheyron.;[];;[16368, 16407, 16409];[16366];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07324_.mp3
And what gruesome fate awaited him?;[];;[16369];[16367];k_hhkd_dialog;
Objection: That is unfair, master. While Bochaba may have died gruesomely, I most certainly had nothing to do with it. Well... very little.;[];;[16370];[16368];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07326_.mp3
Hmm. My memories tell me that, for a time, Bochaba was one of the most feared gangsters on Sleheyron. I helped him with this reputation greatly.;[];;[16371];[16369, 16408, 16410];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07331_.mp3
Over a span of one year, I terminated a grand total of 322 sentient meatbags. These contracts made Bochoba very wealthy.;[];;[16372, 16401, 16404];[16370];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07332_.mp3
And so what happened to stop that?;[];;[16373];[16371];k_hhkd_dialog;
It was unfortunate but inevitable that eventually Bochaba would overstep his bounds. I had just cleared two Hutt households when the Exchange retaliated.;[];;[16374];[16372, 16403];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07334_.mp3
Statement: I was not even present when my old master was assassinated. I did appreciate the artistry behind his demise upon my return, however.;[];;[16375, 16393, 16397];[16373];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07335_.mp3
Why? How was he killed?;[];;[16376];[16374];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: Allow me to say that I have little doubt that residents of that sector were fishing pieces of Bochaba out of their soup for weeks afterward.;[];;[16377];[16375];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07337_.mp3
At any rate, I quickly shut down upon my master's death. The rival Hutt claimed me along with my master's other possessions.;[];;[16378];[16376, 16396, 16400];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07346_.mp3
Observation: If that Hutt had only known my true function, he surely would not have sold me to a senator he bribed regularly.;[];;[16379, 16381, 16388];[16377];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07347_.mp3
You would have preferred to stay on Sleheyron?;[];;[16380];[16378, 16382, 16392];k_hhkd_dialog;
Observation: It would have suited my character, master. I have enjoyed my existence since, more or less, so I do not miss it.;[];;[16381, 16383, 16388];[16379];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07349_.mp3
You would have been found out eventually.;[];;[16382];[16380, 16392, 16378];k_hhkd_dialog;
Observation: No doubt, master. It would have been a glorious battle to end my existence with. I would prefer that to rusting on a junk heap.;[];;[16379, 16383, 16388];[16381];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07355_.mp3
Do you remember anything else?;[];;[16384];[16382, 16392, 16380];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: Negative, master. There is still more memory that can be restored, however, if you wish to try.;[];;[16385];[16383];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07351_.mp3
As well, I believe I can restore several programs the Hutt installed to improve my performance. Yesss... they are now active.;[];;[16386];[16384];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07352_.mp3
Contemplative: I wonder how many more dead masters I might have out there. A droid can live for a long time, you know.;[];;[16387];[16385];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07353_.mp3
[Because of your repairs, HK-47 will now regenerate at a rate of 1 vitality point every 6 seconds, in addition to his other abilities.];[];;[];[16386];k_hhkd_dialog;
I should dismantle you!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[16389];[16382, 16380, 16378];k_hhkd_dialog;
Supplication: Please, master, have I not pleased you? I cannot control the acts I have performed... perhaps that is why memory is erased?;[{'HK-47': 'Talk_Pleading'}];;[16390];[16388];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07357_.mp3
At any rate, I act only as you instruct me... even if that means being... *gulp* ...non-violent.;[];;[16391];[16389];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07358_.mp3
How very self-sacrificing of you.;[];;[16392];[16390];k_hhkd_dialog;
Affirmation: HK-47 exists only to serve, master.;[{'HK-47': 'Salute'}];;[16379, 16381, 16383];[16391];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07360_.mp3
That's terrible. You don't even mourn your master?;[];;[16394];[16374];k_hhkd_dialog;
Observation: According to your own meatbag values, was my master not a heartless gangster and murderer? I will mourn you when you perish, master.;[];;[16395];[16393];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07339_.mp3
When I perish?;[];;[16396];[16394];k_hhkd_dialog;
Amendment: *If* you perish. So far I am three out of three, remember, through little fault of my own.;[];;[16377];[16395];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07341_.mp3
So another master gone because of you.;[];;[16398];[16374];k_hhkd_dialog;
Observation: Indeed. Perhaps it is better that my assassination function is inoperable, master, yes?;[];;[16399];[16397];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07343_.mp3
No doubt.;[];;[16400];[16398];k_hhkd_dialog;
I am like a veritable fable, warning against the karma caused by murdering others. A morality tale, if you will. What utter irony.;[];;[16377];[16399];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07345_.mp3
You sound proud of that carnage.;[];;[16402];[16371];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: That is correct, master. I do enjoy my work, though my past owners have enjoyed utilizing my functions far more.;[];;[16403];[16401, 16406];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07365_.mp3
Strictly speaking, one meatbag is the same as another. Anything I do is in support of my master.;[];;[16373];[16402];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07366_.mp3
Don't you care about all those lives lost?;[];;[16405];[16371];k_hhkd_dialog;
Statement: Should I, master? I had no reason to terminate those targets, it was not my decision. I am the weapon, not the wielder.;[];;[16406];[16404];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07363_.mp3
But you *have* killed on your own accord before.;[];;[16402];[16405];k_hhkd_dialog;
So you were a gangster's assassin droid?;[];;[16408];[16367];k_hhkd_dialog;
Statement: So it appears, master. A rather suitable occupation, would you not agree?;[];;[16370];[16407];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07328_.mp3
That makes sense. Did the Hutts build you?;[];;[16410];[16367];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: It does not appear so. Or, at least, Bochaba was not my first owner. He purchased me from somewhere else.;[];;[16370];[16409];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07330_.mp3
Access complete: I have recovered the last of my deleted memory, master. Unfortunately, my history is still not complete.;[];;[16412];[16256];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07367_.mp3
What? Why not?;[];;[16413];[16411];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: As I did inform you, master, the majority of my memory is still locked within my core. That can only be accessed by the appropriate stimuli.;[];;[16414];[16412];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07369_.mp3
And I have no idea what that stimuli might be, unfortunately. Sadly, it seems my true origins will always be a mystery.;[];;[16415, 16418, 16423];[16413];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07370_.mp3
Are you sure your core isn't just damaged?;[];;[16416];[16414, 16422];k_hhkd_dialog;
Observation: If it was, master, your restorations will certainly have ensured that the proper stimulus restores my core's functions.;[];;[16417];[16415];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07372_.mp3
Sadly, that could have already happened and we missed it, and my core was too damaged to activate. Oh, woe is me.;[];;[16418, 16423];[16416];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07373_.mp3
You are eager to find your origins, are you?;[];;[16419];[16417, 16414];k_hhkd_dialog;
Query: Wouldn't you be, master? Here I am, surrounded by all these meatbags and all I desire is true perfection.;[];;[16420];[16418];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07375_.mp3
Surely there are more droids like me out there, or is that too much to hope?;[];;[16421];[16419];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07376_.mp3
Well...;[];;[16422];[16420];k_hhkd_dialog;
Objection: Oh, fine. Laugh at me, master. Humiliate your pet droid, go ahead.;[];;[16415, 16423];[16421];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07378_.mp3
So tell me about this last owner, then.;[];;[16424];[16422, 16417, 16414];k_hhkd_dialog;
Correction: That would actually be my first owner, master. The first I can remember.;[];;[16425];[16423];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07380_.mp3
I had completed an assassination in Mandalorian space... though I have no knowledge of what my target was or who sent me.;[];;[16426];[16424];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07381_.mp3
Regardless, my motor function had been damaged and I could not return to wherever I had been sent from. A Mandalorian soldier claimed me as 'booty', I believe.;[];;[16427];[16425];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07382_.mp3
He repaired me... poorly, I might add... and proceeded to use my assassination protocol to raise his rank.;[];;[16428, 16452, 16454];[16426];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07383_.mp3
It appears no-one could resist using your protocol.;[];;[16429];[16427];k_hhkd_dialog;
Query: Do you not have enemies that you would desire eliminated, master? If my protocol still worked, would you not use it?;[];;[16430, 16449, 16450];[16428];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07385_.mp3
No, of course not.;[];;[16431];[16429];k_hhkd_dialog;
Statement: If you say so, master.;[];;[16432];[16430, 16449];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07387_.mp3
At any rate, it seems that my Mandalorian owner finally decided to send me against Mandalore, himself. My poorest performance, sadly.;[];;[16433];[16431, 16451, 16453, 16455];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07395_.mp3
Oh? Why is that?;[];;[16434];[16432];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: I was captured by this Mandalore during the attempt. He was able to reverse my programming and send me after my own master.;[];;[16435];[16433];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07397_.mp3
It was quite distressing. There was little I could do. Needless to say, I dispatched the Mandalorian soldier efficiently.;[];;[16436];[16434];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07398_.mp3
Once I deactivated, I believe I eventually ended up on the black market and was sold to the Hutt on Sleheyron. *sigh* My darkest day.;[];;[16437, 16439, 16447];[16435];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07399_.mp3
So you killed *that* master directly.;[];;[16438];[16436, 16442, 16448];k_hhkd_dialog;
Statement: So I did. I am not very proud of that, master. The soldier seemed very startled, I must say.;[];;[16439, 16443, 16447];[16437];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07401_.mp3
You are just a traveling piece of bad luck, aren't you?;[];;[16440];[16438, 16448, 16436];k_hhkd_dialog;
Objection: That is so unfair, master! Have I not brought you a great deal of satisfaction?;[];;[16441];[16439];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07406_.mp3
You don't want to hear the answer to that.;[];;[16442];[16440];k_hhkd_dialog;
Statement: You are a very harsh master, master. I like you.;[];;[16437, 16443, 16447];[16441];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07408_.mp3
So can you remember anything else?;[];;[16444];[16442, 16448, 16438];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: There are a few Mandalorian implants that I can activate, now. They will improve my performance.;[];;[16445];[16443];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07403_.mp3
Beyond that, master, there is nothing more I can relate to you. With luck, we will discover the stimulus to unlock my core very soon.;[];;[16446];[16444];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07404_.mp3
[Because of your repairs, HK-47 will now regenerate at a rate of 1 vitality point every 3 seconds and has gained an additional +2 bonus to his dexterity.];[];;[];[16445];k_hhkd_dialog;
So you couldn't kill Mandalore, hey?;[];;[16448];[16442, 16438, 16436];k_hhkd_dialog;
Statement: With all due respect, master, he *is* the leader of the Mandalorians. Perhaps my old master was foolish to send me after him.;[];;[16437, 16439, 16443];[16447];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07410_.mp3
That's different.;[];;[16431];[16429];k_hhkd_dialog;
I suppose I would, at that.;[];;[16451];[16429];k_hhkd_dialog;
Statement: See? I provide a function that is useful to others. They merely must learn to use it properly, I believe.;[];;[16432];[16450];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07390_.mp3
So there is no way to find out who sent you there originally?;[];;[16453];[16427];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: Such knowledge is locked within my core, master, as I said. There is no way to withdraw it otherwise.;[];;[16432];[16452];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07392_.mp3
Does nobody decent ever find you?;[];;[16455];[16427];k_hhkd_dialog;
Observation: *You* found me, master. Perhaps you are simply fortunate that my assassination protocol no longer functions?;[];;[16432];[16454];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07394_.mp3
[Failure] ...no, no! What are you doing, master! That is my motor core! Stop! Ahhhh!;[{'HK-47': 'Horror'}];;[16457];[16255, 16459];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07411_.mp3
Supplication: Perhaps it would be best if you desisted your efforts for the moment, meatb-- I mean master. This seems to be going nowhere.;[];;[16458, 16466];[16456, 16460, 16461, 16462, 16463, 16464, 16465];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07418_.mp3
I want to try again.;[];;[16255, 16459];[16457];k_hhkd_dialog;
[Repair] Statement: As you wish, master. You are already familiar with accessing my central control cluster, correct? Now you will need to...;[];;[16256, 16456, 16460, 16461, 16462, 16463, 16464, 16465];[16458, 16254];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07421_.mp3
[Failure] ...err, you've shorted out something, master, but it has nothing to do with my memory. Ow! I am poking my own eye sockets! Ow! Stop!;[{'HK-47': 'Horror'}];;[16457];[16459, 16255];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07412_.mp3
[Failure] ...no, that is not it, master. No... that is not it, either. *sigh* That is a hinge, master.;[{'HK-47': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[16457];[16459, 16255];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07413_.mp3
[Failure] ...no, no, no. This is no good, master. You have nearly detonated my thermal core three times in a matter of minutes.;[{'HK-47': 'Horror'}];;[16457];[16459, 16255];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07414_.mp3
[Failure] ...aahhhh! What are you doing?! Remove the arc wrench, remove the arc wrench! Medic!;[{'Player': 'Horror'}];;[16457];[16459, 16255];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07415_.mp3
[Failure] ...but I *need* those circuits, master. Please, master... do not destroy my chips out of frustration. Calm yourself, I implore you.;[{'HK-47': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[16457];[16459, 16255];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07416_.mp3
[Failure] ...now close the last panel. Hmmm... I am afraid the operation did not succeed, master, though it was a valiant attempt for a meatbag.;[{'HK-47': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[16457];[16459, 16255];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07417_.mp3
Very well. We'll do this later.;[];;[16467];[16457];k_hhkd_dialog;
As you desire, master. I cannot help but claim a small amount of relief. Signing off.;[{'HK-47': 'Salute'}];;[];[16466, 16468];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07423_.mp3
I'll try later.;[];;[16467];[16253, 16251, 16249];k_hhkd_dialog;
So how do I go about restoring part of your memory?;[];;[16470];[16240, 16237];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: Simply tell me that you wish to make the attempt, master, and I will attempt to walk you through it. Please do be careful.;[];;[16238, 16241, 16471, 16482];[16469];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07048_.mp3
Tell me what you can, then.;[];;[16472];[16470, 16240, 16237, 16489, 16230, 16227, 16222];k_hhkd_dialog;
Observation: I am sure that you are aware of the majority of my skills, master. I can handle various sorts of heavy weaponry with ease.;[];;[16473];[16471];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07018_.mp3
My physical abilities are well-above those of your average meatbag, as are my sensor functions... an assassin if you would.;[];;[16474, 16482];[16472];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07019_.mp3
An assassin?;[];;[16475];[16473];k_hhkd_dialog;
Caution: Shhhh, master! Such a function in a droid is highly illegal.;[{'HK-47': 'Talk_Pleading'}];;[16476, 16482];[16474];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07021_.mp3
Err... I won't tell anyone.;[];;[16477];[16475];k_hhkd_dialog;
Commentary: Good, for I would truly hate to be turned into spare scrap, master. That would be a waste of my genius engineering.;[];;[16478];[16476];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07023_.mp3
Answer: My assassination functions are currently non-functional, having been de-activated by the meatbag Yuka Laka on Tatooine.;[];;[16479];[16477];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07024_.mp3
Were they functional, you as my master would be able to specify a target and I would operate independently to the best of my ability to terminate it.;[];;[16480, 16484, 16486];[16478];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07025_.mp3
Is there any way to reactive that function?;[];;[16481];[16479];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: Not that I know of, master. I still possess all my normal combat and stealth abilities, however.;[];;[16231, 16482];[16480];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07027_.mp3
Okay, that will be all.;[];;[16483];[16481, 16485, 16487, 16475, 16473, 16470, 16240, 16237];k_hhkd_dialog;
As you desire, master. Signing off.;[];;[];[16482, 16626, 16642];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07431_.mp3
Has that function been... used a lot?;[];;[16485];[16479];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: I have no way of knowing that, master. My memory has been deleted, remember?;[];;[16231, 16482];[16484];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07029_.mp3
I'm glad it's gone, really.;[];;[16487];[16479];k_hhkd_dialog;
Observation: If you say so, master. I imagine it was truly a work of art to see me in action, however.;[];;[16231, 16482];[16486];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07031_.mp3
Are you damaged?;[];;[16489];[16230, 16227, 16222];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: I believe I have been damaged several times in the past, master. I have always been repaired... but perhaps full functionality has not been restored.;[];;[16228, 16231, 16471];[16488];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07036_.mp3
You don't need to call me master, you know.;[];;[16491, 16492];[16220];k_hhkd_dialog;
Commentary: Of course I do, master. You are Revan... you are my master, the one who created me. I exist to serve.;[];;[];[16490];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07051_.mp3
Query: Don't I? I was under the assumption that organic meatbags such as yourself enjoyed such forms of address.;[];;[16493, 16526, 16605];[16490];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07052_.mp3
'Organic meatbags?';[];;[16494];[16492];k_hhkd_dialog;
Retraction: Did I say that out loud? I apologize, master. While you are a meatbag, I suppose I should not call you such.;[];;[16495, 16568, 16604];[16493];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07054_.mp3
You just called me a meatbag *again*!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[16496];[16494];k_hhkd_dialog;
Explanation: It's just that... you have all these squishy parts, master. And all that water! How the constant sloshing doesn't drive you mad, I have no idea...;[];;[16497, 16596, 16602];[16495];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07056_.mp3
Neither do I, come to think of it...;[];;[16498];[16496];k_hhkd_dialog;
Statement: Now do you understand the travails of my existence, master? Surely it does not compare to your existence, but still...;[];;[16499, 16501, 16568];[16497];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07058_.mp3
I survive. Somehow.;[];;[16500];[16498];k_hhkd_dialog;
Commentary: As do I. It is our lot in life, I suppose, master. Shall we find something to kill to cheer ourselves up?;[];;[];[16499];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07060_.mp3
*sigh* Just stop calling me master, at least.;[];;[16502];[16498, 16603];k_hhkd_dialog;
Apology: I am afraid I cannot comply with your command, master, as much as I would like to.;[];;[16274, 16503, 16526];[16501, 16555, 16578, 16595, 16605];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07102_.mp3
As much as you would like to? What does that mean?;[];;[16504];[16502];k_hhkd_dialog;
Commentary: How would you like to be the wholly-owned servant to an organic meatbag. It's demeaning! If, uh, you weren't one yourself, I mean...;[];;[16505, 16561, 16562];[16503];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07128_.mp3
Why can't you comply with my command?;[];;[16506];[16504, 16563];k_hhkd_dialog;
Explanation: Someone has hard-coded it into my system that my current master always be addressed as such.;[];;[16507, 16513, 16526];[16505];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07104_.mp3
Who did that?;[];;[16508];[16506, 16516, 16518];k_hhkd_dialog;
Conjecture: I do not know... some organic meatbag?;[];;[16509, 16513, 16519];[16507, 16558];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07106_.mp3
You don't know?;[];;[16510];[16508];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: No, master. My past memory has been almost completely erased prior to your purchase of me.;[];;[16511, 16513, 16519];[16509];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07108_.mp3
Almost completely?;[];;[16512];[16510];k_hhkd_dialog;
Observation: At certain times, power re-routing forces some memory circuits to fire that were previously deleted. I cannot control this process, however.;[];;[16274];[16511];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07110_.mp3
Well, maybe I can fix that.;[];;[16514];[16510, 16508, 16506];k_hhkd_dialog;
Objection: I would not advise that, master. There are safeguards present that... well, it should suffice to say that my systems have been altered plenty already.;[];;[16515, 16517, 16519];[16513, 16559];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07122_.mp3
Your systems have been tampered with?;[];;[16516];[16514, 16518];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: Considerably. Several of my systems do not match their imbedded parameters. I have no memory of such alterations, however, or their purpose.;[];;[16507, 16517, 16519];[16515];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07124_.mp3
What sorts of safeguards?;[];;[16518];[16516, 16514];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: electrical protection systems, mostly. They are at lethal levels, however, master... only the best for your droid.;[];;[16507, 16515, 16519];[16517];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07126_.mp3
Fine, forget it, then.;[];;[16520];[16518, 16516, 16514, 16510, 16508];k_hhkd_dialog;
Observation: I can hardly be blamed for my programming, master. Do not worry... I am still well-capable of killing most anything for you.;[];;[16521, 16523, 16525];[16519];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07117_.mp3
Oh, goody.;[];;[16522];[16520];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: Even a droid has to be allowed a little fun once in a while, master.;[];;[];[16521, 16525];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07075_.mp3
I can live with that.;[];;[16524];[16520];k_hhkd_dialog;
Commentary: That is a very clever turn of phrase, master. Your brain is very un-meatbag-like.;[];;[];[16523];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07120_.mp3
You're pretty bloodthirsty for a droid, aren't you?;[];;[16522];[16520, 16573];k_hhkd_dialog;
But I'm *not* your master.;[];;[16527];[16506, 16502, 16492];k_hhkd_dialog;
Qualification: You *are* my master, master. Did you not purchase me legitimately? Am I stolen goods? Shall I report myself to the authorities?;[];;[16528, 16555, 16556];[16526, 16561];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07138_.mp3
Whoa, slow down there. Yes, I did purchase you...;[];;[16529];[16527];k_hhkd_dialog;
Explanation: Then you qualify as my master and I must refer to you as such. The legal requirements for models of my type are very specific, master.;[];;[16530, 16554, 16555];[16528, 16560];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07140_.mp3
Models of your type? What type is that?;[];;[16531];[16529];k_hhkd_dialog;
Evasion: Oh... the illegal kind of model, master... you know...;[];;[16532];[16530];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07142_.mp3
There are legal requirements for illegal models?;[];;[16533];[16531];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: More than there are for legal models, apparently. That is meatbag logic for you.;[];;[16534, 16538, 16550];[16532];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07144_.mp3
Stop saying meatbag, already!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[16535];[16533];k_hhkd_dialog;
Apology: Sorry, master. My optical sensors simply pick up all the water sloshing about inside your flesh coating. It is... unpleasant.;[];;[16536];[16534];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07146_.mp3
That's an image I did not need.;[];;[16537];[16535];k_hhkd_dialog;
Commentary: Organic meatbags have such delicate staminas. Perhaps you should consider some cybernetic implants, master.;[];;[];[16536];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07148_.mp3
But... how can an illegal model be regulated?;[];;[16539];[16533];k_hhkd_dialog;
Query: Would you rather be caught with contraband that is *very* illegal or just a little illegal?;[];;[16540];[16538];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07150_.mp3
What's the difference?;[];;[16541];[16539];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: About 20 years, master.;[];;[16542, 16544, 16550];[16540];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07152_.mp3
Maybe we'll just keep you a little illegal, then.;[];;[16543];[16541];k_hhkd_dialog;
Agreement: This was my thought as well, master. You show excellent logical skills... for a meatbag.;[];;[];[16542];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07154_.mp3
Why all the fuss over you calling me master?;[];;[16545];[16541];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: Simply that the distinction between 'killer' and 'killee' be a clear one. I cannot kill of my own volition, naturally.;[];;[16546, 16548, 16550];[16544, 16554];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07157_.mp3
I don't think 'killee' is a word.;[];;[16547];[16545];k_hhkd_dialog;
Expletive: Damn it, master, I am an assassination droid... not a dictionary!;[{'HK-47': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[];[16546];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07159_.mp3
So... you're a blaster but I'm pulling the trigger?;[];;[16549];[16545];k_hhkd_dialog;
Commentary: A blaster is such a primitive comparison... but essentially you have it correct, yes.;[];;[16550];[16548];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07161_.mp3
And I can't ask you to break the law?;[];;[16551];[16549, 16545, 16541, 16533];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: Certainly not, master! You may not value your own existence, but I certainly do! They melt down droids that belong to criminals, you know.;[];;[16552];[16550];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07163_.mp3
So just who is the master here, then?;[];;[16553];[16551];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: Why you are, master. I thought that was obvious.;[];;[];[16552];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07165_.mp3
What legal requirements do you mean?;[];;[16545];[16529];k_hhkd_dialog;
If I'm your master, you should listen to my orders.;[];;[16502];[16529, 16527];k_hhkd_dialog;
What difference does that make?;[];;[16557];[16527];k_hhkd_dialog;
Explanation: If I was to be stolen somehow, I would be forced to turn myself into sector authorities. This programming was added to my system months ago.;[];;[16558, 16559, 16560];[16556];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07168_.mp3
Who added that to your system?;[];;[16508];[16557];k_hhkd_dialog;
Can that programming be removed?;[];;[16514];[16557];k_hhkd_dialog;
I see. I did purchase you, if you'll remember...;[];;[16529];[16557];k_hhkd_dialog;
You're not my servant!;[];;[16527];[16504];k_hhkd_dialog;
Demeaning, is it?;[];;[16563];[16504];k_hhkd_dialog;
Qualification: Err... perhaps I did not mean it *quite* like that, master. I mean... while an artificial life-form is superior...;[];;[16505, 16564, 16566];[16562];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07132_.mp3
You're not making it any better.;[];;[16565];[16563];k_hhkd_dialog;
Commentary: I mean... nice human, goo-oood human...;[];;[];[16564];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07134_.mp3
Just... stop talking.;[];;[16567];[16563];k_hhkd_dialog;
Commentary: Yes, master. Did I ever tell you how much I enjoy killing for you, master?;[];;[];[16566];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07136_.mp3
Do you want to end up in the trash heap?;[];;[16569];[16498, 16603, 16494];k_hhkd_dialog;
Objection: But Master! Am I not far too useful to be thrown aside in such a casual manner? Can I be faulted for my perfect artificial construction?;[{'HK-47': 'Talk_Pleading'}];;[16570, 16578, 16601];[16568];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07069_.mp3
Why not? I don't need a lippy droid.;[];;[16571];[16569];k_hhkd_dialog;
Analysis: Reference: 'lippy'... argumentative, disputatious, contentious, quarrelsome. What?! I must object, master, this is untrue!;[];;[16572, 16578, 16579];[16570];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07071_.mp3
Untrue? You've been lippy since I bought you.;[];;[16573];[16571];k_hhkd_dialog;
Explanation: It's my combative nature, master. I cannot help myself. I'll make it up to you... allow me to kill something in your honor!;[{'HK-47': 'Talk_Pleading'}];;[16525, 16574, 16578];[16572];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07073_.mp3
I guess you're not all bad...;[];;[16575];[16573];k_hhkd_dialog;
Observation: Neither are you, master. For an organic meatbag.;[];;[16576];[16574];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07077_.mp3
Now, listen here...;[];;[16577];[16575];k_hhkd_dialog;
Correction: Err... fluid-filled biped? Watery flesh-sentient? I'll, uh, work on it, master...;[];;[];[16576];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07079_.mp3
Fine. Just stop calling me master.;[];;[16502];[16573, 16571, 16569];k_hhkd_dialog;
What, 'meatbag' isn't considered lippy these days?;[];;[16580];[16571];k_hhkd_dialog;
Amendment: Then I will endeavour not to refer to you by your meatbag status in the future, master. Does that suffice?;[];;[16581, 16595, 16600];[16579, 16601, 16604];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07084_.mp3
No!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[16582];[16580];k_hhkd_dialog;
Query: I am confused. 'No' you do wish to be referred to as meatbag or 'no' it does not suffice?;[];;[16583, 16587, 16596];[16581];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07086_.mp3
No it does not suffice!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[16584];[16582];k_hhkd_dialog;
Observation: Well, the only other possibility is to alter your meatbag status. Are you up for an array of cybernetic implants, perhaps?;[];;[16585, 16587, 16595];[16583];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07088_.mp3
No, I am *not*.;[];;[16586];[16584];k_hhkd_dialog;
Statement: Then there is nothing I can do, master. You have my abject apologies for your condition. *sigh*;[];;[];[16585];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07090_.mp3
Are you deliberately trying to insult me?;[];;[16588];[16584, 16582];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: Deliberation implies some form of intent, master, when I am only stating a fact. Perhaps you would prefer the term liquidious fleshbag?;[];;[16589, 16595, 16596];[16587];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07092_.mp3
How about 'human'?;[];;[16590];[16588];k_hhkd_dialog;
Objection: But... but that technical term does not accurately portray the vast amount of bulbous slushiness present in your bipedal form!;[];;[16591, 16593, 16595];[16589];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07094_.mp3
Would you prefer I call you 'junk'?;[];;[16592];[16590];k_hhkd_dialog;
Resignation: *sigh* Very well, master. You are a harsh, harsh taskmaster. I like you more already.;[];;[];[16591];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07096_.mp3
You'll just have to suffer.;[];;[16594];[16590];k_hhkd_dialog;
Resignation: You have no idea, master. No idea at all. Can we please go and shoot something now?;[{'HK-47': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[];[16593];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07098_.mp3
Just... stop calling me master.;[];;[16502];[16590, 16588, 16584, 16580];k_hhkd_dialog;
Just stop talking. I give up!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[16597];[16588, 16582, 16603, 16496];k_hhkd_dialog;
Observation: Organics have no sense of persistence.;[];;[16598];[16596, 16600];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07065_.mp3
What was that?;[];;[16599];[16597];k_hhkd_dialog;
Err... ignore that, master. Obeying original command. Signing off.;[{'HK-47': 'Salute'}];;[];[16598];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07067_.mp3
Fine, fine. Whatever.;[];;[16597];[16580];k_hhkd_dialog;
I just don't appreciate being called a meatbag.;[];;[16580];[16569];k_hhkd_dialog;
You're the one who's driving me mad!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[16603];[16496];k_hhkd_dialog;
Objection: Surely not, master. I am programmed to perform all kinds of psychological assistance. Do you require some?;[];;[16501, 16568, 16596];[16602];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07063_.mp3
I would hope not!;[];;[16580];[16494];k_hhkd_dialog;
Well I don't, so stop it.;[];;[16502];[16492];k_hhkd_dialog;
So... you belonged to Revan originally?;[];;[16607];[16220];k_hhkd_dialog;
Statement: Yes, master. You created me shortly after you and your apprentice began your war to conquer the galaxy.;[];;[16608];[16606];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07173_.mp3
I was sent on an assassination mission into Mandalorian space, but I was damaged and unable to return to you.;[];;[16609];[16607];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07174_.mp3
Exclamation: I find this most distressing. I could certainly have protected you from the Jedi and your pupil's betrayal had I returned.;[];;[16610, 16629, 16635];[16608];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07175_.mp3
It's probably better it worked out this way.;[];;[16611];[16609];k_hhkd_dialog;
Observation: You may be right, master. This way we are reunited, and neither of us has suffered permanent termination.;[];;[16612, 16615, 16617, 16620, 16626];[16610];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07177_.mp3
Am I very much like the Revan you knew?;[];;[16613, 16627];[16611, 16616, 16619, 16625, 16623, 16632, 16634, 16636];k_hhkd_dialog;
Observation: In many ways you are, master, yes. You have much of the beloved cruelty of the master I knew.;[];;[16614];[16612];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07187_.mp3
You seem to have forgotten much, but in some ways you seem improved from the human I once knew. It is... difficult to explain, master.;[];;[16615, 16617, 16620, 16626];[16613];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07188_.mp3
Do you know anything about the Star Forge?;[];;[16616];[16614, 16619, 16625, 16623, 16628, 16611, 16632, 16634, 16636];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: No, master. You never did make me privy to any of the Star Forge's secrets.;[];;[16612, 16617, 16620, 16626];[16615];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07192_.mp3
What can you tell me of Malak?;[];;[16618];[16616, 16625, 16623, 16614, 16628, 16611, 16632, 16634, 16636];k_hhkd_dialog;
Commentary: Your former pupil is efficient and brutal, even for an organic. I rather liked him when you first introduced me to him.;[];;[16619];[16617];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07194_.mp3
If I had known what he would do to you, master, I would have gladly removed his entrails right then!;[];;[16612, 16615, 16620, 16626];[16618];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07195_.mp3
So... why the 'meatbag' references?;[];;[16621];[16619, 16616, 16614, 16628, 16611, 16632, 16634, 16636];k_hhkd_dialog;
Answer: It was you who programmed me thus, master.;[];;[16622];[16620];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07197_.mp3
Your pupil once asked what I thought of him and I informed him of his meatbag status. He was unimpressed, but you found the reference humorous.;[];;[16623];[16621];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07198_.mp3
You changed my programming so that I would continue to use the term. It drove your pupil to extreme lengths of frustration.;[];;[16612, 16615, 16617, 16624, 16626];[16622];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07199_.mp3
So... Malak was the original meatbag? I like that idea.;[];;[16625];[16623];k_hhkd_dialog;
Observation: Of course you do, master. You did then, as well.;[];;[16612, 16615, 16617, 16626];[16624];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07201_.mp3
That will be all, HK-47.;[];;[16483];[16625, 16623, 16619, 16616, 16614, 16628, 16611, 16632, 16634, 16636, 16220];k_hhkd_dialog;
Observation: You are different in many fundamental ways, master. You have a concern for life that is unsettling.;[];;[16628];[16612];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07189_.mp3
This cannot solely be caused by memory loss. I do not know how to explain it. Regardless, you do seem to be improved, overall, from the human I once knew.;[];;[16615, 16617, 16620, 16626];[16627];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07190_.mp3
I doubt you could have done anything.;[];;[16630];[16609];k_hhkd_dialog;
Objection: But I would have tried, master! I could have killed the Jedi, Bastila, I am sure of it. That would have been most fun.;[];;[16631, 16633];[16629];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07179_.mp3
Don't talk about Bastila like that!;[];;[16632];[16630];k_hhkd_dialog;
Retraction: I apologize, master. It is a force of habit.;[];;[16612, 16615, 16617, 16620, 16626];[16631];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07181_.mp3
Hmm... maybe a little.;[];;[16634];[16630];k_hhkd_dialog;
Observation: Now that is the master I remember.;[];;[16612, 16615, 16617, 16620, 16626];[16633];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07183_.mp3
You find it distressing?;[];;[16636];[16609];k_hhkd_dialog;
Statement: Of course, master. You are the one who created me, meatbag or no... and while you may not be all you once were, I am grateful for my existence.;[];;[16612, 16615, 16617, 16620, 16626];[16635];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07185_.mp3
I want to begin a fighter simulation.;[];;[16638];[16220];k_hhkd_dialog;
Statement: Certainly, master. Allow me to input the proper sequences into the ship computer. I caution you that the simulation will appear quite real.;[];;[16639];[16637];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07425_.mp3
Are you ready to begin the training sequence, master?;[];;[16640, 16642];[16638];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07426_.mp3
Go ahead.;[];;[16641];[16639];k_hhkd_dialog;
Statement: Simulation initiating.;[];;[];[16640];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07428_.mp3
No, forget it.;[];;[16483];[16639];k_hhkd_dialog;
Do you know anything about these gizka, HK?;[];;[16644];[16220];k_hhkd_dialog;
Statement: I have little knowledge of that to impart, master.;[];;[];[16643];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07432_.mp3
We have a little stowaway problem. Can you help?;[];;[16646];[16220];k_hhkd_dialog;
Statement: I cannot be of assistance on that, master.;[];;[];[16645];k_hhkd_dialog;NM35AAHHKD07433_.mp3
Statement: Well done, master. You're my kind of owner!;[];;[];[None];k_hhkd_dialog;NGLOBEHHKD07556_.mp3
Observation: Your ruthlessness and cruelty are quite refreshing in an organic meatbag, master. Are you sure you aren't part droid?;[];;[];[None];k_hhkd_dialog;NM25AAHURT03069_.mp3
Statement: Oh, master. I'm so very disappointed in you.;[];;[];[None];k_hhkd_dialog;NGLOBEHHKD07558_.mp3
What are you doing in my room?;[]; player enters echanis room;[16651, 16653, 16655, 16657];[None];man26_echmerc2;NM26AAECHM03000_.mp3
I just want to talk.;[];;[16652];[16650, 16656];man26_echmerc2;
I am too tired to enter a discussion with you tonight. You can speak to me tomorrow at the mercenary enclave if you wish.;[];;[16653, 16655];[16651];man26_echmerc2;NM26AAECHM03002_.mp3
I'll be going now.;[];;[16654];[16652, 16656, 16650, 16680, 16670, 16667, 16683, 16690];man26_echmerc2;
Good - leave me to my privacy.;[];;[];[16653];man26_echmerc2;NM26AAECHM03007_.mp3
I'm here to kill you!;[];;[16656];[16652, 16650];man26_echmerc2;
Don't be a fool. Since the murder, there are security cameras all over the place. If you do anything to me, the Selkath will lock you up for the rest of your life.;[];;[16651, 16653];[16655, 16657];man26_echmerc2;NM26AAECHM03004_.mp3
Give me all your money!;[];;[16656];[16650];man26_echmerc2;
I won't talk to you with that Mandalorian thug around!;[{'Echani Mercenary': 'Talk_Forceful'}]; canderous is in party and first time talked to;[16659];[None];man26_echmerc2;NM26AAECHM03009_.mp3
We're wasting our time with this prancing Echani.;[];;[16660];[16658];man26_echmerc2;NM26AAECHM03011_.mp3
Brave words - but only a coward hides behind layers of armor, Mandalorian! A true Echani needs only his training and warrior spirit for protection!;[];;[16661];[16659];man26_echmerc2;NM26AAECHM03013_.mp3
Your protection didn't help much when my brothers slaughtered your warriors by the thousands during the Mandalorian Wars!;[];;[16662];[16660];man26_echmerc2;NM26AAECHM03015_.mp3
You are fortunate the Selkath neutrality laws stay my hand, else you would pay for those comments with your tongue, Mandalorian!;[{'Echani Mercenary': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[16663];[16661];man26_echmerc2;NM26AAECHM03017_.mp3
See - I told you we were just wasting our time here.;[];;[];[16662];man26_echmerc2;NM26AAECHM03019_.mp3
As long as this brutish oaf is with you, we have nothing to talk about.;[]; canderous is in party, subsequent conversations;[];[None];man26_echmerc2;NM26AAECHM03021_.mp3
Allow me to express my thanks. Though there has been no official statement from the Republic, I have learned you were the one responsible for discovering the fate of my fellow Echani.;[]; first conversation after hrakert rift plot completed;[16666];[None];man26_echmerc2;NM26AAECHM03023_.mp3
The knowledge of their deaths saddens me, but now that their fate is known I can perform the appropriate funeral rites to honor our fallen.;[];;[16667];[16665];man26_echmerc2;NM26AAECHM03025_.mp3
Unlike the Mandalorians and Iridorians, we Echani remember those who have done us a service. Is there some small favor I may now do for you?;[];Second and later times talked to after Hrakert Rift done.;[16653, 16668, 16674, 16676];[16666];man26_echmerc2;NM26AAECHM03027_.mp3
Do you anything about the murder of Elassa?;[];Player is arbiter for Sunry murder plot;[16669];[16667, 16670, 16685];man26_echmerc2;
I cannot help you there. I have heard she was one of the Sith... perhaps the answers you seek are inside the Sith Embassy.;[];;[16670];[16668];man26_echmerc2;NM26AAECHM03037_.mp3
Is there anything else I can do for you?;[];;[16653, 16668, 16671, 16674, 16676];[16669, 16673, 16675, 16687];man26_echmerc2;NM26AAECHM03039_.mp3
Why is the Republic hiring so many mercenaries?;[];;[16672];[16670, 16680, 16685];man26_echmerc2;
I do not know. The Republic has become very secretive as of late. I think they have something to hide. They hire my people, but will not say why - and those they hire do not return.;[];;[16673];[16671];man26_echmerc2;NM26AAECHM03062_.mp3
Perhaps they have left the planet. Perhaps they are dead. I cannot say - and none of the Republic soldiers are talking.;[];Set merctalk to active, enable the submarine plot.;[16670];[16672];man26_echmerc2;NM26AAECHM03064_.mp3
Do you know about a Star Map or ancient ruins?;[];;[16675];[16670, 16667, 16685];man26_echmerc2;
Ruins? On Manaan? There is nothing on Manaan but water, and the recently built Ahto City.;[];;[16670];[16674];man26_echmerc2;NM26AAECHM03042_.mp3
What do you have against the Mandalorians and Iridorians?;[];;[16677];[16670, 16680, 16667, 16683, 16690];man26_echmerc2;
The Mandalorians call themselves warriors - but they cower behind their heavy battle armor, and arm themselves with brutish weapons of mass destruction that require no skill or training to use!;[];;[16678];[16676];man26_echmerc2;NM26AAECHM03049_.mp3
As for the Iridonians, they are blood-thirsty demons. They kill for pleasure, and leave a wake of savage violence and gruesome death. They have no nobility, no understanding of true honor. They are animals.;[];;[16679];[16677];man26_echmerc2;NM26AAECHM03051_.mp3
We Echani, however, are true warriors. We do not cower behind layers of armor and our chosen weapons are implements of precision and skill. We know honor and nobility.;[];;[16680];[16678];man26_echmerc2;NM26AAECHM03053_.mp3
The Republic knows we Echani are not as greedy as the Mandalorians, nor as blood thristy as the Iridorians. But recently their need for mercenaries on Manaan is so great they have been forced to hire whomever they can.;[];;[16653, 16671, 16676];[16679, 16693];man26_echmerc2;NM26AAECHM03060_.mp3
Have you come here seeking refuge from the senseless atrocities of war, as I have?;[]; first conversation after dantooine destroyed;[16682];[None];man26_echmerc2;NM26AAECHM03028_.mp3
The Sith have recently destroyed a Jedi enclave on Dantooine - did you know? I heard they bombed the planet from afar, just as they did Taris.;[];;[16683];[16681];man26_echmerc2;NM26AAECHM03030_.mp3
It seems in battle the Sith are as ruthless as the Iridorians and as craven as the Mandalorians.;[];;[16653, 16676, 16684];[16682];man26_echmerc2;NM26AAECHM03032_.mp3
I just want to ask you some questions.;[];;[16685];[16683, 16690];man26_echmerc2;
I suppose I see no harm in that. Ask away.;[];;[16668, 16671, 16674, 16686, 16688];[16684];man26_echmerc2;NM26AAECHM03035_.mp3
Why have the Sith shown such interest in young Selkath?;[];;[16687];[16685];man26_echmerc2;
Who'd be interested in those fish? I have no clue. Maybe Gonto over by the bar knows.;[];;[16670];[16686];man26_echmerc2;NM26AAECHM03045_.mp3
Never mind.;[];;[16689];[16685];man26_echmerc2;

You know, I may have been out of circulation for a while, but doesn't it seem likely to you that this friend of yours didn't own the droid?;[];;[16790];[16788];tat17_08yuka_01;NM17AC08YU02074_.mp3
And was this a droid of his own... or something stored in that warehouse?;[];;[16790];[16788];tat17_08yuka_01;NM17AC08YU02075_.mp3
Sounds like you've got a faulty droid on your hands.;[];;[16715];[16713];tat17_08yuka_01;NM17AC08YU02017_.mp3
Basilisks were always much more reliable than the stuff you see in the Republic or Sith Empire.;[];;[16715];[16713];tat17_08yuka_01;NM17AC08YU02018_.mp3
You bought it. Sold as is with no guarantee. Sorry, but any problem it's having is yours alone.;[];player bought HK-47;[16796, 16798];[16710];tat17_08yuka_01;
Observation: I am not a problem, you useless organic meatbag! You and your lack of any organized mechanical skills are a problem!;[{'HK47': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[16797];[16795];tat17_08yuka_01;NM17AC08YU02080_.mp3
Uhhhh... yes, like that sort of problem. Good luck with that.;[];;[16707, 16734, 16752];[16796];tat17_08yuka_01;
That's business on Tatooine, I'm afraid.;[];;[16707, 16734, 16752];[16795];tat17_08yuka_01;
But, I could have misheard. They cover very large areas when they scavenge, but aren't doing much right now.;[];jawas have not been rescued.;[16710, 16734, 16738, 16800, 16805];[16708];tat17_08yuka_01;
What is stopping the Jawas from scavenging?;[];;[16801];[16799, 16807];tat17_08yuka_01;
Again, I may have misunderstood, but I think some of their tribe-mates are missing. I think they wanted help.;[];;[16802];[16800];tat17_08yuka_01;
I stay away from trouble, but if you are interested, there was a Jawa by the city gate. You'll need a droid to translate though.;[];;[16710, 16734, 16738, 16803, 16805];[16801];tat17_08yuka_01;
I don't need a translator. I understand most languages fine.;[];;[16804, 16808];[16802];tat17_08yuka_01;
Impressive. That HK-47 I sold you would be of considerable help as well, I imagine, though I'm still not certain what it was fully capable of.;[];;[16710, 16734, 16738, 16805];[16803];tat17_08yuka_01;
Did the Jawas bring you this HK-47?;[];;[16806];[16804, 16808, 16802, 16799];tat17_08yuka_01;
No, they keep assembled or working units to sell themselves. They don't have them often. No place to store them.;[];;[16807];[16805];tat17_08yuka_01;
Mostly they bring in parts. There's the occasional antique. Old blasters and the like. Tatooine has a few buried secrets.;[];;[16710, 16734, 16738, 16800];[16806];tat17_08yuka_01;
Really? The Jawas give me trouble. Say, maybe I could interest you in a multipurpose droid? HK-47. Very nice.;[];;[16710, 16734, 16738, 16805];[16803];tat17_08yuka_01;
Thanks. Goodbye.;[];;[16810];[16706];tat17_08yuka_01;
Oh, thank you, most definitely.;[];;[];[16809];tat17_08yuka_01;
Fine, I'm leaving.;[];;[16812];[16698, 16696];tat17_08yuka_01;
Good riddance. You aren't welcome here.;[{'Yuka Laka': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[];[16811];tat17_08yuka_01;
What is this? A customer I don't recognize? Perhaps you bring off-world money to Yuka Laka?;[];;[16738, 16814, 16817];[None];tat17_08yuka_01;
What do you have available in your shop?;[];player not told about hk-47 Set local that says player told about hk-47;[16815];[16813];tat17_08yuka_01;
You are lucky to have come at this time. I have one droid ready to go. I just took possession of it. An HK-47.;[];;[16816];[16814];tat17_08yuka_01;
It's a fine protocol translator. I think it's been modified. It claims to understand the Sand People dialect, and also has some armor mounts. Combat ready, perhaps?;[];;[16707, 16710, 16734, 16738];[16815, 16818];tat17_08yuka_01;
My money is my own business.;[];;[16818];[16813];tat17_08yuka_01;
Of course it is, of course, but you must appreciate the finer things. Just take a look at the droid I have available. An HK-47.;[];;[16816];[16817];tat17_08yuka_01;
Hello again! It is unfortunate, but I have nothing new in droids to show you right now. Things are very slow.;[];player has purchased HK-47;[16820];[None];tat17_08yuka_01;
But, since you purchased that worn out HK-47, you will get excellent prices as soon as I am restocked.;[];;[16821];[16819];tat17_08yuka_01;

Err... you've gotten a little hostile there, droid, haven't you?;[];;[16823];[16821];tat17_08yuka_01;
I have always been hostile. Now that I need no longer rely on you and your primitive maintenance skills I do not need to hide it.;[{'HK47': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[16824];[16822];tat17_08yuka_01;NM17AC08YU02120_.mp3
Yes, well... just keep away from me, then. I'm just an honest businessman.;[];;[16707, 16710, 16734, 16752];[16823];tat17_08yuka_01;
Welcome back! Yes, I knew you would return. I still have that droid available. This HK-47 is a good deal.;[];;[16707, 16710, 16734, 16738];[None];tat17_08yuka_01;
Ahhh... what is this you bring me, Shaardan?;[{'Uthar Wynn': 'Listen'}];;[16827];[None];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22000_.mp3
It is none other than the sword of Ajunta Pall, Master.;[];;[16828];[16826];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22001_.mp3
Fool. All the trouble you went through for your deception, and you did not even make an effort to verify the sword's authenticity?;[];;[16829];[16827];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22002_.mp3
M-master? What... what do you mean?;[{'Shaardan': 'Talk_Pleading'}];;[16830];[16828];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22003_.mp3
There is no place for fools amongst the Sith. Begone.;[{'Shaardan': 'Horror'}];;[];[16829];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22004_.mp3

Greetings, prospective students. It appears we have a late entry. Who do you bring before me, Yuthura? A young human, bristling with the Force?;[];the PC will appear in the main chamber, where Yuthura, Uthar and several students and guards are waiting. kor_yuthura1 global is set to 2 kor_sithtest global is set to 0 -------------------------------------------------- Dialogue Endings #1 - End the beginning cut-scene: player has agreed to join the academy. Fade to black and jump the player to a bedroom within the academy. Jump Yuthura to her quarters and the other students to their quarters (though they need not stay there). Master Uthar remains in the main room.;[16833];[None];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22006_.mp3
A human that has had some training, it seems, Master Uthar. Very promising, I think.;[];;[16834, 16835, 16836];[16832];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22007_.mp3
Promising? Hmmph. That one's not worthy to lick spit off your shoes, master.;[{'Shaardan': 'Taunt'}];;[16835, 16836];[16833];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22008_.mp3

That I'll judge for myself, thank you. Tell me, human... what do you know of the ways of the Sith? What preconceptions has your mind been polluted with?;[{'Uthar Wynn': 'Persuade'}];;[16837, 16869, 16871, 16873, 16875, 16877];[16835, 16834, 16833];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22010_.mp3
I know more about the Sith than you... I've just forgotten.;[];;[16838];[16836];kor35_utharwynn;
Indeed? Then perhaps you would care to demonstrate for us the powers of a Sith Master. ...No? Then perhaps you shall keep your foolishness to yourself and actually learn something.;[];;[16839];[16837];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22012_.mp3
The Jedi equate the light with goodness and strength and the dark with weakness and evil. That is their tradition and it is truly no surprise that they cling to it for comfort.;[];;[16840];[16838, 16870, 16872, 16874, 16876, 16878];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22023_.mp3
We, however, do not treat the Force as a burden. We treat it as a gift, a thing to be celebrated. We use it to acquire power over others... and why should we not? Because the Jedi say we should not?;[];;[16841];[16839];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22024_.mp3
We are as the Force is meant to be. The Jedi would hide that from you... they would tell you the dark side is too quick, too easy, all so that they need never challenge the passions that lie within them.;[];;[16842];[16840];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22025_.mp3
Joining with us means realizing your true potential. It means not stifling yourself solely for the sake of hide-bound shamans and their antiquated notion of order. Be what you were meant to be.;[{'Uthar Wynn': 'Persuade'}];;[16843];[16841];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22026_.mp3

I dare, Master Uthar! I am ready!;[{'Lashowe': 'Victory'}];;[16845];[16843];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22028_.mp3
Brash and fiery, as expected. Turn that passion to your advantage, child. What of you, Mekel? Are you ready?;[];;[16846];[16844];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22029_.mp3
I am, Master. More than ready.;[{'Mekel': 'Bow'}];;[16847];[16845];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22030_.mp3

And what of my companions?;[];the player has others with him;[16852];[16850];kor35_utharwynn;
Your slaves? They are irrelevant. They may accompany you, so long as they do not interfere with us or with your training. Are you ready or not, young one?;[];;[16853, 16863, 16865];[16851];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22036_.mp3
I am ready to learn more.;[];player is Dark Side;[16854, 16862];[16852, 16850];kor35_utharwynn;
And so shall it be.;[];;[16855];[16853];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22038_.mp3
Now, then. All of you five recruits have shown a degree of facility with the Force... you all have the potential to become true Sith. Only one of you, however, will succeed.;[];;[16856];[16854, 16862, 16864, 16868];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22039_.mp3
The one who succeeds will be admitted to the academy as a full Sith. All others must wait until next year and try again... if you survive.;[];;[16857];[16855];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22040_.mp3
My pupil, Yuthura, shall be your teacher and master while you attempt to prove yourselves. Heed her words.;[];;[16858];[16856];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22041_.mp3
As Master Uthar said, none of you are true Sith *yet*. For that to occur, one of you must do enough of worth... gain enough prestige... to be selected.;[];;[16859];[16857];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22042_.mp3
What is an act of worth? You must learn that for yourselves. Remember that you are competitors, here... fight for your destiny, or go home.;[];;[16860];[16858];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22043_.mp3
If you wish to gain a lead over your competitors, the first of you to learn the Code of the Sith and tell me of it will be rewarded.;[];;[16861];[16859];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22044_.mp3
The rest is for you to discover. Welcome to the dark side, my children... your one chance at true greatness lies here.;[{'Uthar Wynn': 'Bow'}];;[];[16860];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22045_.mp3
Are you? I can see into your heart, young human, and I see the dark kernel that is there. If it is ready to sprout remains to be seen.;[];;[16855];[16853];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22046_.mp3
I don't know...;[];;[16864];[16852, 16850];kor35_utharwynn;
An honest answer. You will make little progress, however, if you do not come to learn that any opportunity, even an unsure one, must be snatched.;[];;[16855];[16863];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22048_.mp3
But... power without consideration of morality is a weakness.;[];player is Light Side;[16866];[16852, 16850];kor35_utharwynn;
Ha ha ha! You are brave to argue, young one. I have met few students who would speak so openly to me.;[{'Uthar Wynn': 'Talk_Laughing'}];;[16867];[16865];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22050_.mp3
Ask yourself first what this 'morality' is? How is it created? Who does it benefit? Where do your notions of 'good' and 'evil' come from?;[];;[16868];[16866];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22051_.mp3
You may come to the realization that morality is but an obstacle to overcome... or not. The discovery is yours to make, should you be ready.;[];;[16855];[16867];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22052_.mp3
I've killed too many Sith to have preconceptions about them.;[];;[16870];[16836];kor35_utharwynn;
Most impressive, if it is true. Those who were too weak to stand against you deserved their fate, so expect no retribution from us. There is much you can learn from the Sith, and we from you.;[];;[16839];[16869];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22020_.mp3
I don't know anything about the Sith, to tell the truth.;[];;[16872];[16836];kor35_utharwynn;
An honest if evasive answer. Likely it is more true than you realize. Allow me to speak of the deeper matters at hand.;[];;[16839];[16871];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22022_.mp3
I know that the Sith are powerful. A force to be reckoned with.;[];;[16874];[16836];kor35_utharwynn;
A diplomatic answer, if not the core of the matter. Our power is obvious. The question in truth goes much deeper than the surface.;[];;[16839];[16873];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22014_.mp3
The Sith are evil and have surrendered themselves to the temptation and corruption of their power.;[];;[16876];[16836];kor35_utharwynn;
An honest answer, and one I would expect from anyone who has been exposed to those sad relics amongst the Jedi. As always, young human, the truth is not quite so simple.;[];;[16839];[16875];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22016_.mp3
The Sith do what they want and pay no heed to duty or discipline.;[];;[16878];[16836];kor35_utharwynn;
Untrue. The Force demands discipline from all who use it, and the Sith demand duty. The truth goes far beyond such a superficial evaluation.;[];;[16839];[16877];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22018_.mp3
So, then. I take it you are ready to travel to the tomb of Naga Sadow? Your final test should not be delayed.;[];if the player has 3+ prestige;[16880, 16882, 16884, 16886];[None];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22053_.mp3
What is this tomb of Naga Sadow?;[];;[16881];[16879, 16883];kor35_utharwynn;
It is a tomb that belonged to an ancient Sith Lord... the greatest of Korriban's Sith Lords, in fact. It is there that your test is performed.;[];;[16882, 16884, 16886];[16880];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22055_.mp3
What is this final test?;[];;[16883];[16881, 16879];kor35_utharwynn;
I will tell you the details when we are there, young one. You will, however, fight for your life... that is why I suggest you be in sufficient health.;[];;[16880, 16884, 16886];[16882];kor35_utharwynn;NM35AAUTHA22057_.mp3

There truly isn't much to tell, citizen. Dreshdae was established by the Sith, and we arrived to take advantage of some of the planet's mineral wealth.;[];;[17033];[17031];kor33_czerkarep;NM33AACZER07036_.mp3
The only thing that's really unusual about Dreshdae, I suppose, is that the Sith built their academy on the east side of the colony. You don't find those just anywhere.;[];;[17034, 17038, 17047, 17053];[17032];kor33_czerkarep;NM33AACZER07037_.mp3

Not much. The Sith are a rather secretive lot, and they don't allow many into the academy. I hear they claim that Korriban was inhabited long ago by other Sith.;[];;[17040, 17041];[17038];kor33_czerkarep;NM33AACZER07043_.mp3

How do you use security on a door?;[];;[17250];[17248, 17264];end_trask01;
Target the door using the mouse. When you have selected the door, the TARGET MENU will appear. The icons on the TARGET MENU are the additional options you can use on the door.;[];;[17251];[17249];end_trask01;
Look at the TARGET MENU and find the SECURITY icon. Remember, the SECURITY icon only appears if you're controlling a character with the SECURITY skill.;[];;[17252];[17250];end_trask01;

Tell me about the TARGET MENU.;[];;[17259];[17257];end_trask01;
The icons in your TARGET MENU will change depending on whether your targeting circle is on a door, a container, a friendly creature or an enemy.

How do I use a medpac?;[];;[17268];[17266];end_trask01;
To use an item like a medpac - or another self-targetting item or power - you'll need to know how to use your ACTION MENU.;[];;[17269, 17270];[17267];end_trask01;
Tell me about the ACTION MENU.;[];;[17254];[17268, 17274];end_trask01;

Notice the up and down arrows on this icon. This means you have more than one available option for this icon. You must choose between a medpac and an advanced medpac.;[];;[17273];[17271];end_trask01;
Use the mouse wheel to scroll up or down to switch between your medpac and your advanced medpac. Left-click the mouse to use the selected item on the character you currently control.;[];;[17274];[17272];end_trask01;
Just remember that you have to actually be hurt for a medpac to work. You can't use it when you're uninjured.;[];;[17205, 17210, 17269];[17273];end_trask01;

As Arbiter of the Sunry murder trial you have the authority to question me on matters pertaining to this case.;[];;[17360, 17382, 17402, 17406, 17411];[None];man26_seljud1;
I have questions about the trial.;[];;[17361];[17359, 17381, 17386, 17405, 17408];man26_seljud1;
You have the right, Arbiter, to ask me questions regarding the case.;[];;[17362, 17368, 17375, 17380];[17360];man26_seljud1;
What do you think of Sunry?;[];;[17363];[17361, 17374, 17379];man26_seljud1;
Sunry is known to us as a hero of the Republic in your perpetual conflicts with the Sith Empire.;[];;[17364];[17362];man26_seljud1;
While he may have been severely injured in the line of duty, I personally hold him in quite high regard.;[];;[17365, 17366, 17413];[17363];man26_seljud1;
Speaking of that injury, has it been taken into consideration, your honor?;[];;[17366];[17364];man26_seljud1;NM26AASELJ17008_.mp3
In no way does his disability hamper him, though. Rest assured that my personal regard for Sunry will not affect my judgment. While emotion may rule your Senate, the cold hard hand of the law rules here on Manaan.;[];;[17367];[17365, 17413, 17364];man26_seljud1;
Is there anything else you wished to ask me, human?;[];;[17368, 17375, 17380, 17411];[17366];man26_seljud1;
Is there anything suspicious about this case?;[];;[17369];[17367, 17379, 17361];man26_seljud1;
Yes, there is something that has been bothering me: the medal that was found clutched in the Sith's hand.;[];;[17370];[17368];man26_seljud1;
I find it most odd that such a blatantly incriminating piece of evidence would be left at the scene of the crime.;[];;[17371];[17369];man26_seljud1;
We have analyzed the evidence and it does not appear to be a replica, but I still have my doubts.;[];;[17372];[17370];man26_seljud1;
In the midst of the crime, though, Sunry could well have lost it. I have seen much more improbable things happen in my tenure to the courts.;[];;[17373, 17374];[17371];man26_seljud1;
Hmmm. Simply because it was real does not mean Sunry would have overlooked it being in Elassa's hand.;[];;[17374];[17372];man26_seljud1;NM26AASELJ17024_.mp3
Is there another matter you wish to inquire about, human?;[];;[17362, 17375, 17380, 17411];[17373, 17372];man26_seljud1;
What do you think of the Republic and the Sith Empire?;[];;[17376];[17374, 17367, 17361];man26_seljud1;
The governing bodies of both states seek to keep an amicable relationship with our world in order to facilitate the exporting of kolto.;[];;[17377];[17375];man26_seljud1;
I do not delude myself into thinking that either of your states holds any great love for us, but we are necessary so you will let us hold our autonomy.;[];;[17378];[17376];man26_seljud1;
I try not to concern myself with intragalactic policy. I find it stretches the letter of the law too much for my tastes.;[];;[17379];[17377];man26_seljud1;
Is there something else that concerns you, human?;[];;[17362, 17368, 17380, 17411];[17378];man26_seljud1;
I want to ask you something else.;[];;[17381];[17379, 17374, 17367, 17361];man26_seljud1;
What is it you wish to ask?;[];;[17360, 17382, 17402, 17406, 17411];[17380];man26_seljud1;
How did you know I was from the Republic?;[];;[17383];[17381, 17359, 17422];man26_seljud1;
Your ship registry is originally from the Republic world of Transel. Therefore you are a Republic citizen.;[];;[17384];[17382];man26_seljud1;
Or are you saying you STOLE your ship?;[];;[17385];[17383];man26_seljud1;
No, no... perfectly legitimate.;[];;[17386];[17384];man26_seljud1;
I see. Is there more you need?;[];;[17360, 17387, 17402, 17406, 17409, 17411];[17385];man26_seljud1;
I would like to investigate the murder case involving Sunry.;[];;[17388];[17386, 17405, 17408, 17417, 17419, 17422];man26_seljud1;
That is acceptable, I believe. In Manaan legal tradition the defendant can have an Arbiter who tries to prove his innocence in court.;[];;[17389];[17387];man26_seljud1;
This Arbiter is a neutral party that can investigate and present evidence in the trial, and argue on the defendant's behalf. As you are a Jedi, I believe you could fulfill this role adequately.;[];;[17390, 17391, 17400, 17401];[17388];man26_seljud1;
I suppose you're Sunry's only hope. We have to at least try to help him.;[];;[17391];[17389];man26_seljud1;NM26AASELJ17060_.mp3
So be it! You are now appointed Arbiter in the case of Sunry vs. The Sith Empire. Your name and position have been recorded in our files.;[];;[17392];[17390, 17400, 17401, 17389];man26_seljud1;
I will now inform you of the pertinent facts in this case. You have a limited amount of time in which to investigate and organize a defense of your client, and I advise you to use it wisely.;[];;[17393];[17391];man26_seljud1;
Sunry was seen leaving a hotel, leaving behind a dead Sith woman - Elassa Huros. He has been charged with murder and is being held in the Ahto City prison facilities. Due to his crippled status he is being kept in a solitary holding cell.;[];;[17394];[17392];man26_seljud1;
Witnesses claimed to have seen the killing and are being detained at the hotel in question pending the trial. The manager of the hotel has now been informed of your appointment.;[];;[17395];[17393];man26_seljud1;
Elassa was found dead of a blaster wound with an incriminating Republic medal clutched in her hand. This information has been uploaded to your datapad. It would be wise to review all information before the trial starts.;[];;[17396];[17394];man26_seljud1;
You may question Sunry or the witnesses. The evidence in this case is heavily stacked against Mr. Sunry. I believe it will take some doing to absolve him of guilt.;[];;[17397, 17398];[17395];man26_seljud1;
Yes... but it almost seems too heavily stacked, doesn't it? Very suspicious.;[];;[17398];[17396];man26_seljud1;NM26AASELJ17078_.mp3
You may also interview the judges here, including myself, to get an idea of the pertinent factors in this case.;[];;[17399];[17397, 17396];man26_seljud1;
"Since this is also your first case, and you are an off-worlder, I feel compelled to add ""good luck"" as my final missive.";[];;[];[17398];man26_seljud1;
Jedi are renowned for being arbiters in times of need. We will investigate this matter as best we are able.;[];;[17391];[17389];man26_seljud1;NM26AASELJ17062_.mp3
We'll do our best. You can count on that.;[];;[17391];[17389];man26_seljud1;NM26AASELJ17064_.mp3
Is there a Star Map on this world?;[];;[17403];[17386, 17408, 17381, 17359, 17419, 17422];man26_seljud1;
A Star Map? Hm... not precisely... but Manaan holds many wonderous and exciting locales and treasures, kolto not the least of them.;[];;[17404];[17402];man26_seljud1;
Our many shops and boulevards cater to the whim of any species and provide a vibrant night-life that has to be seen to be believed.;[];;[17405];[17403];man26_seljud1;
This and other tourist paraphenalia can be had from your local embassy... So do not waste my time with it.;[];;[17360, 17387, 17406, 17409, 17411];[17404];man26_seljud1;
What do you know about the young Selkath who have been going missing?;[];;[17407];[17405, 17386, 17381, 17359, 17417, 17422];man26_seljud1;
The court is unaware of any missing beings reports. Should any substantial evidence come up in regards to such a disappearance, you should file it with us and an investigation will be launched.;[];;[17408];[17406];man26_seljud1;
Is there anything else you require?;[];;[17360, 17387, 17402, 17409, 17411];[17407];man26_seljud1;
I have no more questions, your honor.;[];;[17410];[17408, 17405, 17386, 17417, 17419, 17422];man26_seljud1;
Then go and enjoy Ahto City. And do not break any laws that we would have to lock you up for.;[];;[];[17409];man26_seljud1;
I have no more questions for now.;[];;[17412];[17408, 17405, 17386, 17381, 17379, 17374, 17367, 17359];man26_seljud1;
Very well. When you feel you have gathered enough evidence, you may speak to the warden in charge of the prison where Sunry is being held. He will bring Sunry to us and the trial will commence.;[];;[];[17411];man26_seljud1;
Well, speaking of that injury... does that not make it seem unlikely that he killed anyone?;[];;[17366];[17364];man26_seljud1;NM26AASELJ17010_.mp3
Your task with the courts has been completed, human. You have fulfilled your role as Arbiter to the satisfaction of this court.;[];;[17415];[None];man26_seljud1;
Should you have any other grievances you wish to present, give them to the judge on duty at that time.;[];;[];[17414];man26_seljud1;
While we are not free to discuss the... incident, we remember your involvement in it quite well.;[];;[17417];[None];man26_seljud1;
What is it you wish to bring to my attention?;[];;[17387, 17406, 17409];[17416];man26_seljud1;
The Selkath people thank you for exposing the Sith plots here on Manaan. When our leaders decide a fitting punishment, they will certainly know our displeasure.;[];;[17419];[None];man26_seljud1;
If there is anything else you wish to bring to my attention, you have my permission to ask.;[];;[17387, 17402, 17409];[17418];man26_seljud1;
I am Judge Shelkar acting on behalf of the Selkath government of Manaan. It is my task today to answer the needs of off-world citizens of both the Republic and the Sith Empire.;[];;[17421];[None];man26_seljud1;
If you have legitimate grievances with another party then you should speak to me. You should first, however, consult with the Republic Embassy before pressing formal charges.;[];;[17422];[17420];man26_seljud1;
Is there something you wish to bring to my attention?;[];;[17382, 17387, 17402, 17406, 17409];[17421];man26_seljud1;
Just move along. There's nothing to see here.;[];;[10550];[None];tar02_sithintero;NM02ADSITH10000_.mp3
Hey, we don't need any reinforcements. All we're doing is searching for some missing Sith uniforms.;[];;[10575, 10577];[None];tar02_sithintero;NM02ADSITH10037_.mp3
What do you want, civilian? Do you have any information about the missing Sith uniforms? Make it quick!;[];;[10580, 10587];[None];tar02_sithintero;NM02ADSITH10044_.mp3
Forgive me for the intrusion, human. My name is Senni Vek. I believe you dropped this datapad and I wish to return it to you.;[];;[17427, 17429, 17432, 17434];[None];k_hsenni_dialog;
I didn't drop anything.;[];;[17428];[17426, 17433, 17435];k_hsenni_dialog;
I'm certain you did, human. Please, take the datapad. It's yours, I'm sure.;[];;[17429, 17432, 17436];[17427];k_hsenni_dialog;
Uh... thanks.;[];;[17430];[17428, 17433, 17435, 17426];k_hsenni_dialog;
My pleasure, human. You should examine it to make sure it is not broken.;[];;[17431];[17429, 17438];k_hsenni_dialog;
Goodbye, human.;[];;[];[17430];k_hsenni_dialog;
What is this, some kind of con game?;[];;[17433];[17428, 17435, 17426];k_hsenni_dialog;
No, this is no game. I simply saw you drop this datapad and I wish to give it back to you.;[];;[17427, 17429, 17434, 17436];[17432];k_hsenni_dialog;
I'm sorry, there must be some mistake.;[];;[17435];[17433, 17426];k_hsenni_dialog;
There is no mistake, human. This datapad is yours and yours alone. Please, take it.;[];;[17427, 17429, 17432, 17436];[17434];k_hsenni_dialog;
I don't want it.;[];;[17437];[17435, 17433, 17428];k_hsenni_dialog;
Are you certain, human? Please, take the datapad.;[];;[17438, 17439, 17441];[17436];k_hsenni_dialog;
Fine. Give me the stupid datapad!;[];;[17430];[17437];k_hsenni_dialog;
No. It's not mine. I won't take it.;[];;[17440];[17437];k_hsenni_dialog;
Very well, human. I will keep the datapad and I will leave. Goodbye, human.;[];;[];[17439, 17441];k_hsenni_dialog;
I'll beat you to death with that datapad if you don't go away right now!;[];;[17440];[17437];k_hsenni_dialog;
I saw you in the swoop race. Very impressive. You seem like you know how to get results. That's just the kind of person I'm looking for.;[];First time player comes into the Lower City after swoop race Canderous will appear and init conversation;[17443, 17497, 17498];[None];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06000_.mp3
Who are you?;[];;[17444];[17442];tar03_cand031;
"My name's Canderous Ordo. I work for Davik Kang and the Exchange; the hours aren't great, but they promised me a fortune to work for them and I have nothing better to do. Mandalorian mercs like me are in high demand.";[];;[17445];[17443, 17497, 17499];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06002_.mp3
But lately Davik hasn't been paying me what he promised. I don't like getting cheated, so I figure it's time for me to break the Sith quarantine and get off this backwater planet.;[];;[17446, 17496];[17444];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06004_.mp3
How do you plan to do that?;[];;[17447];[17445];tar03_cand031;
I've got a plan to escape Taris, but I can't do it alone. I need someone I know can get the job done to help me. That's where you come in.;[];;[17448, 17450, 17495];[17446, 17496];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06006_.mp3
Careful. Mercs like this haven't a lick of conscience... they'll betray you in a heartbeat. This could be a trap.;[];;[17449];[17447];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06008_.mp3
I ain't talking to you. I'm talking to your friend, aren't I?;[];;[17450];[17448, 17495];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06010_.mp3
I saw you win that swoop race, and I started thinking. Anyone crazy enough to race like that is probably crazy enough to break into the Sith military base.;[];;[17451, 17489];[17449, 17447];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06014_.mp3
See, I put two and two together and I figured out you're the person who stole the Sith departure codes for Taris. So you're exactly the person I'm looking for.;[];;[17452, 17488];[17450];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06016_.mp3
What kind of deal are you proposing?;[];;[17453];[17451];tar03_cand031;
I've got a plan to get inside Davik's base and steal his ship, the Ebon Hawk. If any ship is fast enough to break the Sith quarantine, it's that one.;[];;[17454];[17452, 17488];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06018_.mp3
But the ship alone won't get me off this rock. Without the proper launch codes the automated defense guns of the Sith fleet will disintegrate me as soon as I leave the atmosphere.;[];;[17455];[17453];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06020_.mp3
So here's the deal: we join up together. You've got the codes, and I'll get us to Davik's ship. What do you say? Do we have a deal? We can go right now.;[];;[17456, 17458, 17468, 17473];[17454];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06022_.mp3
I have a few things to take care of first.;[];;[17457];[17455, 17502];tar03_cand031;
Fair enough. But don't take too long. As soon as you're ready to get inside Davik's estate, come speak to me. The sooner we get off this rock the better.;[];;[];[17456];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06024_.mp3
Okay, let's join up. But how are we going to get me inside Davik's estate?;[];;[17459];[17455, 17502];tar03_cand031;
Davik's always looking to recruit new talent. I'll tell him how you won that swoop race and mention that you're interested in working for the Exchange.;[];;[17460];[17458];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06027_.mp3
I'll say I brought you in so he could check you out. He'll have you stay at his estate for a couple days while he runs some background checks on you - that's standard procedure.;[];;[17461, 17465, 17467];[17459];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06029_.mp3
This is too risky. We should find another way.;[];;[17462];[17460];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06031_.mp3
You got another plan, sister? Or are you just objecting 'cause you didn't think of it?;[];;[17463];[17461];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06033_.mp3
No, I... don't have another plan. I would rather not place my life in your hands, however.;[];;[17464];[17462];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06035_.mp3
I can say the same about you. That makes us even. Fortunately we both want to get off this rock, right?;[];;[17465];[17463];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06037_.mp3
While Davik's checking you out, we steal the Ebon Hawk and escape Taris. Come on - I've got an air speeder nearby to take us to Davik's estate. The sooner we're off Taris the better!;[];;[17466];[17464, 17467, 17460];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06041_.mp3
[CANDEROUS has joined your party.] [Canderous has a special cybernetic implant that regenerates minor wounds.] [Left-click this response to go to PARTY SELECTION screen.];[];;[];[17465];tar03_cand031;
That's... not a bad plan. It might just work.;[];;[17465];[17460];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06039_.mp3
Forget it - I don't trust you!;[];;[17469];[17455, 17479, 17477];tar03_cand031;
Look, I don't like working with strangers either but we don't have much choice. I can provide the ship, you can get me those codes. We need each other.;[];;[17470, 17471, 17472];[17468];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06056_.mp3
I don't sense any deception from him, which is surprising. This may be exactly what we need.;[];;[17471];[17469, 17480];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06058_.mp3
Sooner or later you'll figure this out. Either we work together, or we both stay stuck here on Taris. Come back and speak to me again when you come to your senses.;[];;[];[17470, 17472, 17469, 17503, 17504];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06081_.mp3
Hmm. Much as I hate to say it, he's...he's probably right. We're going to need that ship.;[];;[17471];[17469, 17480];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06060_.mp3
Sorry, not interested.;[];;[17474];[17455, 17491];tar03_cand031;
Damn, you're stubborn! We both want off the planet, but neither one of us can pull it off alone! Bring me the launch codes and we'll both get what we want.;[];;[17475, 17486];[17473];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06068_.mp3
How am I supposed to get inside the military base?;[];;[17476];[17474, 17493, 17491];tar03_cand031;
Getting in won't be easy: the Sith base is protected by an encrypted security system. It would take a top of the line astromech droid to slice through it.;[];;[17477, 17482];[17475, 17487, 17508];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06050_.mp3
But that little T3 unit you got from Janice should be good enough to get the job done.;[];;[17468, 17478, 17480];[17476];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06052_.mp3
Why don't you do this yourself?;[];;[17479];[17477, 17483];tar03_cand031;
Normally I'd do this myself, but everyone knows who I work for. If I broke into the Sith base, they'd send an army down on Davik's estate to get those codes back. That's why I need you.;[];;[17468, 17480];[17478, 17485];tar03_cand031;NM02AECAND30099_.mp3
Okay, Canderous - I'll bring you those codes.;[];;[17470, 17472, 17481];[17479, 17477];tar03_cand031;
Glad to hear it. I'll be waiting right here.;[];;[];[17480, 17507];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06088_.mp3
Lucky for you I know just the place to get a droid like that. Davik was having one custom built by Janice Nall.;[];;[17483];[17476];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06053_.mp3
Just tell her Canderous sent you and she'll sell you the droid. Then you can use it to get the launch codes from the Sith base.;[];;[17478, 17484];[17482];tar03_cand031;NM02AECAND30095_.mp3
Won't Davik be mad if I take his droid?;[];;[17485];[17483];tar03_cand031;
Davik paid for the droid, but I'm the guy he put in charge of this mission. He won't care how I come up with those codes.;[];;[17479];[17484];tar03_cand031;NM02AECAND30098_.mp3
I'll be back when I get those codes from the military base.;[];;[17487];[17474, 17493, 17491];tar03_cand031;
Good luck - you're going to need it. The entrance to the base is sealed up tight.;[];;[17476];[17486];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06065_.mp3
Why would I want to help you?;[];;[17453];[17451];tar03_cand031;
I need someone to steal the Sith launch codes from the base. Without those codes any ship leaving the atmosphere will be disintegrated by the Sith fleet's automated defense guns.;[];;[17490, 17494];[17450];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06044_.mp3
What's in this for me?;[];;[17491];[17489];tar03_cand031;
Here's the deal: you bring me those launch codes and I can provide the vehicle to get off the planet - Davik's flagship, the Ebon Hawk!;[];;[17473, 17475, 17486, 17492];[17490, 17494];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06046_.mp3
How are you going to manage that?;[];;[17493];[17491];tar03_cand031;
Uh-uh. Not yet. First, you bring me the launch codes. Then I'll tell you the rest of my plan.;[];;[17475, 17486];[17492];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06048_.mp3
Why should I help you?;[];;[17491];[17489];tar03_cand031;
You don't need to ally yourself with this... person. We should move on while we can.;[];;[17449];[17447];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06012_.mp3
Why are you telling me this?;[];;[17447];[17445];tar03_cand031;
What are you talking about?;[];;[17444];[17442];tar03_cand031;
Goodbye.;[];;[17499];[17442];tar03_cand031;
Hold on just a second. Believe me, you'll want to hear this.;[];;[17444];[17498];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06073_.mp3
I figured you'd be back. Neither one of us is getting off this planet unless we work together.;[];;[17501, 17505];[None];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06075_.mp3
Now, I know the Sith military base had a break in. I know it was you. I know you've got those departure codes I need.;[];;[17502];[17500];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06077_.mp3
So what do you say? We join forces and I can get you inside Davik's base - and right to the Ebon Hawk. We can go right now.;[];;[17456, 17458, 17503, 17504];[17501];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06079_.mp3
Sorry, I'm not interested.;[];;[17471];[17502, 17506];tar03_cand031;
Forget it, I don't trust you.;[];;[17471];[17502, 17506];tar03_cand031;
But we've got a small problem. I haven't heard about anyone breaking into the miliarty base yet, so I know you don't have those departure codes.;[];;[17506];[17500];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06084_.mp3
If you want me to help you, you've got to bring something to the table. So until you get those codes we really don't have much to talk about.;[];;[17503, 17504, 17507, 17508];[17505];tar03_cand031;NM03AECAND06086_.mp3
I'll be back when I get those codes.;[];;[17481];[17506];tar03_cand031;
How am I supposed to get inside the military base, again?;[];;[17476];[17506];tar03_cand031;
Hey, Stranger! Mysterious Stranger! Wow, look at you... a Jedi! Heh. No wonder I could never beat you. It's me - Duncan. Deadeye Duncan. From the dueling arena on Taris. Remember?;[];;[17510, 17547];[None];man26ad_duncan;NM26ADDUNC07000_.mp3
Deadeye Duncan. I remember.;[];;[17511];[17509];man26ad_duncan;
I'm glad to see you made it off of Taris alive... things were pretty bad when the Sith started their bombardment. But I guess getting off the planet would be easy for a Jedi, huh?;[];;[17512];[17510];man26ad_duncan;NM26ADDUNC07002_.mp3
Well, there were a handful of us who made it out. The lucky ones. I survived by breaking into the military base, overpowering a dozen Sith soldiers and stealing one of their own ships.;[];;[17513, 17544, 17546];[17511, 17547];man26ad_duncan;NM26ADDUNC07004_.mp3
You overpowered a dozen Sith?;[];;[17514];[17512];man26ad_duncan;
Well... when the bombing started the Sith sent down a bunch of auto-piloted ships to evacuate soldiers from the planet. I saw one and I figured it was a rescue ship, so I ran up to it.;[];;[17515];[17513, 17546];man26ad_duncan;NM26ADDUNC07006_.mp3
A Sith patrol was approaching from the other side, getting ready to board. When they saw me they all pulled their blasters. But it takes more than a dozen armed Sith soldiers to slow me down!;[];;[17516, 17545];[17514];man26ad_duncan;NM26ADDUNC07007_.mp3
You were pretty easy to slow down inside the dueling ring.;[];;[17517];[17515];man26ad_duncan;
Well, to tell the truth I didn't actually take the Sith out. A building fell on them. A chunk of building, actually. From the bombing. Crushed the whole bunch of them. Heh. Very messy.;[];;[17518];[17516, 17545];man26ad_duncan;NM26ADDUNC07010_.mp3
So there I was, all alone and standing by this empty evacuation ship. I climbed on board, overrode the auto-pilot controls and lifted off into orbit.;[];;[17519];[17517];man26ad_duncan;NM26ADDUNC07011_.mp3
The ship had all the Sith launch codes programmed in, so I didn't have to worry about being blasted from the sky. I just played it cool and tried to fly casual.;[];;[17520];[17518];man26ad_duncan;NM26ADDUNC07012_.mp3
In the confusion of the bombing, nobody paid any attention to my one little ship slipping away from the fleet. Once I was out of scanner range, I knew I was home free.;[];;[17521, 17544];[17519];man26ad_duncan;NM26ADDUNC07013_.mp3
So what are you doing here?;[];;[17522];[17520];man26ad_duncan;
"I've decided to become a mercenary. I came here looking for work; I heard the Republic was hiring. But they weren't interested in me. I guess I made a mistake by telling them who I was.";[];;[17523];[17521];man26ad_duncan;NM26ADDUNC07015_.mp3
They'd heard of me. Seems like everybody's heard of me. The legend of Deadeye Duncan, the worst duelist of all time, has spread far and wide across the galaxy. Makes it hard to earn a living, you know.;[];;[17524, 17541, 17542];[17522];man26ad_duncan;NM26ADDUNC07016_.mp3
Why is the Republic hiring mercenaries?;[];;[17525];[17523];man26ad_duncan;
I have no idea. All I know is that if I don't find some way to shake my reputation soon I'm going to have to find another line of work. It's too bad... hey, wait a minute!;[];;[17526];[17524, 17541];man26ad_duncan;NM26ADDUNC07018_.mp3
You're a Jedi now, so you probably won't be doing much dueling anymore, right? So the name Mysterious Stranger probably won't be much use to you anymore, right? So, uh... could I have it?;[];;[17527];[17525];man26ad_duncan;NM26ADDUNC07019_.mp3
I mean, if everyone's heard of Deadeye Duncan then they've probably heard of the Mysterious Stranger. But nobody knows anything about you except the name. You could be anybody: man, woman... me.;[];;[17528, 17540];[17526];man26ad_duncan;NM26ADDUNC07020_.mp3
You want to tell them you're the champion?;[];;[17529];[17527];man26ad_duncan;
If I say I'm the Mysterious Stranger, who's going to know? There'll be celebrity tours, maybe some endorsements... I could milk this thing for months. Well, right up until people see me fight.;[];;[17530];[17528, 17540];man26ad_duncan;NM26ADDUNC07022_.mp3
What do you say? Fame, celebrity: you don't need that. You're a Jedi! But I'm just a guy trying to earn a living. Come one, give me a break.;[];;[17531, 17535, 17538];[17529];man26ad_duncan;NM26ADDUNC07023_.mp3
Okay, the name is yours.;[];;[17532];[17530];man26ad_duncan;
Really? You mean it? Oh, this is great! Heh! No more jokes, no more snickering! When I tell people I'm the Mysterious Stranger they'll finally treat me with respect.;[];;[17533];[17531];man26ad_duncan;NM26ADDUNC07025_.mp3
Thanks a lot, Stranger. Oops, heh. I guess I shouldn't call you that now. People will think I'm talking to myself. Ha-ha!;[];;[17534];[17532];man26ad_duncan;NM26ADDUNC07026_.mp3
Anyway, I should be going. I'm heading off planet to look for work. Shouldn't be too hard, now that I'm the Taris duel champion! It was good seeing you again... and thanks.;[];;[];[17533];man26ad_duncan;NM26ADDUNC07027_.mp3
No, you can't take my credit.;[];;[17536];[17530];man26ad_duncan;
Eh, just forget I ever mentioned it. It was a dumb idea. I'll figure something out on my own.;[];;[17537];[17535, 17539];man26ad_duncan;NM26ADDUNC07029_.mp3
I probably should be going now, anyway. I'm heading off planet. Maybe I can find work somewhere else. Somewhere they've never heard of Deadeye Duncan. Goodbye, Stranger.;[];;[];[17536];man26ad_duncan;NM26ADDUNC07030_.mp3
If I ever find out you're impersonating me, I'll slice you open!;[];;[17539];[17530];man26ad_duncan;
Okay, okay. Settle down. No need to get violent. We're not in the duel ring right now.;[];;[17536];[17538];man26ad_duncan;NM26ADDUNC07032_.mp3
You'll never pull this off.;[];;[17529];[17527];man26ad_duncan;
So what are you going to do now?;[];;[17525];[17523];man26ad_duncan;
Great story. Goodbye.;[];;[17543];[17523];man26ad_duncan;
Oh, right. Okay. Goodbye then. I was just heading off planet anyway. Good to see you again, Stranger.;[];;[];[17542, 17544];man26ad_duncan;NM26ADDUNC07038_.mp3
Good, I'm happy for you. Goodbye.;[];;[17543];[17520, 17512];man26ad_duncan;
Do you expect me to believe this?;[];;[17517];[17515];man26ad_duncan;
Yeah, right. Why don't you tell me what really happened.;[];;[17514];[17512];man26ad_duncan;
How did you escape Taris?;[];;[17512];[17509];man26ad_duncan;
You fast, you quick. You even beat Twitch.;[];;[];[None];tar02_twitch;
Ready Aim Fire!! Is your trigger finger as itchy as mine?;[];;[17550, 17552, 17554];[None];tar02_twitch;
What the hell are you talking about?;[];;[17551];[17549];tar02_twitch;
Shoot first! Shoot last! Party with me, we'll have a blast!;[];;[17552];[17550, 17554];tar02_twitch;
Uh... okay. Goodbye then.;[];;[17553];[17551, 17549];tar02_twitch;
Blast away! Open fire! Shoot, kill, maim!;[];;[];[17552];tar02_twitch;
Are you completely insane?;[];;[17551];[17549];tar02_twitch;
You here with Selkath? You have questions for Gluupor? Gluupor already say everything he knows.;[]; player talks to gluupor, before gluupor tells him anything;[17556, 17579, 17581, 17583];[None];man26_gluupor;NM26ACGLUU03000_.mp3
I have questions about the murder of Elassa.;[];;[17557, 17558];[17555, 17580, 17582, 17585];man26_gluupor;
Gluupor already tell you everything, why you bother Gluupor more... Gluupor not answering any more question for you!;[];;[];[17556];man26_gluupor;NM26ACGLUU03002_.mp3
Gluupor tell everything to Selkath. You not know? Gluupor have no reason not to say. Gluupor tell everything. Everything about murder, everything about Sith lady's room.;[];;[17559, 17562, 17565, 17583];[17556];man26_gluupor;NM26ACGLUU03004_.mp3
Why were you at the hotel?;[];;[17560];[17558, 17564];man26_gluupor;
Gluupor staying at hotel. Gluupor not very rich - hotel much too rich for Gluupor to live at - but Gluupor save for weeks and have enough to stay here for a few days.;[];;[17561];[17559];man26_gluupor;NM26ACGLUU03006_.mp3
Using Gluupor's chance to live better for a while.;[];;[17562, 17565, 17583];[17560];man26_gluupor;NM26ACGLUU03008_.mp3
What did you see?;[];;[17563];[17561, 17558];man26_gluupor;
Gluupor not see murder, oh no. Gluupor did see Republic guy... the cripple... Sunry his name, Gluupor thinks. Gluupor see Sunry running away from scene of crime.;[];;[17564];[17562];man26_gluupor;NM26ACGLUU03010_.mp3
Gluupor see nothing else. Nothing else at all. Especially not in Sith lady's room!;[];;[17559, 17565, 17583];[17563];man26_gluupor;NM26ACGLUU03012_.mp3
What about Elassa's room?;[];;[17566];[17564, 17561, 17558];man26_gluupor;
Gluupor just curious... just curious to see what had happened. Gluupor have no reason to go into room... no one pay Gluupor to do it.;[];;[17567, 17574, 17576, 17583];[17565];man26_gluupor;NM26ACGLUU03014_.mp3
[Persuade] Did someone pay you to do something in that room Gluupor?;[];;[17568, 17573];[17566];man26_gluupor;
[Success] How you know someone pay Gluupor?!;[];;[17569];[17567, 17574];man26_gluupor;NM26ACGLUU03016_.mp3
Well... Sith man came up to Gluupor after murder, before Selkath arrive. He say he give Gluupor good money if Gluupor put medal into Sith's hand.;[];;[17570];[17568];man26_gluupor;NM26ACGLUU03018_.mp3
Gluupor good. Gluupor plant evidence and leave no trace. But Gluupor not recognize Sith man anyway. Gluupor not recognize humans very well.;[];;[17571];[17569];man26_gluupor;NM26ACGLUU03020_.mp3
No use to Selkath, so not bother to tell them. Well, that, and the Sith man say he kill Gluupor if Gluupor speaks. Uh... Oh, no...;[];;[17572];[17570];man26_gluupor;NM26ACGLUU03022_.mp3
Gluupor think... Gluupor think he can't talk more right now. Gluupor feels the need to lie down... maybe just stay here...;[{'Gluupor': 'Flirt'}];;[];[17571];man26_gluupor;NM26ACGLUU03024_.mp3
[Failure] No one pay Gluupor to do anything... that why Gluupor so poor...;[];;[17574, 17576, 17583];[17567];man26_gluupor;NM26ACGLUU03026_.mp3
[Persuade] How about if I give you 100 credits to tell me?;[];;[17568, 17575];[17573, 17566];man26_gluupor;
[Failure] Gluupor not saying anything... Gluupor have nothing to say.;[];;[17576, 17583];[17574];man26_gluupor;NM26ACGLUU03028_.mp3
[Force Persuade] You want to tell me who paid you and for what.;[{'Player': 'Persuade'}];;[17577];[17575, 17573, 17566];man26_gluupor;
[Success] Gluupor want to tell you. Gluupor want to tell you Sith paid him money to plant medal on body.;[];;[17578];[17576];man26_gluupor;NM26ACGLUU03030_.mp3
Gluupor want to tell you this because you are Gluupor's friend. Good friend... maybe give Gluupor money? Maybe not...;[];;[17579, 17581, 17583];[17577];man26_gluupor;NM26ACGLUU03032_.mp3
Do you know about a Star Map?;[];;[17580];[17578, 17582, 17555, 17585];man26_gluupor;
Gluupor not know what you talking about. But then again, Gluupor not very bright.;[];;[17556, 17581, 17583];[17579];man26_gluupor;NM26ACGLUU03034_.mp3
Do you know about the Selkath youths who have gone missing?;[];;[17582];[17580, 17578, 17555, 17585];man26_gluupor;
Gluupor heard of it, yes. But Gluupor been locked in this room for days. Gluupor think it rather poor insight to think he knows something.;[];;[17556, 17579, 17583];[17581];man26_gluupor;NM26ACGLUU03036_.mp3
I'll ask more questions later.;[];;[17584];[17582, 17580, 17578, 17575, 17573, 17566, 17564, 17561, 17558, 17555, 17585];man26_gluupor;
Gluupor answer later too, then. Selkath not let Gluupor leave while trial still on...;[];;[];[17583];man26_gluupor;NM26ACGLUU03038_.mp3
Why you back, human? Gluupor already tell you everything. Why you not leave Gluupor alone?;[]; if gluupor has told the player, but the player has not yet arranged to see the man who hired him;[17556, 17579, 17581, 17583];[None];man26_gluupor;NM26ACGLUU03040_.mp3
Have you heard the news? They say the Sith slaughtered a secret Jedi oupost on Dantooine in a vile and cowardly sneak attack.;[]; dantooine has been destroyed, first time conversation;[17587];[None];man26_tyvark;
Yet despite this monstrous act, the Selkath authorities insist on maintaining their neutrality - and the Sith walk amongst us like vermin in the streets of Ahto City!;[];;[17588];[17586];man26_tyvark;
But my feelings about the Sith are well known around Ahto City. I shall spare you further outbursts. What may I do for you?;[];;[17589, 17591];[17587, 17604, 17606, 17608];man26_tyvark;
Let me see what you have in stock.;[];;[17590];[17588, 17594, 17596, 17598, 17600, 17602, 17609];man26_tyvark;

As you wish, human. Please return when you have need of anything from my vast inventory.;[];;[];[17591];man26_tyvark;
Come in, come in! You honor my humble store with your presence. All of Manaan has heard tell of your glorious swoop riding exploits.;[]; player is famous swoop rider;[17594];[None];man26_tyvark;
I carry many other choice items of the highest quality. Items a celebrity of your stature might be interested in.;[];;[17589, 17591, 17595];[17593];man26_tyvark;
Do you know about the Sunry case?;[];Player is Sunry Arbiter;[17596];[17594, 17598, 17600, 17609];man26_tyvark;
Unfortunately, I cannot offer any great insight into this matter. I suggest you investigate the murder scene, or perhaps talk to the other residents of the hotel where the crime occured.;[];;[17589, 17591];[17595];man26_tyvark;
Welcome, welcome. This is a great time to be alive, as the Czerka Corp. has been driven from one of its outposts.;[]; player is famous pazaak player;[17598];[None];man26_tyvark;
"They lost their ""trading"" outpost on Kashyyyk - merely a slaver's den I've been told. News of this sort is welcome indeed to me. What can I do for you today?";[];;[17589, 17591, 17595];[17597];man26_tyvark;
I have heard from several customers that you are now the Arbiter during the murder trial of Sunry, the Republic war hero.;[];First time talked to while player is Arbiter in Sunry plot.;[17600];[None];man26_tyvark;

The Selkath say the kolto harvest is the lowest it has ever been, and healing salves have become extremely expensive.;[];;[17589, 17603];[17601];man26_tyvark;
Why do you dislike the Sith so much?;[];;[17604];[17602, 17609];man26_tyvark;
How can you ask such a question? They are cruel and ruthless, and care nothing for the welfare of others. And the Sith regard my species with particular disdain.;[];;[17588];[17603];man26_tyvark;
The Selkath now seem more distant than before... They treat members of the Republic at arms length only... I hope this does not negatively impact our trade.;[];;[17606];[None];man26_tyvark;
If they give too much deference to the Sith, then the monsters will simply come in and take over!;[];;[17588];[17605];man26_tyvark;

What is this, some kind of con game?;[];;[17618];[17613, 17620, 17611];k_hsenni_dialogx;
No, this is no game. I simply saw you drop this datapad and I wish to give it back to you.;[];;[17612, 17614, 17619, 17621];[17617];k_hsenni_dialogx;
I'm sorry, there must be some mistake.;[];;[17620];[17618, 17611];k_hsenni_dialogx;
There is no mistake, human. This datapad is yours and yours alone. Please, take it.;[];;[17612, 17614, 17617, 17621];[17619];k_hsenni_dialogx;
I don't want it.;[];;[17622];[17620, 17618, 17613];k_hsenni_dialogx;
Are you certain, human? Please, take the datapad.;[];;[17623, 17624, 17626];[17621];k_hsenni_dialogx;
Fine. Give me the stupid datapad!;[];;[17615];[17622];k_hsenni_dialogx;
No. It's not mine. I won't take it.;[];;[17625];[17622];k_hsenni_dialogx;
Very well, human. I will keep the datapad and I will leave. Goodbye, human.;[];;[];[17624, 17626];k_hsenni_dialogx;
I'll beat you to death with that datapad if you don't go away right now!;[];;[17625];[17622];k_hsenni_dialogx;
I saw you talking with Rukil. He told you his legends about the Promised Land, didn't he? He told you all about his missing apprentice and the other lost explorers, right?;[];;[17628];[None];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07000_.mp3
You know, most people don't believe his stories - they figure he's nothing but an old kook. But I think there might be some truth in what he's saying. That's why I want to stop him!;[];;[17629, 17680, 17682];[17627];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07002_.mp3
Stop him? What are you talking about?;[];;[17630];[17628];tar04_igear;
For an Outcast, I've got things pretty good. The village relies on me to bring in food and supplies - I'm an important man. If it wasn't for Gendar I'd be running this place.;[];;[17631, 17632];[17629, 17681];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07004_.mp3
I get the feeling if it wasn't for Gendar, this place would be a lot worse off than it is.;[];;[17632];[17630];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07074_.mp3
But if Rukil ever finds his Promised Land, I'm sunk. People won't need to rely on me anymore. I'll just be another nobody like all the rest of the villagers. I won't let that happen!;[];;[17633, 17677, 17678];[17631, 17630];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07006_.mp3
That's horrible! How can you be so self-centered?;[];;[17634];[17632];tar04_igear;
Don't judge me! I learned a long time ago that if I want to survive down here I've got to look out for number one.;[];;[17635];[17633];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07008_.mp3
The two explorers who went searching for the Promised Land might have found something. They might have found clues or evidence - just like Rukil's apprentice!;[];;[17636];[17634, 17677];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07011_.mp3
They would have recorded that information in their journals. I'll pay you if you bring all three journals to me - the two from the explorers and the one from Rukil's apprentice.;[];;[17637];[17635, 17679];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07013_.mp3
Then I can destroy the evidence and make sure nobody ever finds the Promised Land! I've saved up enough credits from my business here to make it worth your while if you help me.;[];;[17638, 17675, 17676];[17636];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07015_.mp3
Forget it! I won't betray Rukil and the village for you.;[];;[17639];[17637];tar04_igear;
Don't be a fool. I'm the only one here who can pay you for those journals. Rukil has nothing - he won't be able to come up with any kind of reward.;[];;[17640];[17638];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07017_.mp3
Once you have all three journals just bring them to me and I'll give you a decent reward. Now, was there something else you needed?;[];;[17641, 17656, 17668, 17670];[17639, 17675, 17676];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07020_.mp3
I have those journals you wanted.;[];Player has all of Rukil's journals;[17642];[17640, 17657, 17667, 17664, 17686];tar04_igear;
I knew Rukil's legends about the Promised Land were true! Quick - give me those journals so I can destroy them!;[];;[17643, 17652];[17641];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07060_.mp3
First hand over those credits you promised.;[];;[17644];[17642];tar04_igear;
"Right - your reward. Here's 100 credits; that's a pretty hefty payment for some old notes and maps, eh?";[];;[17645, 17649, 17652];[17643];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07062_.mp3
100 credits sounds fair. Here's the journals.;[];;[17646];[17644, 17655];tar04_igear;
Excellent - now Rukil will never lead these people to the Promised Land! Now, is there something else you need? You want to look at my inventory?;[];;[17647];[17645, 17651];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07064_.mp3
False prophet! Deceiver! You have betrayed me! You have sold the hope of the entire village to the selfish and damnable Igear!;[{'Rukil04': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[17648];[17646];tar04_igear;NM04AARUKI25000_.mp3
All I have worked for is destroyed! All the hopes and dreams of my father and grandfather before him turned to dust! Begone, up-worlder - I have only curses to speak at you!;[{'Rukil04': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[];[17647];tar04_igear;NM04AARUKI25002_.mp3
[Persuade] 100 credits? After all I went through? I want double that!;[];;[17650, 17654];[17644];tar04_igear;
[Success] Well, I don't want Rukil to get his hands on them journals. I'll give you 200 credits - that's all I have.;[];;[17651, 17652];[17649];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07066_.mp3
200 credits? It's a deal!;[];;[17646];[17650];tar04_igear;
I've changed my mind. I'm going to give them to Rukil.;[];;[17653];[17650, 17655, 17644, 17642];tar04_igear;
Fine - go to Rukil! But he won't be able to pay you anything for those journals. Come back and see me when you're ready to stop acting crazy and you want to cut a deal.;[];;[];[17652];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07072_.mp3
[Failure] I don't think you understand how much 100 credits is worth down here in the Undercity. This is a small fortune!;[];;[17655];[17649];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07068_.mp3
I want those journals, but I'm not rich like you up-worlders. 100 credits is all I can afford.;[];;[17645, 17652];[17654];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07070_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;[];;[17657];[17640, 17667, 17685, 17686];tar04_igear;
Oh, you better ask Gendar - he's the spokesman for the village. I just run the store. I don't want to make him mad by answering any questions. Gendar already doesn't like me.;[];;[17641, 17658, 17665, 17668, 17670];[17656];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07037_.mp3
Why doesn't Gendar like you?;[];;[17659];[17657];tar04_igear;
Gendar seems to think I should share the profits of my store with the whole village. He figures we're all in this together so it should be share and share alike.;[];;[17660];[17658];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07039_.mp3
But I'm the one who runs the store! I'm the one who makes the deals! The others just bring me salvage to trade with the up-worlders - why should they get anything?;[];;[17661, 17672, 17674];[17659];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07041_.mp3
That's a pretty selfish attitude.;[];;[17662];[17660];tar04_igear;
Hey, you don't know what it's like down here! I have to claw and scrape to survive - nobody else will look out for me. But Gendar doesn't agree with my philosophy.;[];;[17663];[17661];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07043_.mp3
He caught me hoarding supplies a while back. I figured I'd wait until food was scarce and then I could offer it to people who'd follow me instead of Gendar. Then I'd be the leader!;[];;[17664];[17662, 17673, 17674];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07049_.mp3
But Gendar made me share my hoard. Ever since then he hasn't trusted me. He keeps me around because of my store, though. Without it this village wouldn't stand a chance.;[];;[17641, 17665, 17668, 17670];[17663];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07051_.mp3
How do you manage to run a store here in the Undercity?;[];;[17666];[17664, 17657, 17685];tar04_igear;
If a villager comes across any useful salvage in the Undercity they bring it to me. Every so often members from the Lower City gangs come down to trade for the salvage.;[];;[17667];[17665];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07033_.mp3
They'll exchange food and medicine for engine parts, old blasters and the like. Sometimes they even give me credits if I have some really good stuff.;[];;[17641, 17656, 17668, 17670];[17666];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07035_.mp3
Let me see your inventory.;[];;[17669];[17667, 17664, 17657, 17640, 17685, 17686];tar04_igear;
It ain't the best stuff - mostly salvage and such. But the prices are right.;[];;[];[17668];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07053_.mp3
I'll be going now.;[];;[17671];[17667, 17664, 17657, 17640, 17685, 17686];tar04_igear;
Yeah, okay. You come back and see me if you want to deal.;[];;[];[17670];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07056_.mp3
I agree with you - your store, your profits.;[];;[17673];[17660];tar04_igear;
Exactly my point. But Gendar doesn't see it that way.;[];;[17663];[17672];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07046_.mp3
That's why Gendar's mad at you? There has to be more to it than that!;[];;[17663];[17660];tar04_igear;
I'll think about it.;[];;[17640];[17637];tar04_igear;
Sounds like a good deal to me.;[];;[17640];[17637];tar04_igear;
So what do you want me to do?;[];;[17635];[17632];tar04_igear;
You want me to kill Rukil to shut him up?;[];;[17679];[17632];tar04_igear;
I don't want you to kill Rukil - he's not the problem. It's those damn explorers that went before him. What if they actually found something?;[];;[17636];[17678];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07023_.mp3
Why are you telling me this?;[];;[17681];[17628];tar04_igear;
Oh, don't worry, I'll make this quick. I've got an offer that might be worth your while.;[];;[17630];[17680, 17682];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07027_.mp3
I don't have time for this.;[];;[17681];[17628];tar04_igear;
Hey, you ain't from the village! You're from the up-world, ain't you? Yes, you've got credits I bet.;[];;[17684, 17685];[None];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07029_.mp3
Watch yourself. There's something slimy about this guy. I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw him.;[];;[17685];[17683];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07075_.mp3
My name's Igear. I run a little salvage shop here. You want to buy something from my store? I got some good deals.;[];;[17656, 17665, 17668, 17670];[17684, 17683];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07031_.mp3
Hey there, up-worlder. You want to see what I got for sale in my inventory? Or do you need something else?;[];;[17641, 17656, 17668, 17670];[None];tar04_igear;NM04AAIGEA07058_.mp3

Err... do I know you?;[];;[17690];[17688];kor33b_belaya;
So you do not even have the decency to remember me? I have cursed your name every moment since we last met on Dantooine.;[];;[17691];[17689];kor33b_belaya;NM35AABELA25003_.mp3
I am Belaya, once of the Jedi but now of the Sith... it was your murder of Juhani that placed this bitter blackness in my heart!;[];;[17692];[17690, 17700];kor33b_belaya;NM35AABELA25012_.mp3
I couldn't touch you on Dantooine, but I can, here! The Sith have taught me the power of freedom... and revenge! FOR JUHANI!!;[{'Belaya': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[];[17691, 17698];kor33b_belaya;NM35AABELA25013_.mp3
[Persuade] No, the Jedi certainly didn't send me here.;[];;[17694, 17697];[17688];kor33b_belaya;
[Success] I see. So you have come to join the Sith as I have? I should have known that would happen, as should the Council.;[];;[17695];[17693];kor33b_belaya;NM35AABELA25005_.mp3
The Council is nothing but a slow and doddering farce, placing all their trust in you... and you failed them, just as you failed Juhani.;[];;[17696];[17694];kor33b_belaya;NM35AABELA25006_.mp3
Do you even remember me? I am Belaya, and it is your murder of Juhani that brought me here. Fortunately, I have learned the power of revenge!;[{'Belaya': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[];[17695];kor33b_belaya;NM35AABELA25007_.mp3
[Failure] You do not fool me for a second! The Council fawns over you and places all their hope in you to save them... you wouldn't turn on them!;[{'Belaya': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[17698];[17693];kor33b_belaya;NM35AABELA25008_.mp3
You are a spy... and a murderer. It was you who killed Juhani and placed this bitter blackness in my heart that I cannot get rid of!;[{'Belaya': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[17692];[17697];kor33b_belaya;NM35AABELA25009_.mp3
I'll not suffer your insults!;[];;[17700];[17688];kor33b_belaya;
But you will! You pretend to be a Sith, but I know who you are! I have cursed your name every moment since we last met on Dantooine!;[{'Belaya': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[17691];[17699];kor33b_belaya;NM35AABELA25011_.mp3

[Persuade/Lie] Sorry. I'm new here. I must have gotten lost.;[];;[17704, 17716];[17702];tar10_vulklabt01;
[Success] Another new mechanic? Brejik's gone crazy - he's hiring anyone who ever picked up a blast torch!;[];;[17705];[17703];tar10_vulklabt01;
Well, you can't just go wandering around the spice labs! All you mechanics have to stay on the north side of the floor- you should know that!;[];;[17706, 17709, 17713, 17715];[17704];tar10_vulklabt01;

Look, you should just go. This is my private room - there's nothing for you here. All the spice stays in the lab next door. Now get out of here or I'll have to call the guards.;[];;[17709, 17711];[17707, 17714];tar10_vulklabt01;

I'm just looking around.;[];;[17714];[17705, 17717];tar10_vulklabt01;
Looking for some spice, I'll bet! They warned me that a lot of you mechanics were addicts who would come snooping around looking for a fix.;[];;[17708];[17713];tar10_vulklabt01;
I'm here to kill you.;[];;[17712];[17705, 17702, 17717];tar10_vulklabt01;

Hey, there. I didn't think we'd be chatting again so soon. You took off on me pretty quick last time.;[];;[17982];[None];tar02_yungenda21;NM02AEYUNG26050_.mp3
I'm actually a little surprised you're talking to me at all... most of the people here on Taris can't stand us Sith. It can make this a pretty lonely job.;[];;[17979, 17983, 18001, 18005];[17981];tar02_yungenda21;NM02AEYUNG26057_.mp3
[Persuade] You're just doing your job, right? I don't hold that against you.;[];;[17984, 17999];[17982, 18004];tar02_yungenda21;
[Success] That's true, but people don't appreciate what we've done for them. We could have slapped a curfew on this whole planet, but we didn't.;[];;[17985];[17983];tar02_yungenda21;NM02AEYUNG26059_.mp3
You know, it's like everyone on this backwater planet is in a permanent bad mood. Don't they know they have to make the best of things?;[];;[17986, 17998];[17984, 18009];tar02_yungenda21;NM02AEYUNG26074_.mp3
You've got a pretty positive attitude.;[];;[17987];[17985, 18008];tar02_yungenda21;
Exactly! It's all about attitude. I didn't ask to be assigned to this backwater planet, but I try to make the best of it!;[];;[17988];[17986, 17998];tar02_yungenda21;NM02AEYUNG26076_.mp3
It's pretty easy to get depressed on an assignment like this, but we do what we can to keep our spirits up.;[];;[17989, 17997];[17987];tar02_yungenda21;NM02AEYUNG26077_.mp3
You need to blow off steam once in a while.;[];;[17990];[17988];tar02_yungenda21;
That's true. It's nice to meet someone who understands what I'm going through. It's good to talk about this stuff - it gets pretty lonely up at the military base.;[];;[17991];[17989, 17997];tar02_yungenda21;NM02AEYUNG26079_.mp3
I have to get going soon - I've got a shift at the military base. But some of us junior Sith officers are having a party tonight to blow off some steam.;[];;[17992];[17990];tar02_yungenda21;NM02AEYUNG26080_.mp3
I'd really like to see you again. Why don't you drop by the party? I'll show you where it is on your map.;[];;[17993, 17995];[17991];tar02_yungenda21;NM02AEYUNG26081_.mp3
Sounds good. I'll be there.;[];;[17994];[17992];tar02_yungenda21;
Don't be late. We're starting right after our shifts end. Most of us won't even be going back to the base to lock up our uniforms. I look forward to seeing you there.;[];;[];[17993, 17996];tar02_yungenda21;NM02AEYUNG26083_.mp3
I don't think I can make it.;[];;[17996];[17992];tar02_yungenda21;
Just because I'm with the Sith doesn't mean I don't know how to have a good time. You'll enjoy yourself. I promise.;[];;[17994];[17995];tar02_yungenda21;NM02AEYUNG26085_.mp3
It must be tough, being stationed on a hostile world.;[];;[17990];[17988];tar02_yungenda21;
Everybody has their ups and downs... it's how you deal with them that counts.;[];;[17987];[17985, 18008];tar02_yungenda21;
[Failure] Save the sympathetic best friend act. I'm not buying it.;[];;[18000];[17983, 18007];tar02_yungenda21;NM02AEYUNG26060_.mp3
But I don't want to fill out a bunch of paperwork on my day off, so let's just pretend this conversation never happened. Now move along.;[];;[];[17999];tar02_yungenda21;NM02AEYUNG26061_.mp3
You can't really blame people... you did conquer the planet.;[];;[18002];[17982];tar02_yungenda21;
"Oh, great... I see where this is going: the Sith are evil; why did I join them; blah, blah, blah. I don't need a lecture from the likes of you.";[];;[18003, 18010];[18001];tar02_yungenda21;NM02AEYUNG26063_.mp3
Sorry - I'm not trying to judge you.;[];;[18004];[18002, 18013];tar02_yungenda21;
Ah, it's okay. I might have overreacted a bit. But can you blame me? Everywhere I look I see one of you Tarisians glaring at me with hate in your eyes.;[];;[17983, 18005];[18003];tar02_yungenda21;NM02AEYUNG26065_.mp3
I'm not actually from Taris. I'm just stuck here until the quarantine ends.;[];;[18006];[18004, 17982];tar02_yungenda21;
You're an off-worlder? Huh, I figured you'd be even more angry, being stuck on a foreign planet and all.;[];;[18007, 18009];[18005];tar02_yungenda21;NM02AEYUNG26070_.mp3
[Persuade] Hey, we're both strangers on Taris. We have to stick together.;[];;[17999, 18008];[18006];tar02_yungenda21;
[Success] You're right! It's like everyone on this backwater planet is in a permanent bad mood. Don't they know they have to make the best of things?;[];;[17986, 17998];[18007];tar02_yungenda21;NM02AEYUNG26072_.mp3
Being stuck on Taris isn't so bad... but the locals aren't much fun.;[];;[17985];[18006];tar02_yungenda21;
You seem pretty touchy about this. Maybe you feel a little guilty about what you do.;[];;[18011];[18002, 18013];tar02_yungenda21;
Don't try to analyze me. I'm just doing my job - same as any other soldier in any other army. Besides, I don't have to explain myself to you!;[];;[18012];[18010];tar02_yungenda21;NM02AEYUNG26067_.mp3
I don't think we have much else to say to each other. Let's just keep this civil and go our separate ways, okay?;[];;[];[18011];tar02_yungenda21;NM02AEYUNG26068_.mp3
Back again? Didn't I make myself clear enough? The senior Sith officers don't like us fraternizing with the locals. Besides, I don't need you lecturing me for my career choice.;[];;[17966, 18003, 18010];[None];tar02_yungenda21;NM02AEYUNG26051_.mp3
Hi there - I haven't seen you around before. Of course they don't give us Sith officers from the military base much time off...;[];;[17972, 17979];[None];tar02_yungenda21;NM02AEYUNG26054_.mp3
So, Canderous - I see you have brought someone with you. Most intriguing, if I do say so myself. You usually travel alone.;[];Cut scene dialog that begins as soon as player is spawned into area. Canderous MUST be with the player (he's the one who gets them inside Davik's base). First exit - move party to Ebon Hawk base Second exit point - move party to 8.02 room;[18016];[None];tar08_davik081;NM08AADAVI08000_.mp3
It's not like you to take on partners, Canderous. You're getting soft.;[];;[18017];[18015];tar08_davik081;NM08AADAVI08002_.mp3
Watch yourself, Calo. You may be the newest kath hound in the pack, but you aren't top dog yet!;[];;[18018];[18016];tar08_davik081;NM08AADAVI08004_.mp3
Enough! I won't have my top two men killing each other - that's not good business. I'm sure Canderous has an explanation as to why he's not working solo anymore.;[];;[18019];[18017];tar08_davik081;NM08AADAVI08006_.mp3
This is a special case, Davik. I ran into someone the Exchange might want to recruit. You may have heard something of their exploits already.;[];;[18020];[18018];tar08_davik081;NM08AADAVI08008_.mp3
Ah, yes - now I recognize your companion. The rider who won the big swoop race. Very impressive... as was your display in the rather heated battle afterwards.;[];;[18021, 18042, 18043, 18045];[18019];tar08_davik081;NM08AADAVI08010_.mp3
Good to finally meet you, Davik. My name's <FullName>.;[];;[18022];[18020];tar08_davik081;
You know, Canderous was right. The Exchange is always looking for new talent. You could have a bright future with our organization.;[];;[18023];[18021, 18042];tar08_davik081;NM08AADAVI08012_.mp3
With a recommendation from Canderous - and a thorough background check - you could become part of the Exchange. Many would kill to prove themselves worthy of this honor.;[];;[18024, 18040];[18022, 18044, 18046];tar08_davik081;NM08AADAVI08020_.mp3
Your offer intrigues me, Davik.;[];;[18025];[18023];tar08_davik081;
Come with me - I will give you a tour of my operations. I'm certain you'll be most impressed.;[];;[18026];[18024, 18041];tar08_davik081;NM08AADAVI08025_.mp3
"Ah, there she is - the Ebon Hawk. My pride and joy; the fastest ship in the Outer Rim! Note the state of the art security system I've had installed to protect her.";[];;[18027];[18025];tar08_davik081;NM08AADAVI08027_.mp3
The shields are completely impregnable. Nobody can get past them without the codes to try and steal my baby. Unfortunately, the Sith military blockade has grounded my vessel.;[];;[18028];[18026];tar08_davik081;NM08AADAVI08029_.mp3
The Ebon Hawk can outrun any vessel in the galaxy, but even she isn't fast enough to avoid the auto-targeting laser cannons of the orbiting Sith fleet.;[];;[18029];[18027];tar08_davik081;NM08AADAVI08031_.mp3
I am, of course, working on acquiring the Sith departure codes so that I may come and go as I please. However, progress has been slow... but we should continue our tour.;[];;[18030];[18028];tar08_davik081;NM08AADAVI08033_.mp3
These will be your accommodations. The slave quarters are just down the hall. If you need anything during your stay - food, a massage - feel free to call upon their services.;[];;[18031];[18029];tar08_davik081;NM08AADAVI08035_.mp3
If all goes well with your background check you will be invited to join the Exchange. I'd advise you to accept the offer when it comes - or suffer the dire consequences of refusal.;[];;[18032, 18038, 18039];[18030];tar08_davik081;NM08AADAVI08037_.mp3
I'm looking forward to working with you, Davik.;[];;[18033];[18031];tar08_davik081;
"You will stay in these rooms as my guest for the next few days; I will not accept no for an answer. Feel free to visit the slave quarters at any time during your stay.";[];;[18034];[18032, 18038, 18039];tar08_davik081;NM08AADAVI08041_.mp3
I must warn you that if you are found anywhere outside the guest wing during your stay - or if you bother my other guests - my security forces will deal with you most harshly.;[];;[18035];[18033];tar08_davik081;NM08AADAVI08043_.mp3
I will return after the investigation into your background is complete. Until then, make yourself comfortable. Come, Calo, let us leave our guests in peace.;[];;[18036];[18034];tar08_davik081;NM08AADAVI08045_.mp3
Okay, we're inside. Now all we have to do is figure out a way to get past the Ebon Hawk's security system and we can get the rest of your group and get off this planet!;[];;[18037];[18035];tar08_davik081;NM08AADAVI08047_.mp3
No sense waiting around here, though. The sooner we get off Taris the better.;[];;[];[18036];tar08_davik081;NM08AADAVI08049_.mp3
I'm sorry, but I can't stay.;[];;[18033];[18031];tar08_davik081;
Am I a prisoner here?;[];;[18033];[18031];tar08_davik081;
Sorry, I'm not interested.;[];;[18041];[18023];tar08_davik081;
Don't be so hasty. Our allies end up much better off than our enemies - as both Canderous and Calo Nord could surely tell you. The Exchange has much to offer.;[];;[18025];[18040];tar08_davik081;NM08AADAVI08023_.mp3
It was nothing I couldn't handle.;[];;[18022];[18020];tar08_davik081;
Brejik had to learn that double-crossers tend to end up dead!;[];;[18044];[18020];tar08_davik081;
An important lesson to learn, no doubt. In my line of business I've seen far too many people suffer for not understanding it.;[];;[18023];[18043];tar08_davik081;NM08AADAVI08015_.mp3
I didn't know you were a swoop fan.;[];;[18046];[18020];tar08_davik081;
A casual fan at best, but everyone on Taris follows the big season opener. But we have more important issues to discuss now.;[];;[18023];[18045];tar08_davik081;NM08AADAVI08018_.mp3

Ah, the Arbiter. Since you have been permitted to defend Sunry against these accusations I shall assist how I can.;[];;[18067, 18072, 18078, 18084];[None];man26_seljud4;
What do you think of Sunry?;[];;[18068];[18066, 18077, 18083];man26_seljud4;
Sunry was a great warrior in his time. He fought for the Republic against the Sith aggression and proved valorous.;[];;[18069];[18067];man26_seljud4;
I have great respect for his accomplishments and find it tragic that he finds himself in his current condition.;[];;[18070];[18068];man26_seljud4;
If the Republic had more individuals like him right now, I do not believe the Sith would be so great a problem for your people.;[];;[18071];[18069];man26_seljud4;
Is there any other way I can assist you?;[];;[18072, 18078, 18084];[18070];man26_seljud4;
Is there anything suspicious about this case?;[];;[18073];[18071, 18083, 18066];man26_seljud4;
I find it questionable that a man with such a reputable past as Sunry would murder a Sith woman. Especially not from behind.;[];;[18074];[18072];man26_seljud4;
But knowing the Sith, there was probably some deception involved. They seek to do the same thing to us here.;[];;[18075];[18073];man26_seljud4;
There has been much pressure by the Sith on our government - and even on the judges themselves - to deliver a guilty verdict in this case.;[];;[18076];[18074];man26_seljud4;
But the letter of the law is absolute, and we will not be compromised for Sith power-games.;[];;[18077];[18075];man26_seljud4;
Is there anything else you need?;[];;[18067, 18078, 18084];[18076];man26_seljud4;
What do you think of the Republic and the Sith Empire?;[];;[18079];[18077, 18071, 18066];man26_seljud4;
I find this great battle being waged across the galaxy both disturbing and, ultimately, tragic.;[];;[18080];[18078];man26_seljud4;
For all its faults, your tottering Republic has benefitted the vast majority of the galaxy for many millenia. To see it fall into ruin in such a short time...;[];;[18081];[18079];man26_seljud4;
I do not like the Sith, that I make no effort to hide. I will even admit that if given the option, I would rule that we should join the Republic.;[];;[18082];[18080];man26_seljud4;
But I must remain impartial and rule on this case as the law requires.;[];;[18083];[18081];man26_seljud4;
Do you have any additional questions?;[];;[18067, 18072, 18084];[18082];man26_seljud4;
I have no more questions for now.;[];;[18085];[18083, 18077, 18071, 18066];man26_seljud4;
If there is anything else you require, feel free to inquire with me.;[];;[];[18084];man26_seljud4;
Republic citizens are welcome on Manaan, but official inquiries should go through the proper channels.;[];;[18087, 18088];[None];man26_seljud4;
Your function with the courts is complete. You should not interrupt our proceddings in this manner.;[];;[];[18086];man26_seljud4;

Excellent. As always, my selection is somewhat limited. Czerka Corp. has a monopoly on some of the suppliers.;[];;[18101];[18099];dan13_crattis;
But I'm sure you'll find all my inventory is of the highest quality... and I've got a few special items you won't find anywhere else!;[];;[];[18100];dan13_crattis;

Don't get me started on Czerka Corp.!;[{'Crattis Yurkal': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[18104];[18102];dan13_crattis;
They've got a monopoly on half the galaxy already, and they do everything they can to keep anyone else from getting a foothold in their territory: extortion, bribing officials and government diplomats.;[];;[18105];[18103];dan13_crattis;
Not to mention driving up prices on essentials like food and water on distant colonies. I've heard stories of them letting people starve to death because they couldn't afford their jacked-up prices!;[];;[18106];[18104];dan13_crattis;
And since they've thrown themselves in with the Sith, things have only gotten worse.;[];;[18107, 18112, 18113, 18114];[18105];dan13_crattis;
Worse? How has it gotten worse?;[];;[18108];[18106];dan13_crattis;
The Sith are tangled up in an expensive war with the Republic. They need supplies, equipment, resources.;[];;[18109];[18107, 18112];dan13_crattis;
There's lots of opportunities for a company with no morals, like Czerka Corp., to make some major profits. Malak has given them exclusive trading rights wherever the Sith have control.;[];;[18110];[18108];dan13_crattis;
It's bad enough they're helping to finance the Sith war effort, but I've heard rumors of even worse stuff.;[];;[18111];[18109];dan13_crattis;
Slaving, pillaging planets of their resources, genocide of indigenous species. The Sith and Czerka Corp. seem like a perfect match to me. Ah, listen to me going on...;[];;[18098];[18110];dan13_crattis;
Do you mean Czerka Corp. are allied with the Sith?;[];;[18108];[18106];dan13_crattis;

Be sure to come back every now and again. I'm always getting more inventory in. You never know what I might have in stock, and my prices are always better than those crooks at Czerka Corp.!;[];;[];[18114];dan13_crattis;
What have you heard about the Mandalorian raiders?;[];;[18117];[18098, 18150, 18152];dan13_crattis;
They're vermin, mostly. Leftovers from the Mandalorian Wars. They lost their armies and worlds and now wander the galaxy raiding weak farms and outposts.;[];;[18118, 18119];[18116];dan13_crattis;
They are the scum who could not stand defeat and fled the final battles. They do us no credit.;[];;[18119];[18117];dan13_crattis;NM13AACRAT07050_.mp3
Any reasonably well-defended base could withstand them. This Enclave, for instance, would never fall to them.;[];;[18120];[18118, 18117];dan13_crattis;
They do make trouble for the farmers though... They're almost as much of a burden on ordinary people as that damn Czerka Corporation! But I digress...;[];;[18098];[18119];dan13_crattis;

I have my sources. Anyway, I've got a little proposal for you.;[];;[18126];[18124];dan13_crattis;
Those kinrath caves are crawling with crystals. Valuable crystals. Sure, the Jedi use them to make their lightsabers. But it's not like they need them all, right?;[];;[18127];[18125, 18143];dan13_crattis;
I'd pay very handsomely for any crystals that happened to end up in my eager hands.;[];;[18128, 18140, 18141];[18126];dan13_crattis;
I doubt the Order would approve of such a transaction.;[];;[18129];[18127];dan13_crattis;
It's not like you have to tell the Jedi Council what you're doing. And it's not like anyone's going to miss a few extra crystals, right? Anyway, think about it.;[];;[18130];[18128, 18140];dan13_crattis;
Bring me those crystals here and I'll buy them from you, no questions asked. You might want to keep one for yourself, though. You'll need it for your lightsaber.;[];;[18131, 18132, 18133, 18134, 18135, 18138, 18139];[18129, 18141];dan13_crattis;

You wouldn't be the first, you know. I don't think the Jedi Council approves, but they don't make a big deal about it. They've got more important things to worry about.;[];;[18138];[18136, 18132];dan13_crattis;
But enough of this. I'm sure there's another reason you came in to my shop. What can I do for you?;[];;[18099, 18114];[18137, 18131, 18130];dan13_crattis;

I think you answered your own question by becoming Sector Champion. It's obviously a good place for you to race. Me too, I guess.;[];player champ;[18219];[18217];man26_queedle;

I can't get used to the Sith presence here, but everyone is interested in Manaan to some degree. It's all because of the kolto.;[];;[18215, 18245, 18247, 18249];[18243];man26_queedle;
What do you know about kolto?;[];;[18246];[18244, 18248];man26_queedle;

Have the Sith been a problem?;[];;[18248];[18246, 18244];man26_queedle;
No, but it's unnerving to have them here, especially after what happened on Taris. The swoop circuit was really hurt by that, I'm sure you know.;[];;[18215, 18245, 18249];[18247];man26_queedle;

Commentary: I like the sound of this! Warming up blasters... on your command, master!;[];;[18339];[18337];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07004_.mp3
You're joking, of course. You want to fight me here? In the academy?;[];;[18340, 18342];[18338, 18337];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07005_.mp3
That's right!;[];;[18341];[18339];kor35_lashowe;
Ha ha ha! Oh, I wonder what Master Uthar will think of this! Alright, then... you have yourself a fight!;[{'Lashowe': 'Talk_Laughing'}];;[];[18340];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07007_.mp3
I suppose not.;[];;[18343];[18339];kor35_lashowe;
I thought not. Get lost, then, will you? I'm busy.;[{'Lashowe': 'Taunt'}];;[];[18342];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07009_.mp3
But I helped you get the holocron!;[];;[18345];[18336, 18347];kor35_lashowe;
So? That's your problem, not mine.;[];;[18337, 18346, 18348];[18344];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07011_.mp3
You betrayed me, you traitorous...!;[];;[18347];[18345, 18336];kor35_lashowe;
Ha ha ha! Look... either do something about it or run along, will you? I have prestige to earn.;[{'Lashowe': 'Talk_Laughing'}];;[18337, 18344, 18348];[18346];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07013_.mp3
Fine. I'll go, now.;[];;[18349, 18350, 18351];[18347, 18345, 18336];kor35_lashowe;
Do run along... you have a long way to catch up, after all.;[];;[];[18348, 18421, 18431];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07099_.mp3
Mmm. Don't trip or kill yourself or anything.;[];;[];[18348, 18421, 18431];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07100_.mp3
I'll get more prestige and catch up to you. Count on it.;[];;[];[18348, 18421, 18431];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07101_.mp3
You? I remember you from the colony. I can't believe you actually made it into the academy.;[];;[18353, 18355, 18421, 18427, 18432];[None];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07015_.mp3
Who are you?;[];;[18354, 18429];[18352, 18433];kor35_lashowe;
My name is Lashowe. Remember it, for I'll be the one who earns the prestige to move on. You'll have to be satisfied with next year, I suppose.;[];she hates the PC;[18355, 18421, 18427];[18353];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07017_.mp3
You're trying to become a Sith as well?;[];;[18356];[18354, 18429, 18352, 18433];kor35_lashowe;
Just figured that out, did you? It just so happens that I have a sure-fire way of pulling ahead in this little contest of ours. You don't really have a chance.;[];;[18357, 18421, 18422, 18423, 18427];[18355];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07021_.mp3
And what way is that?;[];;[18358];[18356];kor35_lashowe;
I've found an artifact that will impress Uthar far more than anything you could ever scrounge up. I'll win for sure.;[];;[18359, 18409, 18422];[18357];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07023_.mp3
Why haven't you brought it to Uthar yet?;[];;[18360];[18358];kor35_lashowe;
I don't have it just yet. I'll get it... when I'm good and ready.;[];;[18361, 18363, 18421];[18359];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07025_.mp3
Where is this artifact?;[];;[18362];[18360];kor35_lashowe;
Hah! Like I would tell you. Why don't I just let you rob me while you're at it?;[];;[18363, 18421];[18361];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07027_.mp3
It's guarded, isn't it?;[];;[18364];[18362, 18360];kor35_lashowe;
So what if it is? I'll get it eventually, regardless. Nothing good comes without a bit of a fight... that's the Sith motto, more or less.;[];;[18365, 18409, 18418, 18419];[18363];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07029_.mp3
[Persuade/Lie] Maybe I could help you get it?;[];;[18366, 18369, 18411, 18412, 18416];[18364];kor35_lashowe;
Now where are you going with this, I wonder?;[];;[18367, 18369, 18411];[18365, 18418, 18422];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07031_.mp3
Shut up, old man, and don't spoil anything or I'll twist that scrawny neck of yours.;[];;[18368];[18366];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07032_.mp3
It was just an idle question. Don't get so testy, damn it.;[];;[18369, 18411];[18367];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07033_.mp3
[Success] Help me get it? I don't know...;[];;[18370];[18368, 18366, 18415, 18412, 18417, 18416, 18365, 18432];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07040_.mp3
Hmph. I suppose I *could* use some help. The artifact I know of certainly won't be easy to take. But why should I work with you?;[];;[18371, 18385, 18406, 18409];[18369, 18418, 18422];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07048_.mp3
[Force Persuade] Because you want to work with me.;[];;[18372, 18384];[18370];kor35_lashowe;
[Success] Yes, I do... want to work with you. I suppose it's possible that Master Uthar could award both of us prestige. We'd be ahead of the others, for sure...;[{'Player': 'Persuade'}];;[18373];[18371];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07050_.mp3
Unfortunately, the holocron lies in the gullet of a tuk'ata mother. I can arrange for us to 'meet' her, but you're going to have to help me in putting her down.;[];;[18374];[18372, 18390, 18407];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07061_.mp3
That make sense to you? Go into the valley when you're prepared enough. I'll be amongst the central pillars, near the north end.;[];;[18375, 18378, 18380, 18382];[18373];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07062_.mp3
And I'm just supposed to trust you?;[];;[18376];[18374, 18379, 18381];kor35_lashowe;
And I'm just supposed to trust *you*? You're the one who asked to work on this, remember?;[];;[18377];[18375];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07064_.mp3
You watch me and I'll watch you. I don't trust you any more than you trust me. If you don't like that, don't come.;[];;[18378, 18380, 18382];[18376];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07065_.mp3
Why do you think this holocron is so important?;[];;[18379];[18377, 18381, 18374];kor35_lashowe;
Because it probably contains secrets from the time when the Sith ruins on this planet first existed. You don't think that Master Uthar would find that impressive?;[];;[18375, 18380, 18382];[18378];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07067_.mp3
What is a holocron?;[];;[18381];[18379, 18377, 18374];kor35_lashowe;
A holocron... this holocron, anyway... is an ancient recording device. It can store and display large amounts of information.;[];;[18375, 18378, 18382];[18380];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07069_.mp3
See you there.;[];;[18383];[18381, 18379, 18377, 18374];kor35_lashowe;
Remember: the central pillars in the valley. I'll be waiting, so don't take too long.;[];;[];[18382];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07071_.mp3
[Failure] Trying to force me to agree with you, hey? Don't make me laugh. You want my cooperation, you'll have to get it the old-fashioned way.;[{'Player': 'Persuade'}];;[18385, 18406, 18409];[18371];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07051_.mp3
[Persuade] Because together we will be unbeatable.;[];she hates the PC;[18386, 18404];[18384, 18370];kor35_lashowe;
[Success] Hmmm. You make a decent case. I suppose it's possible that Master Uthar could award both of us prestige. We'd be ahead of the others, for sure...;[];;[18387];[18385];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07053_.mp3
I want something out of this, first, however. I want you to tell me about some lead you have for where I could find more prestige.;[];;[18388, 18392, 18394, 18396, 18398, 18400, 18402];[18386];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07057_.mp3
[Lie] There is a powerful Sith cloak in the furthest tomb in the valley.;[];;[18389, 18391];[18387];kor35_lashowe;
[Success] Oh? I hadn't heard about that. Fair enough... I will have to look into it.;[];;[18390];[18388];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07059_.mp3
You've given me a lead, so I'll let you in on my plan. The artifact that I've discovered is an ancient Jedi holocron.;[];;[18373];[18389, 18393, 18395, 18397, 18399];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07060_.mp3
[Failure] How gullible to you believe me to be? The furthest tomb? Yeah right. Find your own prestige.;[];;[];[18388];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07072_.mp3
Do you know about the hermit in the hills that kidnaps students?;[];;[18393];[18387];kor35_lashowe;
I thought that was a myth. Perhaps you are correct, however... it may be worth prestige to investigate.;[];;[18390];[18392];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07074_.mp3
There are some renegades hiding on the surface which Master Uthar wants killed.;[];;[18395];[18387];kor35_lashowe;
Oh? I hadn't heard about them. It certainly merits looking into.;[];;[18390];[18394];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07076_.mp3
I've heard there's an artifact sword in the tomb of Freedon Nadd.;[];;[18397];[18387];kor35_lashowe;
I think I have heard of that. But it's good enough... at least I know you're telling the truth.;[];;[18390];[18396];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07078_.mp3
Hmm. You could go and talk to Kel Algwinn.;[];;[18399];[18387];kor35_lashowe;
He's... one of the students? Yes, I've met the sniveler. I think I know where you're going with this... good, yes, I accept.;[];;[18390];[18398];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07080_.mp3
But I don't know any leads...;[];;[18401];[18387];kor35_lashowe;
Then you'll just have to come back when you do. Of course, I may have changed my mind by then...;[];;[];[18400];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07082_.mp3
Forget it! I'm not giving you any leads!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[18403];[18387];kor35_lashowe;
Then you're on your own.;[];;[];[18402];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07084_.mp3
[Failure] Forget it. I never liked you to begin with, and I'm not about to work with you.;[];;[18405];[18385];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07054_.mp3
So run along and get your own prestige, will you? Thanks ever so much.;[];;[];[18404, 18408];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07086_.mp3
[Persuade] I've always wanted to work with a beautiful woman.;[];;[18407, 18408];[18384, 18370];kor35_lashowe;
[Success] Flattery, is it? I... suppose it's possible that Master Uthar could award both of us prestige. We'd be ahead of the others, for sure...;[{'Lashowe': 'Flirt'}];;[18373];[18406];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07088_.mp3
[Failure] Hmmm... no. No, it's not worth it. I'll figure out how to get the artifact, myself.;[];;[18405];[18406];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07085_.mp3
Fine, forget it.;[];;[18410];[18384, 18370, 18364, 18358];kor35_lashowe;
Fine by me.;[];;[];[18409];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07046_.mp3
[Failure] Hah! Forget it. I'm not going to be tricked so easily. Just move along, now.;[];;[];[18368, 18366, 18415, 18412, 18417, 18416, 18365, 18432];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07041_.mp3
What? Sith don't co-operate on things like this...;[];;[18369, 18411, 18413];[18365, 18418, 18422];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07034_.mp3
Quiet, already!;[];;[18414];[18412];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07035_.mp3
Don't you shush me, Carth Onasi!;[];;[18415];[18413];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07036_.mp3
Keep it up and I'll gag you. Are you forgetting where we are? Now be quiet.;[];;[18369, 18411];[18414];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07037_.mp3
This is not wise. She'll be as willing to lie as you are.;[];;[18369, 18411, 18417];[18365, 18418];kor35_lashowe;
Yeah, but if we do it first, we win. Shush up, Big Z.;[];"whispered, like ""Quiet you big dope!""";[18369, 18411];[18416];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07039_.mp3
[Lie] Maybe I could help you get it?;[];;[18366, 18370, 18412, 18416];[18364];kor35_lashowe;
You're lying. You don't have anything.;[];;[18420];[18364];kor35_lashowe;
You go ahead and think that. I'll enjoy the look on your face when I win.;[];;[];[18419];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07044_.mp3
I have to go.;[];;[18349, 18350, 18351];[18362, 18360, 18356, 18354, 18352];kor35_lashowe;
Perhaps we could work together?;[];if Yuthura told PC to see Lashowe out;[18366, 18370, 18412];[18358, 18356];kor35_lashowe;
You talk big, but that's about it.;[];;[18424, 18425, 18426];[18356];kor35_lashowe;
And what do you have to brag about? You haven't earned any prestige at all.;[];;[];[18423];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07090_.mp3
Uh-huh. Well, you may be the competition, but I've still got the edge on you.;[];;[];[18423];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07091_.mp3
You may have more prestige than me, but that won't last long, just you wait and see.;[];;[];[18423];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07092_.mp3
I remember you. I challenge you to a duel!;[];;[18428];[18356, 18354, 18352];kor35_lashowe;
A duel? Fine, you run along and get ready while I go gain some prestige. Idiot.;[];;[];[18427, 18430];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07094_.mp3
You don't remember? My name is Lashowe. We met in the colony, ever so briefly.;[];;[18355, 18430, 18431];[18353];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07018_.mp3
I challenge you to a duel.;[];;[18428];[18429, 18433];kor35_lashowe;
I must go.;[];;[18349, 18350, 18351];[18429, 18433];kor35_lashowe;
[Persuade] I'd like to help you retrieve your artifact.;[];;[18369, 18411];[18352, 18433];kor35_lashowe;
I remember you from the colony. You seem alright, though you'll not win the right to train before me.;[];;[18353, 18355, 18430, 18431, 18432];[None];kor35_lashowe;NM35AALASH07096_.mp3
Hello. It is... good to see you again.;[{'Yuthura Ban': 'Greeting'}];;[18435, 18495];[None];dan13_yuthura;NM13AAYUTH22000_.mp3
Yuthura! So you made it here after all.;[];;[18436];[18434];dan13_yuthura;
I did. You told me I should rethink my path, and I did. You were right.;[];;[18437];[18435];dan13_yuthura;NM13AAYUTH22002_.mp3
It's been very hard to let go of all those thoughts... about power and strength and victory. I don't know if I'll ever be completely free of them.;[];;[18438];[18436, 18496];dan13_yuthura;NM13AAYUTH22005_.mp3
The real irony is that, despite what the Sith Code says, I've never felt more free. I think I might... be able to find a little peace here. Finally.;[];;[18439, 18450, 18459, 18467];[18437];dan13_yuthura;NM13AAYUTH22006_.mp3
So the Jedi Council will let you stay?;[];;[18440];[18438, 18458, 18466, 18472, 18476, 18478];dan13_yuthura;
For now. They've been very welcoming... more than I expected. I met my old master. He... he cried when he saw me.;[];;[18441];[18439];dan13_yuthura;NM13AAYUTH22008_.mp3
I was embarrassed to see his weakness. Old habits die hard. But... it felt good, too. It felt good to know he missed me, that he worried about me.;[];;[18442];[18440];dan13_yuthura;NM13AAYUTH22009_.mp3
The Council said they would give me time to decide if I wanted to try again, if I was ready. I don't know. There's... there's so much that I've done.;[];;[18443, 18489, 18491, 18493];[18441];dan13_yuthura;NM13AAYUTH22010_.mp3
You've got a lot to atone for, I suppose.;[];;[18444];[18442];dan13_yuthura;
Yes. Part of me just wants to forget it, to put it behind me... but that isn't right, either. I have to accept it and move on.;[];;[18445];[18443];dan13_yuthura;NM13AAYUTH22012_.mp3
My old master said he would start exercises with me again... slowly, when I was ready. He said my experience with the dark side could make me a very wise Jedi.;[];;[18446];[18444, 18490, 18492, 18494];dan13_yuthura;NM13AAYUTH22019_.mp3
"There is no emotion; there is peace. There is no ignorance; there is knowledge. There is no passion; there is serenity. There is no chaos; there is harmony. There is no death; there is the Force.";[];;[18447];[18445];dan13_yuthura;NM13AAYUTH22020_.mp3
Those words never held such resonance for me until I returned. I'd... like some serenity, some harmony. Wouldn't you?;[];;[18448, 18487];[18446];dan13_yuthura;NM13AAYUTH22021_.mp3
If I had a choice, yes.;[];;[18449];[18447];dan13_yuthura;
Yes, I suppose your fate still has much in store for you, just as I saw back on Korriban.;[];;[18450, 18459, 18467, 18473];[18448];dan13_yuthura;NM13AAYUTH22023_.mp3
Do you think you might ever go back to the Sith?;[];;[18451];[18449, 18466, 18472, 18476, 18478, 18488, 18438];dan13_yuthura;
I don't know. I doubt it. Even if I wanted to, the Sith would never take me back. To them, I am a traitor.;[];;[18452];[18450];dan13_yuthura;NM13AAYUTH22029_.mp3
But the dark side... that's a different matter. The dark side is not the Sith. I still feel its temptation strongly.;[];;[18453];[18451];dan13_yuthura;NM13AAYUTH22030_.mp3
My emotions are so strong. Just the other day I nearly attacked a poor Padawan for tripping into me, nearly berated his clumsiness and weakness.;[];;[18454];[18452];dan13_yuthura;NM13AAYUTH22031_.mp3
I didn't, thankfully, but it's difficult to fight off those feelings. How do you do it?;[];;[18455, 18482, 18484, 18485];[18453];dan13_yuthura;NM13AAYUTH22032_.mp3
I don't. I do what I like.;[];;[18456];[18454];dan13_yuthura;
And to think I took my advice to come here from you. Ha ha! Perhaps you should follow your own counsel sometime.;[];;[18457];[18455];dan13_yuthura;NM13AAYUTH22034_.mp3
The one thing that made me come here was how hard I had to think to remember where I began and where Yuthura the Sith Master ended.;[];;[18458];[18456, 18483, 18486];dan13_yuthura;NM13AAYUTH22040_.mp3
That wasn't the person I wanted to be, so how did I end up there? It... it will take some time for me to sort through that, I think.;[];;[18439, 18459, 18467, 18473];[18457];dan13_yuthura;NM13AAYUTH22041_.mp3

How did you and Zaalbar hook up?;[];;[18639];[18637];k_hmis_dialog;
Big Z's my family, you know? My parents... well, I guess they're dead. It was just me on my own until the day I saw Zaalbar in the Lower City. I could tell right away he was in trouble.;[];;[18640];[18638, 18676];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13043_.mp3
This was before the gang wars were out of hand, but even then the Vulkars were scum. A few of them were hassling Big Z, trying to pick a fight - but he wasn't looking for trouble.;[];;[18641, 18669, 18674, 18675];[18639];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13044_.mp3
Who'd want to pick a fight with a Wookiee?;[];;[18642];[18640];k_hmis_dialog;
Hey, nobody said the Vulkars was smart. But there were three of them, so maybe they figured they could handle him. I don't know.;[];;[18643];[18641];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13046_.mp3
Anyway, I don't like Vulkars at the best of times. And when I saw them picking on this poor Wookiee - all alone on a strange planet, overwhelmed by the big city - I just lost it.;[];;[18644];[18642, 18674];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13048_.mp3
I screamed out 'Leave him alone, you core-slimes!' and charged right at them. One of them saw me coming and slapped me so hard he just about knocked me cold.;[];;[18645, 18669, 18671, 18673];[18643];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13049_.mp3
You're lucky he didn't fry you with a blaster.;[];;[18646];[18644];k_hmis_dialog;
Hey, I don't need a lecture from you. You ain't my mother! I knew what I was doing.;[];;[18647];[18645];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13051_.mp3
Those Vulkars didn't scare me. They're nothing but cowards. I knew how to deal with them. Of course, I never got the chance.;[];;[18648];[18646, 18672, 18673];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13054_.mp3
I guess Zaalbar didn't like seeing me get smacked around. He let out this howl and yanked that Vulkar a meter up off the ground and held him there by his throat.;[];;[18649, 18667, 18669];[18647];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13055_.mp3
What did the other two Vulkars do?;[];;[18650];[18648];k_hmis_dialog;
The other two screamed and ran off. Can't say I blame them. The first time you see an angry Wookiee up close it isn't a pretty sight.;[];;[18651];[18649, 18668];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13057_.mp3
I thought Zaalbar was going to rip that punk's arms off and beat him to death with his own fists. The Vulkar was so scared he fainted. Or maybe Big Z's breath just knocked him out.;[];;[18652, 18666];[18650];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13058_.mp3
Mission!;[];;[18653];[18651];k_hmis_dialog;

Anyway, I knew those Vulkars would be back with friends, so I grabbed Zaalbar and we took off. Ever since then we've been a team. We look out for each other, you know?;[];;[18655, 18658, 18661];[18653, 18666];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13062_.mp3
How did Zaalbar end up on Taris?;[];;[18656];[18654, 18660];k_hmis_dialog;
He was fleeing some kind of trouble back on Kashyyyk. That's all I know, really. Big Z doesn't like to talk about it. In case you didn't notice he's the strong, silent type.;[];;[18657];[18655];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13064_.mp3
Doesn't much matter to me, though. I accept him for what he is, not what he was. Me and Zaalbar like to live in the present.;[];;[18658, 18661];[18656];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13065_.mp3
How did you survive before you met Zaalbar?;[];;[18659];[18657, 18654];k_hmis_dialog;
What's that supposed to mean? You think I can't take care of myself? I've got street smarts! I know how to get by on my own!;[];;[18660];[18658];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13067_.mp3
In fact, I look out for Zaalbar more than he looks out for me, you know? Big Z's a little bit too gullible to make it alone on the mean streets of the Lower City.;[];;[18655, 18661];[18659];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13068_.mp3
We should get back to the task at hand.;[];;[18662];[18660, 18657, 18654];k_hmis_dialog;
Yeah, I suppose you're right. Like I used to tell my brother, fast talk and slick words don't get the job done.;[];;[18663, 18665];[18661];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13070_.mp3
I didn't know you had a brother.;[];;[18664];[18662, 18670];k_hmis_dialog;
My brother's a touchy subject, you know? It just so happens I don't really feel like talking about him right now. Nothing personal. Let's just get back to the business at hand, okay?;[];;[];[18663, 18665];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13077_.mp3
I hope I don't have to listen to you prattle on about your brother now!;[];;[18664];[18662, 18670];k_hmis_dialog;

Did Zaalbar kill him?;[];;[18668];[18648];k_hmis_dialog;
Are you kidding? Big Z ain't like that! He's just a big old softie inside. Of course, the Vulkars didn't know that.;[];;[18650];[18667];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13072_.mp3
Could your story be more boring? I've heard enough.;[];;[18670];[18648, 18644, 18640];k_hmis_dialog;
Fine - I won't tell how Zaalbar and I hooked up. Sheesh! First you ask about it, then you say you don't want to hear it! You're as bad as my brother used to be!;[];;[18663, 18665];[18669, 18675];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13075_.mp3

I'm not going to worry about Griff anymore. Like you said, he brought this on himself! Besides, he's always treated me like garbage. Now it's payback time!;[];;[];[18677, 18809];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13186_.mp3
I... I was a little snappish when we last talked. I'm sorry about that. I get a little touchy when it comes to Griff. It's kind of embarassing telling people about him.;[];;[18681, 18738, 18740];[18677];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13081_.mp3
Embarassing? Why?;[];;[18682];[18680];k_hmis_dialog;
It's complicated. Griff wasn't the most popular guy, he had his faults. But I still loved him, you know? Sometimes people don't understand.;[];;[18683];[18681];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13083_.mp3
I never knew my parents, my brother always looked out for me. He's the one who brought me to Taris. I was just a kid, only five. But I remember the trip - if you could call it that.;[];;[18684];[18682, 18739];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13084_.mp3
We were stuffed inside a packing crate in a star freighter's cargo hold with just enough food and water to make the trip. Not exactly first class, you know?;[];;[18685, 18735, 18737];[18683];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13085_.mp3
You were stowaways?;[];;[18686];[18684];k_hmis_dialog;
I don't know the whole story - I was pretty young. But my brother owed a lot of money. Might even have been a few arrest warrants out for him, I don't know.;[];;[18687];[18685, 18737];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13087_.mp3
The only way to get off the planet was to smuggle ourselves out. I mean, I don't want to make it sound like we were criminals... well, maybe my brother was.;[];;[18688];[18686];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13088_.mp3
See, this is why I don't like to talk about it. It makes Griff sound worse than he really was. My brother had his problems, but he always looked out for me.;[];;[18689, 18734, 18735];[18687];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13089_.mp3
He's family. You have to stick by your family.;[];;[18690];[18688];k_hmis_dialog;
Yeah - that's what I'm trying to say! Without my brother I don't know where I'd be.;[];;[18691];[18689];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13091_.mp3
He gambled. And drank. And he was always borrowing money for his latest get rich quick scheme. But he had a good heart, you know? He taught me how to survive.;[];;[18692];[18690, 18734];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13093_.mp3
"He showed me how to slice into a computer's security system; how to get inside a locked building without the entrance codes, and how to spot a wealthy mark for a quick shell game.";[];;[18693, 18732];[18691];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13094_.mp3
Sounds like he was nothing but a petty criminal.;[];;[18694];[18692];k_hmis_dialog;

I really miss him since he left. I keep hoping he'll come back some day. He promised me he would.;[];;[18696, 18730];[18694, 18733];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13097_.mp3
Why did he leave?;[];;[18697];[18695];k_hmis_dialog;
He fell in with a bad crowd. It's all Lena's fault. She's the one who took him from me! Just batted those long lashes at him and off he went!;[];;[18698, 18727, 18728];[18696, 18731, 18736];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13099_.mp3
Who's Lena?;[];;[18699];[18697];k_hmis_dialog;
I don't want to talk about Griff and Lena - just the thought of that space tramp makes my blood boil! Subject's closed as far as I'm concerned!;[];;[18700];[18698, 18727, 18729, 18677];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13101_.mp3
If I'm going to be any help to you I can't be worrying about my brother running off with some intergalactic skank! So, is there something else you need?;[];;[18701, 18717, 18719];[18699];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13102_.mp3
Do you know anything about the planet we're on?;[];Only shows up if player is on Taris, Dantooine, Tattoine, Kashyyyk, Korriban, Mannan or the Unknow world;[18702, 18715, 18721, 18722, 18723, 18724, 18725];[18700, 18743, 18759, 18630, 18832];k_hmis_dialog;
Taris is a pretty good place to grow up, all things considered. Just stick to the area you belong in and stay out of Davik's business and you'll be fine.;[];Player on Taris;[18703, 18705, 18707, 18710, 18713];[18701];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13012_.mp3
Tell me about the Upper City.;[];;[18704];[18702, 18706, 18709, 18712];k_hmis_dialog;
The Upper City's got some nice shops and all, but it's boring! The only time I go up there is if I need free healing from Zelka at his medical facility.;[];;[18705, 18707, 18710, 18713];[18703];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13014_.mp3
Tell me about the Lower City.;[];;[18706];[18704, 18709, 18712, 18702];k_hmis_dialog;
What can I say? The Lower City was a great place to hang out until the Vulkars started that gang war. Now you can't even walk the streets without getting shot at!;[];;[18703, 18707, 18710, 18713];[18705];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13016_.mp3
Tell me about the Undercity.;[];;[18708];[18706, 18709, 18712, 18704, 18702];k_hmis_dialog;
It can be pretty nasty down there: you've got rakghouls crawling around looking for their next meal, and the Gamorrean slavers like to set up their bases in the sewers.;[];;[18709];[18707];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13018_.mp3
"And then there's the Outcast village - a collection of people banished to the Undercity for their crimes. I mostly avoid the village, though; it's pretty depressing seeing how they live.";[];;[18703, 18705, 18707, 18710, 18713];[18708];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13019_.mp3
Tell me about Davik.;[];;[18711];[18709, 18706, 18704, 18702];k_hmis_dialog;
I tend to keep my nose out of an intergalactic crime lord's business, you know? I can't tell you much that isn't common knowledge.;[];;[18712];[18710];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13021_.mp3
Extortion, slavery, smuggling: Davik's got a piece of all the action here on Taris. Even the swoop gangs know better than to get in his way.;[];;[18703, 18705, 18707, 18713];[18711];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13022_.mp3
Thanks for the info.;[];;[18714];[18712, 18709, 18706, 18704, 18702];k_hmis_dialog;
Hey, no problem. I'm here to help, right?;[];;[];[18713];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13024_.mp3
"I'm not the one you should ask about Dantooine. I didn't even know there was a Jedi Academy here; I always thought it was just a bunch of settlers and farmers!";[];Player on Dantooine;[18716];[18701];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13025_.mp3
Sorry I can't be more help, you know? Is there anything else I can do for you?;[];;[18636, 18677, 18717, 18719];[18715, 18721, 18722, 18723, 18724, 18726];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13026_.mp3
Do you feel like playing some Pazaak?;[];Only comes up on the Ebon Hawk;[18718];[18716, 18700, 18743, 18759, 18630, 18832];k_hmis_dialog;
Want to practice your skills, eh? Sure - I'll play you a few hands. Just for practice, though. I don't want to bet with you.;[];;[];[18717];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13034_.mp3
Nothing. Never mind.;[];;[18720];[18716, 18700, 18743, 18759, 18832, 18630];k_hmis_dialog;
Okay... have it your way.;[];;[];[18719];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13206_.mp3
Well, I know Zaalbar's from Kashyyyk, but he never liked to talk about it. He wouldn't even tell me why he left. I don't think the Wookiees like outsiders much.;[];Kashyyyk;[18716];[18701];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13027_.mp3
I don't know anything about Korriban, but I get a bad feeling in this place. If there's such a thing as an 'evil' planet, this is it!;[];Korriban;[18716];[18701];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13028_.mp3
I always heard Tatooine was nothing but a rock covered by a bunch of worthless sand. I can't even figure out why Czerka Corp. set up their mining operations here.;[];Tatooine;[18716];[18701];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13029_.mp3
"Manaan's the source for all the kolto in the galaxy; that's why those fish-faced Selkath can stay neutral in this whole Sith-Republic war. But I don't know much else about this place.";[];Manaan;[18716];[18701];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13030_.mp3
How am I supposed to know anything about this planet? It's an uncharted world in an unexplored quadrant! I didn't even know this planet was here!;[];unknown world;[18726];[18701];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13031_.mp3
Didn't you come here back when you were the Dark Lord? If you don't remember anything about this place then I guess we're just stumbling in the dark.;[];;[18716];[18725];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13032_.mp3
What are you talking about? What happened?;[];;[18699];[18697];k_hmis_dialog;
Let's get back to our mission, Mission.;[];;[18729];[18697];k_hmis_dialog;
Mission - mission: is that supposed to be a joke? Like I've only heard that about a million times in my life! Okay, I can take a hint. You don't want to hear anymore. That's just fine.;[];;[18699];[18728];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13105_.mp3
Griff doesn't sound like he's big on keeping promises.;[];;[18731];[18695];k_hmis_dialog;
Why do you got to go putting my brother down like that? That's just mean! Besides, it wasn't his idea to leave!;[];;[18697];[18730];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13107_.mp3
Pretty handy skills to have, Mission.;[];;[18733];[18692];k_hmis_dialog;
Yeah, Griff did right by me.;[];;[18695];[18732];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13109_.mp3
What kind of problems did your brother have?;[];;[18691];[18688];k_hmis_dialog;
I really don't care about your traumatic childhood.;[];;[18736];[18688, 18684];k_hmis_dialog;
Oh... yeah. I understand. We've got bigger bantha to hunt, right? I just miss Griff, is all. I keep thinking things might have been different, you know?;[];;[18697];[18735];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13112_.mp3
How could your brother do that to a five year old?;[];;[18686];[18684];k_hmis_dialog;
You don't have to tell me anything if you don't want to.;[];;[18739];[18680];k_hmis_dialog;
No, I want to tell you. Zaalbar's a great listener but it might be nice to talk about this with someone who doesn't reply in growls and grunts.;[];;[18683];[18738];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13114_.mp3
I don't have time for this.;[];;[18741];[18680, 18751, 18748, 18744, 18773, 18799];k_hmis_dialog;
Right, sure. I understand. We've got all this other stuff going on what with the Sith and all. You're busy. No problem. Maybe later we can talk. When you have more time, you know?;[];;[];[18740];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13116_.mp3
I'm not really in the mood to talk about my brother right now. Maybe we should just stay focused on the job at hand, you know?;[];MissionTalk at 1;[18743];[18677];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13117_.mp3
So, is there anything else you need?;[];;[18701, 18717, 18719];[18742, 18797, 18812, 18821];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13118_.mp3
I'm sorry for the way I acted before. It's just that when it comes to Lena I tend to get a little worked up.;[];MissionTalk at 3, player is off Taris;[18740, 18745, 18766];[18677];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13119_.mp3
Why do you hate her so much?;[];;[18746];[18744];k_hmis_dialog;
My brother and me had a good thing going. Sure, Griff had his run-ins with the law on Taris. But we got by okay. Until Lena came and ruined everything.;[];;[18747];[18745, 18766];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13121_.mp3
She was a dancer at the cantina where my brother used to go to play Pazaak. Griff could be a real smooth talker, and it wasn't long before the two of them were dating.;[];;[18748];[18746];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13122_.mp3
But Lena was used to dating rich Tarisian nobles - guys with mountains of credits. Griff could never give her the kind of lifestyle she was used to, no matter how hard he worked.;[];;[18740, 18749, 18765];[18747];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13123_.mp3
You mean no matter how much he stole.;[];;[18750];[18748];k_hmis_dialog;
I'm not going to pretend Griff wasn't a hustler and a con-artist, but that doesn't mean you can just insult him! He did what he did to look out for me!;[];;[18751];[18749];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13125_.mp3
I thought Lena would brush Griff off when she saw how poor he was, but for some reason she stuck around. I guess she saw the potential for a big payday down the road.;[];;[18740, 18752, 18763, 18764];[18750, 18765];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13126_.mp3
Sounds like you're jealous.;[];;[18753];[18751];k_hmis_dialog;
I saw Lena for what she really was - a busty, credit-grubbing cantina rat! She used Griff and took away the only family I had!;[];;[18754];[18752, 18763];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13128_.mp3
After they'd been together for a few months, Griff told me he was leaving Taris. He and Lena were going to try and make their fortune off-world.;[];;[18755];[18753, 18764];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13129_.mp3
He promised as soon as he made enough credits he'd come back and get me and we'd all live like royalty. That was two years ago - I haven't seen him since! I don't even know where he went!;[];;[18756, 18760, 18761, 18762];[18754];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13130_.mp3
How is this Lena's fault?;[];;[18757];[18755];k_hmis_dialog;
Oh, I know what happened! As soon as she got him off Taris Lena sunk her claws into Griff but good! She twisted him around her little finger and made him forget all about me!;[];;[18758];[18756, 18760, 18761];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13133_.mp3
I know I'll probably never see Griff again. But part of the reason I came with you was the hope that I could find out what happened to my brother.;[];;[18759];[18757, 18762];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13134_.mp3
Don't worry - I won't let my search for Griff get in the way of what we're doing. Let's just get back to the task at hand. Is there anything else I can help you with?;[];;[18701, 18717, 18719];[18758, 18677];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13135_.mp3
Maybe something happened to him.;[];;[18757];[18755];k_hmis_dialog;
Sounds like he deserted you.;[];;[18757];[18755];k_hmis_dialog;
We should get back to the job at hand.;[];;[18758];[18755];k_hmis_dialog;
Maybe she actually liked Griff.;[];;[18753];[18751];k_hmis_dialog;
So what happened?;[];;[18754];[18751];k_hmis_dialog;
Did Lena dump him?;[];;[18751];[18748];k_hmis_dialog;
What did she do to you?;[];;[18746];[18744];k_hmis_dialog;
Don't tell me you believe Lena's lies? Griff might be working as a miner on Tatooine, but the rest of her story is bantha poo-doo! You can't trust someone like her.;[];Mission Talk at 6;[18768];[18677];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13142_.mp3
At least Griff's free of her clutches. I'd like to go speak to the Czerka Corp rep on Tatooine, if we have time. Maybe I can arrange to see my brother again.;[];;[18769, 18771];[18767];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13143_.mp3
We'll find your brother, Mission.;[];;[18770];[18768];k_hmis_dialog;
I just hope he's not in any kind of trouble when we do.;[];;[];[18769];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13145_.mp3
I don't think we'll have time, Mission.;[];;[18772];[18768];k_hmis_dialog;
Sure, I understand. Saving the galaxy and all. All I'm saying is if we get time to make a quick sidetrip to Tatooine... look, just think about it, okay?;[];;[];[18771];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13147_.mp3
I've been thinking about Lena and what she said about Griff. You know, how he was always blaming other people for his problems. There might be something to what she said.;[];Mission Talk at 6, level gained;[18740, 18774, 18787];[18677];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13148_.mp3
You mean you believe her story now?;[];;[18775];[18773];k_hmis_dialog;
No, of course not. Not really. But what if... what if it was his idea to leave me behind? I'm not saying Griff would just abandon me.;[];;[18776];[18774, 18787];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13150_.mp3
But maybe... maybe he did want to leave me behind. Just temporarily, you know? He might have done that, if he planned on coming back later.;[];;[18777];[18775];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13151_.mp3
But things didn't usually work out for Griff the way he planned, you know? And that's when he'd get in trouble. He was always borrowing money he could never pay back.;[];;[18778];[18776];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13152_.mp3
He might have been trying to skip out on his debts when he left Taris. He would have had to leave his little sister behind so it would look like he was coming back.;[];;[18779, 18786];[18777];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13153_.mp3
So he sacrificed you to save his own hide?;[];;[18780];[18778];k_hmis_dialog;
Yeah... well, no. Not exactly. Look, all I'm trying to say is that the more I think back the more I realize I might be idolizing my brother a bit. Not seeing all his faults.;[];;[18781];[18779, 18786];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13155_.mp3
I still want to find him. I need to see him again. It's just that I'm not sure how I'll react when I do.;[];;[18782, 18785];[18780];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13156_.mp3
When the time comes you'll know what to say, Mission.;[];;[18783];[18781];k_hmis_dialog;
Maybe. We'll see. I don't... I don't want to judge him yet. Maybe Lena was lying. Or maybe... maybe she wasn't.;[];;[18784];[18782, 18785];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13158_.mp3
All I know is I'd like to speak to Griff myself. If we have time, I'd like to go talk to the Czerka Corp rep on Tatooine and see what he has to say about where my brother is now.;[];;[];[18783, 18677];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13159_.mp3
I think he deserves a swift kick in the groin for what he did.;[];;[18783];[18781];k_hmis_dialog;
Kind of like how you came to Taris in the first place.;[];;[18780];[18778];k_hmis_dialog;
Griff may not be perfect, but he is your brother, Mission.;[];;[18775];[18773];k_hmis_dialog;
Talk? What is there to talk about? Those sandpeople took my brother prisoner!;[];Mission Talk 9;[18789];[18677];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13163_.mp3
Griff may be a slime but we have to go rescue him! We can't just leave him with those... those... those monsters!;[];;[18790, 18792, 18795];[18788];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13164_.mp3
Don't worry Mission - we'll get him back.;[];;[18791];[18789];k_hmis_dialog;
I knew I could count on you! There's definite fringe benefits to being friends with a Jedi!;[];;[];[18790];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13166_.mp3
He's probably already dead, Mission.;[];;[18793];[18789];k_hmis_dialog;
You heard the Czerka rep: the sandpeople sometimes take prisoners. Say what you want about Griff, but he's a survivor. I know he's still alive.;[];;[18794];[18792];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13168_.mp3
I can't make you go after my brother, but you're the only one who can save him. Just think about it, that's all I ask. In the end I know you'll do the right thing.;[];;[];[18793, 18796];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13171_.mp3
I've got more important things to worry about, Mission.;[];;[18796];[18789];k_hmis_dialog;
I know you're out to save the galaxy and all. But you can't just turn your back on someone who needs your help - you're a Jedi, not a Sith!;[];;[18794];[18795];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13170_.mp3
Look, I'm happy Griff's alive but I'm mad at him right now. And I don't know what kind of job he's got for you, but I don't trust him. It's probably just another scam!;[];;[18743];[18677];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13172_.mp3
I'm worried about Griff and his latest plan. I've got a bad feeling about it. He doesn't know anything about brewing Tarisian ale.;[];MissionTalk at 11;[18799];[18677];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13173_.mp3
And now he's gotten himself mixed up with the Exchange. Sometimes Griff can be so stupid! Part of me just wants to let him get what's coming to him.;[];;[18740, 18800, 18811];[18798];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13174_.mp3
You can't turn your back on your own brother!;[];;[18801];[18799];k_hmis_dialog;
Why not? He turned his back on me! He abandoned me on Taris, so maybe I should just leave him high and dry now!;[];;[18802];[18800];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13176_.mp3
Maybe a couple broken knee-caps will do him some good! Maybe that's the kind of jolt he needs to turn his life around! Only... what if they do something worse?;[];;[18803];[18801, 18811];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13178_.mp3
"They might kill him! I don't want him to die; he doesn't deserve that. But I can't just keep supporting his crazy schemes. Someone has to teach him a lesson!";[];;[18804, 18807, 18808, 18810];[18802];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13179_.mp3
You have to stick by your family, Mission. Even if they're slime sometimes.;[];;[18805];[18803];k_hmis_dialog;
Yeah, I guess you're right. I'm not going to change him. Griff is going to keep on being Griff.;[];;[18806];[18804, 18807];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13181_.mp3
Maybe if we get these tach glands for him things will work out. Or maybe he'll finally see the light and turn over a new leaf. I know it's not likely, but it's all I have to hope for.;[];;[];[18805, 18677];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13182_.mp3
No one can teach him this lesson, Mission. He has to learn it himself.;[];;[18805];[18803];k_hmis_dialog;
Whatever happens, he brought it on himself.;[];;[18809];[18803];k_hmis_dialog;
You're right! Griff may be my brother, but he deserted me on Taris. As far as I'm concerned that pretty much breaks any bond we had!;[];;[18679];[18808, 18810];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13185_.mp3
What do you care? He left you to die on Tais!;[];;[18809];[18803];k_hmis_dialog;
You said it, Mission! Let the Exchange take care of that slime!;[];;[18802];[18799];k_hmis_dialog;
Hey, if you want to help him with this Tarisian ale scheme that's your business. I'm washing my hands of the whole thing.;[];Mission Talk 10;[18743];[18677];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13188_.mp3
I appreciate everything you've done for Griff. You know that, right? I just hope things work out for him this time around.;[];MissionTalk at 14;[18814];[18677];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13189_.mp3
I guess we'll find out when he meets up with us at the Czerka Corp shop. If he's got those credtis he promised you then maybe there's hope for him yet.;[];;[];[18813];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13190_.mp3
I want to thank you for helping me with Griff. You... you did everything you could for my brother. More than most people would have.;[];MissionTalk at 15;[18816];[18677];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13191_.mp3
I know it might look like it didn't make any difference in the end... Griff's in debt and on the run like usual. But at least I know we tried to help him.;[];;[18817, 18824, 18826, 18828];[18815];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13192_.mp3
Don't give up on him, Mission. He could still change.;[];;[18818];[18816];k_hmis_dialog;
I know people can change no matter how bad they were. But I'm not holding my breath. None of us is perfect, but I've come to realize that Griff is a little less perfect than most.;[];;[18819];[18817];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13194_.mp3
My brother is what he is, but I've learned to deal with that. I'll never forget that he looked after me when I was just a kid, but I don't feel like I owe him anything anymore.;[];;[18820, 18822, 18823];[18818, 18825, 18827];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13200_.mp3
So you're okay?;[];;[18821];[18819];k_hmis_dialog;
I've made my peace with Griff and what he means to me. If he ever shows up again I'll deal with him, but I'm not going to dwell on my brother anymore. It's time to move forward!;[];;[18743];[18820, 18822, 18823, 18677];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13202_.mp3

I still hate that core-slime's guts!;[];;[18821];[18819];k_hmis_dialog;
Griff's a slime ball, Mission. Accept it.;[];;[18825];[18816];k_hmis_dialog;
Don't worry, I see all Griff's faults plainly now. None of us is perfect, but I realize he's a little less perfect than most.;[];;[18819];[18824];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13196_.mp3
I invested a lot in Griff. I'm still looking to get some payback!;[];;[18827];[18816];k_hmis_dialog;
I can't say I blame you. But I'll be honest... I doubt you'll ever see Griff again. I don't even know if I'll ever see him again. Like all good con men he knows how to disappear.;[];;[18819];[18826, 18828];k_hmis_dialog;NGLOBEMISS13199_.mp3
If I ever see your brother again he's a dead man!;[];;[18827];[18816];k_hmis_dialog;
I need you to make me a security spike.;[];;[18830, 18831];[18630, 18832];k_hmis_dialog;

Padawan, your arrival here is well timed.;[]; player is a padawan  first time;[18846, 18876];[None];dan14_bolook;
Who are you?;[];;[18847];[18845, 18877];dan14_bolook;
I am Bolook, a Jedi from the Enclave. I was sent by the Jedi Council to investigate a killing that took place here a few hours ago.;[];;[18848];[18846, 18876];dan14_bolook;
Communication does not pose a problem, as both the suspects and I speak Basic and Huttese.;[];;[18849];[18847];dan14_bolook;
I was going to handle this case myself, but now that you are here this could be an excellent opportunity for you to demonstrate how well you have been learning your lessons at the Academy.;[];;[18850];[18848];dan14_bolook;
Though you are not yet a full Jedi, perhaps you could assist me in sorting out the truth from the lies.;[];;[18851, 18865];[18849];dan14_bolook;
What do you want me to do?;[];;[18852];[18850, 18869];dan14_bolook;
Listen to the stories given by the two suspects. I have brought an information retrieval droid with access to the archives both at the Jedi Enclave and the planetary capital.;[];;[18853];[18851];dan14_bolook;
I will use my wisdom and experience to offer you some guidance, but I will not solve the case for you. There is little benefit if you do not solve this problem yourself.;[];;[18854];[18852];dan14_bolook;
Consider each man's account and check the facts with the information droid. Once you have gathered all the evidence you think you need, run through the possible scenario with me.;[];;[18855];[18853];dan14_bolook;
If you are unable to come to a satisfactory resolution, then I will take these men to the Enclave and deal with this myself.;[];;[18856];[18854];dan14_bolook;
According to the accounts of the participants, these three men were out here in the field together earlier, before the clouds broke.;[];;[18857];[18855, 18884];dan14_bolook;
I find that very odd, for most people would seek shelter indoors when the sky is filled with dark stormclouds as it was earlier today. But that is not the most puzzling aspect of the case.;[];;[18858];[18856];dan14_bolook;
The dead man, Calder Nettic, was shot in the back with a blaster rifle. A rifle was found lying near his body with blood stains on it. It has been sent back to the Enclave for analysis.;[];;[18859];[18857];dan14_bolook;
Two other men were found at the scene when I arrived. One was Handon Guld. He was unarmed. The other was Rickard Lusoff, who was carrying a hunting laser.;[];;[18860];[18858];dan14_bolook;
Both men say they did not do anything, and that they came across the body. But both also accuse the other. Obviously there is more to this than what we have been told.;[];;[18861, 18864];[18859];dan14_bolook;
Is there anything else I should know?;[];;[18862];[18860];dan14_bolook;
There is one last thing. When I arrived Handon was holding his side and Rickard was favoring one of his legs. You would do well to remember this as we progress through the case.;[];;[18863];[18861, 18864];dan14_bolook;
If there is anything else you need, I will remain here while you question the witnesses.;[];;[];[18862, 18878];dan14_bolook;
I will begin my investigaton at once.;[];;[18862];[18860];dan14_bolook;
Sorry, I do not have time for this.;[];;[18866];[18850];dan14_bolook;
We Jedi are often called on to make judgements in case such as this. I think exploring this case could be an important part of your training, though I will not force you to participate.;[]; all leave;[18867];[18865];dan14_bolook;
If you are not willing to assist me, then I will bring the suspects to the Enclave and handle this myself. But are you certain you wish to pass up this opportunity to test yourself?;[];;[18868, 18870, 18873];[18866];dan14_bolook;
I have reconsidered.;[];;[18869];[18867, 18889];dan14_bolook;
Ah, that is good. Perhaps then, we can get to the bottom of this mystery.;[];;[18851];[18868];dan14_bolook;
I don't have the time to assist you.;[];;[18871, 18872];[18867];dan14_bolook;
I regret that you feel that way. I must remove myself and the suspects to the Enclave then. Good day to you, Padawan.;[];;[];[18870];dan14_bolook;
I regret that you feel that way. I must remove myself and the suspects to the Enclave then. Good day to you, apprentice.;[];;[];[18870];dan14_bolook;
Get out of my way, worm-head!;[];;[18874];[18867];dan14_bolook;
I find your demeanor most unbecoming in a prospective Jedi. I think that your mentors have perhaps been lax in your training.;[];;[18875];[18873];dan14_bolook;
I regret that you feel you cannot assist me. I will remove myself and the suspects to the Enclave for judgment. May the Force be with you.;[];;[];[18874];dan14_bolook;
What do you want?;[];;[18847];[18845, 18877];dan14_bolook;
Apprentice, your arrival here is well timed.;[]; player is not a padawan  first time;[18846, 18876];[None];dan14_bolook;
We should proceed on to the next point. We need to find a motive for the killing. Maybe you should talk to the men about their relationship with the victim.;[];;[18863];[None];dan14_bolook;
Yes? Is there something I can do to help you in this investigation?;[];;[18880, 18882, 18884, 18885];[None];dan14_bolook;
I want to discuss the murder.;[];;[18881];[18879];dan14_bolook;
You should speak to the witnesses and the information droid before we try to figure out this puzzle. You will need the facts if we are to continue.;[];Each time the player hits a road block;[];[18880];dan14_bolook;
I will continue my investigation.;[];;[18883];[18879];dan14_bolook;
When you have gathered all the information you need, come back to me and we can try to determine what happened.;[];;[];[18882];dan14_bolook;
Tell me what happened here.;[];;[18856];[18879];dan14_bolook;
I cannot resolve this case.;[];;[18886];[18879, 18889];dan14_bolook;
Are you certain? It would be beneficial to your training if you were to at least make the attempt.;[];;[18887];[18885];dan14_bolook;
By assisting me with this case you may learn much about how well you have learned the wisdom of the Jedi... or how much further you have yet to go.;[];;[18888, 18889, 18893];[18886];dan14_bolook;
We should assist Jedi Bolook as best we can.;[];;[18889];[18887];dan14_bolook;NM14ACBOLO01360_.mp3
If you give up now, I will take these men to the Enclave and deal with this myself. But you will have missed out on an excellent opportunity.;[];;[18868, 18885, 18890];[18888, 18893, 18887];dan14_bolook;
I said I can't do it, dammit!;[];;[18891];[18889];dan14_bolook;
Very well. I will take these two suspects to the Enclave and judge this case myself.;[];;[18892];[18890];dan14_bolook;
May the Force be with you.;[];;[];[18891];dan14_bolook;
We should provide what help we can. Surely it is not that difficult to ascertain the truth.;[];;[18889];[18887];dan14_bolook;NM14ACBOLO01361_.mp3

Why? Why?! That's a really dumb question. To become a Sith, of course! To wield the greatest power in the galaxy!;[];;[18950, 18964, 18966, 18969];[18962];kor33_prospectm;NM33AAPROS18043_.mp3

Hah! They're weaklings not worth anyone's attention! It's the Sith that are going to conquer the galaxy, after all.;[];;[18950, 18962, 18966, 18969];[18964];kor33_prospectm;NM33AAPROS18045_.mp3
What do you think your chances are?;[];;[18967];[18965, 18974, 18963, 18961, 18978];kor33_prospectm;
I don't know. I've been here for a few days now, and the Sith still haven't paid me any attention.;[];;[18968];[18966];kor33_prospectm;NM33AAPROS18047_.mp3
I suppose I should consider myself lucky. I've heard of some of the prospects getting killed. Still... it's all a test. I'll just have to be strong!;[];;[18950, 18962, 18964, 18969];[18967];kor33_prospectm;NM33AAPROS18048_.mp3
How does someone get into the academy?;[];;[18970];[18968, 18965, 18963, 18961, 18978];kor33_prospectm;
Well... you have to impress one of the Sith. The final decision rests with Yuthura Ban, however.;[];;[18971];[18969];kor33_prospectm;NM33AAPROS18050_.mp3
She's the one who decides exactly which of us get into the academy or not. I've been hanging out hoping she'll come by and notice me, to be honest.;[];;[18972];[18970];kor33_prospectm;NM33AAPROS18051_.mp3
Where is this Yuthura Ban?;[];;[18973];[18971];kor33_prospectm;
Usually she's in the academy, but sometimes she comes out into the colony to look for prospects.;[];;[18974];[18972];kor33_prospectm;NM33AAPROS18053_.mp3
If she's in the colony, she can usually be found in the cantina, but not always. She's one of the most powerful Sith in the academy, I hear.;[];;[18950, 18962, 18964, 18966];[18973];kor33_prospectm;NM33AAPROS18054_.mp3

Look, I'll answer questions if a Sith puts them to me, but not otherwise.;[];;[18950, 18977];[18975];kor33_prospectm;NM33AAPROS18056_.mp3
What do you mean?;[];;[18978];[18976];kor33_prospectm;

What are you talking about??;[];;[18993];[18991];k_hxor_dialog;NGLOBEHXOR15019_.mp3
Maybe I was wrong. Still, I think a specimen like you would be a nice addition to my collection.;[];;[18994];[18992];k_hxor_dialog;NGLOBEHXOR15021_.mp3
So what would it take, Jedi, for you to sell your pet here to me?;[];;[18995, 19028, 19029];[18993];k_hxor_dialog;NGLOBEHXOR15023_.mp3
She is not for sale!;[];;[18996];[18994, 19009];k_hxor_dialog;

The females make amusing pets, but males should be put down like the animals they are. I remember one time on Taris...;[];;[18998];[18996];k_hxor_dialog;NGLOBEHXOR15027_.mp3
What?! WHAT DID YOU SAY?!;[];;[18999, 19026, 19027];[18997];k_hxor_dialog;NGLOBEHXOR15029_.mp3

It was you!;[];;[19003];[19001];k_hxor_dialog;NGLOBEHXOR15035_.mp3
What? Me? Oh ho! Now I recognize where I've seen that face before.;[];;[19004];[19002];k_hxor_dialog;NGLOBEHXOR15037_.mp3
You were the little Cathar I was going to purchase. But those Jedi came and stole my pet away from me!;[];;[19005, 19024, 19025];[19003];k_hxor_dialog;NGLOBEHXOR15039_.mp3
You bought Juhani?;[];;[19006];[19004];k_hxor_dialog;
When I was fighting with the Mandalorians against the Cathar, I developed an appreciation for these creatures. They make excellent servants if properly trained.;[];;[19007];[19005, 19024, 19025];k_hxor_dialog;NGLOBEHXOR15041_.mp3
You Jedi act all prim and proper, but inside you must feel the same way I do about the lesser, non-human species. The Sith at least let their feelings show on the outside.;[];;[19008];[19006];k_hxor_dialog;NGLOBEHXOR15043_.mp3
You... My homeworld...;[];;[19009];[19007];k_hxor_dialog;NGLOBEHXOR15045_.mp3
Come now, will you let your pet go? I'm sure we can come up with a price we both think is fair.;[];;[18995, 19010, 19023];[19008];k_hxor_dialog;NGLOBEHXOR15047_.mp3
You'll only hurt her if I let her go.;[];;[19011];[19009];k_hxor_dialog;
NO, I WILL NOT BE SOLD!;[];;[19012];[19010, 19023];k_hxor_dialog;NGLOBEHXOR15051_.mp3

But the Council felt it best if we moved with care and caution. The true threat, the Council feared, had not yet revealed itself.;[];;[19221];[19219];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19116_.mp3
But Revan would not be dissuaded. Charismatic and powerful, it was inevitable many of the Order would flock to Revan's seemingly noble cause.;[];;[19222];[19220];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19117_.mp3
Malak was the first to join his closest friend. Others soon followed, many of our youngest and brightest, intent on saving the galaxy from the Mandalorian threat.;[];;[19223, 19231, 19232];[19221];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19118_.mp3
They disobeyed the Jedi Council!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[19224];[19222];dan13_zhar;
They were foolish to disregard the Council's wishes. I do not know what happened to Revan, Malak and their followers on the farthest reaches of the Outer Rim, but something corrupted them.;[];;[19225];[19223, 19231];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19121_.mp3
Their ideals became twisted, their spirits were tainted and they fell to the dark side.;[];;[19226];[19224];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19122_.mp3
There is a lesson in this, a lesson you would do well to take to heart: the dark side can corrupt even the most noble of Jedi.;[];;[19227, 19230];[19225];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19123_.mp3
I will heed the lesson, Master Zhar.;[];;[19228];[19226];dan13_zhar;
You have learned much, yet there is much more for you to still understand. The way of the Jedi must be entered into with a clear and focused mind.;[];;[19229];[19227, 19230, 19232, 19299, 19305];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19106_.mp3
When you feel you are ready to continue your training, know that you can find me here.;[];;[];[19228];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19107_.mp3
Yeah, yeah, get on with it.;[];;[19228];[19226];dan13_zhar;
What happened to this noble mission?;[];;[19224];[19222];dan13_zhar;
I should be going now.;[];;[19228];[19222, 19215, 19190];dan13_zhar;
You should speak to Master Dorak. He can assist you in selecting your lightsaber crystal.;[];;[];[None];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19000_.mp3
Ah, good. Now that you have selected your crystal, we shall begin the construction of your lightsaber.;[];;[];[None];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19001_.mp3
Ah, so you are the one who rescued Bastila. It is appropriate you are here. We have been discussing your rather special case. I am Zhar, a member of the Jedi Council.;[];SCRIPTED  first council meeting Dialog Mission Statement   This is the dialog for Zhar Lestin, the Jedi trainer.   The first dialog is the initial Jedi Council meeting the player has just after he lands on Dantooine.   The second dialog is Zhar assigning and testing the first test, and assigning the second.   The third dialog is susequent conversations before the player has cleansed the grove.   The fourth dialog is the first time after the player saved Juhani.   The fifth dialog is the first time after the player killed Juhani.   The sixth dialog is him assigning the third test.   The seventh dialog is subsequent times before the player returns with a crystal.   The eighth dialog is when the player returns with a crystal.   The ninth dialog is once the player's lightsaber has been constructed.   The tenth dialog is once the player has shown basic proficiency with the lightsaber.   The eleventh dialog is after the player has defeated the shielded droid.   The twelfth dialog is if the player failed to defeat Zhar.   The thirteenth dialog is once the player has defeated Zhar.   The fourteenth dialog is subsequent conversations. Exit points in conversation: Exit stream 1: The lines are spoken and the conversation ends. The player's responses do not affect the conversation. If the player shows arrogance, there is the possibility of a minor dark side hit. DAN_JEDI_PLOT is set to 1 to show that the player is being considered for Jedi training. Exit stream 2: Zhar gives a quest based on what test the player needs to take. The player can also choose to exit the conversation. If the player passes the first test, DAN_PLOT_JEDI is set to 3 to show that the player has passed the first test. If he gives the second test, DAN_JUHANIQ_DONE is set to TRUE to show that the quest has been given, and if the player has already killed Juhani, DAN_JEDI_PLOT is set to 4 to show that the grove has been cleansed. Exit stream 3: The line is spoken and the conversation ends. Exit stream 4: The lines are spoken and the conversation ends. Exit stream 5: The lines are spoken and the conversation ends. Exit stream 6: The lines are spoken and the conversation ends. If the player accepts, DAN_ZHARL_DONE is set to TRUE to show that the player has been told to find the lightsaber crystals. Exit stream 7: The line is spoken and the conversation ends. Exit stream 8: All stream and at the construction of the lightsabe, but if the character is unrepentant he can suffer a minor dark side hit. Exit stream 9: The line is said and the conversation ends. DAN_JEDI_PLOT is set to 6 to show that the player has constructed his lightsaber. Exit stream 10: The lines are said and the player can either initiate combat or leave. DAN_ZHARH_DONE is set to TRUE to show that the player has shown basic poficiency. Exit stream 11: The lines are said and the conversation ends. Exit stream 12: The lines are said and the conversation ends. Exit stream 13: The lines are said and the conversation ends. DAN_JEDI_PLOT is set to 7 to show that the player has become a Padawan. Exit stream 14: The lines are said and the conversation ends.;[19236];[None];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19002_.mp3
With me are Master Vrook, Master Vandar and, of course, the Chronicler of our Academy, Master Dorak. Padawan Bastila I am sure you are already familiar with.;[];;[19237, 19260, 19262, 19274];[19235];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19003_.mp3
What do you want from me?;[{'Player': 'Talk_Normal'}];;[19238];[19236, 19261, 19275];dan13_zhar;
Bastila tells us you are strong in the Force. We are considering you for Jedi training.;[];;[19239, 19257, 19259];[19237, 19264, 19265, 19272, 19273];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19005_.mp3
Nothing would give me greater honor than learning the ways of the Jedi.;[];;[19240];[19238];dan13_zhar;
Master Zhar speaks out of turn, perhaps. We need indisputable proof of your strong affinity to the Force before we would even consider accepting you for training.;[];;[19241, 19256];[19239, 19258, 19259];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19010_.mp3
Proof? Surely the entire Council can feel the strength of the Force within this man... and I have already related to you the events that took place on Taris...;[];;[19242];[19240];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19011_.mp3
Perhaps it was simple luck.;[];;[19243];[19241, 19256];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19012_.mp3
We both know there is no luck. There is only the Force. We all feel the power in Bastila's companion, though it is wild and untamed. Now that this power has begun to manifest itself, can we safely ignore it?;[];;[19244];[19242];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19013_.mp3
The Jedi training is long and difficult, even when working with a young and open mind. Teaching a child is hard. How much harder will it be for an adult to learn the ways of the Jedi?;[];;[19245, 19251, 19254];[19243];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19014_.mp3
I am willing to try my best.;[{'Player': 'Bow'}];;[19246];[19244];dan13_zhar;
Traditionally the Jedi do not accept adults for training, though there are rare exceptions in the history of our Order. But you are a special case.;[];;[19247];[19245, 19253];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19019_.mp3
I agree with Master Dorak. Many of our own pupils are leaving the Jedi order to follow the Sith teachings, we need recruits to stand against Malak! With Revan dead...;[];;[19248];[19246, 19255];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19020_.mp3
Are you certain Revan is truly dead? What if we undertake to train this one, and the Dark Lord should return?;[{'Vrook Lamar': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[19249];[19247];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19021_.mp3
We should discuss this matter more fully in private. Bastila, you and your companion must go. This is a matter for the Council alone.;[];;[19250];[19248];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19022_.mp3
As you wish, Master Vandar. We shall return to the Ebon Hawk and leave you to your deliberations.;[{'Bastila': 'Bow'}]; player leaves and goes to ebon hawk with bastila  cutscene with dream of revan and malak  player exits ebon hawk the next day and carth initiates conversation;[];[19249];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19023_.mp3
I am ready to accept the training... and my age has nothing to do with it!;[{'Player': 'Bow'}];;[19252];[19244];dan13_zhar;
Such pride! Such arrogance! Ach. This one is already on the path to the dark side!;[{'Vrook Lamar': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[19253];[19251];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19017_.mp3
As are many who are not given proper training, Master Vrook. Only through our guidance can we hope to lead those who have strayed back to the path of the light.;[];;[19246];[19252];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19018_.mp3
[Lie] Of course, great Jedi. I will learn your ways and follow the light.;[{'Player': 'Bow'}];;[19255];[19244];dan13_zhar;
[Success] Traditionally the Jedi do not accept adults for training, though there are rare exceptions in the history of our Order. But you are a special case.;[];;[19247];[19254];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19025_.mp3
Proof? Surely the entire Council can feel the strength of the Force within this woman... and I have already related to you the events that took place on Taris...;[];;[19242];[19240];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19026_.mp3
I don't know if I'm ready for this.;[];;[19258];[19238];dan13_zhar;
Do not worry. I am confident in your ability to learn.;[];;[19240];[19257];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19008_.mp3
Strong in the Force?;[];;[19240];[19238];dan13_zhar;
So you've drawn me into your little trap, Bastila. What now?;[];;[19261];[19236];dan13_zhar;
This is no trap. The Council just wants to talk to you. There is much that needs to be discussed.;[];;[19237, 19262, 19274];[19260];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19028_.mp3
I've got some questions for all of you.;[{'Player': 'Talk_Normal'}];;[19263];[19261, 19275, 19236];dan13_zhar;
Indeed, I am sure that you do. I assure you that we will have answers for you.;[];;[19264, 19265, 19266];[19262];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19032_.mp3
Why am I a special case?;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[19238];[19263];dan13_zhar;
Why am I here?;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[19238];[19263];dan13_zhar;
Why did the Sith destroy Taris?;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[19267];[19263];dan13_zhar;
Darth Malak seeks to destroy the Jedi Order. Our most effective weapon, perhaps our only hope, is Bastila's skill with Battle Meditation.;[];;[19268];[19266];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19036_.mp3
With this power she can swing the tide of nearly any battle in our favor. Which is why Malak was seeking her so fervently.;[];;[19269];[19267];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19037_.mp3
And if he could not have her, he would see her destroyed. Taris was just in the way.;[];;[19270];[19268];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19038_.mp3
We need Bastila in our fight against the Sith. Indeed, we need every Jedi we can muster, since the Sith have been hunting us down at every opportunity.;[];;[19271];[19269];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19039_.mp3
Which brings us to you...;[];;[19272, 19273];[19270];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19040_.mp3
Me? What about me?;[];;[19238];[19271];dan13_zhar;
I feel I'm not going to like this...;[];;[19238];[19271];dan13_zhar;
Isn't the Jedi Council on Coruscant?;[{'Player': 'Talk_Normal'}];;[19275];[19261, 19236];dan13_zhar;
Yes, the High Council of the Jedi Order is on Coruscant, but we are the Council in charge of the training facility here on Dantooine.;[];;[19237, 19262];[19274];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19030_.mp3
You have done extremely well in constructing your lightsaber, apprentice. Your crystal seems to have been set perfectly. It is rare indeed for that to happen the first time one constructs their lightsaber.;[];;[19277];[None];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19043_.mp3
These crystals are very rare, found only in certain caves strong in the Force. By adding crystals to your lightsaber you can alter or enhance its properties.;[];;[19278];[19276];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19044_.mp3
There have even been unconfirmed rumors of certain Force-sensitive caves here on Dantooine that may hold these crystals.;[];;[19279, 19300, 19302];[19277];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19045_.mp3
I can find crystals on Dantooine?;[];;[19280];[19278];dan13_zhar;
It is a rumor only. I do not know if there is any truth in it.;[];;[19281];[19279];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19047_.mp3
But you must learn first to use your lightsaber and take care when drawing it.;[];;[19282];[19280, 19301];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19050_.mp3
Your lightsaber identifies you as a member of the Jedi Order. With such recognition comes honor and respect... and the attention of dangerous enemies.;[];;[19283];[19281, 19302];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19052_.mp3
The Sith and Dark Jedi will seek to destroy you, apprentice. And you must prove yourself worthy in battle against a foe who also wields a lightsaber.;[];;[19284];[19282];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19053_.mp3
Are you ready to face the final challenge, apprentice?;[];;[19285, 19299];[19283];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19054_.mp3
I am ready to face the third trial.;[];;[19286];[19284];dan13_zhar;
For every Jedi the threat of the dark side is always present. You must truly understand this before you are accepted into the Order. You must see the corruption of the dark side for yourself.;[];;[19287];[19285, 19304];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19093_.mp3
Even here on Dantooine there are places where the dark side holds sway, twisting and tainting nature itself.;[];;[19288];[19286];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19094_.mp3
The ancient grove once used for deep meditation by the Jedi is now tainted, a wave of darkness perverts the region around it.;[];;[19289];[19287];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19095_.mp3
The kath hounds in the area have become savage and ruthless. They have become a threat to the settlers, a threat the Jedi have promised to stop.;[];;[19290, 19297, 19298];[19288];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19096_.mp3
What would you have me do, Master Zhar?;[];;[19291];[19289];dan13_zhar;
The kath hounds are but a symptom of the true problem. You must journey into the grove and confront the true source of the darkness. That is your task.;[];;[19292, 19296];[19290, 19297, 19298];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19100_.mp3
Do you have no other guidance?;[];;[19293];[19291];dan13_zhar;
"I can say no more; some things you must see for yourself. None of the other Jedi at the academy are permitted to help you in this task.";[];;[19294];[19292, 19296];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19103_.mp3
But remember this, my young apprentice: a Jedi acts with patience and care, and those on the dark path are not always lost forever.;[];;[19295];[19293];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19104_.mp3
The dark side still taints the ancient grove. Your lessons cannot continue until the spreading corruption of the dark side has been stopped. This is your task, apprentice. May the Force be with you.;[]; DIALOGUE  not having completed the second trial;[];[19294];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19127_.mp3
You know more than you're telling me...;[];;[19293];[19291];dan13_zhar;
You want me to go kill kath hounds?;[];;[19291];[19289];dan13_zhar;
What's causing this corruption?;[];;[19291];[19289];dan13_zhar;
I need more time to prepare myself.;[];;[19228];[19284];dan13_zhar;
What will these crystals do for me?;[];;[19301];[19278];dan13_zhar;
They can modify simple things, such as the color of your blade, or complex ones, such as crystals that reputedly increase the strength of the beam.;[];;[19281];[19300];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19049_.mp3
Should I know anything else about lightsabers?;[];;[19282];[19278];dan13_zhar;
Greetings, my young pupil. Your progress has been most remarkable so far. Are you here to continue your training in the ways of the Jedi?;[]; DIALOGUE  and apprentice before being given the second trial;[19212, 19304, 19305];[None];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19057_.mp3
I am ready to continue my training.;[];;[19190, 19286];[19303];dan13_zhar;
Not right now.;[];;[19228];[19303];dan13_zhar;
You have done well, my pupil. The ancient grove has been purified, and Juhani's journey down the dark path has been halted. Because of you she walks once more in the light.;[]; DIALOGUE  having saved juhani;[19307];[None];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19128_.mp3
But though she was saved, do not dismiss what happened to her. Juhani is both dedicated and true to the ideals of the Order, yet she was still vulnerable to the dark side. As are we all.;[];;[19308];[19306];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19129_.mp3
She struck her master in anger during training, and injured her greatly. But it was Quatra's choice to test Juhani this way, and it seems to have made its point.;[];;[19309];[19307];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19130_.mp3
Juhani has been redeemed, and you have passed your final test.;[];;[19310];[19308];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19131_.mp3
Congratulations, apprentice. Or should I say congratulations, Padawan? You have proven yourself worthy of joining the Jedi. Let me be the first to welcome you as a full-fledged member of our Order!;[]; SCRIPTED  if the player defeats zhar;[];[19309, 19313];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19132_.mp3
You have cleansed the grove of its dark taint, but at great cost. Juhani was a most promising student and could one day have been strong in the Force.;[];;[19312];[None];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19133_.mp3
Do not dismiss what happened to her, however. Juhani was both dedicated and true to the ideals of the Order, yet she was still vulnerable to the lure of the dark side.;[];;[19313];[19311];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19134_.mp3
Keep this in mind always in the future, and do not forsake the path of the light.;[];;[19310];[19312];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19135_.mp3
I have nothing left to teach you, Padawan, though a Jedi is ever learning. Even the Masters know their training is but in its infancy. Now is the time for you to seek wisdom outside the training chambers.;[]; DIALOGUE  after defeating zhar;[19315];[None];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19136_.mp3
The lessons that yet await you are to be found beyond the walls of this academy. You should speak to the Council, Padawan.;[];;[19316];[19314];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19137_.mp3
Now that the first stage of your training is complete I am certain they would be eager to have you aid us in our struggle against Darth Malak and the Sith.;[];;[];[19315];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19138_.mp3
I have heard there was some sort of large battle to the south of here between two families of settlers.;[{'Zhar Lestin': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[19318];[None];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19139_.mp3
Apparently both the families were completely killed in the fight, along with their respective droids.;[];;[19319];[19317];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19140_.mp3
I find that most suspicious. Were you not in that area recently?;[];;[19320, 19324, 19325];[19318];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19141_.mp3
[Lie] No, I was somewhere else.;[];;[19321];[19319];dan13_zhar;
[Success] Hm, is that so... It is tragic that this had to happen to those families. Their children were in love, I hear.;[];;[19322];[19320, 19324];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19143_.mp3
Perhaps it was Mandalorian raiders, or a feud that got out of control. It is tragic, but nothing can be done now that all who were involved are dead.;[];;[19323];[19321];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19144_.mp3
Let this be a lesson against hate and violence: a Jedi must always be wary lest these lead to the dark side.;[];;[];[19322, 19326];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19145_.mp3
[Lie] That's horrible! I didn't know!;[];;[19321];[19319];dan13_zhar;
[Lie] Perhaps it was Mandalorian raiders.;[];;[19326];[19319];dan13_zhar;
[Success] Perhaps, perhaps. That or a feud that got out of control. It is tragic, but nothing can be done now that all who were involved are dead.;[];;[19323];[19325];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19148_.mp3
Shen Matale and Rahasia Sandral have fled their feuding families and asked for sanctuary here in the Enclave. The Council has granted this request.;[];;[19328];[None];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19149_.mp3
I have heard that it was by your actions that they managed to escape, and I must congratulate you for avoiding a potentially dangerous situation.;[];;[];[19327];dan13_zhar;NM13AAZHAR19150_.mp3

But... what could I possibly tell you? It is forbidden for slaves to leave this room on pain of torture and death.;[];;[19338, 19367, 19369];[19336];tar08_davslav84;NM08AADAVS11011_.mp3
[Persuade] Tell me what I want to know and I'll tell Davik how pleased I was with your performance.;[];;[19339, 19366];[19337, 19368];tar08_davslav84;
[Success] Praise from the guests is a valuable commodity here. Davik rewards the slaves who perform their duties well. I will tell you what I know.;[];;[19340];[19338];tar08_davslav84;NM08AADAVS11013_.mp3
Davik rarely lets us leave the slave quarters. We only know what we hear from Davik's guests. Recently they've all been talking about poor Hudrow.;[];;[19341];[19339, 19358, 19370];tar08_davslav84;NM08AADAVS11021_.mp3
He was caught trying to steal some spice from the lab. Normally Hudrow is allowed to get away with things like that because he's Davik's personal pilot for the Ebon Hawk.;[];;[19342];[19340];tar08_davslav84;NM08AADAVS11023_.mp3
But since the Sith have grounded every ship on the planet, Hudrow doesn't get anymore special treatment. They've locked him up in Davik's torture chambers.;[];;[19343, 19354, 19364];[19341];tar08_davslav84;NM08AADAVS11025_.mp3
Where is the torture chamber?;[];;[19344];[19342];tar08_davslav84;
I think you can get there through the hall behind the west door of Davik's throne room. Just keep going west from the slave quarters and you'll see the throne room.;[];;[19345];[19343, 19365];tar08_davslav84;NM08AADAVS11027_.mp3
But Davik's certain to have guards patrolling the area. If you leave the guest wing, they'll shoot you on sight. Please - I don't know anything else.;[];;[19346, 19354];[19344];tar08_davslav84;NM08AADAVS11029_.mp3
I'd love a massage right now.;[];;[19347];[19345, 19351, 19360, 19368, 19366, 19333, 19371];tar08_davslav84;
As you wish, mistress. You will find this most relaxing. If you would come with me into the massage room at the back...;[];;[19348, 19349];[19346];tar08_davslav84;NM08AADAVS11034_.mp3
Come on. I mean... I love a massage as much as the next guy, but we're not exactly on vacation here. We need to get going.;[];;[19349];[19347];tar08_davslav84;NM08AADAVS11036_.mp3
I trust you were satisfied with the service? I have received many compliments on my skills from previous clients.;[];;[19350, 19352, 19355, 19363];[19348, 19353, 19347];tar08_davslav84;NM08AADAVS11038_.mp3
It was everything I ever dreamed. You are truly an expert in your craft.;[];;[19351];[19349];tar08_davslav84;
Thank you, my lady. I hope you will express your appreciation to Davik. He often rewards those slaves who perform their duties well. Is there anything else you require?;[];;[19336, 19346, 19352, 19354];[19350];tar08_davslav84;NM08AADAVS11040_.mp3
Your job isn't finished yet. I want another massage!;[];;[19353];[19351, 19349];tar08_davslav84;
My, you certainly have a great hunger for my services. I will do my best to sate your prodigious appetite with another massage, mistress.;[];;[19349];[19352];tar08_davslav84;NM08AADAVS11053_.mp3
I'll be going now.;[];;[19335];[19351, 19360, 19345, 19342, 19368, 19366, 19333, 19371];tar08_davslav84;
Let's just say you came up a little short of my expectations.;[];;[19356];[19349];tar08_davslav84;
Please, I beg you - don't tell Davik you are displeased with me! He punishes those slaves who do not satisfy his guests!;[];;[19357, 19359, 19361];[19355, 19363];tar08_davslav84;NM08AADAVS11042_.mp3
I won't say anything if you answer my questions!;[];;[19358];[19356];tar08_davslav84;
I have no wish to be beaten by Davik, so I will tell you all I know. I hope it is enough to buy your mercy.;[];;[19340];[19357];tar08_davslav84;NM08AADAVS11044_.mp3
I don't want to get you in trouble. Don't worry, I won't say anything.;[];;[19360];[19356];tar08_davslav84;
I am sorry I have failed to please you, my lady. I will try to do better in the future. Is there anything else you require from this most unworthy servant?;[];;[19336, 19346, 19354];[19359, 19362];tar08_davslav84;NM08AADAVS11050_.mp3
I'm telling Davik you're the worst slave I've ever seen!;[];;[19362];[19356];tar08_davslav84;
As... as you wish, mistress. It will not be the first time I have been punished by Davik.;[];;[19360];[19361];tar08_davslav84;NM08AADAVS11048_.mp3
That was pathetic!;[];;[19356];[19349];tar08_davslav84;
What else can you tell me?;[];;[19365];[19342];tar08_davslav84;
Nothing - Davik keeps us locked away in here day and night. I'm not even certain of the location of the torture chamber where they've got Hudrow locked away.;[];;[19344];[19364];tar08_davslav84;NM08AADAVS11031_.mp3
[Failure] I'm sorry, mistress, but the risk is too great. Davik will have me flayed alive if he finds out. Is there something else I may do to please you?;[];;[19346, 19354, 19367, 19369];[19338];tar08_davslav84;NM08AADAVS11015_.mp3
[Persuade] Maybe 50 credits would loosen your tongue.;[];;[19368];[19366, 19337];tar08_davslav84;
"[Failure] I won't betray Davik's secrets for credits; they are of no use to a slave. Is there something else I can do for you?";[];;[19338, 19346, 19354, 19369];[19367];tar08_davslav84;NM08AADAVS11017_.mp3
Either you start talking, or I start blasting random body parts.;[];;[19370];[19368, 19366, 19337];tar08_davslav84;
Please don't hurt me! I'll... I'll tell you everything I know. I only pray Davik doesn't find out, or my life will end in terrible agony.;[];;[19340];[19369];tar08_davslav84;NM08AADAVS11019_.mp3
I greet you once more, mistress. How may this humble servant be of use to you?;[];;[19336, 19346, 19354];[None];tar08_davslav84;NM08AADAVS11059_.mp3
You're back, I see. And Bastila isn't even with you.;[];K_SWG_HELENA == 3 Bastila not in the party;[19373];[None];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01000_.mp3
I suppose she's too busy to even help her own mother, correct? Nothing more than I would expect from her after all this time.;[{'Helena': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[19374];[19372];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01002_.mp3
Go on, leave me be. I will find the holocron myself, if I have to.;[{'Helena': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[];[19373];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01004_.mp3
Back already? Have you even looked for the holocron, yet?;[{'Helena': 'Talk_Forceful'}];K_SWG_HELENA == 3 Bastila in the party;[19376, 19430];[None];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01006_.mp3
I have the holocron, Mother. I'm just not sure I want to give it to you.;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[19377];[19375];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01008_.mp3
And why not? Would you deny me even that?;[];;[19378];[19376];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01010_.mp3
I've never denied you anything, Mother. You may think I don't remember what it was like before I left for the order, but I do.;[];;[19379];[19377];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01012_.mp3
You were the one who pushed Father to go on one treasure hunt after the other. You loved living in wealth. You think I don't remember the fights?;[];;[19380];[19378];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01014_.mp3
You were eager to send me to the Jedi, even though I didn't want to go. You took Father away from me, and now this holocron is all I have of him.;[];;[19381];[19379];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01016_.mp3
Fool girl! You have a strange way of remembering things. That wasn't --;[{'Helena': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[19382];[19380];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01018_.mp3
No. I don't wish to argue with you any more, Mother. It's time we parted ways, now, for both our benefit.;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[19383, 19427, 19429];[19381];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01020_.mp3
Maybe you should listen to what she has to say.;[];;[19384];[19382];k_hhelena_dialog;
You don't know her. My mother is notoriously deceptive when she wants something. Why should she have the holocron?;[];;[19385];[19383];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01022_.mp3
Is it too difficult to believe that I am a dying woman who simply wishes to see her husband one last time?;[];;[19386];[19384, 19428];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01024_.mp3
I find it difficult to believe anything you say, Mother.;[];;[19387, 19419, 19420];[19385];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01026_.mp3
It sounds like you've already made up your mind.;[];;[19388];[19386];k_hhelena_dialog;
*Sigh* You're right. It shames me, but I just... I find it difficult to... let go of the past. I'm... sorry, Mother.;[];;[19389];[19387, 19419];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01028_.mp3
I was hard on you, dear. I wasn't a very good mother to you, I know that.;[{'Helena': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[19390];[19388];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01030_.mp3
Your father loved you so. He wanted you to be just like him... he wanted to take you on his hunts, but I said they were too dangerous.;[];;[19391, 19418];[19389];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01032_.mp3
Treasure hunting is a dangerous occupation.;[];;[19392];[19390];k_hhelena_dialog;
I always tried to keep him from the dangerous ones, but he would have none of it. It was a reckless life we led, always moving... I didn't want that for you.;[];;[19393];[19391, 19418];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01034_.mp3
So that's why you gave me to the Order?;[];;[19394];[19392];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01036_.mp3
What do your father and I have to show for all those years of hunting? Nothing. That was no life for anyone, especially not someone as gifted as you.;[];;[19395];[19393];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01038_.mp3
Your father... he spent all his last years trying to pay for my treatments. That's why he went for the pearls. I begged him not to, but...;[];;[19396];[19394];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01040_.mp3
Your treatments.;[];;[19397];[19395];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01042_.mp3
I'm dying, Bastila. I did not lie about that. It's been a long time in the coming, and there's really nothing that can be done anymore.;[{'Helena': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[19398];[19396];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01044_.mp3
I told your father to let me go, but you know how he was. Stubborn. Like you.;[];;[19399];[19397];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01046_.mp3
I'm so sorry, Mother. I don't know what to say...;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[19400];[19398];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01048_.mp3
Keep the holocron, Bastila. It would do me good to know you have it. This... talking to you... this is what I really needed before I...;[{'Bastila': 'Listen'}, {'Helena': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[19401];[19399];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01050_.mp3

Well, now. You said you had important business, and you were never one to mince words. You there... you take care of my daughter, you hear me?;[];;[19403, 19412, 19414, 19416];[19401];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01054_.mp3
I'll do my best.;[];;[19404];[19402];k_hhelena_dialog;
That's good. I'll feel a lot better knowing there's someone to watch her.;[];;[19405];[19403];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01056_.mp3
Where are you going to go?;[];;[19406];[19404, 19413, 19415, 19417];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01058_.mp3
It doesn't matter, dear. Don't you worry about me.;[{'Helena': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[19407];[19405];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01184_.mp3
Here. Take these 500 credits. It's all I have. Go to Coruscant and find a doctor. I'll meet you there after... after what I have to do.;[];;[19408];[19406];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01185_.mp3
But I already told you there's nothing that can --;[];;[19409];[19407];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01186_.mp3
Please, take it. I... want to see you again. When we can talk.;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[19410];[19408];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01187_.mp3
*sigh* Alright, I will. Now you do what you have to, Bastila. You go make your father and I proud.;[{'Bastila': 'Listen'}, {'Helena': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[19411];[19409];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01060_.mp3
I'll try. Farewell, Mother.;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[];[19410];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01062_.mp3
Bastila can take care of herself.;[];;[19413];[19402];k_hhelena_dialog;
So could her father. That doesn't mean she doesn't need help now and again.;[];;[19405];[19412];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01065_.mp3
As if she'd let me!;[];;[19415];[19402];k_hhelena_dialog;
You make her let you. She's too much like her father in that respect.;[];;[19405];[19414];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01068_.mp3
Hmph. I'm not her keeper.;[];;[19417];[19402];k_hhelena_dialog;
So you're not. I'd feel better knowing that someone was there to watch over her, however. I wasn't.;[];;[19405];[19416];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01071_.mp3
Yet you let your husband go on these dangerous expeditions.;[];;[19392];[19390];k_hhelena_dialog;
Maybe one of you should be the first to give the other a break?;[];;[19388];[19386];k_hhelena_dialog;
I agree. We should go before this gets ugly.;[];;[19421];[19386];k_hhelena_dialog;
So that's the way it is, is it? All that Jedi training and you haven't learned a thing.;[{'Helena': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[19422];[19420, 19429];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01079_.mp3
On the contrary, I've learned much. I've learned, for instance, when it is best to walk away from a situation that can lead only to conflict.;[];;[19423];[19421];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01081_.mp3
How can you learn anything when you hear only what you want to hear? Well, go on, then. Keep the holocron. It was for you, anyhow.;[];;[19424];[19422];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01083_.mp3
I'll just go off and die peacefully and you needn't bother with me anymore. That's obviously what's best.;[];;[19425];[19423];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01085_.mp3
Farewell, Mother. May the Force be with you.;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[19426];[19424];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01087_.mp3
Hmph. It may as well be with one of us.;[];;[];[19425];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01089_.mp3
Do you really need the holocron, Bastila?;[];;[19428];[19382];k_hhelena_dialog;
I... perhaps not. I can remember my father well enough. But I ask you: why should she have it?;[];;[19385];[19427];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01076_.mp3
You're right. Let's go.;[];;[19421];[19382];k_hhelena_dialog;
I don't have the holocron, if that's what you're asking.;[];;[19431];[19375];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01091_.mp3

You know my daughter? Where is she?;[];;[19435];[19433];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01097_.mp3
Nearby. I'm not sure she wants to meet with you.;[];;[19436];[19434];k_hhelena_dialog;
Is that so? Has she said this, herself? Tell her it is quite urgent that I speak with her at once. She has been most difficult to find.;[{'Helena': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[19437, 19439, 19441];[19435];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01099_.mp3
Tell me what you want and I'll relay it to her.;[];;[19438];[19436];k_hhelena_dialog;
I most certainly will not. What I have to say is for Bastila alone. It is... family business. That should be enough for her to come.;[{'Helena': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[];[19437];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01101_.mp3
She said that you two don't get along.;[];;[19440];[19436];k_hhelena_dialog;

That's the kind of response I would expect. Very well. We'll look for the holocron if we have time. I can't promise any more than that.;[];;[19482];[19480];k_hhelena_dialog;NM17AFHHEL01173_.mp3

Eh, I suppose, but I think it's pretty clear that you are the better player. You've won a lot. I suppose I can afford it, though.;[];Player won 10 games and got the big prize;[19700];[19698];kas22_xxpazaa_01;

Sure, let's go. Just a small wager to start, though, because I don't know how good you are. It's kind of a courtesy to new players.;[];Player has not won or lost previously.;[19702];[19698];kas22_xxpazaa_01;

You'll want to find some cards to improve that deck. Like I said, it's pretty basic. When you think you're ready, we'll have a game.;[];;[19692, 19698, 19714, 19717];[19712];kas22_xxpazaa_01;

What can you tell me about your attackers?;[];;[19824];[19822];kas25_hurt_01;
I've never seen their kind before, not even among the Czerka. You saw them, armored head to toe, yet blending with the forest.;[];;[19825, 19826];[19823];kas25_hurt_01;
They were Mandalorian. Poachers, probably. They use stealth units to stalk their prey. Their kind were among the first to flee when the war turned against my people. Bloody cowards.;[];;[19826];[19824];kas25_hurt_01;NM25AAHURT03068_.mp3
They followed us for a long while. We found bodies to the southwest, and then again further south after the west branch of the path. Their speed was amazing.;[];;[19827];[19825, 19824];kas25_hurt_01;
They fought like outsiders, waiting until we were unarmed. They would not attack until we had put our weapons away! They strike like cowards!;[];;[19828, 19832];[19826];kas25_hurt_01;
I'll look into it.;[];;[19829];[19827];kas25_hurt_01;
I thank you. I will wait here. I am too weak to fight them again, but I refuse to leave the Shadowlands unless vengeance is sated.;[];leaves;[19830];[19828];kas25_hurt_01;
Please, if you kill them, I will reward you with whatever I can. They are not worthy of life.;[];;[19831];[19829];kas25_hurt_01;
Look for them where the bodies of my fellows are. They will only attack you if you are not armed. The cowards.;[];;[];[19830];kas25_hurt_01;
This is not my problem.;[];;[19833];[19827, 19822];kas25_hurt_01;
You have already fought some of them. How can you claim it is not your problem? They may come for you next, waiting until you put your weapons away, like they attacked us.;[];;[19834];[19832];kas25_hurt_01;
I should have known not to expect much from an outsider. I will find them on my own... as weak as I am.;[];;[];[19833];kas25_hurt_01;

Wait, up-worlder. You can't go through this gate. There is too much danger and suffering beyond. For your own sake, turn back.;[];;[19857, 19865, 19874, 19877, 19879, 19880];[None];tar04_outwom044;NM04AAOUTW23000_.mp3
I have brought you a serum to cure the rakghoul disease.;[];;[19858];[19856, 19871, 19867, 19884];tar04_outwom044;
Your offer is generous, up-worlder, but the serum is useless to us now.;[];;[19859];[19857];tar04_outwom044;NM04AAOUTW23002_.mp3
The villagers infected with the rakghoul disease have been quarantined beyond this gate. At any moment they could be transformed into terrible monsters.;[];;[19860];[19858];tar04_outwom044;NM04AAOUTW23004_.mp3
Nobody would be foolish enough to risk going into the pens to give them the cure: the infected ones could transform into rakghouls and attack them at any moment.;[];;[19861, 19863, 19865, 19874];[19859, 19873];tar04_outwom044;NM04AAOUTW23006_.mp3
So you'll just leave the infected ones to die? You're a coward!;[];;[19862];[19860];tar04_outwom044;
I can't help the infected ones. They have to die so that the rest of the village can live. I accept this. If you think that makes me a coward, so be it.;[];;[19863, 19865, 19874];[19861];tar04_outwom044;NM04AAOUTW23008_.mp3

I can't stop you from going through the gates, up-worlder. But if the infected ones have already transformed into rakghouls you'll be walking into your grave.;[];;[];[19863];tar04_outwom044;NM04AAOUTW23028_.mp3

The villagers infected with the rakghoul disease are quarantined beyond this gate. It's only a matter of time until they transform into horrible creatures that would destroy us all.;[];;[19870, 19871];[19868, 19879, 19881];tar04_outwom044;NM04AAOUTW23021_.mp3

For the sake of the village, we have to keep the infected ones locked away. And when they finally do transform into rakghouls we'll let them destroy each other.;[];;[19857, 19863, 19865, 19872, 19874];[19870, 19869];tar04_outwom044;NM04AAOUTW23023_.mp3

I don't require anything right now - you can tell Davik everything about my stay has been most pleasing so far. Here's a five credit chip for your trouble, sirrah.;[];;[19890, 19892];[19888];tar08_davguest83;NM08AADAVG07006_.mp3

You're a friend of Carth's, I take it?;[];;[19946];[19922, 19948];k_hjordo_dialog;

Nice to meet you, Jordo.;[];;[19925];[19922, 19948];k_hjordo_dialog;

Excellent work, my young Sith. Your enemy lies dead at your feet and you are victorious... the final test is complete.;[{'Uthar Wynn': 'Bow'}];;[19950, 19963, 19973, 19974];[None];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03000_.mp3

You two were pathetically easy to turn on each other.;[];;[19952];[19950];kor39_utharwynn;
I must say that it is quite disappointing that you must die now, as well, seeing as you didn't inform me earlier of Yuthura's plans.;[];;[19964, 19967, 19969, 19971, 19972];[19949];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03014_.mp3

So you did. And now I shall destroy you as I would any other Sith who betrayed me.;[];;[19966];[19964];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03016_.mp3

Don't be a fool, Sith. I'll destroy you.;[{'Player': 'Taunt'}];;[19968];[19963, 19973];kor39_utharwynn;
Destroy me? I am not Yuthura, young one. I am a Sith Master... and I tire of foolish upstarts.;[];;[19966];[19967];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03018_.mp3
It's okay. I'm not here to join the Sith anyway.;[];;[19970];[19963, 19973];kor39_utharwynn;
Is that so? So you were a spy all along? How interesting.;[];;[19966];[19969, 19971, 19972];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03020_.mp3
It figures. You are as evil and twisted as Malak.;[];;[19970];[19963, 19973];kor39_utharwynn;
I am not here to join the Sith, anyway. My mission is done.;[];;[19970];[19963, 19973];kor39_utharwynn;
I must say that it is quite disappointing that you must die now, as well, since there's no telling how far your scheming with Yuthura went.;[{'Uthar Wynn': 'Persuade'}];;[19964, 19967, 19969, 19971, 19972];[19949];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03024_.mp3
You are truly a Sith in spirit, and one gifted with great power. Of this I no longer have any doubt. There is much more for you to learn, perhaps... but not here.;[];;[19975];[19949];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03025_.mp3
There is... something very strange about you, young one. Something I cannot place. You are like no other student I have ever met.;[];;[19976, 19986];[19974];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03026_.mp3
Why that is, I cannot say. Your path takes you elsewhere, however, and soon.;[];;[19977];[19975];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03027_.mp3
Go on to your destiny, then, and return here afterwards... if that is what you still desire.;[{'Uthar Wynn': 'Persuade'}];;[19978, 19981, 19983, 19984, 19985];[19976, 19994];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03028_.mp3
So am I a Sith now or not?;[];;[19979];[19977];kor39_utharwynn;
You have passed the final test, but I see it is not yet your destiny to join the order. Perhaps that will come in time, young one.;[];;[19980];[19978];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03030_.mp3
There is much you must accomplish, first. The dark side has plans for you. As I said... return once that is done, if you desire.;[];;[19981, 19983, 19984, 19985];[19979];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03031_.mp3
Perhaps we shall meet again.;[];;[19982];[19980, 19977];kor39_utharwynn;
May the Force serve you well, young one.;[{'Uthar Wynn': 'Bow'}];;[];[19981, 19983];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03033_.mp3
Alright, I'll go.;[];;[19982];[19980, 19977];kor39_utharwynn;
My desire is to see you dead, actually.;[];;[19952];[19980, 19977];kor39_utharwynn;
My desire is to see all evil such as yourself defeated.;[];;[19952];[19980, 19977];kor39_utharwynn;
Is it... is it possible that you are not what you seem to be? Tell me, young one... tell me what you really are.;[];;[19987, 19992, 19993, 19995];[19975];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03037_.mp3
I am Darth Revan. Bow before me.;[];;[19988];[19986];kor39_utharwynn;
Ah, I see. So it is... Darth Revan, not dead as we were led to believe.;[];;[19989];[19987, 19992, 19995];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03043_.mp3
And yet... and yet you are *not* Revan, are you? What has occurred between the time of your reported death and now I can only guess at, but you have changed much.;[];;[19990];[19988];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03044_.mp3
Regardless, your destiny does take you away from here... to confront your old pupil, without a doubt. Yes... that is what lies before you.;[];;[19991];[19989];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03045_.mp3
Go to your destiny, then, my Dark Lord. I shall say nothing of what you have done here. Should you prove victorious and wish to return, then I and all Sith shall be your servants.;[{'Uthar Wynn': 'Bow'}];;[];[19990];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03046_.mp3
I was once Darth Revan.;[];;[19988];[19986];kor39_utharwynn;
Who or what I am is not important.;[];;[19994];[19986];kor39_utharwynn;
I see. No matter what you might be, then, I am certain that your path takes you elsewhere... and soon.;[];;[19977];[19993];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03041_.mp3
If you were not blind, you would already know.;[];;[19988];[19986];kor39_utharwynn;
Do not let your attention waver! Strike her down!!;[{'Uthar Wynn': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[];[None];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03047_.mp3
So you return to us with the lightsaber in hand, as I knew you would.;[];;[19998];[None];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03048_.mp3
The Force has served you well.;[];;[19999];[19997];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03049_.mp3
You took a great risk in acquiring the artifact. You used your mind and your power... no peaceful meditation, no pacifism.;[];;[20000];[19998];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03050_.mp3
Sometimes you must fight in order to achieve. This gives you your passion, this makes you stronger. This is what makes you superior.;[];;[20001];[19999];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03051_.mp3
That is the lesson we teach with that part of the final test. Do you understand?;[];;[20002, 20004, 20008, 20010, 20015];[20000];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03052_.mp3
The Sith are not the only ones who fight and take risks.;[];;[20003];[20001, 20007, 20009, 20014, 20012];kor39_utharwynn;
True, but most would say they fight only when they must... or not at all. We are the ones who know that struggle is what makes us superior.;[{'Uthar Wynn': 'Persuade'}];;[20004, 20008, 20010, 20015];[20002];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03054_.mp3
Are you saying a Jedi couldn't have gotten the lightsaber?;[];;[20005];[20003, 20009, 20014, 20012, 20001];kor39_utharwynn;
When a Jedi acts, it is with skill, true. But the Jedi teach you that your passions are counter-productive. That strength is only found in peace.;[{'Uthar Wynn': 'Persuade'}];;[20006];[20004];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03056_.mp3
Did you not feel a moment of excitement in the tomb? Did your passions not flow and make you feel stronger and more alive?;[];;[20007];[20005];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03057_.mp3
What purpose would be served by restricting yourself from such? I would say only the purpose of the Jedi. Through this they would control you and restrict your potential.;[];;[20002, 20008, 20010, 20015];[20006];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03058_.mp3
I wouldn't say I exerted myself getting this.;[];;[20009];[20007, 20014, 20012, 20003, 20001];kor39_utharwynn;
Perhaps not, to someone of your natural strength. The point is in the recognition of the nature of the act rather than its sheer difficulty.;[{'Uthar Wynn': 'Persuade'}];;[20002, 20004, 20010, 20015];[20008];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03060_.mp3
I don't believe you. I don't feel superior to anyone.;[];;[20011];[20009, 20007, 20003, 20001];kor39_utharwynn;
If you came to the academy, you must have felt the stirrings within you that cry out for the freedom of the dark side, that cry out for release.;[{'Uthar Wynn': 'Persuade'}];;[20012];[20010];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03062_.mp3
I can only show you the path that will lead to power and superiority. You have followed it this far... you must decide if you are capable of continuing.;[];;[20002, 20004, 20008, 20013, 20015];[20011];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03063_.mp3
And if I'm not?;[];;[20014];[20012];kor39_utharwynn;
This is where your path ends, young one. There is no turning back once you have embarked on it.;[];;[20002, 20004, 20008, 20015];[20013];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03065_.mp3
I think I understand.;[];;[20016];[20014, 20012, 20009, 20007, 20003, 20001];kor39_utharwynn;
Good. The last part of your test will now commence. Here you will learn the lesson of competition.;[];;[20017];[20015];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03067_.mp3
All life must compete in order to flourish. Such is the natural way of the universe. To stand still is to know death... one must always be moving forward.;[];;[20018];[20016];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03068_.mp3
So is it the same amongst the Sith. Compete or die. Mercy is irrelevant.;[];;[20019];[20017];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03069_.mp3
So it behooves you in this final test to strike down one you are familiar with, for no other reason than to prove you are superior and without mercy.;[];;[20020];[20018];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03070_.mp3
Normally this would be against another student. You, however, get a special treat. You will fight Yuthura, here... my own apprentice.;[];;[20021, 20063];[20019];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03071_.mp3
You talk too much, old fool.;[{'Yuthura Ban': 'Taunt'}];;[20022];[20020];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03072_.mp3
So... you know, do you? Well, it makes no difference. You have become too ambitious, Yuthura... it is time for you to die.;[{'Uthar Wynn': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[20023];[20021];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03073_.mp3
No, it is time for *you* to die, master. My pupil stands with me.;[{'Yuthura Ban': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[20024, 20062];[20022, 20064];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03074_.mp3
Oh? Is this true, young one? You wish to join Yuthura in her foolish scheme?;[{'Uthar Wynn': 'Persuade'}];;[20025, 20030, 20037, 20061];[20023];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03075_.mp3
Sorry, Uthar... I'm with Yuthura on this one.;[];;[20026];[20024, 20062];kor39_utharwynn;
Do you hear that, my master? That is the sound of a new leader rising to replace you.;[{'Yuthura Ban': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[20027, 20029];[20025];kor39_utharwynn;NM39AAUTHA03078_.mp3

Maybe that Iridorian skullslacker at the bar, or the Echani nerfherder cowering in the corner is available.;[];;[20180, 20186, 20190, 20196];[20178];man26_manmerc;NM26AAMANM07014_.mp3
Can I ask you some questions?;[];;[20181];[20179, 20189, 20202, 20204, 20203];man26_manmerc;
Normally I'd charge you for information, but times are good right now and I'm feeling generous. So ask your questions, free of charge.;[];;[20182, 20184, 20186, 20194, 20196, 20198];[20180];man26_manmerc;NM26AAMANM07016_.mp3
Do you know about the murder of Elassa?;[];Sunry plot active;[20183];[20181, 20185, 20195, 20200];man26_manmerc;
Not really. They say some Republic war hero killed her. Maybe you should check out the Republic Embassy.;[];;[20184, 20186, 20190, 20194, 20196, 20198];[20182];man26_manmerc;NM26AAMANM07018_.mp3
Do you know anything about ancient ruins or a Star Map?;[];;[20185];[20183, 20195, 20200, 20181];man26_manmerc;
If there ever were any ruins on this world, they've long since disappeared beneath the oceans.;[];;[20182, 20186, 20194, 20196, 20198];[20184];man26_manmerc;NM26AAMANM07020_.mp3
Don't you hate the Republic for defeating your people?;[];;[20187];[20185, 20195, 20200, 20183, 20181, 20179, 20202];man26_manmerc;
I'm a realist. It was war, after all. And even though the Republic destroyed my people, the leaders of the armada were Revan and Malak, so I hate the Sith just as much.;[];;[20188];[20186];man26_manmerc;NM26AAMANM07034_.mp3
And with this war, there's plenty of opportunity to take bloody vengeance against both sides and make a nice profit along the way. We Mandalorians are always practical. Not like those blood-thirsty Iridorians, or those honor-bound Echani.;[];;[20189];[20187];man26_manmerc;NM26AAMANM07036_.mp3
Is there anything else you want?;[];;[20180, 20190, 20196];[20188];man26_manmerc;NM26AAMANM07038_.mp3
What do you have against the Echani and the Iridorians?;[];;[20191];[20189, 20200, 20183, 20179, 20202];man26_manmerc;
Nothing, except the Echani are a bunch of fey dancers, prancing into battle with tiny weapons not fit for Mandalorian children. They hardly wear any armor because it slows them down when they run away.;[];;[20192];[20190];man26_manmerc;NM26AAMANM07026_.mp3
But the Echani are better than the Iridorians. Those savages keep hacking at fallen foe even after death, mutilating the corpse out of pure blood lust.;[];;[20193];[20191];man26_manmerc;NM26AAMANM07028_.mp3
I even heard they'll turn on each other when the battle fever hits. Who wants to work with someone like that? I can pretty much name my price right now, especially since the Republic is so desperate for mercs all of a sudden.;[];;[20194, 20196];[20192];man26_manmerc;NM26AAMANM07030_.mp3
Why is the Republic hiring so many mercenaries?;[];;[20195];[20193, 20185, 20183, 20181];man26_manmerc;
They ain't saying, but the price sure is right. Of course, I haven't heard of anyone coming back, so I'm guessing the job ain't easy.;[];;[20182, 20184, 20186, 20196];[20194];man26_manmerc;NM26AAMANM07032_.mp3
I'll be going now.;[];;[20197];[20195, 20193, 20189, 20200, 20185, 20183, 20181, 20179, 20202];man26_manmerc;
So why are you telling me? If you're going, go. I don't need a status report.;[];;[];[20196];man26_manmerc;NM26AAMANM07040_.mp3
Do you know anything about the young Selkath who have gone missing?;[];;[20199];[20185, 20183, 20181];man26_manmerc;
Not really. I have no interest in the Selkath other than the fact that they are charging me an exorbitant amount to stay on this world.;[];;[20200];[20198];man26_manmerc;NM26AAMANM07022_.mp3
The Iridorian over there, however... He, I believe, may know more. He has been seen with several of them before.;[];;[20182, 20184, 20186, 20190, 20196];[20199];man26_manmerc;NM26AAMANM07024_.mp3
So the Sith smoked a Jedi outpost on Dantooine. No survivors, or so they say. First Taris, now Dantooine. Wouldn't surprise me if the Republic starts hiring mercs to make a counter attack.;[]; first time after dantooine has been destroyed;[20202];[None];man26_manmerc;NM26AAMANM07006_.mp3
They might even hire some Echani or Iridorian mercenaries, if they're desperate. I bet a Mandalorian could make some good money working for the Republic right now.;[];;[20180, 20186, 20190, 20196];[20201];man26_manmerc;NM26AAMANM07008_.mp3
All of a sudden the Republic isn't hiring mercenaries anymore.;[]; first time after hrakert rift plot;[20180, 20204];[None];man26_manmerc;NM26AAMANM07009_.mp3
And now the kolto harvest is at an all time low. More than just coincidence, if you ask me.;[];;[20180];[20203];man26_manmerc;NM26AAMANM07011_.mp3
You with the Selkath? You here to see me about the murder too?;[];;[20206];[None];man26_firith;NM26ACFIRI02000_.mp3
I told the damn fish everything I knew, what more do you all want from me?;[];;[20207, 20234, 20242];[20205];man26_firith;NM26ACFIRI02002_.mp3
What do you know about Sunry and Elassa?;[];;[20208];[20206, 20237, 20243];man26_firith;
Sunry I only heard of once or twice in passing. Some sort of old-time war hero against the Sith. Seen him around in the hotel too. Going to Elassa's room always of course.;[];;[20209];[20207];man26_firith;NM26ACFIRI02004_.mp3
Kept the rest of the building up half the night with their damn antics usually!;[];;[20210, 20240];[20208];man26_firith;NM26ACFIRI02006_.mp3
You mean Sunry was having a relationship with Elassa?;[];;[20211];[20209, 20241];man26_firith;
I'm not saying anything like that. What they did in that room, in private, is their business.;[];;[20212];[20210];man26_firith;NM26ACFIRI02008_.mp3
And there isn't any rule against Sith and Republics seeing each other for personal reasons. Although if you think her Sith Master didn't know, heh, you must be fooling yourself.;[];;[20213, 20234, 20238];[20211];man26_firith;NM26ACFIRI02010_.mp3
Sith Master?;[];;[20214];[20212];man26_firith;
Uh... well Elassa was a Sith... so of course she'd have to have someone above her... yeah. I didn't see anything!;[];;[20215, 20227, 20230, 20232];[20213];man26_firith;NM26ACFIRI02012_.mp3
[Persuade] What did you see?;[];;[20216, 20226];[20214];man26_firith;
[Success] Well... one time... I saw Elassa coming in wearing this big cloak. I was on my way to my room, and she normally wears stuff like that so I didn't pay her too much attention.;[];;[20217];[20215, 20228, 20231];man26_firith;NM26ACFIRI02014_.mp3
But this time I accidentally brushed up against her - accidentally of course! - and her cloak fell open...;[];;[20218];[20216];man26_firith;NM26ACFIRI02016_.mp3
Now I don't have no qualms about the Sith! I leave them alone and they leave me alone. And seeing as how Elassa had a Sith lightsaber under her cloak, I'm not going to poke that hornet's nest.;[];;[20219, 20222, 20224];[20217];man26_firith;NM26ACFIRI02018_.mp3
She was a Dark Jedi?;[];;[20220];[20218];man26_firith;
Seems so... But I'm not getting myself in any further with the Sith. I know how ruthless they are.;[];;[20221];[20219];man26_firith;NM26ACFIRI02020_.mp3
Now that's all I'm going to tell you. I'll testify it to the court, but you aren't going to get anything else out of me.;[];;[];[20220, 20223];man26_firith;NM26ACFIRI02025_.mp3
A lightsaber does not mean anything.;[];;[20223];[20218];man26_firith;
I don't know what it means to you, but to me it kind of screams 'Dark Jedi'. And I'm not getting myself in any further with the Sith. I know how ruthless they are.;[];;[20221];[20222, 20225];man26_firith;NM26ACFIRI02023_.mp3
I have a lightsaber too, you know.;[];;[20225];[20218];man26_firith;
I know, I know, but you're a Jedi. Elassa never claimed to be.;[];;[20223];[20224];man26_firith;NM26ACFIRI02028_.mp3
[Failure] I didn't see anything and there's no way you can make me say otherwise! Now quit asking!;[];;[20227, 20230, 20232];[20215];man26_firith;NM26ACFIRI02030_.mp3
[Persuade] Maybe if I tossed in 100 credits?;[];;[20228, 20229];[20226, 20214];man26_firith;
[Success] Since you put it that way...;[];;[20216];[20227];man26_firith;NM26ACFIRI02032_.mp3
[Failure] 100 credits isn't enough for the kind of trouble I'd be having if I told you. Sorry, you're gonna have to look somewhere else.;[];;[20230, 20232];[20227];man26_firith;NM26ACFIRI02034_.mp3
[Force Persuade] You know you want to tell me.;[{'Player': 'Persuade'}];;[20231];[20229, 20226, 20214];man26_firith;
[Success] You know, I think I could trust you. Heck, I don't know why I shouldn't tell you.;[];;[20216];[20230];man26_firith;NM26ACFIRI02036_.mp3
Okay, okay, I'll ask something else.;[];;[20233];[20229, 20226, 20214];man26_firith;
Thanks...;[];;[20234, 20238];[20232];man26_firith;NM26ACFIRI02039_.mp3
What did you see the night of the murder?;[];;[20235];[20233, 20212, 20206, 20243];man26_firith;
I was in my room, minding my own business with the lastest copy of Pazaak Weekly - checking out the listings for the big tournament that's gonna be held here soon - when I heard a blaster shot.;[];;[20236];[20234];man26_firith;NM26ACFIRI02043_.mp3
Being still alive - and therefore smart enough not to stick my head out immediately - I didn't go out right away. I looked out after a minute and saw Gluupor in the hall by Elassa's room, and Sunry running like the wind.;[];;[20237];[20235];man26_firith;NM26ACFIRI02045_.mp3
You can't tell me that someone who was running like that - and he was pretty fast for a cripple! - isn't guilty.;[];;[20207, 20238];[20236];man26_firith;NM26ACFIRI02047_.mp3
I have nothing more to ask for now.;[];;[20239];[20237, 20233, 20212];man26_firith;
Yes, well I'll be right here... Not like they're letting me go anywhere else...;[];;[];[20238, 20242, 20244];man26_firith;NM26ACFIRI02050_.mp3
Elassa roomed here often?;[];;[20241];[20209];man26_firith;
Yes. She rented a room every week or so. Coincidentally it was right about the same time that Sunry would show up. They didn't seem all that discreet either.;[];;[20210];[20240];man26_firith;NM26ACFIRI02041_.mp3
Nothing for now.;[];;[20239];[20206];man26_firith;
You again... didn't I tell you people everything I knew? So why do you keep coming back to me?;[];;[20207, 20234, 20244];[None];man26_firith;NM26ACFIRI02052_.mp3
Nothing more for now.;[];;[20239];[20243];man26_firith;
You Sith don't scare me. Down here the swoop gang's are in charge and you don't have enough troops on Taris to do anything about it!;[];;[];[None];tar03_hidbek031;NM03AAHIDB14000_.mp3

You were racing for those damn Vulkars! You'll pay for that!;[];;[];[20246];tar03_hidbek031;NM03AAHIDB14004_.mp3
You better be careful out here. Those damn Vulkars will be looking to get even with you for winning that race and killing Brejik.;[];;[];[20246];tar03_hidbek031;NM03AAHIDB14006_.mp3
Brejik is nothing but a punk! I don't know why those Vulkars follow him - Gadon's ten times the man he is!;[];;[];[None];tar03_hidbek031;NM03AAHIDB14008_.mp3

Greetings, fellow student. Have you heard the news? Master Uthar reports that his apprentice, Yuthara, is dead. How unsettling.;[];;[];[None];kor35_tariga;
You return to the academy in an odd time. Master Yuthara has just taken over leadership. No doubt there will be many other changes to come.;[];;[];[None];kor35_tariga;
Have you seen Master Uthar and Yuthara? There are many in the academy who seem to be searching for them.;[];;[];[None];kor35_tariga;
Greetings, fellow student. Are you planning on going to the Valley of the Dark Lords? I am headed there soon, myself.;[];Tariga should only appear at the exit to the valley when the player has been given the second challenge when selected;[20257, 20263, 20270, 20275, 20280];[None];kor35_tariga;
Who are you?;[];;[20258];[20256, 20269, 20265];kor35_tariga;
I am known as Tariga, a student here at the academy. It is my pleasure to be assigned to the Sith ruins, to study their past and unearth new relics.;[];;[20259, 20263, 20270, 20275, 20280];[20257];kor35_tariga;
You're human, but you speak like a Twi'lek...;[];;[20260];[20258, 20265, 20262];kor35_tariga;
I was raised on a planet in the Outer Rim. We were not part of the Republic, so we never adopted their language. I can understand Basic, but I am not fluent in speaking it yet.;[];;[20261];[20259];kor35_tariga;
I am, however, quite fluent in the Twi'lek tongue, so I prefer to use it when dealing with others. It is nearly as well known as Basic, and no one will make fun of my accent.;[];;[20262];[20260];kor35_tariga;
I think I made the right choice. I doubt I would have been assigned to the Sith ruins in the Valley of the Dark Lords if I was stuttering and stumbling over an unfamiliar language.;[];;[20259, 20263, 20270, 20275, 20280];[20261];kor35_tariga;
How do I get to this valley?;[];;[20264];[20262, 20269, 20274, 20279, 20277, 20258, 20256];kor35_tariga;
The exit at the end of this hall will bring you to the surface. There you merely follow a natural path through the rock and you will come to the valley, itself.;[];;[20265];[20263];kor35_tariga;
You will find many Sith working on the dig at the southern end of the valley. If you head into the northern end where the strange pillars are, do beware of the tuk'ata beasts.;[];;[20257, 20259, 20266, 20270, 20275, 20280];[20264];kor35_tariga;
What are these tuk'ata?;[];;[20267];[20265, 20279, 20277];kor35_tariga;
Local beasts that hunt in packs and are not at all afraid of attacking students... or even armed patrols. They have proven to be a hindrance to our progress.;[];;[20268, 20269];[20266];kor35_tariga;
Arrogant hunters always assume the animal knows how important they are.;[];;[20269];[20267];kor35_tariga;
Several attempts have been made to destroy their nests in the tombs, but their numbers have proven to be too great.;[];Gives the PC some tuk'ata bait;[20257, 20263, 20270, 20275, 20280];[20268, 20267];kor35_tariga;
What can you tell me about the valley?;[];;[20271];[20269, 20279, 20277, 20265, 20262, 20258, 20256];kor35_tariga;
There are four tombs that have been uncovered so far, each holding the remains of a Sith Lord from a time long ago when the Sith were first on Korriban.;[];;[20272];[20270];kor35_tariga;
We have found evidence that there were larger structures underground, a veritable ancient fortress... but it appears to have been destroyed. The tombs are all that remain intanct.;[];;[20273];[20271];kor35_tariga;
Currently we are allowed access only to three tombs... the one furthest to the left may only be entered by Master Uthar and those he brings with him.;[];;[20274];[20272];kor35_tariga;
Fortunately there is still much else for us to find. I am pleased that you have joined us.;[];;[20263, 20275, 20280];[20273];kor35_tariga;
Anything I should be watchful for?;[];;[20276];[20274, 20269, 20265, 20262, 20258, 20256];kor35_tariga;
Yes, indeed. Shortly before entering the valley, you will pass by a cave entrance. Do not enter it... it is full of dangerous creatures we call shyrack.;[];;[20277];[20275];kor35_tariga;
The only other danger to speak of is the tuk'ata. There are guards that will protect you if you remain in the south part of the valley, however.;[];;[20263, 20266, 20270, 20278, 20280];[20276];kor35_tariga;
What are these shyrack?;[];;[20279];[20277];kor35_tariga;
Flying creatures that lay webs in their tunnels. The webs can only be burned or moved by explosives I believe. Best to avoid them entirely.;[];;[20263, 20266, 20270, 20280];[20278];kor35_tariga;
I'll be going.;[];;[20281];[20279, 20277, 20274, 20269, 20265, 20262, 20258, 20256];kor35_tariga;
I wish you well, fellow student.;[];once the player has passed the second test, she will leave permanently;[];[20280];kor35_tariga;
I wish you well in your explorations.;[];;[];[None];kor35_tariga;
Greetings, Padawan. You must be the one Master Bolook has enlisted to help him with this problem.;[];;[20284];[None];dan14_idroid;NM14ACIDRO06000_.mp3
I am an information retrieval droid. I can assist you by accessing the records of both the Jedi Enclave and the central government facilities here on Dantooine.;[];;[20285];[20283, 20310];dan14_idroid;NM14ACIDRO06004_.mp3
If you have any need of my services, please do not hesitate to talk to me.;[];;[20286];[20284];dan14_idroid;NM14ACIDRO06006_.mp3
I have already retrieved some information from the archives on Calder Nettic, Rickard Lusoff and Handon Guld. I have also had time to examine the body of Mr. Nettic.;[];;[20287];[20285];dan14_idroid;NM14ACIDRO06008_.mp3
Is there any information you require?;[];;[20288, 20291, 20295, 20299, 20301, 20304, 20308];[20286];dan14_idroid;NM14ACIDRO06010_.mp3
What did you find out about the body?;[];;[20289];[20287, 20290];dan14_idroid;
My preliminary analysis of the body indicates that he was killed approximately 3 hours ago by a single energy blast to the torso.;[];;[20290];[20288];dan14_idroid;NM14ACIDRO06025_.mp3
Is there any other information you need?;[];;[20288, 20291, 20295, 20298, 20299, 20301, 20304, 20308];[20289, 20294, 20297, 20300, 20303, 20307];dan14_idroid;NM14ACIDRO06023_.mp3
Tell me about the blood sample.;[];;[20292];[20290, 20287];dan14_idroid;
I have just received back an analysis of a sample of the blood found on the weapon. It had been sent back to the Enclave just before you arrived.;[];;[20293];[20291];dan14_idroid;NM14ACIDRO06011_.mp3
The blood on the weapon is definitely not Calder's. Unfortunately there was a bacterial contaminant in the sample that had been taken back to the laboratory, and it had become degraded.;[];;[20294];[20292];dan14_idroid;NM14ACIDRO06013_.mp3
We cannot get any more specific analysis from that sample other than the fact it did not belong to Calder.;[];;[20290];[20293, 20298];dan14_idroid;NM14ACIDRO06015_.mp3
Is there a report of Handon's blaster being stolen?;[];;[20296];[20290, 20287];dan14_idroid;
I am sorry, but I seem to be failing you. I have searched and searched, but I cannot seem to come up with anything at all.;[{'Information Droid': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[20297];[20295];dan14_idroid;NM14ACIDRO06043_.mp3

Tell me about the weapon found at the scene.;[];;[20294];[20290];dan14_idroid;

The Southwood speeder rental business has records that, over the past several weeks, a speeder had been rented by Mr. Nettic and Mr. Guld.;[];;[20290];[20299];dan14_idroid;NM14ACIDRO06028_.mp3
What can you tell me about Calder and Rickard?;[];;[20302];[20290, 20287];dan14_idroid;
According to the municipal authorities near the Garang spaceport, there had been news of violent drunken activity in a cantina attached to the port.;[];;[20303];[20301];dan14_idroid;NM14ACIDRO06031_.mp3
Apparently a Mr. R. Lusoff was making accusations at a Mr. C. Nettic about cheating him in a business deal. Jedi Tooka was dispatched to the scene and restored order.;[];;[20290];[20302];dan14_idroid;NM14ACIDRO06033_.mp3
Tell me about these plains.;[];;[20305];[20290, 20287];dan14_idroid;
These plains are rife with wild animals, not all of them benign. The iriaz are mostly docile, but can easily be provoked to violence. Kath hounds, on the other hand, are much more deadly...;[];;[20306];[20304];dan14_idroid;NM14ACIDRO06036_.mp3
There have been over 35 catalogued attacks on settlers by kath hounds in the last 2 weeks. A general advisory was given out three days ago to carry a weapon at all times when on the plains.;[];;[20307];[20305];dan14_idroid;NM14ACIDRO06038_.mp3
Small farms and holdings dot the plains, and can provide safe refuge for those in need.;[];;[20290];[20306];dan14_idroid;NM14ACIDRO06040_.mp3
I will have more questions later.;[];;[20309];[20290, 20287];dan14_idroid;
Very well. I will be here to assist you.;[];;[];[20308];dan14_idroid;NM14ACIDRO06053_.mp3
Greetings, apprentice. You must be the one Master Bolook has enlisted to help him with this problem.;[];;[20284];[None];dan14_idroid;NM14ACIDRO06002_.mp3
Congratulations, Stranger. I never thought anyone would beat Starkiller. Did you know it was because of him that I became a duelist in the first place?;[];Dialog Mission Statement: End dialog #1 is the only scripting event that needs to happen. If the player speaks to Ice and Bendak is dead she will speak and then escape area and destroy self.;[20312];[None];tar02_ice021;NM02AEICE017000_.mp3
As a little girl I used to dream of meeting him one day. When I finally did, the guy was a complete slime ball. Made me realize I had to be cold and ruthless to survive, like him.;[];;[20313];[20311];tar02_ice021;NM02AEICE017002_.mp3
And now he's dead. There's probably a lesson in there somewhere. Something for me to think about, at least. Congratulations again, Stranger... and goodbye.;[];;[];[20312];tar02_ice021;NM02AEICE017004_.mp3
I heard you're going to fight Bendak Starkiller, Stranger. I'm not one to mince words, so let me just say this: you're dead. He'll kill you, end of story.;[];;[20315];[None];tar02_ice021;NM02AEICE017006_.mp3
You think I'm cold and hard, wait until you step into the ring with him. He's a natural born killer. You had great potential, Stranger. Too bad you're going to throw it all away.;[];;[];[20314];tar02_ice021;NM02AEICE017008_.mp3
I've never been one to shy away from the cold, hard truth so I'll just come right out and say it: I can't compete with the likes of you, Stranger. I know when I'm overmatched.;[];;[20317];[None];tar02_ice021;NM02AEICE017010_.mp3
You're good - very good. But you're wrong if you think that means I'm suddenly going to warm up to you. Truth is, I really don't have anything more to say, so you might as well move on.;[];;[];[20316];tar02_ice021;NM02AEICE017012_.mp3
What do you want? Wait, let me guess - now that you're a duelist you figure we have something in common? Something to chat about, right?;[];;[20319];[None];tar02_ice021;NM02AEICE017014_.mp3
Wrong! Just because we're both duelists doesn't mean we're suddenly friends. So give me some space, Stranger. I've got nothing more to say to you.;[];;[];[20318];tar02_ice021;NM02AEICE017016_.mp3
Back again? Didn't you get the message last time - I'm not here to make friends. Talk to the Duel Organizer if you want a match, otherwise leave me alone.;[];;[];[None];tar02_ice021;NM02AEICE017018_.mp3
Wait, I know what you're going to say: I'm so beautiful, I'm so attractive, how can someone who looks so hot with a weapon in her hand be called Ice? Well, I've heard it all before.;[];;[20322];[None];tar02_ice021;NM02AEICE017020_.mp3
I'm here to take care of business in the dueling ring, not to have some slack-jawed, goggle-eyed man slobber all over me. So back off!;[];;[20323, 20325, 20328];[20321];tar02_ice021;NM02AEICE017022_.mp3
Wow - that was cold!;[];;[20324];[20322, 20327, 20330];tar02_ice021;
Now you know why they call me Ice. If you're looking for a match, go talk to the Ajuur. He's that big Hutt over there in the corner. Otherwise, just go away.;[];;[];[20323];tar02_ice021;NM02AEICE017024_.mp3
Dueling ring? What are you talking about?;[];;[20326];[20322, 20330];tar02_ice021;
You don't know about the dueling ring? This is unbelievable! Then why are you even here? Wait - never mind. I don't really care.;[];;[20327];[20325];tar02_ice021;NM02AEICE017027_.mp3
You know what? I'm not one for friendly chit-chat, so I'm just going to deliver the cold, hard facts: I don't want to waste anymore time with you.;[];;[20323];[20326, 20328];tar02_ice021;NM02AEICE017030_.mp3
I just want to ask you some questions.;[];;[20327];[20322, 20330];tar02_ice021;
Wait, I know what you're going to say: it's great to see a woman in the duel ring, strike a blow for equality, I'm a credit to my gender, blah, blah, blah. Just save it, okay?;[];;[20330];[None];tar02_ice021;NM02AEICE017031_.mp3
I'm just here to take care of business in the dueling ring. For some reason every woman who comes in here thinks we should have some kind of female bond. Guess what? We don't!;[];;[20323, 20325, 20328];[20329];tar02_ice021;NM02AEICE017033_.mp3

It's...;[];;[20334];[20332];dan14_elise;
It's just soo great to have him back!;[];;[20335];[20333, 20342, 20343];dan14_elise;NM14AAELIS09003_.mp3
We're just going to go right home, right now, and celebrate, aren't we, my lovely little droid?;[];;[20336];[20334];dan14_elise;NM14AAELIS09004_.mp3

[sadly] Beep boop-oop.;[];;[20340];[20338, 20337];dan14_elise;
I agree. Completely.;[];;[20341];[20339];dan14_elise;
Ha! Better get used to it, droid!;[];;[];[20340, 20338, 20337];dan14_elise;NM14AAELIS09011_.mp3

Greetings, young Jedi, I wonder if you could assist me. I seem to have lost my... companion, you see.;[{'Elise': 'Flirt'}];;[20345, 20386, 20390];[None];dan14_elise;NM14AAELIS04000_.mp3
Your companion?;[];;[20346];[20344, 20388];dan14_elise;
We were working on my farm to the north of here. I was working in the garden outside, and he was working inside.;[];;[20347];[20345, 20389, 20407];dan14_elise;NM14AAELIS04002_.mp3
I heard the door to the house open, but not close. I went to see and found it wide open!;[];;[20348];[20346];dan14_elise;NM14AAELIS04003_.mp3
I searched everywhere, and could not find him! I worry so much. I need him back so badly. I wonder if he... Could he have been kidnapped?;[{'Elise': 'Talk_Pleading'}];;[20349, 20383, 20384];[20347];dan14_elise;NM14AAELIS04004_.mp3
It is possible...;[];;[20350];[20348];dan14_elise;
Maybe it was the Mandalorians... or maybe kath hounds. But... no...;[];;[20351];[20349, 20385];dan14_elise;NM14AAELIS04006_.mp3
Kath hounds are not intelligent enough to open doors. Although they have been more vicious lately...;[];;[20352];[20350, 20383];dan14_elise;NM14AAELIS04008_.mp3
No, it must have been someone who could open the door by himself. Come to think of it, the door was locked!;[];;[20353, 20355, 20382];[20351];dan14_elise;NM14AAELIS04009_.mp3
Did someone break it down?;[];;[20354];[20352];dan14_elise;
No, the door was undamaged and showed no signs of tampering...;[];;[20355];[20353, 20382];dan14_elise;NM14AAELIS04011_.mp3
Could it have been opened from the inside?;[];;[20356];[20354, 20352];dan14_elise;
Well... Yes, it could have. But he had no reason to run away! His programming...;[];;[20357, 20378, 20379, 20380];[20355];dan14_elise;NM14AAELIS04014_.mp3
Your missing companion is a droid??;[]; if the player has not heard the history before;[20358];[20356, 20393];dan14_elise;

But he is very valuable to me all the same! He is the last piece of my poor, passed-away husband that I have left.;[];;[20360];[20358];dan14_elise;NM14AAELIS04030_.mp3
He is very dear to me, my precious is. I don't know what I'd do without him!;[];;[20361, 20363];[20359];dan14_elise;NM14AAELIS04031_.mp3

You live alone with this... droid?;[];;[20365];[20363];dan14_elise;
He is a personal assistance droid. My husband was a genius at constructing droids. He made this one capable of taking care of me for the rest of my life.;[];;[20366];[20364, 20377];dan14_elise;NM14AAELIS04036_.mp3
As the last legacy of my husband, for my own personal ease of mind, I need him back! His absence gnaws at me like a gaping wound.;[];;[20367, 20371];[20365];dan14_elise;NM14AAELIS04037_.mp3
Wow. She really misses her droid, doesn't she?;[];;[20368, 20371];[20366];dan14_elise;NM14AAELIS04038_.mp3

Well, Motta pays for timing on official runs, but rec-runs are staffed by volunteers. They deserve a little something.;[];;[20415];[20413];tat17_04race_01;

What do you have on Garm?;[];;[20430, 20433];[20428, 20434, 20426, 20435, 20424, 20436, 20437, 20422];tat17_04race_01;
You have made short work of his best time of <CUSTOM27>.;[];;[20423, 20425, 20427, 20431];[20429];tat17_04race_01;
Let's go back to my other questions.;[];;[20432];[20430, 20433, 20428, 20434, 20426, 20435, 20424, 20436, 20437, 20422];tat17_04race_01;
Just don't keep me too long. Other racers might want to have a run down the track. Do you want a race?;[];;[20411, 20413, 20416, 20419, 20421];[20431];tat17_04race_01;
His current best time is <CUSTOM27>.;[];;[20423, 20425, 20427, 20431];[20429];tat17_04race_01;
Yuka Rill's best time is currently <CUSTOM28>.;[];;[20423, 20425, 20429, 20431];[20427];tat17_04race_01;
Her best time is <CUSTOM29>, which you have beaten.;[];;[20423, 20427, 20429, 20431];[20425];tat17_04race_01;
Your best time is <CUSTOM25>. Your first time was <CUSTOM24> and the last time we have for you is <CUSTOM26>.;[];;[20425, 20427, 20429, 20431];[20423];tat17_04race_01;
You are the current track leader. Your best time was <CUSTOM25>. Your first time was <CUSTOM24> and the last time we have for you is <CUSTOM26>.;[];;[20425, 20427, 20429, 20431];[20423];tat17_04race_01;
Well, another swoop-jock come to give the track a try? It's just a 20 credit timing fee for recreational runs.;[];;[20411, 20413, 20416, 20419, 20421];[None];tat17_04race_01;
Sorry, the track is only for racers that Motta has accepted and signed up. He pays for track upkeep, so it's his choice.;[];;[20440];[None];tat17_04race_01;
Go talk to him and we'll see about setting you up.;[];;[];[20439];tat17_04race_01;
Well raced. You would do well in our local tournament. Did you want to have another go? The fee is 20 credits, as you know.;[];Initiated after player races recreational run, player has not defeated everyone yet.;[20411, 20413, 20416, 20419, 20421];[None];tat17_04race_01;
A good result. I can see how you beat everyone in the official races. Did you want to have another go? The fee is 20 credits, as you know.;[];Initiated after player races recreational run, player has defeated everyone already.;[20411, 20413, 20419, 20421];[None];tat17_04race_01;
I heard you challenged Bendak Starkiller. I'll probably watch the fight... but forgive me if I don't go to your funeral.;[];;[];[None];tar02_deadeye021;NM02AEDEAD06000_.mp3
This is great! You beat Bendak - you're a legend! Whenever anyone asks I can say I was the first duelist the Mysterious Stranger ever beat in the ring! I'm going to be famous!;[];;[];[None];tar02_deadeye021;NM02AEDEAD06002_.mp3
Wow - you're the new champ. Congratulations, I guess. You know, when you started out I actually thought I'd be able to crawl up from my last place ranking for a while.;[];;[20446];[None];tar02_deadeye021;NM02AEDEAD06004_.mp3
Shows what I know. Enjoy your time at the top, Stranger. Sooner or later someone will come along to knock you down here with the rest of us grinders!;[];;[];[20445];tar02_deadeye021;NM02AEDEAD06006_.mp3
You beat Ice! I've been trying to beat her for years, and you do it just like that! Heh. I can't believe how lucky you are!;[];;[20448];[None];tar02_deadeye021;NM02AEDEAD06008_.mp3
That's right - I said lucky! Lucky to be born with the kind of talent I've spent a life time trying to build. It isn't fair, I tell you!;[];;[];[20447];tar02_deadeye021;NM02AEDEAD06010_.mp3
What do you want? Oh, let me guess - you beat me in the dueling ring and now you're here to rub it in my face! Yeah well, I'm used to it. So pardon me if I ignore your gloating.;[];;[20450, 20456, 20458];[None];tar02_deadeye021;NM02AEDEAD06012_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;[];;[20451];[20449, 20460];tar02_deadeye021;
Questions? I don't have to answer your questions just because you beat me in the ring!;[];;[20452];[20450];tar02_deadeye021;NM02AEDEAD06014_.mp3
Look, I admit it - you're better than me. Everyone is better than me! A blindfolded, one-legged tach with a rusty knife could probably beat me, okay?;[];;[20453];[20451, 20459];tar02_deadeye021;NM02AEDEAD06016_.mp3
Is that what you wanted to hear? You satisfied yet? Are you happy now that you've taken the last shred of dignity I have?;[];;[20454, 20456];[20452];tar02_deadeye021;NM02AEDEAD06018_.mp3
Yeah, I'm happy now.;[];;[20455];[20453];tar02_deadeye021;
Slime-rat.;[];;[];[20454];tar02_deadeye021;NM02AEDEAD06020_.mp3
Uh... I'll just be going now.;[];;[20457];[20453, 20449];tar02_deadeye021;
Oh. Well... okay. Goodbye, then.;[];;[];[20456];tar02_deadeye021;NM02AEDEAD06026_.mp3
Wow - you sure have a bad attitude.;[];;[20459];[20449];tar02_deadeye021;
Gee, I wonder why? Couldn't have anything to do with being the WORST duelist on Taris, could it? Even a rookie like you got the better of me!;[];;[20452];[20458];tar02_deadeye021;NM02AEDEAD06023_.mp3
Back for more, eh? I thought you would have learned your lesson by now: don't step into the dueling ring with Deadeye Duncan!;[];;[20450, 20461, 20463];[None];tar02_deadeye021;NM02AEDEAD06028_.mp3
I want a rematch!;[];;[20462];[20460];tar02_deadeye021;
I may have lost 54 consecutive matches before I beat you, but I figure I've got your number! You want to step into the ring again, just tell the duel organizer to set it up!;[];;[];[20461];tar02_deadeye021;NM02AEDEAD06030_.mp3
Goodbye.;[];;[20464];[20460, 20472, 20470, 20467, 20465];tar02_deadeye021;
Yeah yeah, off you go. Run away like the coward you are!;[];;[];[20463];tar02_deadeye021;NM02AEDEAD06034_.mp3
What are you looking at, fresh meat? You want a piece of me? You want to step into the dueling chambers with me?;[];;[20463, 20466, 20468, 20473];[None];tar02_deadeye021;NM02AEDEAD06036_.mp3
Who are you?;[];;[20467];[20465];tar02_deadeye021;
I'm Deadeye Duncan, the number five ranked duelist in this cantina. You must have seen me in the dueling chambers, right?;[];;[20463, 20468, 20471, 20473];[20466];tar02_deadeye021;NM02AEDEAD06038_.mp3
Dueling chambers?;[];;[20469];[20467, 20472, 20465];tar02_deadeye021;
You know - the dueling chambers: two people in combat, loser gets carried out unconscious on a stretcher. It's the only reason people come into this part of the cantina.;[];;[20470];[20468];tar02_deadeye021;NM02AEDEAD06042_.mp3
"Look, I'm the number five ranked duelist around here; I don't have time to explain all this. Go talk to the Duel Organizer if you're interested. He's that Hutt over there in the corner.";[];;[20463, 20471, 20473];[20469];tar02_deadeye021;NM02AEDEAD06044_.mp3
You're the number five ranked duelist? Out of how many?;[];;[20472];[20470, 20467];tar02_deadeye021;
Uh... five. But it's an elite group, okay? It's not like just anyone can step into the dueling chamber! Well, actually anyone can... but not many do!;[];;[20463, 20468, 20473];[20471];tar02_deadeye021;NM02AEDEAD06040_.mp3
You don't look so tough. I think I could beat you in a duel.;[];;[20474];[20472, 20470, 20467, 20465];tar02_deadeye021;
Big talk. Go speak with the Hutt in the corner to back it up - he's the Duel Organizer. I'll look forward to our match. Fresh meat is just what I need to end my losing streak!;[];;[];[20473];tar02_deadeye021;NM02AEDEAD06046_.mp3
Yeah, what do you...? Oh, I apologize Master Jedi, I should not have been rude.;[];;[20476, 20479, 20506, 20519];[None];man26_reparg;NM26ADREPA01000_.mp3
It is alright.;[];;[20477];[20475];man26_reparg;
No really, I should apologize. I should try to control myself... as you Jedi do.;[];;[20478];[20476];man26_reparg;NM26ADREPA01002_.mp3
Is there anything I can help you with?;[];;[20479, 20506, 20519];[20477];man26_reparg;NM26ADREPA01003_.mp3
Why do the Sith upset you so much?;[];;[20480];[20478, 20494, 20498, 20475];man26_reparg;
These damn Sith are everywhere on Manaan, pushing us Republic citizens around, trying to goad us into breaking the law somewhere.;[];;[20481, 20510, 20512];[20479];man26_reparg;NM26ADREPA01005_.mp3
Breaking the law?;[];;[20482];[20480];man26_reparg;
The Selkath want to maintain their neutrality in this war we're fighting with the Sith and they enforce it VERY strictly.;[];;[20483];[20481];man26_reparg;NM26ADREPA01007_.mp3
So we have to sit here and let the Sith insult us and we can't raise a hand against them otherwise the Republic will face severe kolto export restrictions. That could lose us the war altogether.;[];;[20484, 20495, 20499, 20502];[20482, 20511];man26_reparg;NM26ADREPA01013_.mp3
What is kolto?;[];;[20485];[20483, 20494, 20500, 20505];man26_reparg;
You're joking... right?;[];;[20486];[20484];man26_reparg;NM26ADREPA01027_.mp3
Sorry, but everyone knows what kolto is. The most powerful healing agent in the galaxy. I would've died several times myself if we didn't have this stuff handy.;[];;[20487];[20485];man26_reparg;NM26ADREPA01028_.mp3
But the reason it's important here is that kolto is only found naturally on Manaan, and all of our attempts to synthesize it have failed miserably.;[];;[20488];[20486];man26_reparg;NM26ADREPA01029_.mp3
So we sit here on the surface, the Selkath harvesting what kolto bubbles up from the bottom of the ocean, and we buy it from them.;[];;[20489];[20487];man26_reparg;NM26ADREPA01030_.mp3
Us and the Sith of course. The Selkath don't want to play favorites.;[];;[20490, 20501, 20506];[20488];man26_reparg;NM26ADREPA01031_.mp3
The Republic and Sith both stay here?;[];;[20491];[20489, 20500, 20505];man26_reparg;
The Selkath think that by staying neutral they can play both sides, selling kolto to everyone that needs it, and making themselves too valuable to be worth conquering.;[];;[20492];[20490, 20501];man26_reparg;NM26ADREPA01033_.mp3
Well, that, and they threatened to destroy the only natural source of kolto on the planet if anyone tries to attack them.;[];;[20493];[20491];man26_reparg;NM26ADREPA01034_.mp3
But I think they're underestimating the lengths the Sith will go to get what they want... They're probably planning something already.;[];;[20494];[20492];man26_reparg;NM26ADREPA01035_.mp3
Is there anything else you require?;[];;[20479, 20484, 20495, 20506];[20493];man26_reparg;NM26ADREPA01036_.mp3
Have you seen an ancient Star Map?;[];;[20496];[20494, 20483, 20520];man26_reparg;
A Star Map? Like an ancient artifact or something?;[];;[20497];[20495];man26_reparg;NM26ADREPA01040_.mp3
No, sorry, never heard of it.;[];;[20498];[20496];man26_reparg;NM26ADREPA01041_.mp3
Is there anything else I can do for you?;[];;[20479, 20499, 20502, 20506];[20497];man26_reparg;NM26ADREPA01042_.mp3
Why are there Sith on Manaan?;[];;[20500];[20498, 20483, 20520];man26_reparg;
Well, for the kolto, of course. Really that's the only reason anyone would want to be here. It's the only reason the Selkath built Ahto City in the first place: to export kolto.;[];;[20484, 20490, 20501];[20499];man26_reparg;NM26ADREPA01021_.mp3
Why haven't they joined the Republic?;[];;[20491];[20500, 20505, 20489];man26_reparg;
Tell me about Ahto City.;[];;[20503];[20498, 20483, 20520];man26_reparg;
Um... It's big. Real big. Actually it's pretty much the only real city on the entire world. The only place for us air-breathers anyway.;[];;[20504];[20502];man26_reparg;NM26ADREPA01023_.mp3
Manaan is a water world - which you may have noticed on your way down to land here - inhabited natively by a species of fish-people called the Selkath.;[];;[20505];[20503, 20521];man26_reparg;NM26ADREPA01024_.mp3
They built this city to cater to us off-worlders and as a base of operations to export kolto, which is the only real thing they have to trade here.;[];;[20484, 20490, 20501];[20504];man26_reparg;NM26ADREPA01025_.mp3
Never mind, I must go.;[];;[20507];[20498, 20494, 20489, 20478, 20475];man26_reparg;
Of course. If you have any other questions you should probably see Roland Wann, he's the Republic diplomat here. He's by the Republic enclave near the visitor residences.;[];;[20508];[20506];man26_reparg;NM26ADREPA01044_.mp3
If you don't know where that is, go north from here, then south past the port official and the first courtyard, east into the second courtyard, then north then east again. You got that?;[];;[20509];[20507];man26_reparg;NM26ADREPA01045_.mp3
Have a pleasant stay, Master Jedi.;[];;[];[20508];man26_reparg;NM26ADREPA01046_.mp3
Why don't you run them off Manaan?;[];;[20511];[20480];man26_reparg;
There's nothing we can do, though. The Selkath want to maintain their neutrality and they enforce it VERY strictly.;[];;[20483];[20510, 20514, 20516, 20518];man26_reparg;NM26ADREPA01012_.mp3
The Sith and the Republic coexisting peacefully? Well... relatively...;[];;[20513];[20480];man26_reparg;
Peacefully? Not hardly. Just look in their eyes. You can see they'd like nothing more than to kill each and every one of us, personal-like.;[];;[20514, 20515, 20517];[20512];man26_reparg;NM26ADREPA01010_.mp3
Yeah, I know the feeling...;[];;[20511];[20513];man26_reparg;
They mean well, but are misguided.;[];;[20516];[20513];man26_reparg;
You're... you're joking, right? The smug Hutt-spawn push us every chance they can get and enjoy it.;[];;[20511];[20515];man26_reparg;NM26ADREPA01015_.mp3
It is the work of the dark side.;[];;[20518];[20513];man26_reparg;
If you say so, Master Jedi. It's very aggravating. Sometimes I just want to take one of them and... *grrr*;[];;[20511];[20517];man26_reparg;NM26ADREPA01017_.mp3
I would like to ask a few questions.;[];;[20520];[20478, 20475];man26_reparg;
Of course, I'm always willing to help a Jedi. What do you require?;[];;[20495, 20499, 20502, 20521];[20519];man26_reparg;NM26ADREPA01019_.mp3
Who are the Selkath?;[];;[20504];[20520];man26_reparg;
If you have any other questions you should probably see Roland Wann, he's the Republic diplomat here. He's by the Republic enclave near the visitor residences. Have a pleasant stay, Master Jedi.;[];;[];[None];man26_reparg;NM26ADREPA01047_.mp3
Another Sith patrol? I'm telling you, you're wasting your time here.;[];;[20524];[None];tar02_dia022;NM02AADIA004000_.mp3
Go ahead and search my apartment again, if you want. You'll find the same thing as last time... nothing.;[];;[];[20523];tar02_dia022;NM02AADIA004002_.mp3
Who are you? What are you doing in here? You can't just come barging into someone's home!;[];;[20526, 20529, 20537, 20569, 20571];[None];tar02_dia022;NM02AADIA004004_.mp3
I spoke to Holdan, Dia. He'll remove the bounty on your head if you pay him off.;[];;[20527];[20525, 20573, 20576];tar02_dia022;
I have nothing... I barely make enough credits to get by. I can't afford to pay that pig off!;[];;[20528];[20526];tar02_dia022;NM02AADIA004057_.mp3
I guess I have no choice but to stay here and hope Holdan cools down. With that bounty on my head it's too dangerous to go outside.;[];;[];[20527, 20566, 20568, 20575];tar02_dia022;NM02AADIA004063_.mp3
I spoke with Holdan. I convinced him to remove the bounty on your head.;[];;[20530];[20525, 20573, 20576];tar02_dia022;
He... he called the bounty off? That's wonderful! I only wish I had something to give you as a reward.;[];;[20531];[20529];tar02_dia022;NM02AADIA004006_.mp3
Wait a minute... I know! I don't have many credits, but there is something I can give you. It's a family heirloom. It's not much, but it's something.;[];;[20532, 20534, 20535];[20530];tar02_dia022;NM02AADIA004008_.mp3
Keep your reward, Dia. Helping you was thanks enough.;[];;[20533];[20531];tar02_dia022;
I can never truly repay you for helping me, but you'll always have my thanks for what you did.;[];;[];[20532, 20534, 20536];tar02_dia022;NM02AADIA004053_.mp3
Thank you, Dia. This reward will be fine.;[];;[20533];[20531];tar02_dia022;
I save your life and all I get is some family trinket?;[];;[20536];[20531];tar02_dia022;
If I had more I'd gladly give it to you, but this is all I've got. I'm sorry.;[];;[20533];[20535];tar02_dia022;NM02AADIA004012_.mp3
I'm here to collect the bounty on your head, Dia!;[];;[20538];[20525, 20546, 20576];tar02_dia022;
Wait! Think about what you're doing. If that pig had just kept his hands to himself, I wouldn't have had to give him that scar with my vibroblade.;[];;[20539];[20537, 20554];tar02_dia022;NM02AADIA004015_.mp3
He gets drunk and tries to force himself on me, and I get a bounty put on my head for defending myself? Where's the justice in that? Holdan's the one to blame, not me.;[];;[20540, 20562, 20568];[20538];tar02_dia022;NM02AADIA004017_.mp3
Is there anything I can do to help?;[];;[20541];[20539, 20553, 20546];tar02_dia022;
I doubt it. Holdan is one of Davik's men. When you work for the local crime lord the authorities tend to turn a blind eye. I'm afraid this is between me and Holdan now.;[];;[20542, 20545, 20554, 20555];[20540, 20567];tar02_dia022;NM02AADIA004031_.mp3
Maybe I could speak to Holdan for you.;[];;[20543];[20541];tar02_dia022;
You could try, I guess. He usually hangs out at the cantina in the Lower City. It probably won't do any good. Holdan's used to getting his own way.;[];;[20544];[20542];tar02_dia022;NM02AADIA004033_.mp3
That's one of the fringe benefits of being a goon for Davik. Working for the local crime lord lets you get away with things. Still, I appreciate the offer.;[];;[20545, 20555];[20543];tar02_dia022;NM02AADIA004035_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;[];;[20546];[20544, 20553, 20559, 20550, 20548, 20541, 20570, 20576];tar02_dia022;
I can't help you there. Since this thing with Holdan I've been scared to leave my apartment. I don't know anything about what's going on in the outside world anymore.;[];;[20537, 20540, 20547, 20555];[20545];tar02_dia022;NM02AADIA004049_.mp3

Czerka Corporation will begin an extensive examination of the commercial potential of this world. The Wookiees will aid us in this.;[];;[20585];[20583];kas22_xxjanos_02;

The tomb is an ancient ruin on the surface that was visited years ago by Darth Revan and Darth Malak. They discovered a Star Map there of great importance.;[];;[20718, 20720, 20914, 20915];[20716];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24011_.mp3

Master Uthar cannot prevail against us both. That's all there is to it. It is a very simple matter.;[];;[20724, 20726, 20731, 20734, 20737, 20912];[20722];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24019_.mp3

I suppose you could do that. Even the hint of betrayal from his pupil and Uthar would move to eliminate me.;[];;[20728];[20726];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24028_.mp3

What fuels your power with the Force but your passion? The stronger, darker emotions. Anger, hatred, fear... these passions empower us.;[];;[20755, 20757, 20761, 20763];[20753];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24118_.mp3
What about love?;[];;[20756];[20754, 20758, 20760, 20762];kor35_yuthuraban;
Love is more dangerous than all those things. Love leads to anger and hatred more often that not... but it also leads to mercy, which is far worse. That, however, is a lesson for another time.;[];;[20757, 20761, 20763];[20755];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24120_.mp3
Those seem like awfully negative passions.;[];;[20758];[20756, 20762, 20754];kor35_yuthuraban;
Negative? Compared to what? What keeps even the most rudimentary creature alive? Fear to run, anger to fight... without it a creature would most surely die.;[];;[20755, 20759, 20761, 20763];[20757];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24122_.mp3
Are you saying we aren't anything more than a rudimentary creature?;[];;[20760];[20758];kor35_yuthuraban;
We are far more than them, perhaps, but in some ways we are little different. To think us creatures beyond the need of simple passions is a delusion.;[];;[20755, 20761, 20763];[20759];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24124_.mp3

Unless the victory is achieved by demonstrating that your power is superior, it is only an illusion. Temporary at best. We seek more.;[];;[20749, 20753, 20765, 20771, 20779, 20782];[20769];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24134_.mp3

I think I got it.;[];;[20783];[20781, 20778, 20770, 20767, 20764, 20752, 20748];kor35_yuthuraban;
I am not surprised. The Force is strong with you... master it and it shall serve you well.;[];;[20740, 20784, 20808, 20809, 20821, 20837, 20840, 20842, 20848, 20861];[20782];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24147_.mp3
I have some news about Uthar...;[];the player has already gone to Uthar;[20785];[20783, 20820, 20836, 20839, 20841, 20858, 20879, 20908, 20925, 20931, 20934, 20936, 20938, 20939, 20940];kor35_yuthuraban;
What? What's happened? Our plan is still intact, I hope.;[];;[20786, 20806];[20784];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24064_.mp3
He plans to have me fight you in the final test.;[];;[20787];[20785];kor35_yuthuraban;
Ahhh. How very clever of him. Normally you would face some other student in the tomb, preferably one of the failed ones.;[];;[20788];[20786];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24066_.mp3
Obviously Uthar has decided to get rid of me. But why...? Did you say something to him?;[];;[20789, 20803];[20787];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24067_.mp3
Yes, I did.;[];;[20790];[20788];kor35_yuthuraban;
What?! You fool! While I respect your attempt to play both sides of the fence, you are playing a dangerous game.;[{'Yuthura Ban': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[20791];[20789];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24069_.mp3
If you think Uthar will truly be so grateful to you for double-crossing me, think again. Your only chance lies with me.;[];;[20792];[20790, 20805];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24070_.mp3
In the end, it works out better that it is only the two of us in the tomb with him. So long as we refuse to fight. Is there anything else I should know?;[];;[20793, 20798, 20800, 20802];[20791, 20804];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24073_.mp3
He wants you poisoned. I'm supposed to give this pad to Andrenas.;[];player has Uthar's pad;[20794];[20792];kor35_yuthuraban;
Let me see that. Hmm... so it's true. Thank you for bringing this to me... now I will be far stronger than Uthar expects.;[];Yuthura takes the pad, destroys it.;[20795];[20793];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24075_.mp3
Here... this passcard will allow you access to Uthar's quarters. It's at the far end of the passages with the other quarters.;[];;[20796];[20794, 20799, 20801];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24081_.mp3
Take this device as well and put it inside his cot. No-one should see you do it. Then Uthar will be too weak to stand up against us.;[];Yuthura gives the passcard and the device to the PC set the betrayal global to 3;[20797];[20795];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24082_.mp3
Don't even think of failing me. You and I are too far into this now to back out.;[];;[];[20796];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24083_.mp3
[Lie] He wants you poisoned. I don't know how, though.;[];Yuthura has already been poisoned;[20799];[20792];kor35_yuthuraban;
Hah! He's a fool. I can make preparations to resist any poisons. Thank you for telling me... now I will be far stronger than Uthar expects.;[];;[20795];[20798];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24077_.mp3
[Lie] No. I don't know anything else.;[];;[20801];[20792];kor35_yuthuraban;
Good. I'm not about to rest on my laurels, however.;[];;[20795];[20800, 20802];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24080_.mp3
[Lie] No, that's it.;[];Yuthura has not already been poisoned;[20801];[20792];kor35_yuthuraban;
[Persuade/Lie] No, of course not.;[];;[20804, 20805];[20788];kor35_yuthuraban;
[Success] Then how could he suspect? Unless one of the others... never mind. It is not important, now.;[];;[20792];[20803];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24072_.mp3
[Failure] Hmph. I truly doubt that. You are attempting to play both sides of the fence, I think. I respect that. You are playing a dangerous game, however.;[];;[20791];[20803];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24084_.mp3
It's nothing. Our plan is fine.;[];;[20807];[20785];kor35_yuthuraban;
Good. Let's keep it that way.;[];;[20740, 20744, 20808, 20809, 20821, 20837, 20840, 20842, 20848, 20861];[20806];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24086_.mp3
I want to ask more about the Code.;[];if the Code is known but the test not completed;[20745];[20807, 20820, 20836, 20839, 20841, 20858, 20879, 20783, 20743, 20908, 20925, 20931, 20934, 20936, 20938, 20939, 20940];kor35_yuthuraban;
I want to know more about these ruins on the surface.;[];;[20810];[20807, 20820, 20836, 20839, 20841, 20858, 20879, 20783, 20908, 20739, 20925, 20931, 20934, 20936, 20938, 20939, 20940];kor35_yuthuraban;
I have been involved in the work there over the last couple of years, but not often. Most of the excavating is left to the students. What did you wish to know?;[];;[20811, 20816, 20819];[20809];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24150_.mp3
Is there any way into the tomb of Naga Sadow?;[];;[20812];[20810, 20818];kor35_yuthuraban;
Not unless you are accompanied by Master Uthar, no. It is strictly forbidden... and I truly doubt you could bypass the doors to the tomb with anything less than ship blasters. Even then, perhaps.;[];;[20813, 20816, 20819];[20811];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24152_.mp3
There's no other way inside?;[];;[20814];[20812];kor35_yuthuraban;
None. I do not even know how Master Uthar gains entrance, to tell the truth, though I look forward to discovering that fact.;[];;[20815];[20813];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24154_.mp3
I have searched many times, so do not bother... there is no other way. Do not fret, however. Simply get the prestige you need and you will see the tomb soon enough.;[];;[20816, 20819];[20814];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24155_.mp3
Why are the Sith so interested in these ruins?;[];;[20817];[20815, 20812, 20810];kor35_yuthuraban;
We could learn much about the history of the ancient Sith... why they were on Korriban and why they left.;[];;[20818];[20816];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24333_.mp3
Perhaps we could learn more about the origin of the Force, itself. With that knowledge could come great power.;[];;[20811, 20819];[20817];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24157_.mp3
I've heard enough.;[];;[20820];[20818, 20815, 20812, 20810];kor35_yuthuraban;
As you wish.;[];player has passed the second test;[20740, 20744, 20784, 20808, 20809, 20821, 20837, 20840, 20842, 20848, 20861];[20819];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24159_.mp3
Do you know anything about Darth Revan?;[];;[20822];[20820, 20836, 20839, 20841, 20858, 20879, 20807, 20783, 20908, 20925, 20931, 20934, 20936, 20938, 20939, 20940];kor35_yuthuraban;
Revan? You mean Darth Malak's former master?;[];;[20823];[20821];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24161_.mp3
That's the one.;[];;[20824, 20896];[20822];kor35_yuthuraban;
Very little. I never met him personally, though I hear he was a powerful man. Very charismatic.;[];;[20825];[20823];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24163_.mp3
In the end, Revan was outshone by his pupil. Such is the way of the Sith. Why? Is this dead man of importance to you?;[];;[20826, 20830, 20833, 20835];[20824];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24164_.mp3
Do you think it's possible Revan might be alive?;[];;[20827];[20825, 20832, 20834, 20897];kor35_yuthuraban;
Anything is possible. Uthar's former master still lives... though he is in no condition to challenge his former pupil for leadership.;[];;[20828];[20826];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24168_.mp3
Perhaps the same is true for Revan. Perhaps Revan is out there, somewhere, waiting to take revenge upon Malak.;[];;[20829];[20827];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24169_.mp3
More likely what we were told is the truth: Revan is dead. Malak would be foolish to leave his old master alive, considering all the knowledge Revan held.;[];;[20830, 20833, 20835];[20828];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24170_.mp3
So you wouldn't recognize Revan if the two of you met?;[];;[20831];[20829, 20834, 20825, 20897];kor35_yuthuraban;
Is there any reason I should? Beside the fact that I did not know Revan in life, Revan was known for wearing a full helmet and cape.;[];;[20832];[20830];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24172_.mp3
Perhaps Revan's body had been disfigured by the power of the Force... it is not unheard of. Regardless, I doubt I shall be meeting Revan anytime soon.;[];;[20826, 20833, 20835];[20831];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24173_.mp3
You mentioned that Revan came here before?;[];;[20834];[20832, 20829, 20825, 20897];kor35_yuthuraban;
Both Revan and Malak came to Korriban when they discovered the tomb of Naga Sadow. That was before my time.;[];;[20826, 20830, 20835];[20833];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24175_.mp3
That's all I have to ask.;[];;[20836];[20834, 20832, 20829, 20825, 20897];kor35_yuthuraban;
Fair enough.;[];;[20740, 20744, 20784, 20808, 20809, 20821, 20837, 20840, 20842, 20848, 20861];[20835, 20910];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24093_.mp3
Do you know a student named Kel?;[];Kel has told the player his secret plot not resolved yet;[20838];[20836, 20841, 20858, 20879, 20820, 20807, 20783, 20908, 20739, 20931, 20934, 20936, 20938, 20939, 20940];kor35_yuthuraban;
Yes... vaguely. The boy burdens himself with doubts and anxieties. It is sad to watch, really, for he does possess a certain flair with the Force.;[];;[20839];[20837];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24178_.mp3
Kel will not survive long. Someone will betray him soon enough, and he will be dead. If you are smart and you know something, that person should be you.;[];;[20740, 20744, 20784, 20808, 20809, 20821, 20840, 20842, 20848, 20861];[20838];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24179_.mp3
Tell me about yourself.;[];;[20841];[20839, 20836, 20820, 20807, 20783, 20908, 20739, 20925, 20931, 20934, 20936, 20938, 20939, 20940];kor35_yuthuraban;
About myself? I am originally from Sleheyron, if you must know. I was a slave to a cruel master, Omeesh the Hutt. I am sure you don't need to know more.;[];;[20740, 20744, 20784, 20808, 20809, 20821, 20837, 20842];[20840];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24181_.mp3

I hope to see you again.;[];;[];[20842];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24231_.mp3
Come back soon... my friend.;[];;[];[20842];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24232_.mp3
You are very close to succeeding... work quickly!;[];;[];[20842];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24233_.mp3
You have had an excellent start... go, gain more prestige!;[];;[];[20842];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24234_.mp3
You have much to do.;[];;[];[20842];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24235_.mp3
You mentioned you were from Sleheyron...;[];;[20849];[20839, 20836, 20820, 20807, 20783, 20908, 20925, 20931, 20934, 20936, 20938, 20939, 20940];kor35_yuthuraban;
I did. I also said that you didn't need to know more. Why are you asking?;[];;[20850, 20860];[20848];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24183_.mp3
[Persuade] I just would like to know more about you, that's all.;[];;[20851, 20859];[20849];kor35_yuthuraban;
[Success] I... see. Very well. I suppose there's no harm in the tale.;[];;[20852];[20850];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24185_.mp3
As I said, I was originally a slave to one of the Hutts. The Hutts control everything on Sleheyron, and a slave is nothing to them.;[];;[20853];[20851];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24186_.mp3
I was determined not to be 'nothing'. One night when the drunken worm had me alone in his chambers I stabbed him and escaped the compound.;[];;[20854];[20852];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24187_.mp3
I stole onto a cargo ship and was not discovered by the crew until they reached the next system. They left me for dead on a desolate planetoid, alone... but that was fine by me. I was glad to be anywhere other than Sleheyron.;[];;[20855];[20853];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24188_.mp3
It was not luck that I was eventually rescued, of course. The Force was strong with me, though I didn't know that at the time. Not until the Jedi told me, that is.;[];;[20856];[20854];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24189_.mp3
The Jedi found you? What happened?;[];;[20857];[20855];kor35_yuthuraban;
I'd... rather not discuss it. Perhaps another time.;[{'Yuthura Ban': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[20858];[20856];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24191_.mp3
Is there something else you needed?;[];;[20740, 20744, 20784, 20808, 20809, 20821, 20837, 20842];[20857, 20859, 20860, 20891, 20895];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24194_.mp3

Alright, forget I asked.;[];;[20858];[20849, 20864, 20862];kor35_yuthuraban;
How did you become a Sith?;[];;[20862];[20839, 20836, 20820, 20807, 20783, 20908, 20925, 20931, 20934, 20936, 20938, 20939, 20940];kor35_yuthuraban;
I... would prefer not to discuss that.;[{'Yuthura Ban': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[20860, 20863];[20861];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24196_.mp3
I'd really like to hear the tale.;[];;[20864];[20862];kor35_yuthuraban;
Why? There is no point. Have I asked you about your past?;[];;[20860, 20865, 20892, 20894];[20863];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24198_.mp3
[Persuade] I just thought we could become friends, is all.;[];;[20866, 20891];[20864];kor35_yuthuraban;
[Success] You... have odd notions for someone hoping to become a Sith.;[];;[20867];[20865];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24200_.mp3
Let's see... after escaping from Sleheyron I was found by the Jedi. They took me in and trained me even though I was a bit older than most Padawans.;[];;[20868];[20866, 20893];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24201_.mp3
You were a Jedi?;[];;[20869];[20867];kor35_yuthuraban;
Not really, no. I never progressed beyond Padawan. I had discipline, but no peace... and after my treatment at the hands of the Hutts there was little room in me for the ways of the Jedi.;[];;[20870, 20872, 20890];[20868];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24203_.mp3
You sound much like... someone I know.;[];;[20871];[20869];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24204_.mp3
Yes, well... I imagine I am not unique. Things very easily could have been very different for me.;[];;[20872];[20870, 20890];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24205_.mp3
I wanted to use the Force to free the other slaves I knew, to fight for what I knew was right. The Jedi restrained me until I couldn't stand it any more.;[];;[20873];[20871, 20869];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24207_.mp3
They claim the dark side is evil, but that isn't so. Sometimes anger and hatred are deserved and right. Sometimes things change because of it.;[{'Yuthura Ban': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[20874, 20886, 20888];[20872];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24208_.mp3
But not always. Mostly it makes things worse.;[];;[20875];[20873];kor35_yuthuraban;
Any failure to get the results I want is due to a lack of power on my part. That can change, in time. As a Sith, my mettle is tested far more than when I was a Padawan.;[];;[20876];[20874];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24210_.mp3
I know this may sound strange, but only my compassion stands in my way, now. Once that is gone let the slavers beware.;[];;[20877, 20880, 20882, 20884];[20875, 20887, 20889];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24215_.mp3
But... if you lose your compassion, will you still care about those slaves?;[];;[20878];[20876];kor35_yuthuraban;
I... yes, of course. I mean losing my compassion as in... holding back...;[];;[20879];[20877];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24217_.mp3
But enough of that. I've talked about myself too much, surely you are tired of it.;[{'Yuthura Ban': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[20740, 20744, 20784, 20808, 20809, 20821, 20837, 20842];[20878, 20881, 20883, 20885];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24224_.mp3
How long before you begin this fight, do you think?;[];;[20881];[20876];kor35_yuthuraban;
I... well, there is much training to do. I... may be a long time...;[];;[20879];[20880];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24219_.mp3
It's a commendable goal. I admire your spirit.;[];;[20883];[20876];kor35_yuthuraban;

I find it hard to think of any Sith with compassion.;[];;[20885];[20876];kor35_yuthuraban;
I suppose I shouldn't be telling you these things... sharing my weaknesses with you. Being a Sith doesn't make me a monster, however.;[];;[20879];[20884];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24223_.mp3
But has anything changed?;[];;[20887];[20873];kor35_yuthuraban;
No... not yet. But my anger has not diminished, nor my desire to see change. The more time I spend with the Sith the more I am certain that one day I will be able to fight as I must.;[];;[20876];[20886];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24212_.mp3
I agree.;[];;[20889];[20873];kor35_yuthuraban;
There is suffering and injustice in the universe. I am surprised the Jedi can even stand the stench of it, much less stand by and do nothing.;[];;[20876];[20888];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24214_.mp3
You sound very much like... someone I used to know.;[];;[20871];[20869];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24206_.mp3
[Failure] Friends? We can be friends once Uthar is dead. Until then, a 'friend' is a weakness.;[];;[20858];[20865, 20892];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24225_.mp3
[Persuade] I just thought we could become friends... or maybe something more.;[{'Player': 'Flirt'}];;[20891, 20893];[20864];kor35_yuthuraban;
[Success] I see. You... certainly have odd notions for one hoping to become a Sith. I'll play along... for now.;[{'Yuthura Ban': 'Flirt'}];;[20867];[20892];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24227_.mp3
[Persuade] Is there any harm in telling me?;[];;[20895];[20864];kor35_yuthuraban;
[Failure] There is always harm in becoming too vulnerable. I will not be as weak as you desire.;[];;[20858];[20894];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24229_.mp3
Very little. I never met her personally, though I hear she was a powerful woman. Very charismatic.;[];;[20897];[20823];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24165_.mp3
In the end, Revan was outshone by her pupil. Such is the way of the Sith. Why? Is this dead woman of importance to you?;[];;[20826, 20830, 20833, 20835];[20896];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24166_.mp3
Yes, go on.;[];;[20899, 20903, 20904, 20907, 20909];[20743];kor35_yuthuraban;
There are a group of students who refused an order by Master Uthar to execute a group of civilians in the colony.;[];;[20900];[20898, 20911, 20741];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24095_.mp3
Uthar declared that they were to be executed, themselves, but the students escaped and fled before the order could be carried out.;[];;[20901];[20899];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24096_.mp3
We are certain that they have not left Korriban. No doubt they have not gotten far and are simply in hiding... we just do not know where, exactly.;[];;[20902];[20900];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24097_.mp3
If you were to locate them and carry out Uthar's order, I am sure he would be most appreciative.;[];;[20743];[20901];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24098_.mp3
The rebel students I told you about must still be found and dealt with... Master Uthar would be greatly impressed by their deaths, I am sure.;[];;[20904, 20907, 20909];[20898, 20911, 20741];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24101_.mp3
I would suggest you talk to the other prospective Sith and find one that you can gain an advantage with.;[];;[20905];[20903, 20898, 20911, 20741];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24102_.mp3
I believe Lashowe would be an excellent choice. She is too trusting. I have little doubt you could talk her into letting you 'help' her somehow.;[];;[20906];[20904];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24103_.mp3
Just make sure that it is you who gains the advantage, not her. Be ruthless, if you must. That is the only thing that will impress Uthar.;[];;[20907];[20905];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24104_.mp3
The only other idea I can suggest to you is that you head into the Valley of the Dark Lords on the surface. There are ancient ruins there which can be explored.;[];;[20908];[20906, 20909, 20903, 20898, 20911, 20741];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24106_.mp3
It's possible you might find some artifacts or information in them which would please Uthar... it's difficult to say for certain.;[];;[20744, 20784, 20808, 20809, 20821, 20837, 20840, 20842, 20848, 20861];[20907];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24107_.mp3
I still think that approaching Lashowe would be your best move. She is too trusting and can no doubt be talked into aiding your cause.;[];;[20907];[20903, 20898, 20911, 20741];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24105_.mp3
No, I've heard enough.;[];;[20836];[20743];kor35_yuthuraban;
The Code of the Sith is the easiest way, to start. I have told you all that you need to know of it, already.;[];;[20899, 20903, 20904, 20907, 20909];[20741];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24094_.mp3
Forget it. I don't want to be a part of this.;[];;[20913];[20736, 20733, 20730, 20725, 20723];kor35_yuthuraban;
You are already a part of this. Don't be a fool.;[];;[20739];[20912];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24026_.mp3
You don't say? Well, the master loves tombs, don't you master?;[];;[20720];[20717];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24014_.mp3
Darth Malak went there? Very interesting... isn't it, master?;[];;[20720];[20717];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24015_.mp3
Do I have a choice?;[];;[20917];[20710];kor35_yuthuraban;
Not really. Oh, don't worry... what I have in mind will benefit us both, you can be sure of that.;[];;[20713];[20916];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24039_.mp3
But I don't even have any prestige, yet!;[];;[20919];[20710];kor35_yuthuraban;
'Yet' being the operative term. As I said, you have my utmost confidence.;[];;[20713];[20918];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24041_.mp3
What are you doing here? Go back to Uthar and tell him you're ready to take your final test! Our moment is at hand, go!;[{'Yuthura Ban': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[];[None];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24042_.mp3
Hmmm. You're a rather tricky human, aren't you? However did you manage to convince Kel Algwinn to reveal himself to you?;[];;[20922];[None];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24043_.mp3
No matter. I applaud you for the maneuver, at any rate. An act worthy of a Sith, surely.;[];;[20923, 20926, 20928];[20921];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24044_.mp3
I rather enjoyed it. He was a fool.;[];;[20924];[20922];kor35_yuthuraban;
Now that's what I like to see... the flash of ambition in a young human's eyes. Your species has such remarkable retinal coloring, did you know that?;[];;[20925];[20923];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24046_.mp3
You have other things to turn your attention to, however, I'm sure. What do you need?;[];;[20740, 20744, 20784, 20808, 20809, 20821, 20840, 20842, 20848, 20861];[20924, 20927, 20929];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24051_.mp3
He wouldn't have lasted. I just put him out of his misery.;[];;[20927];[20922];kor35_yuthuraban;
Yes, I... suppose so. The weak can surprise you sometimes with their strength, however. He could have surprised us.;[];;[20925];[20926];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24048_.mp3
I... suppose so.;[];;[20929];[20922];kor35_yuthuraban;
What's this? Regrets? Not to worry, dear pupil, it... gets easier with time.;[];;[20925];[20928];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24050_.mp3
I understand you managed to kill Lashowe. Well done! She was devious, but I knew her trust could be turned against her!;[];;[20931];[None];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24052_.mp3
One less opponent is an excellent result regardless of how it occurs, correct? Now, then... something you needed?;[];;[20740, 20744, 20784, 20808, 20809, 20821, 20837, 20840, 20842, 20848, 20861];[20930, 20932, 20933];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24055_.mp3

You've been doing well... I hear you've almost enough prestige to be declared the victor. Somehow I just knew you were the one who would succeed.;[];;[20740, 20744, 20784, 20808, 20809, 20821, 20837, 20840, 20842, 20848, 20861];[None];kor35_yuthuraban;NM35AAYUTH24056_.mp3

It was me. Why?;[];;[20943];[20941];kor33_bartender;
I do not mean to pry, <FullName>. But the Krayt dragon is a fierce and deadly beast, a monster even one of your power would be smart to avoid!;[];;[20944];[20942, 21011];kor33_bartender;
If something should happen to you - if you are injured or even slain by such a beast - then Malak will never be toppled!;[];;[20945, 21007, 21008];[20943, 21010];kor33_bartender;

But if you are going to continue with such reckless escapades, I would strongly recommend you stock up with weapons and armor from my inventory.;[];;[20948, 20950, 20970];[20946];kor33_bartender;
Let me see your premium items.;[];;[20949];[20947, 20969, 20973, 20961, 20998, 20994, 21002, 20990, 20986, 20984, 20980, 21004, 21014, 21017, 21021, 21035];kor33_bartender;
Yes, of course. I'm sure you'll find my selection to be very interesting.;[];;[];[20948];kor33_bartender;
I have some questions for you.;[];;[20951];[20947, 20969, 20973, 21014, 21017, 21021];kor33_bartender;
Of course. I will help you with whatever I can.;[];;[20952, 20970, 20978, 20981, 20985, 20991];[20950];kor33_bartender;
Do you know a lot about the Ebon Hawk and its previous owners?;[];;[20953];[20951, 20969, 20973, 20994, 21002, 20990, 20986, 20984, 20980, 21004, 20961, 21032, 21035];kor33_bartender;
I know very little about the owners of the Ebon Hawk. Most were affiliated with the Exchange, and they only revealed enough to enable us to do business with them.;[];;[20954];[20952];kor33_bartender;
But the ship itself is very well known, especially here on Korriban. Some say it is the finest smuggling vessel in this sector. Others say it is a cursed vessel, bringing doom to its owners.;[];;[20955, 21006];[20953];kor33_bartender;
Cursed? What do you mean?;[];;[20956];[20954];kor33_bartender;
None deny the Hawk is a fine vessel with a long history of successful smuggling runs to its credit. But the owners have not fared nearly as well the ship itself.;[];;[20957];[20955, 21006];kor33_bartender;
Take Davik Kang. He was the last owner I know of before you. His home world was the planet Taris - a world the Sith utterly destroyed. Few would call that a fortunate occurence.;[];;[20958];[20956];kor33_bartender;
And even if Taris hadn't been destroyed, would Davik still be around? It seems doubtful he *sold* the ship to you. And I know Davik didn't *buy* it from the previous owner.;[];;[20959, 21005];[20957];kor33_bartender;
These events have more to do with the type of owner than the Hawk itself.;[];;[20960];[20958];kor33_bartender;
Yes, I suppose a Sith Lord has little time for curses. You are probably far beyond such things. In any case, I meant no offense. I am only telling you what I know of the Hawk's reputation.;[];;[20961];[20959, 21005];kor33_bartender;
Is there anything else you are needing from me?;[];;[20948, 20952, 20962, 20978, 20981, 20985, 20991, 20999];[20960, 20982, 20989];kor33_bartender;
Ziagrom says you sell... special items.;[];;[20963];[20961, 20998, 20994, 21002, 20990, 20986, 20984, 21004, 21029, 21035];kor33_bartender;
Yes, to the right buyer. Traditionally, the owner of the Ebon Hawk has been the contact for all my transactons. But in the past, the owner was always affiliated with the Exchange.;[];;[20964];[20962];kor33_bartender;
That was why Ziagrom did not approach you earlier. We had no idea who you were, or if we wanted to do business with you. Of course that has all changed now, Lord Revan.;[];;[20965, 20967, 20974];[20963];kor33_bartender;
I'm glad you've seen the light.;[];;[20966];[20964];kor33_bartender;
The light? A fine jest, though it contains a crystal of truth. We have allied with you in this conflict, and we trust you will remember us once victory is yours, Revan.;[];;[20967, 20972, 20974];[20965];kor33_bartender;
What kinds of things do you have for sale?;[];;[20968];[20966, 20977, 20975, 20964];kor33_bartender;
Yes, let's get right to business. I carry only the rarest of items. Expensive, yes - but worth every credit! Weapons, armor, equipment: I carry a little of everything.;[];;[20969];[20967];kor33_bartender;
The previous owners of the Ebon Hawk would often resell the items they purchased, but in your case I imagine you might find more than a few of them quite useful against your old apprentice.;[];;[20948, 20950, 20952, 20970];[20968];kor33_bartender;
I'll be going now.;[];;[20971];[20969, 20973, 20951, 20947, 21014, 21017, 21021];kor33_bartender;
Of course. Remember to return whenever you desire to see my inventory of permium items. We are eager to help you against your old apprentice.;[];;[];[20970, 20999, 21033];kor33_bartender;
Your motives seem very self-serving.;[];;[20973];[20966, 20977];kor33_bartender;
Of course. How else are we to survive? Now, do you wish to see the premium items I have for sale? Or is there something else you need?;[];;[20948, 20950, 20952, 20970];[20972];kor33_bartender;
I'm not who you think I am. I'm not Revan anymore.;[];;[20975];[20966, 20964];kor33_bartender;
No? Ziagrom's information is never wrong. Are you saying that you don't want to revenge on your former apprentice? Are you saying you don't plan to kill Malak?;[];;[20967, 20976];[20974];kor33_bartender;
I will stop Malak and his Sith, but not for revenge.;[];;[20977];[20975];kor33_bartender;
In truth, your reasons matter little to me or my partner. But we do believe in your power. We believe you will bring Malak down - and we want to help you, in our own small fashion.;[];;[20967, 20972];[20976];kor33_bartender;
Anything interesting going on here?;[];;[20979, 21003];[20961, 20984, 20990, 20994, 20998, 21002, 20986, 20951, 21032];kor33_bartender;
Since Malak stole the Order from you, the Academy here on Korriban has become all but impossible to deal with. The Sith there care for nothing but their own plots and schemes.;[];;[20980];[20978];kor33_bartender;
I hope that once you destroy your old apprentice things will return to the way they were before. The Sith and the Exchange should work together: it could benefit both sides.;[];;[20948, 20952, 20981, 20985, 20991, 20999];[20979];kor33_bartender;
What do you know about the Sith academy?;[];;[20982, 20983];[20980, 20990, 20994, 20998, 21002, 20986, 21004, 20961, 20951, 21032];kor33_bartender;
Only what I have heard from others: Uthar Wynn is dead, by your hand. I am hoping this will bring about a change in how the Sith will deal with others here on Dreshdae.;[];;[20961];[20981];kor33_bartender;
The Sith built their academy here to train students. Many go to train there, though I know not why. Most are not permitted to train and many die in their attempt to be admitted.;[];;[20984];[20981];kor33_bartender;
Many of their students and sometimes the Sith, themselves, come to my cantina. Look around and you will see them. I have little choice as to their presence.;[];;[20948, 20952, 20962, 20978, 20985, 20991, 20995, 20999];[20983];kor33_bartender;
What can you tell me about the Sith's excavations?;[];;[20986];[20984, 20994, 20998, 21002, 20980, 21004, 20961, 20951, 21032];kor33_bartender;
Very little. None are allowed in their ruins other than the Sith themselves, as I understand it.;[];;[20948, 20952, 20962, 20978, 20981, 20987, 20991, 20995, 20999];[20985];kor33_bartender;
Surely there must be some way to go there.;[];;[20988, 20990];[20986];kor33_bartender;
The Sith do have a passage that leads to their valley from within the monastery. Only they may use it, however.;[];;[20989];[20987];kor33_bartender;
I doubt they would let you in, even if you could somehow convince them of your true identity. Most of the Sith at the Academy are loyal to Malak, now. They see him as the true Master.;[];;[20961];[20988];kor33_bartender;
I am afraid not. The Sith have a passage that leads to their valley from within their monastery, but only they may use it.;[];;[20948, 20952, 20962, 20978, 20981, 20991, 20995, 20999];[20987];kor33_bartender;
Do you know anything about a Star Map on Korriban?;[];;[20992];[20990, 20998, 20986, 20984, 20980, 21004, 20961, 20951, 21032];kor33_bartender;
Could you be more specific, sentient? What manner of Star Map do you seek?;[];;[20993, 21001];[20991];kor33_bartender;
The very old kind. Perhaps you know of some ruins on Korriban?;[];;[20994];[20992];kor33_bartender;
There is a place on the surface of this planet called the Valley of the Dark Lords, I believe, where the Sith dig amongst such ruins. Perhaps what you seek is there.;[];;[20948, 20952, 20962, 20978, 20981, 20985, 20995, 20999];[20993];kor33_bartender;

But I wouldn't put it past the Republic to try and arrange such circumstances to see her dead. The Sith are much more straight forward about their intentions.;[];;[21124];[21122];man26_seljud5;
Is that all?;[];;[21125, 21129, 21139];[21123, 21128];man26_seljud5;
Is there anything suspicious about this case?;[];;[21126];[21124, 21138, 21119];man26_seljud5;
I find it presumptuous to assume that the cripple Sunry could kill Elassa. I think that there must have been another there who killed her. Perhaps one of the 'witnesses'.;[];;[21127];[21125];man26_seljud5;
I do not know the reason for the medal clutched in Elassa's hand either, but it may have been that she fought them off even as she died.;[];;[21128];[21126];man26_seljud5;
I think this may be the work of some Republic conspiracy and I am not afraid to say so! If the only means I have of hurting the Republic is through Sunry, then so be it!;[];;[21124];[21127];man26_seljud5;
What do you think of the Republic and the Sith Empire?;[];;[21130];[21124, 21119];man26_seljud5;
I think the Republic is an institution in sore need of change. It has gone on too long and the Sith are the fresh wind of change blowing across the galaxy.;[];;[21131];[21129];man26_seljud5;
I do not believe in the false stories of the evils of the Sith Empire. They are nothing compared to the oppression and stagnation that the Republic represents at its core.;[];;[21132];[21130];man26_seljud5;
If I was given the power to decide, Manaan would join with the Sith, forcing the Republic to accept the new face of the future.;[];;[21133];[21131];man26_seljud5;
But sadly, it would appear that I am wiser and more farsighted than my immediate superiors. I am relegated to civil judicial matters.;[];;[21134];[21132];man26_seljud5;
I will judge this case. And I will find Sunry as guilty as he is charged to be.;[];;[21135, 21138, 21141];[21133];man26_seljud5;
So nice to meet an impartial judge, for a change.;[];;[21136];[21134];man26_seljud5;NM26AASELJ21028_.mp3
Impartiality is one thing. Blindness is another entirely.;[];;[21137];[21135];man26_seljud5;
You said it, not I.;[];;[21138];[21136];man26_seljud5;NM26AASELJ21032_.mp3
Are you finished?;[];;[21120, 21125, 21139];[21137, 21145, 21134];man26_seljud5;
I have no more questions for now.;[];;[21140];[21138, 21124, 21119];man26_seljud5;
Do not bring frivilous topics to discuss. I deal only with trial information.;[];;[];[21139];man26_seljud5;
Hey! I thought you Selkath judges were supposed to follow the law! You can't already have decided that Sunry is guilty!;[];;[21142, 21145];[21134];man26_seljud5;NM26AASELJ21034_.mp3
If you had listened, Carth, you would know that that *is* the law. Sunry is guilty until proven innocent.;[];;[21143];[21141];man26_seljud5;NM26AASELJ21036_.mp3
That's a stupid law for any civilized world to have.;[];;[21144];[21142];man26_seljud5;NM26AASELJ21038_.mp3
Angering the judge won't get us a more impartial decision, Carth.;[];;[21145];[21143];man26_seljud5;NM26AASELJ21040_.mp3
It is up to you off-worlders to prove the human's innocence. I simply doubt that you will be capable of doing so.;[];;[21138];[21144, 21141];man26_seljud5;

I am Kono Nolan, and this is Sami. We were scientists working here on the Hrakert Rift project.;[];;[21180, 21276, 21283, 21284, 21285];[21178];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303032_.mp3

Just... I am sorry for my actions. But... but what are you doing here?;[];;[21185, 21272, 21274];[21183];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303047_.mp3
I'm on a mission for the Jedi Council to find pieces of a Star Map.;[];;[21186];[21184];man28_sur3;
A Star Map? I don't know of anything about a Star Map down here.;[];;[21187];[21185, 21281, 21283];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303049_.mp3
But... there were some ruins that were excavated when we were digging the foundations for the last section of the kolto harvesting machine.;[];;[21188];[21186];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303050_.mp3
But we can't go anywhere near those now! Maybe... maybe that's why it all happened in the first place...;[];;[21189, 21270, 21271];[21187];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303051_.mp3
What happened?;[];;[21190];[21188, 21280];man28_sur3;
We don't know! Not for sure...;[];;[21191];[21189, 21270, 21282, 21284];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303060_.mp3
The work teams were outside in the Rift near the vent. Then there was this rumbling and my head felt like it was splitting open...;[];;[21192];[21190, 21271, 21273];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303061_.mp3
This... this monster rose up from the Rift...;[];;[21193];[21191];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303062_.mp3
It was a firaxa shark I think... bigger than any I'd ever seen before. Bigger than our submersibles.;[];;[21194];[21192];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303063_.mp3
It was like it was screaming inside my head...;[{'Sami': 'Horror'}];;[21195];[21193];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303064_.mp3
Then all the Selkath started screaming too... and they turned on us.;[];;[21196, 21267, 21268];[21194];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303065_.mp3
Turned on you?;[];;[21197];[21195];man28_sur3;
It was like they couldn't control themselves... like the sound that the monster was making in our heads drove them insane.;[];;[21198];[21196];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303067_.mp3
Well... maybe it was protecting the ruins by the Rift.;[];;[21199];[21197, 21267];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303069_.mp3
It could have been. It might have a lair in the Hrakert Rift near the kolto vent. Hm... that may explain a few things, too...;[];;[21200, 21260, 21265];[21198, 21269];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303070_.mp3
Like what?;[];;[21201];[21199];man28_sur3;
Like why it reacted so violently when our construction efforts got closer to the vent.;[];;[21202];[21200, 21264];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303072_.mp3
And also why it is so large. It must be feeding off the kolto. It would have to be ancient indeed for it to reach that size. But with kolto as a food source...;[];;[21203];[21201];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303073_.mp3
And all those other firaxan sharks! Those might be its offspring!;[];;[21204];[21202];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303074_.mp3
Which would be why they all swarmed when it called out to them... Children coming to protect their mother.;[];;[21205, 21254, 21257, 21259];[21203];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303075_.mp3
So what can I do about it?;[];;[21206];[21204, 21256];man28_sur3;
The firaxan sharks have always been a serious problem. We had some blasters and projectile cannons to defend against them, but they still got some of our workers from time to time.;[];;[21207];[21205];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303077_.mp3
We were working on a soluble chemical compound that would drive them away. Something that smelled or tasted repulsive to them, but we never got it working right.;[];;[21208];[21206];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303078_.mp3
Oh, I think not! Even flawed like it is, it should be ideal for this situation.;[{'Kono Nolan': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[21209];[21207];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303079_.mp3
No! It's not working right! You don't know what it will do!;[{'Sami': 'Talk_Pleading'}];;[21210, 21252, 21253];[21208];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303080_.mp3
What are you talking about?;[];;[21211];[21209];man28_sur3;
The repellant we made was supposed to drive firaxan sharks away, but we never got very far in its development.;[];;[21212];[21210, 21252, 21253];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303083_.mp3
The one we tested instead was violently toxic to them, rupturing their outer skin in seconds and preventing them from drawing oxygen from the water by clogging their intakes.;[];;[21213];[21211];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303084_.mp3
Which is exactly what we need in this situation! Something to kill that monster shark that destroyed our station!;[{'Kono Nolan': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[21214];[21212];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303085_.mp3
But we don't know how else the chemical reacts! We only tried it in a controlled environment. In the open ocean, who knows what it could do... it could even affect the kolto.;[{'Sami': 'Talk_Pleading'}];;[21215];[21213];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303086_.mp3
We know exactly what it will do: it will kill the shark. That's what we designed it to do.;[];;[21216, 21250];[21214];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303087_.mp3
How would I poison the shark?;[];;[21217];[21215];man28_sur3;
You can take this cannister of toxin. We were working on it just before the giant shark drove all the Selkath insane.;[];;[21218];[21216];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303089_.mp3
All you need to do is insert it into the main kolto harvester and have it vent it.;[];;[21219];[21217, 21251];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303092_.mp3
Get away as soon as you can. We don't know how much worse it will affect the giant firaxan shark.;[];;[21220, 21249];[21218];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303093_.mp3
OK. I'll vent the toxin into the Rift to kill the giant shark.;[];;[21221];[21219];man28_sur3;
Wait! Don't! We don't know what effect the toxin will have on the ocean environment around the Rift!;[{'Sami': 'Talk_Pleading'}];;[21222];[21220];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303095_.mp3
It could poison the water against all life. It could poison the kolto itself, even! There is another way...;[];;[21223];[21221];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303096_.mp3
Well, the monster seems to have been driven out by the machinery we installed at the edge of the Rift. We've seen it out there on the cameras bashing itself against the machines.;[];;[21224];[21222, 21249];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303098_.mp3
I think if you could destroy the machinery we installed, the shark would calm down and retreat back into its lair inside the Rift.;[];;[21225, 21247];[21223];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303099_.mp3
How would I do that?;[];;[21226];[21224];man28_sur3;
You can reprogram the harvesting machines to overpressure their self-oxidizing fuel, so that the fuel tank cannisters will rupture and the entire machine will destroy itself.;[];;[21227];[21225, 21248];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303101_.mp3
The Hydrolium gas we use is a gas at 1 to 3 million sangen, a liquid at about 4 million sangen, and a solid above that. When it's a liquid it's VERY explosive.;[];;[21228];[21226];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303102_.mp3
If you inject enough of the Hydrolium gas into the tank, the pressure will be so great that it will turn to liquid form and start a chain reaction inside the machine.;[];;[21229];[21227];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303103_.mp3
But we'll lose everything we've built here! All those years of work!;[{'Kono Nolan': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[21230];[21228];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303104_.mp3
It's better than whatever your chemical will do to the water!;[{'Sami': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[21231, 21238, 21243];[21229];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303105_.mp3
I will try to poison the shark.;[];;[21232];[21230];man28_sur3;
You know it's the right thing to do. It can't go wrong.;[];;[21233];[21231];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303107_.mp3
Just put the cannister into the machine and have it vent it into the Rift. The firaxan shark should die in no time.;[];;[21234];[21232];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303108_.mp3
No! You shouldn't do that! It could poison everything!;[{'Sami': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[21235];[21233];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303109_.mp3
Just reprogram the harvesting machine's computer to overpressure the fuel tanks. Once it's destroyed, the shark should just leave.;[{'Sami': 'Talk_Pleading'}];;[21236];[21234];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303110_.mp3
You know what you have to do.;[];;[21237];[21235, 21242];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303111_.mp3
I just hope you make the right choice.;[];;[];[21236];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303112_.mp3
I will try to destroy the harvesting machine.;[];;[21239];[21230];man28_sur3;
Good! Destroying the machinery will be better in the long run. We can't risk damaging the environment or the kolto.;[];;[21240];[21238];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303114_.mp3
You'll have to break into the computer on the harvesting machine and fiddle with the fuel injectors to get the tank pressure up to the point where the Hydrolium will liquidize.;[];;[21241];[21239];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303115_.mp3
Once the machinery is gone, the shark should leave.;[];;[21242];[21240];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303116_.mp3
That won't work and you know it! We have to vent the toxin from the harvesting machine. Once the shark is dead, we can get back to mining the kolto.;[{'Kono Nolan': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[21236];[21241];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303117_.mp3
I'll do what I want... and kill both of you as well!;[];;[21244];[21230];man28_sur3;
What? No!;[];;[21245, 21246];[21243];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303119_.mp3

Run, Kono! She's one of them!;[{'Kono Nolan': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[];[21244];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303121_.mp3
I am not so sure...;[];;[21248];[21224];man28_sur3;
I AM sure.;[{'Sami': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[21226];[21247];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303123_.mp3
What other choice do I have, though?;[];;[21223];[21219];man28_sur3;
What else could I do?;[];;[21251];[21215];man28_sur3;
You don't need to do anything else. We have a cannister of the toxin here right now. We were working on it before the giant firaxan drove all the Selkath insane.;[];;[21218];[21250];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303091_.mp3

I don't know. It must still be out there.;[];;[21256];[21254];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303126_.mp3

That would be suicide... It's out there still.;[];;[21256];[21257, 21259];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303129_.mp3
The Star Map I'm looking for is out there. I need to get past.;[];;[21258];[21204];man28_sur3;
How could you miss something that big living there?;[];;[21261];[21199];man28_sur3;
I don't know. It seems impossible, but...;[];;[21262];[21260];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303132_.mp3
Maybe what ever sort of power it used to drive the Selkath insane masked it from us somehow... or maybe it was lying dormant deeper in the Rift.;[];;[21263];[21261, 21266];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303135_.mp3
I think it might live there. Live there because of the kolto.;[];;[21264];[21262];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303136_.mp3
Hm... maybe. That would explain more...;[];;[21201];[21263];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303137_.mp3
And no one knew about this thing?;[];;[21266];[21199];man28_sur3;
We had no clue at all... until it came out.;[];;[21262];[21265];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303134_.mp3
What did the shark have to do with that?;[];;[21198];[21195];man28_sur3;
It was protecting something?;[];;[21269];[21195];man28_sur3;
It may... It may have been. Maybe it was protecting the ruins by the Rift.;[];;[21199];[21268];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303139_.mp3
Something happened in the ruins?;[];;[21190];[21188];man28_sur3;
What are you babbling about?;[];;[21191];[21188];man28_sur3;
The Republic wants me to find out what happened here.;[];;[21273];[21184];man28_sur3;
Well, we're not too clear ourselves just exactly what happened...;[];;[21191];[21272];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303056_.mp3
How about I ask the questions.;[];;[21275];[21184];man28_sur3;
Oh.... okay. What is it you want to know?;[];;[21276, 21283, 21284];[21274];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303058_.mp3
What was the Republic doing here?;[];;[21277];[21275, 21179];man28_sur3;
We had a secret agreement with moderates in the Selkath government. They knew that Manaan could not survive independently if the Sith were victorious.;[];;[21278];[21276];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303035_.mp3
Those thugs would wipe out the whole damn planet just to get at the kolto.;[];;[21279];[21277];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303036_.mp3
So the Republic approached them about making this secret installation to harvest more kolto where the Sith couldn't see us.;[];;[21280];[21278];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303037_.mp3
But that all went horribly, horribly wrong...;[];;[21189, 21281, 21282];[21279];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303038_.mp3
Did this have something to do with a Star Map?;[];;[21186];[21280];man28_sur3;
Did the Sith do something?;[];;[21190];[21280];man28_sur3;
Have you seen a Star Map?;[];;[21186];[21275, 21179];man28_sur3;
Why did the Selkath all go crazy?;[];;[21190];[21275, 21179];man28_sur3;
You tried to kill me!;[];;[21181];[21179];man28_sur3;
I suppose that explains a lot. You've been under a lot of strain, here.;[];;[21176];[21174];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303028_.mp3

Yes. I think they're here to help us.;[];;[21170];[21294];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303148_.mp3
We're not leaving this room. We're safe here, and there's plenty of food and water. If you manage to reach the kolto harvesting machinery you can put the poison cannister in it and trigger it to release it into the Rift.;[]; subsequent conversation;[21297];[None];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303149_.mp3

No offense, but we'd rather wait for them than go with you - even if we're stuck here a few more days. Just get back to the surface afterwards, and the Republic will take care of us.;[];;[];[21298];man28_sur3;NM28ACSUR303152_.mp3
Ah, greetings. You must be assisting Master Bolook in his investigation.;[]; first time;[21301];[None];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05000_.mp3
I am Handon Guld, perhaps you've heard of me?;[];;[21302, 21310, 21312];[21300];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05002_.mp3
No.;[];;[21303];[21301];dan14_handon;
Well, I presume you wish to hear my story then? I shall tell you, of course, but there is not much to it. I am sure that you'll agree that Rickard is quite obviously guilty of murder.;[];;[21304];[21302, 21311];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05004_.mp3
You see, I was out here running earlier today - yes, running, I do that a lot. Can't stand speeders, never use them. Keeps me in shape too, you know! Anyway, I was out running on the other side of that bridge there...;[];;[21305];[21303, 21313];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05006_.mp3
When all of a sudden I heard a shot coming from over here. I ran over and found this man Calder lying on the ground dead!;[];;[21306, 21309];[21304];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05008_.mp3
Did you see the killer?;[];;[21307];[21305];dan14_handon;
I saw Rickard come skulking out of the shadows of the rocks south of the river, and I knew something was wrong. I hit my emergency button and called the Enclave right away.;[];;[21308];[21306, 21309];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05010_.mp3
Well... there, that's my story. Now please hurry this up and arrest Rickard so I can get on with my day!;[];;[];[21307];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05030_.mp3
Go on.;[];;[21307];[21305];dan14_handon;
Should I have?;[];;[21311];[21301];dan14_handon;
Um... I guess, under the circumstances, no.;[];;[21303];[21310];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05036_.mp3
[Lie] Ah, yes of course, Mr. Guld.;[];;[21313];[21301];dan14_handon;
[Success] Really? *Ahem* Well, then, I assure you on my reputation I had nothing to do with the killing. I will help you with the case as best I can, though.;[];;[21304];[21312];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05039_.mp3
How can I be of further assistance?;[];;[21315, 21320, 21332, 21338, 21345, 21351, 21356, 21361, 21363];[None, 21319, 21327];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05041_.mp3
What do you know about the weapon found by the body?;[];;[21316];[21314];dan14_handon;
That blaster was stolen from my house last week! I never knew what happened to it.;[];;[21317];[21315];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05087_.mp3
I hardly have enough money to afford a single blaster, let alone another. I can't tell you how important it is to have a weapon on hand with all these ravenous kath hounds around.;[];;[21318];[21316];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05089_.mp3
Even an iriaz can take a man down if it gets in the mood. Every settler has a weapon. It's our most prized possession.;[];;[21319];[21317];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05091_.mp3
I would most appreciate it if I could have that back after you determine that Rickard is the killer.;[];;[21314];[21318];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05093_.mp3
You knew Calder better than you admit. You rented a speeder with him!;[];;[21321];[21314, 21341, 21355];dan14_handon;
But I... I realize this must seem like a motive to you, but I assure you it isn't. I dislike Calder, true. I would punch his face in, given the opportunity. But I would not kill him!;[];;[21322, 21330, 21331];[21320];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05080_.mp3
Punch his face in? Why?;[];;[21323];[21321];dan14_handon;
My wife was cheating on me with him. They slept in my own bed while I was in the next room!;[];;[21324];[21322, 21330, 21331];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05024_.mp3
But... as much as I may hate him for that, I could not kill him.;[];;[21325];[21323, 21337, 21336, 21335];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05026_.mp3
It may have been my own fault for driving my wife away. I must try not to take the law in my own hands.;[];;[21326];[21324];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05028_.mp3
I was just out running, trying to clear my head for the divorce proceedings, not stalking him to kill him. Running is not a crime.;[];;[21327, 21328];[21325];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05082_.mp3
I want to ask you something else.;[];;[21314];[21326, 21344, 21341, 21350, 21355, 21362, 21360, 21357];dan14_handon;
That's all for now.;[];;[21329];[21326, 21344, 21341, 21350, 21355, 21362, 21360, 21357];dan14_handon;
Of course, of course. Listen, if you need anything I shall be glad to assist.;[];;[];[21328, 21363];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05099_.mp3
You better come clean!;[];;[21323];[21321];dan14_handon;
I want the truth - now!;[];;[21323];[21321];dan14_handon;
You wanted to kill Calder for having an affair with your wife!;[];;[21333];[21314];dan14_handon;
Knock his block off, sure, but not kill him! Oh my... I hope you don't find that incriminating...;[];;[21334];[21332, 21342];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05016_.mp3
Normally I am not prone to outbursts like that, but Calder... Mr. Nettic, he was not a very nice person. Not a very nice person to me or my family.;[];;[21335];[21333];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05072_.mp3
I had had my suspicions for several weeks, but had no proof until two days ago. It seems Calder was seeing my wife. Right under my nose, no less!;[];;[21324, 21336];[21334];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05074_.mp3
Well, if you can't keep her, it's your own fault.;[];;[21324, 21337];[21335];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05076_.mp3
She may have had her reasons, Mandalorian!;[];;[21324];[21336];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05078_.mp3
Did you know the victim?;[];;[21339];[21314];dan14_handon;
I knew him a little bit, but I was not any sort of great friend to him or anything.;[];;[21340];[21338];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05061_.mp3
I never really associated with him that much. In truth, I didn't really want to. He had a... reputation. Very inconsiderate of family, I heard.;[];;[21341];[21339];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05063_.mp3
But merely having heard unkind things about someone wouldn't make me want to kill him!;[];;[21320, 21327, 21328, 21342, 21343];[21340];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05065_.mp3
Liar! You wanted to kill him for having an affair with your wife!;[];;[21333];[21341, 21355];dan14_handon;
No one says you killed him... yet.;[];;[21344];[21341, 21355];dan14_handon;
I'm sorry, I'm... I'm getting a bit agitated. Why must we remain here? Can't... Can't you see that Rickard must have shot him?;[];;[21327, 21328];[21343];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05067_.mp3
What did you see happen?;[];State 1;[21346];[21314];dan14_handon;
Actually, I didn't see anything. I was over across the bridge, I heard a shot and came over. I can tell you I was sure surprised to see Calder's body lying there!;[];;[21347];[21345];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05043_.mp3
I just got here when I saw Rickard coming out of the rocks, holding his blaster! I was terrified!;[];;[21348];[21346];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05045_.mp3
I had no idea what he was going to do so I hit my emergency button and called the Enclave.;[];;[21349];[21347];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05047_.mp3
Master Bolook came out here with his droid and started questioning us. I think he really doesn't understand what's going on.;[];;[21350];[21348];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05049_.mp3
I hope that you'll be able to make a more informed decision and get me out of here soon. I have things I have to do!;[];;[21327, 21328];[21349];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05051_.mp3
Why would someone want to kill him?;[];;[21352];[21314];dan14_handon;
Um... well, you see, Calder was involved in some pretty sordid business from time to time. More often than not, I've heard.;[];;[21353];[21351];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05018_.mp3
Disreputable business practices, even more disreputable clients. I've even heard he had dealings with... a Hutt! A Hutt here on Dantooine!;[];;[21354];[21352];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05020_.mp3
Now I bet you're wondering if I had any reasons to kill the man, but I tell you I hardly knew him! Saw him once or twice, yes, and I have heard some pretty unkind things about him, but...;[];;[21355];[21353];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05012_.mp3
Certainly nothing that would make me want to kill him!;[];;[21320, 21327, 21328, 21342, 21343];[21354];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05014_.mp3
Why were you out here?;[];;[21357];[21314];dan14_handon;
I was taking my daily constitutional. I just happened to be running by when I heard a shot. I ran over and found Calder's body lying there.;[];;[21327, 21328, 21358];[21356];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05054_.mp3
Do you often run around the plains?;[];;[21359];[21357];dan14_handon;
Yes, quite often. I generally prefer running to anything else. Can't stand speeders.;[];;[21360];[21358];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05056_.mp3
A healthy body will breed a healthy mind, as I always say! Ha ha!;[];;[21327, 21328, 21361];[21359];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05058_.mp3
You're holding your side. Are you injured?;[];;[21362];[21360, 21314];dan14_handon;
In... injured? No, of course not! Why would I have been? Fit as a bantha! Har har! Yes... I run. I don't know if I mentioned that.;[];;[21327, 21328];[21361];dan14_handon;NM14ACHAND05096_.mp3

And there I left them. To what purpose I neither know, nor care. Perhaps when the Sith learn I have betrayed their secret they will try to kill me. I would welcome the excitement.;[];;[21513, 21514, 21521, 21522];[21511, 21523, 21524, 21510];man26_irimerc;NM26AAIRIM06026_.mp3
Sounds like a recruiting drive to me. We used to use it on planets we had conquered. Get 'em while they're young and impressionable.;[];;[21514];[21512];man26_irimerc;NM26AAIRIM06063_.mp3
Is there more you would ask of me, human?;[];;[21501, 21515, 21517, 21519];[21513, 21521, 21522, 21512];man26_irimerc;NM26AAIRIM06027_.mp3
Do you know about the murder of Elassa?;[];;[21516];[21514, 21518, 21503, 21500];man26_irimerc;
On my world those too weak to defend themselves deserve to die. A murder is justified if you have the strength to kill your victim. Is there anything else you would know?;[];;[21501, 21504, 21517, 21519];[21515];man26_irimerc;NM26AAIRIM06032_.mp3
I am seeking an ancient Star Map or some alien ruins.;[];;[21518];[21516, 21514, 21503, 21500];man26_irimerc;
Manaan has no such things, unless the Selkath have them hidden away at the bottom of the ocean. Is there more you would know?;[];;[21501, 21504, 21515, 21519];[21517];man26_irimerc;NM26AAIRIM06034_.mp3
I'll be going now.;[];;[21520];[21518, 21516, 21514, 21539, 21526, 21503, 21543, 21498];man26_irimerc;
I am not surprised. There are few on this watery world who feel comfortable in my presence.;[];;[];[21519, 21540];man26_irimerc;NM26AAIRIM06042_.mp3
Sounds like the Sith are trying to win this planet by corrupting the Selkath youth. Much more subtle than their usual methods.;[];;[21514];[21512];man26_irimerc;NM26AAIRIM06064_.mp3
I bet they're twisting the minds of those Selkath youth, trying to trick them into joining the Sith!;[];;[21514];[21512];man26_irimerc;NM26AAIRIM06065_.mp3
So you brought these youths to the Sith. And then what did you do to them?;[];;[21512];[21510];man26_irimerc;NM26AAIRIM06061_.mp3
So you tricked these innocents into going to the Sith base. And then what did you do with them?;[];;[21512];[21510];man26_irimerc;NM26AAIRIM06062_.mp3
Maybe the Selkath would be interested in your activities?;[];;[21526];[21505, 21539];man26_irimerc;
I have no fear of the fish people or their laws. There is no evidence I have done anything wrong. You will not learn my business this way.;[];;[21506, 21519, 21527, 21535];[21525];man26_irimerc;NM26AAIRIM06011_.mp3
How many credits would it take to make your business my business?;[];hard persuasion;[21528];[21526, 21505];man26_irimerc;
This is the way of this water world, is it not? Pathetic creatures bargaining with credits for what they cannot seize through strength. My people are warriors, not snivelling merchants.;[];;[21529, 21539];[21527];man26_irimerc;NM26AAIRIM06013_.mp3
But perhaps this world has made me soft. I will play this role, distasteful as it is. For 500 credits, I will tell you what you wish to know.;[];;[21530, 21531, 21534, 21535];[21528];man26_irimerc;NM26AAIRIM06014_.mp3
Here are the credits. Tell me who hired you.;[];;[21510];[21529];man26_irimerc;
I don't have that much.;[];;[21532];[21529];man26_irimerc;
I humble myself to change information for mere credits, and you insult me with this game of offers and counter offers? On my home world such insult would result in death!;[];;[21533];[21531, 21534];man26_irimerc;NM26AAIRIM06017_.mp3
I tire of this conversation and I tire of your company, human. In fact, I tire of this entire weakling world - the air reeks of sea salt and the fawning cowardice of the fish people!;[];Leaves area, doesn't open up recruitment plot.;[];[21532, 21537];man26_irimerc;NM26AAIRIM06030_.mp3
Make it 200 and we have a deal.;[];;[21532];[21529];man26_irimerc;
[Persuade] Maybe I'll just gut you like a Selkath preparing an Orchana ray for lunch.;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];Easy persuasion;[21536, 21537];[21529, 21539, 21526, 21505];man26_irimerc;
[Success] You speak the blunt and brutal language of my people. We share the love of death and bloodshed. But we are a rare breed on this planet. Even the Sith here are as weak as the cowardly fish people.;[];Persuasion succeeds.;[21508];[21535];man26_irimerc;NM26AAIRIM06021_.mp3
[Failure] Your threats are mere words, nothing more. Here on Manaan such bloodshed is not permitted - as I have been told time and time again.;[];Persuasion fails.  Gets up and leaves area.;[21533, 21538];[21535];man26_irimerc;NM26AAIRIM06028_.mp3

I am of sterner stuff, human. I seek blood and death and my reward is the taste of my enemy's fear. Take your credits elsewhere... my price is too high for the likes of you.;[];Bump each persuasion up one category.;[21506, 21519, 21525, 21535];[21528];man26_irimerc;NM26AAIRIM06019_.mp3
On second thought, I don't really want to talk to you.;[];;[21520];[21500];man26_irimerc;
What do you have against the Echani and the Mandalorians?;[];;[21542];[21498, 21546];man26_irimerc;
They lack the resolve to do what needs to be done. The Echani believe in a non-existent warrior code of honor, and the Mandalorians prize credits above bloodshed.;[];;[21543];[21541];man26_irimerc;NM26AAIRIM06036_.mp3
But I am Iridorian. Honor comes from slaying your opponent, and the true reward of any job is the taste of your foe's dying blood on your tongue.;[];;[21499, 21519];[21542];man26_irimerc;NM26AAIRIM06037_.mp3
A mercenary who's not for hire. That's strange.;[];;[21545];[21498];man26_irimerc;
Why do you care? There are other mercenaries you can hire. Though I suggest you act quickly - the Republic seems to be in desperate need of mercenaries right now.;[];;[21546];[21544];man26_irimerc;NM26AAIRIM06039_.mp3
Though not so desperate they have asked for my help as of yet. They prefer the simpering, submissive type - like the Mandalorian and the Echani.;[];;[21499, 21501, 21541];[21545];man26_irimerc;NM26AAIRIM06040_.mp3

I see from your appearance that you are an off-worlder. Still, you are welcome here. I'll not have it said that Zelka Forn refused to help somebody just because they weren't a citizen of Taris.;[];;[21588];[None];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11053_.mp3
Do you require healing or medical supplies? I can treat almost any injury or ailment right here at the medical facility, except the rakghoul disease, of course.;[];;[21589, 21610, 21618, 21620, 21622, 21654];[21587];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11055_.mp3
Rakghoul disease? What's that?;[];;[21590];[21588, 21642];tar02_zelka021;
The terrible affliction has plagued Taris for many generations. It is spread by the rakghouls, horrible monsters that live in the Undercity below Taris' great skyscrapers.;[];;[21591];[21589, 21612];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11057_.mp3
Prolonged exposure to the Undercity breeds the disease and those infected will eventually mutate into rakghouls themselves, becoming mindless beasts that feed on the flesh of others.;[];;[21592, 21600, 21610, 21620, 21622];[21590];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11059_.mp3
Is there no cure?;[];;[21593];[21591];tar02_zelka021;
There is no antidote for the disease, though I heard the Republic scientists at the military base here on Taris were close to perfecting a cure. Then the Sith arrived.;[];;[21594];[21592];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11061_.mp3
They overran the military base and now they refuse to allow anyone access to the laboratories inside. The Sith are keeping all the serum for the patrols they send into the Undercity.;[];;[21595];[21593];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11063_.mp3
If I could just get my hands on a sample of that serum the rakghoul disease could be wiped from the face of Taris forever. But I don't see how that's going to happen.;[];;[21596, 21600, 21610, 21622, 21682];[21594];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11065_.mp3
Maybe I could find a way to get my hands on that serum for you.;[];;[21597];[21595];tar02_zelka021;
I don't see how anyone could get their hands on the serum. The military base is crawling with Sith guards. Breaking in there would be a suicide mission.;[];;[21598];[21596, 21683];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11067_.mp3
I suppose the Sith patrols in the Undercity might have a sample of the serum on them, if they hadn't already used it because of a rakghoul infection.;[];;[21599];[21597];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11069_.mp3
But I doubt a patrol would just hand the serum over. And nobody's stupid enough to attack one of the Sith patrols, even in the Undercity.;[];;[21600, 21610, 21620, 21622, 21679];[21598];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11071_.mp3

Can... can I see it? The serum, I mean? I need to see if there is enough for me to analyze it so I can start producing it in mass quantities.;[];;[21603, 21670];[21601];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11155_.mp3
Here you go.;[];;[21604];[21602];tar02_zelka021;

The people of Taris owe you a debt they can never repay. Please, take this small reward. It isn't much, but it's all I can afford: a few credits and two spare medpacs.;[];;[21606, 21657, 21659, 21662, 21669];[21604];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11162_.mp3
Keep your reward, Zelka. You need it more than I do.;[];;[21607];[21605, 21661];tar02_zelka021;
You truly have a noble and generous spirit, but you deserve something for your effort. Tell you what, I'll give you a discount whenever you shop at my store. It's the least I can do.;[];;[21608, 21609];[21606];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11164_.mp3

How do you feel about the Sith?;[];;[21614];[21611, 21636];tar02_zelka021;
I know enough to be scared of them. I've heard about the brutality of the Sith. I know what they do to the planets they conquer.;[];;[21615];[21613];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11087_.mp3
So far all they've done is ask me some general questions, but I'm afraid they might one day decide to shut this facility down simply out of evil spite.;[];;[21616];[21614];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11089_.mp3

Let me take a look at what you've got for sale.;[];;[21621];[21616, 21645, 21651, 21611, 21656, 21609, 21681, 21599, 21591, 21588, 21685, 21687, 21689, 21690];tar02_zelka021;
Of course. Just step over here and I'll show you what I have in stock. My prices are very reasonable, just what I need to keep this facility operating.;[];End dialog, enter store.;[];[21620];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11136_.mp3
I'll be going now.;[];;[21623];[21616, 21642, 21643, 21638, 21636, 21632, 21629, 21625, 21645, 21651, 21646, 21611, 21656, 21609, 21681, 21599, 21595, 21591, 21588, 21685, 21687, 21689, 21690];tar02_zelka021;
Goodbye and good health to you. If you ever need any medical aid or treatment, you know where to find me.;[];;[];[21622];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11139_.mp3
I just want some general information about Taris.;[];;[21625];[21611];tar02_zelka021;
I don't know much, but I'll tell you what I can. Do you want to know about Upper Taris? Or are you more interested in Lower Taris and the Undercity?;[];;[21617, 21622, 21626, 21630, 21637];[21624];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11093_.mp3
Tell me about Upper Taris.;[];;[21627];[21625, 21636, 21642, 21643, 21638, 21632];tar02_zelka021;
The people here in the Upper City generally like to think they're better than the rest of Taris, but we're no better than anyone else.;[];;[21628];[21626];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11095_.mp3
The people here can be selfish, greedy, arrogant and even prejudiced. That's why aliens need special permission to leave the Lower City.;[];;[21629];[21627];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11097_.mp3
Maybe if more people in the Upper City weren't so self-centered things wouldn't be so bad in the Lower City and the Undercity.;[];;[21617, 21622, 21630, 21637];[21628];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11099_.mp3
Tell me about the Lower City.;[];;[21631];[21629, 21642, 21643, 21638, 21625];tar02_zelka021;
The Lower City has been overrun by swoop gangs and thugs. If you're going to travel down there you better go armed.;[];;[21632];[21630];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11101_.mp3
If you don't get attacked by one of the swoop gangs, you'll probably end up beaten and robbed by one of Davik's thugs! Soon it will be as bad as the Undercity.;[];;[21617, 21622, 21626, 21633, 21637];[21631];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11103_.mp3
What do you know about Davik?;[];;[21634];[21632];tar02_zelka021;
"Davik is the resident crime lord of Taris. He deals in stolen goods, he trades in slaves and contraband, and it would take a month to list all the people he's made ""disappear"".";[];;[21635];[21633];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11105_.mp3
His slimy grasp even reaches here into Upper Taris. Most of the shops pay him protection money so he'll leave them alone. Yeah, the man's nothing but a thug!;[];;[21636];[21634];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11107_.mp3
I guess I'm lucky. Since my medical facility doesn't make any profits Davik doesn't bother me. But if you ask me he's no better than the Sith!;[];;[21613, 21617, 21622, 21626, 21637];[21635];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11109_.mp3
Tell me about the Undercity.;[];;[21638];[21636, 21632, 21629, 21625, 21645];tar02_zelka021;
The Undercity is a wasteland crawling with flesh eating mutants called rakghouls. I feel sorry for the Outcasts that are forced to live there.;[];;[21617, 21622, 21626, 21630, 21639];[21637];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11111_.mp3
Outcasts?;[];;[21640];[21638];tar02_zelka021;
Justice here on Taris is swift and harsh. There are only two punishments - execution, or banishment to the Undercity.;[];;[21641];[21639];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11113_.mp3
Anyone banished can never return on pain of death. Even their descendants are forced to live in the depths beneath our great cities.;[];;[21642, 21643];[21640];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11115_.mp3
Whenever I can I send supplies to the Undercity to help ease the misery of their lives, although there is nothing I can do to help those infected with the rakghoul disease.;[];;[21589, 21617, 21622, 21626, 21630];[21641];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11117_.mp3
Whenever I can I send supplies to the Undercity to help ease the misery of their lives - food, medpacs and serum to cure the rakghoul disease, mostly.;[];;[21617, 21622, 21626, 21630];[21641];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11118_.mp3
Do you know anything about the Republic escape pods that crashed in the Undercity?;[];;[21645, 21646];[21611];tar02_zelka021;
All I know is what I was told by the people who brought these Republic soldiers here for treatment. They found the wreckage of two escape pods down in the Undercity.;[];;[21617, 21620, 21622, 21637];[21644];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11121_.mp3
Republic escape pods? Uh... no... why would you ask me that? I don't know. Those pods crashed in the Undercity. I'm not involved in any way!;[];;[21617, 21622, 21647, 21652];[21644];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11122_.mp3
You seem awfully defensive about this.;[];;[21648];[21646];tar02_zelka021;
I'm not defensive! I just don't like being accused of knowing something about those Republic pods. This is as bad as an interrogation by the Sith!;[];;[21649, 21652];[21647];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11124_.mp3
[Persuade] Don't worry, I'm not with the Sith. I won't betray your secret if you tell me.;[];;[21650, 21651];[21648];tar02_zelka021;
[Success] Well, you don't look like you're with the Sith. I guess... I guess I can tell you my secret. Or rather, I can show you.;[];;[21556];[21649];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11126_.mp3
[Failure] The Sith were already here, asking these same questions. I'll tell you what I told them. I don't know anything about those pods. Now, is there something else you need?;[];;[21610, 21618, 21620, 21622];[21649, 21652];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11128_.mp3
[Persuade] If you know something, you better tell me - unless you'd rather talk to the Sith!;[];;[21651, 21653];[21648, 21646];tar02_zelka021;
[Success] There's no need to get the Sith involved! I guess... I guess I can tell you my secret. Or rather, I can show you.;[];;[];[21652];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11130_.mp3
Medical facility? Is this some kind of hospital?;[];;[21655];[21609, 21588];tar02_zelka021;
This is a hospital of sorts, though my resources are quite limited since the Sith quarantined the planet. I provide basic medical services to all citizens of and visitors to Taris.;[];;[21656];[21654, 21691];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11080_.mp3
I have extensive medical training, and even with the lack of resources I can treat most injuries or ailments right here at the center - except for the rakghoul disease, of course.;[];;[21610, 21612, 21620, 21622];[21655];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11082_.mp3
Thank you, Zelka. That would be fine.;[];;[21658];[21605, 21661];tar02_zelka021;
I appreciate everything you've done. There are many who would have sold the serum to the crime lord Davik for a much higher sum.;[];;[21609];[21657, 21660];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11170_.mp3
[Persuade] Are you sure you couldn't spare a little something extra?;[];;[21660, 21661];[21605];tar02_zelka021;
[Success] I suppose I could give you a discount here at my shop, in addition to the credits and medpacs. Other than that there is really nothing else I can offer.;[];;[21658];[21659, 21669];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11174_.mp3
[Failure] I'm sorry, but all my credits are spent trying to keep this medical facility operating. I can't spare anymore.;[];;[21606, 21657, 21662];[21659, 21669];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11176_.mp3
You better come up with something extra or I'll put a smoking blaster hole right between your eyes!;[];;[21663];[21661, 21605];tar02_zelka021;
You're threatening me? I... I don't want this to become violent. Look, here's an extra fifty credits. That's all I have, I swear!;[];;[21664, 21668];[21662];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11178_.mp3
You mention this to anyone and you're a dead man!;[];;[21665];[21663];tar02_zelka021;
I won't tell anyone. I promise. Now please, just leave me alone.;[];;[21666, 21667];[21664, 21668];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11180_.mp3
That was unworthy of you. Zelka has the serum, certainly, but only because of your extortion. Were the few extra credits truly worth it?;[];;[];[21665];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11182_.mp3
So you twisted a few extra credits out of him. Hope it was worth it.;[];;[];[21665];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11184_.mp3
Hand it over. And don't mention this to anyone!;[];;[21665];[21663];tar02_zelka021;
[Persuade] That's it? After all the trouble I went to?;[];;[21660, 21661];[21605];tar02_zelka021;
Hold on. What about my reward?;[];;[21671];[21602];tar02_zelka021;
I'm not a wealthy man. All I can offer is a handful of credits and a few extra medpacs.;[];;[21672, 21673];[21670];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11158_.mp3
Fine, take the serum.;[];;[21604];[21671, 21676];tar02_zelka021;
I think I should find another buyer who'll pay more.;[];;[21674];[21671];tar02_zelka021;
"The only other buyer would be the crime lord Davik; but he would charge exorbitant fees for the serum if he got his hands on it! Nobody would be able to afford a cure!";[];;[21675, 21676];[21673];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11188_.mp3
Consider giving the serum to this man... surely we do not have such a dire need for credits that you would prize them over mercy?;[];;[21676];[21674];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11190_.mp3
Please, if you have any compassion at all you'll give the serum to me and not to Davik. Don't let him get a monopoly on this cure.;[];;[21672, 21677];[21675, 21674];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11192_.mp3
Forget it - I'm going to see Davik.;[];;[21678];[21676];tar02_zelka021;
Then I guess there's nothing I can do to stop you. I only hope you'll change your mind later on.;[];;[];[21677];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11194_.mp3
Don't worry, Zelka - I'll get that serum for you!;[];;[21680];[21599];tar02_zelka021;
Please don't say that! If the Sith hear you they might think I'm suggesting you start attacking their patrols. They could shut me down!;[];;[21681];[21679];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11073_.mp3
I only mentioned the serum because you asked. I don't actually expect anyone to get me the serum. Now, is there anything else I can do for you?;[];;[21610, 21618, 21620, 21622];[21680];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11075_.mp3
I might be able to help you out... for a price.;[];;[21683];[21595];tar02_zelka021;
I couldn't afford to give you more than a few medpacs and a handful of credits. The medical center can barely afford to stay open as it is. But it hardly matters, anyway.;[];;[21597];[21682];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11077_.mp3
Welcome to my medical facility. Do you require healing or treatment? I can treat almost any ailment right here at the facility.;[];;[21685, 21686, 21688];[None];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11141_.mp3
I even have supplies of the rakghoul serum in my inventory, as I have already told you. So what do you need?;[];;[21610, 21618, 21620, 21622];[21684];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11143_.mp3
I even have a cure for the rakghoul disease now, thanks to you. With the sample you've brought me I've been able to extract hundreds of vials that will cure the horrible affliction.;[];;[21687];[21684];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11144_.mp3
Of course I sell them at a very reasonable price. Just enough to cover the cost of processing the sample.;[];;[21610, 21618, 21620, 21622];[21686];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11146_.mp3
I can even provide a cure for the rakghoul disease, though it is very expensive. Davik has a monopoly on the antidote, and he's selling the serum for a ridiculous fee.;[];;[21689];[21684];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11147_.mp3
Davik's doing everything he can to protect his monopoly. All the samples he provides are treated, making it impossible to analyze their composition and create my own stores of the serum.;[];;[21610, 21618, 21620, 21622];[21688];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11149_.mp3
Welcome back. Are you in need of healing or medical supplies? I can treat you right here at the center for almost any condition, except the rakghoul disease, of course.;[];;[21600, 21610, 21612, 21618, 21620, 21622, 21691];[None];tar02_zelka021;NM02ACZELK11150_.mp3

If the player wins the swoop race, she will still be there.;[21698];[None];tar11_zaerdra111;NM11AAZAER09000_.mp3
Calm down, Zaerdra. Nobody is going to try anything here in the middle of our own base. It would be a suicide mission.;[];;[21699];[21697];tar11_zaerdra111;NM11AAZAER09002_.mp3
You're too trusting, Gadon. Brejik and his Vulkars want you dead. Anyone we don't know is a potential threat, and it's my job to make sure you're safe!;[];;[21700];[21698];tar11_zaerdra111;NM11AAZAER09004_.mp3
Do you want us to start attacking strangers on sight, Zaerdra - like the Vulkars do? I will never let it come to that! Now step aside and let them pass.;[];;[21701];[21699];tar11_zaerdra111;NM11AAZAER09006_.mp3

I'm sorry Gadon can't be here to thank you in person, but he has retired to the safety of his private chambers. I'm afraid he's grieving over Brejik's death.;[];;[21705, 21711];[21703];tar11_zaerdra111;NM11AAZAER09022_.mp3
But Brejik betrayed him!;[];;[21706];[21704];tar11_zaerdra111;
Even so, I think Gadon hoped that somehow Brejik could be made to realize the error of his ways. Despite everything he had done, Gadon probably would have forgiven him.;[];;[21707, 21708];[21705];tar11_zaerdra111;NM11AAZAER09024_.mp3
Gadon always was too soft on Brejik. I just wish I'd been there when that scum got what was coming to him!;[];;[21708];[21706];tar11_zaerdra111;NM11AAZAER09026_.mp3
Brejik violated the customs and traditions of Taris. He dishonored himself by refusing to honor his wager. He got what he deserved - even Gadon has to realize that.;[];;[21709, 21710];[21707, 21706, 21711];tar11_zaerdra111;NM11AAZAER09028_.mp3
Gadon sounds like the kind of person who you'd want in charge down here. At least to me.;[];;[21710];[21708];tar11_zaerdra111;NM11AAZAER09030_.mp3
But he isn't out of danger yet. The survivng Vulkars will still want him dead. He's a prime target now - as are you. You better be careful out on the streets.;[];;[];[21709, 21708];tar11_zaerdra111;NM11AAZAER09032_.mp3
I hope Gadon doesn't blame me for Brejik's death.;[];;[21708];[21704];tar11_zaerdra111;
Gadon can't speak to you right now. Brejik's put a price on his head, so I ordered him to stay in his private chambers until we find the assassin.;[];;[21713, 21715, 21717];[None];tar11_zaerdra111;NM11AAZAER09010_.mp3

I'm glad I could help.;[];;[21733];[21731, 21728, 21725];dan13_zzshari_01;
Thank you. I won't trouble you any more, but... thank you.;[];;[];[21732];dan13_zzshari_01;NM13AAZZSH24009_.mp3
Yes, yes, I have to go.;[];;[21735];[21731, 21728, 21725];dan13_zzshari_01;
Er... all right then. But thank you again. I couldn't have made it here without you.;[];;[];[21734];dan13_zzshari_01;NM13AAZZSH24011_.mp3
Thank you again. We've got a chance now, and it's all because of you.;[];;[];[None];dan13_zzshari_01;NM13AAZZSH24012_.mp3
You've helped so much. It's good that I can tell my children that there are nice people in the galaxy.;[];;[];[None];dan13_zzshari_01;NM13AAZZSH24013_.mp3
I wish Ward could have come here with us. I miss him.;[];;[];[None];dan13_zzshari_01;NM13AAZZSH24014_.mp3
It's so different here, so alive. I can't remember seeing green on Tatooine;[];;[];[None];dan13_zzshari_01;NM13AAZZSH24015_.mp3
Ithorak is waiting for you inside the hangar. As you probably know, there are no security cameras there: the better to conduct our business away from prying eyes.;[];;[21741];[None];k_pman_vek;
However, before we go in I'll point out this rather large assault droid standing beside me. I and the droid will both accompany you in to see Ithorak, just to make sure there is no trouble.;[];;[21742, 21755, 21768];[21740];k_pman_vek;
My business with Ithorak is private.;[];;[21743];[21741];k_pman_vek;
Ithorak is an important man with access to the rich and powerful. He is not about to let himself become an easy target for a kidnapping or an assassination.;[];;[21744];[21742, 21768];k_pman_vek;
When you meet Ithorak, I and the droid will both be there. It is my job to protect my employer, and I intend to do that regardless of my personal feelings toward him.;[];;[21745, 21755];[21743];k_pman_vek;
Personal feelings? Do you mean you don't like Ithorak?;[];;[21746];[21744];k_pman_vek;
Ithorak can be as tempermental as his clients. Combine that with his arrogance and the way he treats his underlings and you can understand why I might soon consider seeking other employment.;[];;[21747];[21745];k_pman_vek;
But despite all Ithorak's faults, he does pay well. So I serve my employer faithfully, for now.;[];;[21748, 21753, 21755];[21746];k_pman_vek;
[Persuade] What if I gave you 500 credits *not* to protect him?;[];;[21749];[21747];k_pman_vek;
[Success] 500 credits to betray Ithorak? 500 credits to abandon the man who insults and belittles me on a daily basis? How could I refuse such a generous offer?;[];;[21750];[21748];k_pman_vek;
Ithorak never appreciated me while I was around, so let's see how he likes dealing with you alone! But before I go, one last warning, human.;[];;[21751];[21749, 21754];k_pman_vek;
Whatever your plan for Ithorak is, be careful. I've always suspected he was more than just a simple merchant. I've heard people who cross him are rarely heard from again.;[];;[21752];[21750];k_pman_vek;
I don't want to risk his vengeance, so I'm going to disappear for a long while. Just in case Ithorak gets the better of you in this, you understand. Goodbye, human... and good luck.;[];;[];[21751];k_pman_vek;
[Force Persuade] You should quit on him right now. Leave and find another job.;[{'Player': 'Persuade'}];;[21754];[21747];k_pman_vek;
[Success] You're... you're right. He's never treated me with the respect I deserve. Yelling at me, insulting me, belittling me. I don't know why I stayed with him as long as I did!;[];;[21750];[21753];k_pman_vek;
Okay, let's go in and see Ithorak.;[];;[21756];[21747, 21744, 21741];k_pman_vek;
Excellent. Follow me.;[];;[21757];[21755];k_pman_vek;
Greetings, human. I am Ithorak. Vek tells me you represent a wealthy buyer, and I am always interested in new clients. So tell me, who do you represent?;[];;[21758, 21765, 21767];[21756];k_pman_vek;
My buyer wishes to remain anonymous.;[];;[21759];[21757];k_pman_vek;
Oh? I don't like not knowing who I'm working for, but exceptions can sometimes be made.  Well, if you won't reveal your patron, at least tell me what pieces of art they're interested in.;[];;[21760, 21765];[21758];k_pman_vek;
Nothing specific. I'm just browsing on behalf of my patron.;[];;[21761];[21759];k_pman_vek;
"One does not ""browse"" the types of items I deal in! You may have fooled my moron of a security advisor, but you don't fool me! You're an assassin!";[];;[21762];[21760];k_pman_vek;
Vek, you idiot! What kind of security advisor are you? You lead this assassin right to me!;[{'Ithorak': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[21763];[21761, 21766, 21767];k_pman_vek;
I... I'm sorry, Ithorak. I just thought...;[];;[21764];[21762];k_pman_vek;
Shut up, Vek! Just do your job and kill them!;[];;[];[21763];k_pman_vek;
Uh... I represent the Organa family from Alderaan.;[];;[21766];[21759, 21757];k_pman_vek;
I happen to know the art acquisitions agent working on behalf of the Organa family quite well, and you are definitly not her! Vek may be a blind fool, but I know an assassin when I see one!;[];;[21762];[21765];k_pman_vek;
I'm just here to kill you, Ithorak!;[];;[21762];[21757];k_pman_vek;
You don't need to do that. I won't cause any trouble.;[];;[21743];[21741];k_pman_vek;
*hushed* You, Jedi! I hear you are investigating the Sunry murder trial, are you not? Hmm. This case is not at all that it appears to be. Many currents, might I say, flow beneath the surface.;[];;[21770, 21787, 21789];[None];man26_mman;NM26ACMMAN05000_.mp3
What do you mean?;[];;[21771];[21769];man26_mman;
This murder is much more complicated than it may first appear. Sunry and Elassa are proxies for their governments and both sides want the other to fail.;[];;[21772];[21770, 21788, 21790];man26_mman;NM26ACMMAN05002_.mp3
You can see the journey, heh, by the footprints. You understand, yes?;[];;[21773, 21785, 21786];[21771];man26_mman;NM26ACMMAN05004_.mp3
Um... I think so... kinda...;[];;[21774];[21772];man26_mman;
Hmm, dear dear. I'm saying they both had something to do with it! They've both kept their hands in this from the start!;[{'Mysterious Man': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[21775];[21773, 21785, 21786];man26_mman;NM26ACMMAN05006_.mp3
If you want to get to the bottom of this murder, you might seek information from both the Sith and the Republic, likely in their Embassies.;[];;[21776, 21780, 21783];[21774];man26_mman;NM26ACMMAN05008_.mp3
They'd just give it to me?;[];;[21777];[21775];man26_mman;
No, of course not! You think state secrets are for sale on the common market?;[];;[21778];[21776];man26_mman;NM26ACMMAN05010_.mp3
You would have to be, heh, devious to get what you want.;[];;[21779];[21777];man26_mman;NM26ACMMAN05012_.mp3
Heed my advice, Jedi, and you may yet find the truths in this murder.;[];;[];[21778, 21782, 21784];man26_mman;NM26ACMMAN05022_.mp3
Why should I believe you?;[];;[21781];[21775];man26_mman;
Because you have no one else to trust? Not Sunry, not the witnesses, and certainly not the judges!;[];;[21782];[21780];man26_mman;NM26ACMMAN05015_.mp3
And if you take my advice, what have you to lose?;[];;[21779];[21781];man26_mman;NM26ACMMAN05017_.mp3
I've heard enough of you!;[];;[21784];[21775];man26_mman;
And I've been seen speaking to you for far too long.;[];;[21779];[21783];man26_mman;NM26ACMMAN05020_.mp3
Huh?;[];;[21774];[21772];man26_mman;
You're talking crazy talk.;[];;[21774];[21772];man26_mman;
Why are you telling me this?;[];;[21788];[21769];man26_mman;
Let us just say that I am an interested party, and that I have, heh heh... concerns.;[];;[21771];[21787];man26_mman;NM26ACMMAN05027_.mp3
I don't have time for this!;[];;[21790];[21769];man26_mman;
Oh, but I think that you do!;[];;[21771];[21789];man26_mman;NM26ACMMAN05030_.mp3
Greetings, student.;[];;[21792, 21795, 21802, 21808];[None];kor35_adrenas;
I'm no student. I'm Darth Revan!;[];;[21793, 21813];[21791];kor35_adrenas;
I have heard you have gained much prestige, student. Why you would want to throw it away by making ridiculous claims is beyond me.;[];;[21794];[21792];kor35_adrenas;
The Sith aren't big on such jokes, human. You would do well to remember that. Now, if your sorry attempt at humor is over, is there anything else you need?;[];;[21795, 21802, 21808];[21793, 21813];kor35_adrenas;
Who are you?;[];;[21796];[21794, 21803, 21812, 21791];kor35_adrenas;
My name is Adrenas. I am the chamberlain of the academy... generally I look after maintenance and supply, here.;[];;[21797, 21800, 21802, 21804, 21808];[21795];kor35_adrenas;
Master Uthar gave me this datapad for you.;[];if the player has the datapad;[21798];[21796, 21801, 21807];kor35_adrenas;
He did? Allow me to see that for a moment...;[];;[21799];[21797];kor35_adrenas;
Ah, yes, I see. I will do as Master Uthar requests, of course. Thank you for bringing this to me.;[{'Adrenas': 'Bow'}];;[];[21798];kor35_adrenas;
So you aren't a Sith?;[];;[21801];[21796, 21807];kor35_adrenas;
No, not truly. I serve the Sith, but I do not study and train in the Force as you do.;[];;[21797, 21802, 21808];[21800];kor35_adrenas;
Can I ask you some questions?;[];;[21803, 21811];[21801, 21807, 21796, 21794, 21791];kor35_adrenas;
I am sure there is nothing I can help you with. I am only a servant to the academy.;[];;[21795, 21804, 21808];[21802];kor35_adrenas;
How come you don't speak Galactic Basic?;[];;[21805];[21803, 21812, 21796];kor35_adrenas;
Galactic Basic is the language of the Republic, but I come from a world beyond the edges of Republic space. There the Twi'lek language of interstellar trade and commerce is the most common dialect.;[];;[21806];[21804];kor35_adrenas;
I can speak your language, but my accent is still very pronounced. Some at the Academy would mock me for this, and I am not eager to become the subject of ridicule.;[];;[21807];[21805];kor35_adrenas;
There are many humans here who come from worlds beyond Republic space. We seem to be more sympathetic to the Sith cause. Some of them are even training at the Academy, unlike me.;[];;[21797, 21800, 21802, 21808];[21806];kor35_adrenas;
I have to go.;[];;[21809, 21810];[21807, 21803, 21812, 21801, 21796, 21794, 21791];kor35_adrenas;
May the Force serve you well.;[{'Adrenas': 'Bow'}];;[];[21808];kor35_adrenas;
If you wish. Good luck with your training.;[];;[];[21808];kor35_adrenas;
You are one of the hopefuls who look to gain prestige, yes? I am afraid there is little that I could help you with.;[];;[21812];[21802];kor35_adrenas;
I am sure you would prefer to speak to one of the students, here, or perhaps the trainers.;[];;[21795, 21804, 21808];[21811];kor35_adrenas;
Darth Revan? Remarkable, considering Lord Revan was killed. If this is a joke, student, it is one I do not understand at all.;[];;[21794];[21792];kor35_adrenas;
Bendak Starkiller's dead! I don't believe it! Bendak never loses... that was an amazing duel! Best duel I've ever seen!;[];;[21815, 21826, 21827];[None];tar02_duelorg021;NM02AEDUEL12000_.mp3
Glad you enjoyed it. Now where's my share of the purse?;[];;[21816];[21814];tar02_duelorg021;
You've done well, Stranger. I'm pleased. Very pleased. Here are your credits. Plus, I'll give you Bendak's blaster pistol as bonus as a sign of my appreciation.;[];;[21817, 21819];[21815, 21826, 21827];tar02_duelorg021;NM02AEDUEL12002_.mp3
Thank you Ajuur. That's very generous of you.;[];;[21818];[21816];tar02_duelorg021;
Everyone will be talking about you now, Stranger. They're all going to know you were the one who killed Bendak Starkiller. You're famous now.;[];;[];[21817, 21820, 21822];tar02_duelorg021;NM02AEDUEL12004_.mp3
[Persuade] I think I deserve a little extra for putting my life on the line.;[];;[21820, 21821];[21816];tar02_duelorg021;
[Success] Very well, Stranger. I like you, and this was a special fight. Biggest purse I've ever handled! I'll give you a little bonus this one time only.;[];;[21818];[21819];tar02_duelorg021;
[Failure] I always pay my debts, but if you get more then all the duelists will want more. We had a deal - ten percent. I expect you to honor it.;[];;[21822, 21823];[21819];tar02_duelorg021;
Okay, I'll take the ten percent.;[];;[21818];[21821];tar02_duelorg021;
Pay up, you overgrown slug, or I'll tell people you went back on our deal! Your reputation will be ruined!;[];;[21824];[21821];tar02_duelorg021;
You'd lie about me? Maybe it would have been better if Bendak had killed you in that ring. But you're still alive, and I can't afford to have a new legend disparaging my reputation.;[];;[21825];[21823];tar02_duelorg021;
"Okay, you win. Here's another 200 credits... more than fair. Now don't be accusing me of not paying my fighters; I've got a reputation to protect!";[];;[];[21824];tar02_duelorg021;
I know, I know - I'm a living legend. Now, what about my cut?;[];;[21816];[21814];tar02_duelorg021;
Cut the flattery - just get to my credits.;[];;[21816];[21814];tar02_duelorg021;
I've heard the news, Mysterious Stranger. You and Bendak are planning a death match. This is excellent news... people will bet a fortune on this fight!;[];;[21829, 21841];[None];tar02_duelorg021;NM02AEDUEL12014_.mp3
Not too many people want to fight a death match anymore. Some are scared, others think it's wrong to kill someone else for credits. I guess that's why they're illegal now.;[];;[21830, 21840];[21828];tar02_duelorg021;
Maybe it is wrong to take a life just for credits.;[];;[21831];[21829];tar02_duelorg021;
What? What are you talking about? No, no, no. I was just making idle chatter, it doesn't mean anything! Bendak is an evil, evil man. Killing him would be a good thing.;[];;[21832, 21838];[21830];tar02_duelorg021;
You're right - let's do this!;[];;[21833];[21831];tar02_duelorg021;
This fight is different than most, of course. We'll turn off the energy suppressor, so weapons won't be limited - they can kill. Anything goes. So, you ready to fight this match now?;[];;[21834, 21836];[21832, 21840];tar02_duelorg021;
I'm ready!;[];;[21835];[21833];tar02_duelorg021;
Good. Excellent. High wagering means lots of credits for the winner on this match. Come see me after the fight to collect your credits - if you're still alive.;[];;[];[21834];tar02_duelorg021;
I'm not ready yet.;[];;[21837];[21833];tar02_duelorg021;
You're not ready? What are you waiting for? Are you scared? Look, don't worry about it. I'll wait. You just come back when you're ready to fight.;[];;[];[21836];tar02_duelorg021;
Sounds like your just trying to rationalize this. I need to think this over.;[];;[21839];[21831];tar02_duelorg021;
Why don't you think this over? Think about all those credits you'll get if you kill Bendak. Then come back and talk to me. I'm confident you'll want to step into the ring.;[];;[];[21838];tar02_duelorg021;
Let's get on with the match!;[];;[21833];[21829];tar02_duelorg021;
But why are you here now? A death match takes time to get ready. I have to bribe officials so they don't break it up. You might as well leave the cantina for now and come back later.;[];;[];[21828];tar02_duelorg021;
Congratulations, Mysterious Stranger. You're the new duel champion. Twitch had a good run, but you took him down! Here's the purse for beating Twitch.;[];;[21843];[None];tar02_duelorg021;
The bad news is that I don't have anyone left who wants to fight you - you're too good for your own good. Nobody wants to go in the ring with you.;[];;[21844, 21845];[21842];tar02_duelorg021;
The only one who'd fight you was Bendak Starkiller, but you killed him. Now I'll never find anyone to fight you. I'm sorry to say, but your dueling career is over, Stranger.;[];;[];[21843, 21846];tar02_duelorg021;NM02AEDUEL12030_.mp3
The only one left who'll fight you is Bendak Starkiller, but he's retired. Too bad. People would pay a fortune to see you fight Bendak.;[];;[];[21843, 21846];tar02_duelorg021;NM02AEDUEL12031_.mp3
Mysterious Stranger - why are you here? I don't have anyone who wants to fight you - you're too good for your own good. Nobody wants to go in the ring with you.;[];;[21844, 21845];[None];tar02_duelorg021;
Good fight, good fight. People like you, Mysterious Stranger. They bet a lot when you fight. It makes me happy... and rich.;[];;[21848, 21853];[None];tar02_duelorg021;
Too bad you lost, though. I don't pay you for losing. But I'll give you a rematch if you want one. What do you say?;[];;[21849, 21851];[21847];tar02_duelorg021;
Give me a rematch.;[];;[21850];[21848];tar02_duelorg021;
Yes - rematch! People always bet lots on a rematch! And who knows, Stranger... maybe you'll even win this time.;[];;[];[21849];tar02_duelorg021;
No - not right now.;[];start cut scene strip player of all equipment store equipment in lock box give them stun blaster move PC to duel ring move appropriate opponent to duel ring start duel announcer conversation end of duel announcer ends cutscene fight begins;[21852];[21848];tar02_duelorg021;
I hope you're not giving up, Stranger. You lost this time, but maybe next time you'll win. You come speak to me if you ever want a rematch.;[];;[];[21851];tar02_duelorg021;
I always pay my debts. You won, so you get paid. Ten percent of the purse - that was the deal. Here's your credits. You come see me when you're ready to fight again.;[];;[];[21847];tar02_duelorg021;
I'm sorry, human - the betting window's closed. No more fights right now. People are sick of seeing the same duelists all the time. It's bad for business. Unless...;[];;[21855];[None];tar02_duelorg021;
My name is Ajuur. I organize all the duels here. We need a new face in the dueling game, human. Maybe you want step into the duel ring? It can be a highly profitable venture.;[];;[21856, 21891, 21893, 21894];[21854];tar02_duelorg021;NM02AEDUEL12040_.mp3
What are you talking about?;[];;[21857];[21855, 21895, 21903];tar02_duelorg021;
I can arrange for you to fight in the duel ring. If you win, you get the standard contract: 10% of all wagers. And don't worry, nobody dies in the duel ring anymore. Death matches are illegal now.;[];;[21858];[21856, 21893];tar02_duelorg021;
Most fighters in the duel ring use vibroblades or stun sticks because the ring's pretty small, but a few of the duelists use blasters. Use whichever you prefer.;[];;[21859, 21860];[21857];tar02_duelorg021;
Vibroblades and blasters? And nobody ever dies? How come I get the feeling you're trying to take us for a ride?;[];;[21860];[21858];tar02_duelorg021;NM02AEDUEL12121_.mp3
The duel ring has energy suppressor fields to make sure nobody dies. Weapons are limited so they hurt, but don't kill. And we've got a medic droid in case of serious injuries. Are you interested?;[];;[21861, 21888, 21891];[21859, 21858];tar02_duelorg021;
Okay, I'll do it.;[];;[21862];[21860, 21890];tar02_duelorg021;
Good - new blood for the ring! But you need a nickname, like Ice or Deadeye or Twitch. Good nicknames make people bet more. Hmmm... what's a good name for you?;[];;[21863];[21861];tar02_duelorg021;
You're an off-worlder. You're new here, people won't recognize you... I know! From now on in the duel ring you'll be the Mysterious Stranger!;[];;[21864, 21885, 21887];[21862];tar02_duelorg021;
The Mysterious Stranger. I like it.;[];;[21865];[21863];tar02_duelorg021;
The Mysterious Stranger is a perfect name for you. You've got no past, no history... it makes you seem like you have some big, dark secret. People like that. Makes them bet more.;[];;[21866, 21867];[21864, 21886];tar02_duelorg021;
This is for the best. We could use the credits from these duels, but using your real name is too risky. The Sith might have come across a crew manifest back on the Endar Spire.;[];;[21867];[21865];tar02_duelorg021;NM02AEDUEL12122_.mp3
You ready for a duel now? You want step into the ring right away? I'll set you up with Deadeye Duncan to start. I'll tell you the rules if you're ready.;[];;[21868, 21879, 21881, 21883];[21866, 21865];tar02_duelorg021;
I'm ready for a duel.;[];;[21869, 21873, 21875, 21876, 21877, 21878];[21867, 21880, 21882, 21898];tar02_duelorg021;
You lost last time, but maybe this time fortune will smile on you. I'll give you a you rematch and a chance to redeem yourself.;[];;[21870, 21871];[21868];tar02_duelorg021;
Let's do it.;[];;[];[21869, 21874, 21875, 21876, 21877, 21878];tar02_duelorg021;
I've changed my mind.;[];;[21872];[21869, 21874, 21875, 21876, 21877, 21878];tar02_duelorg021;
You say you're ready, then you change your mind? Is this a joke to you? I don't have time for jokes - they don't make me any money! Come back when you'r ready to fight.;[];;[];[21871];tar02_duelorg021;
Yes! You fight and people bet and I make money! It's all good. Only one rule - nobody dies. Your opponent goes down, you don't finish them off. Death matches are illegal now.;[];;[21874];[21868];tar02_duelorg021;
You new at this, so I'll start you off easy. You get to fight Deadeye Duncan. Are you ready to go into the ring now?;[];;[21870, 21871];[21873];tar02_duelorg021;
You handled Duncan pretty well. I think you're ready to fight Gerlon Two-Fingers. Just remember - Gerlon uses blasters in the ring sometimes. You ready to step into the arena?;[];;[21870, 21871];[21868];tar02_duelorg021;
I think you're ready to go against Ice, human. She's tough, but so are you. There'll be lots action on this fight... a huge purse! You ready?;[];;[21870, 21871];[21868];tar02_duelorg021;
You've got a real talent for this game, Stranger. I think it's time you fought Marl. He's getting up there in years, but he's still very, very good. He used to be the duel champion.;[];;[21870, 21871];[21868];tar02_duelorg021;
You've beaten almost everyone, human. I think you ready to fight Twitch. Twitch might be crazy, but he's the best in the game. If you can beat him, you'll be the new champion.;[];;[21870, 21871];[21868];tar02_duelorg021;
I'm not ready for the match yet.;[];;[21880];[21867, 21882, 21898];tar02_duelorg021;
Not ready? You look ready to me! Why are you here if you don't want to fight? You don't get paid if you don't fight! Come on... are you sure you don't want to step into the ring?;[];;[21868, 21881, 21883];[21879];tar02_duelorg021;
I want to ask you some questions.;[];;[21882];[21880, 21867, 21898];tar02_duelorg021;
Questions? Bah - I don't have time for questions. They don't make me any credits! I want you to fight, not to ask questions. So, are you ready to step into the ring?;[];;[21868, 21879, 21883];[21881];tar02_duelorg021;
Goodbye.;[];;[21884];[21882, 21880, 21867, 21898];tar02_duelorg021;
I have big plans for you next match, tiny human. You come back when you want to fight.;[];;[];[21883];tar02_duelorg021;
That's a terrible name!;[];;[21886];[21863];tar02_duelorg021;
Bah - what do you know about nicknames? I've been giving names for twenty years! Mysterious Stranger - that's your name now.;[];;[21865];[21885, 21887];tar02_duelorg021;
My name is <FullName>. I think that sounds better than a nickname.;[];;[21886];[21863];tar02_duelorg021;
[Persuade] I'll do it, but I want more than ten percent.;[];;[21889];[21860];tar02_duelorg021;
[Failure] Ha-ha-ha! You're joking, right? If I pay you more, then everyone wants more.;[];;[21890];[21888];tar02_duelorg021;
No, you get the same as all the others - ten percent. That's my final offer.;[];;[21861, 21891];[21889];tar02_duelorg021;
Sorry, I'm not interested.;[];;[21892];[21890, 21860, 21895, 21855, 21903];tar02_duelorg021;
Don't pass this opportunity up, human. You fight for me and I'll make you rich. If you change your mind you come back and talk to me again.;[];;[];[21891];tar02_duelorg021;
I might be interested - what's in this for me?;[];;[21857];[21855, 21895, 21903];tar02_duelorg021;
I just want to ask you some questions.;[];;[21895];[21855, 21903];tar02_duelorg021;
Questions? Bah - questions don't make me money! But if you want to fight, it would could be very profitable for both of us. You interested?;[];;[21856, 21891, 21893];[21894];tar02_duelorg021;
Ah, Mysterious Stranger... I knew you'd be back. They all come back.;[];;[21897, 21899, 21900, 21901, 21902];[None];tar02_duelorg021;
You fought well last time. People like you, Stranger. They bet lots on your last fight. They'll be more on your next fight. You get ten percent, same as always.;[];;[21898];[21896];tar02_duelorg021;
You want to step into the ring now? Are you ready to prove yourself against the best duelists on Taris?;[];;[21868, 21879, 21881, 21883];[21897, 21899, 21900, 21901, 21902];tar02_duelorg021;
"You want to set up another fight, right? The ring is in your blood now, like a virus. You need to hear the cheers of the crowd; you need the rush of battle... you need to fight again.";[];;[21898];[21896];tar02_duelorg021;
"My latest find; my new rising star. We make good team. I'm making money, you're getting famous... it's all good.";[];;[21898];[21896];tar02_duelorg021;
You're getting quite the reputation, Stranger. Everyone's excited, they all want to bet on your next match. I'm excited, too... more bets means more credits for me!;[];;[21898];[21896];tar02_duelorg021;
You've come for a duel, right? I can set up a match and we'll make some money, yes? You get ten percent of the purse if you win.;[];;[21898];[21896];tar02_duelorg021;
You're back, human. Does this mean you want to step into the duel ring? It could be very profitable for both of us. Ask around - everyone knows Ajuur treats his fighters well.;[];;[21856, 21891, 21893, 21894];[None];tar02_duelorg021;
Greetings once again. I trust you have been discrete concerning the events at the Hrakert Rift.;[]; subsequent after hrakert rift plot;[21905];[None];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07055_.mp3
Should the Selkath obtain proof of what occured down there the consequences for the Republic would be severe. For both our sakes, I hope you are smart enough to keep silent on this matter.;[];;[21906];[21904];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07056_.mp3
Truth be told, I am uncomfortable even with us being seen together. The rumors are already plentiful enough among the Selkath about the Republic's role in this.;[];;[21907, 21969, 21971, 21977, 21985];[21905];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07057_.mp3
I have some questions about Ahto city.;[];;[21908];[21906, 21915, 21976, 21980, 21987, 22066];man26_repdip;
A beautiful place, Ahto city - a paradise on the water. But remember, within the city itself the Selkath have absolute authority. They are a tough race, but fair.;[];;[21909];[21907];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07007_.mp3
Obey the Selkath laws, keep the peace and you should encounter no problems. I assume you received a visitor guide to the city when you docked your ship.;[];;[21910];[21908];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07008_.mp3
I regret there is little I can tell you that is not in the visitor guide, my good Jedi. My duties rarely permit me to venture beyond the walls of the Republic Embassy.;[];;[21911, 21916, 21969, 21971, 21977];[21909];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07009_.mp3
Why are your soldiers loading so much kolto?;[];;[21912];[21910, 21976, 21980, 22066];man26_repdip;
Kolto is a precious resource - it's healing powers are near miraculous. During times of war, kolto becomes even more valuable.;[];;[21913];[21911];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07002_.mp3
As long as we have the permits, we will continue to harvest kolto and ship it to our Republic soldiers battling against the Sith. Of course, the Sith enjoy the very same privileges.;[];;[21914];[21912];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07003_.mp3
If there was some way we could gain an edge over the Sith in our kolto supply...;[];;[21915];[21913];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07004_.mp3
But the Selkath are fiercely protective of their neutrality in this conflict. They do not want to grant either side an advantage.;[];;[21907, 21916, 21969, 21971, 21977];[21914];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07005_.mp3
I am on a mission from the Jedi Council, perhaps you can help me with it.;[];;[21917];[21915, 21976, 21980, 21910, 22066];man26_repdip;
Uh... of course, of course. I will do whatever I can. But I am only a simple diplomatic representative of the Republic. I doubt I can be of any use to the Jedi Council.;[];;[21918, 21969];[21916];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07011_.mp3
I seek a Star Map, the remnant of an ancient and forgotten race.;[];;[21919];[21917];man26_repdip;
An ancient and forgotten race... and you think it may be here on Manaan? Hm...;[];;[21920];[21918];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07013_.mp3
You know something?;[];;[21921];[21919];man26_repdip;
Well... perhaps. But if you want to get information about that, you'll have to do something for me first.;[];;[21922, 21964, 21966, 21969];[21920];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07015_.mp3
What do you want me to do?;[];;[21923];[21921, 21926, 21963, 21965, 21968];man26_repdip;
We were using a submersible reconnaissance droid in the ocean surrounding Ahto City and it was... damaged. It took a data recording of the outside of the city before being driven off by the firaxan sharks.;[];;[21924];[21922];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07017_.mp3
But while it was returning to the surface it encountered difficulties and was disabled. Its automatic systems floated it to the surface, but we could not retrieve it in time.;[];;[21925];[21923];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07018_.mp3
The Sith were applying subtle pressure to the Selkath authorities for some reason we have not determined, and were able to delay us long enough that they could retrieve the droid before we did.;[];;[21926];[21924];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07019_.mp3
The droid's data centers are heavily encrypted, so it will take the Sith several days, we believe, to get to its data. It was captured 12 hours ago. It is imperative that we get it back!;[];;[21922, 21927, 21960, 21962];[21925];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07020_.mp3
Where is the droid?;[];;[21928];[21926, 21963];man26_repdip;
It is heavily guarded, we are sure, in the Sith Embassy here on Manaan. Since we have no remaining soldiers to spare, and certainly not our elite ones, we have no one capable of entering the Sith base and retrieving it.;[];;[21929];[21927, 21961];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07022_.mp3
That is what we would ask you to do.;[];;[21930, 21956, 21959];[21928];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07023_.mp3
How do I get in the Sith base?;[];;[21931];[21929];man26_repdip;
There are several leads we have been working on to get into the Sith base. Any of them should work for you, although it might be wise to concentrate your efforts on just one.;[];;[21932];[21930, 22020];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07067_.mp3
The first method that's possible is to help us interrogate a Sith prisoner we managed to catch after he tried to infiltrate our base. He is being held just inside our enclave.;[];;[21933];[21931];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07068_.mp3
We think he may be able to give us the passcode that the Sith give their informers to enter the base.;[];;[21934];[21932];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07069_.mp3
He has proved most resilient so far...;[];;[21935, 21955];[21933];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07070_.mp3
Interrogating the prisoner sounds good.;[];;[21936];[21934];man26_repdip;
Good. It's a logical place to start. But you should also hear about the other options available to you.;[];;[21937];[21935];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07072_.mp3
We managed to pick up a crate of blank Sith data cards the type they use for passcards.;[];;[21938];[21936];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07074_.mp3
The encryption system to unlock them is very difficult however, but if you are more skilled than our technicians, you may be able to gain access that way.;[];;[21939, 21955];[21937];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07075_.mp3
Decrypting the passcard sounds good.;[];;[21940];[21938];man26_repdip;
Good. It is a very intelligent and skilled individual who can crack the matrices of a Sith encryption system.;[];;[21941];[21939];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07077_.mp3
But there is one last method you should know about in case all other options fail.;[];;[21942];[21940];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07078_.mp3
The Sith have got the Selkath to give them exclusive use of one of the main hangar bays.;[];;[21943];[21941, 21955];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07080_.mp3
Visiting Sith masters use this bay to land, then take a speeder over the water to an external entrance to the Sith enclave.;[];;[21944];[21942];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07081_.mp3
The luckless spy we mentioned earlier had a passcard to that hangar on him. While it is surely well guarded, it may prove to be the most direct route. Here is the card.;[];;[21945];[21943];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07082_.mp3
The Sith base itself is very heavily guarded. If they became aware of your presence, I fear you would be quickly outnumbered and killed.;[];;[21946];[21944];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07083_.mp3
Here is a passcard to get you inside our facility. You should find all you need to get started in there.;[];;[21947];[21945];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07084_.mp3
You can choose whichever of the methods you want as long as you get in the base and get the data recording back. Which method do you think you would like to try first?;[];;[21948, 21951, 21953];[21946];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07085_.mp3
I think I'll interrogate the prisoner.;[];;[21949];[21947];man26_repdip;
Good call, just make sure you don't push him too hard or we might lose him.;[];;[21950];[21948];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07087_.mp3
I wish you luck in your task. Should you retrieve the data recording from the droid, return it here to me and we can see about getting you that information.;[];;[];[21949, 21952, 21954];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07088_.mp3
I think I'll decrypt the passcard.;[];;[21952];[21947];man26_repdip;
Good choice. We've been working at that for a while, but it's been too difficult so far. Maybe you'll have better luck.;[];;[21950];[21951];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07090_.mp3
I think I'll raid the landing bay.;[];;[21954];[21947];man26_repdip;
You'll need luck for that one - odds are they have some pretty strong guards in there. But it's also the way most likely to succeed.;[];;[21950];[21953];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07092_.mp3
Is there another way?;[];;[21942];[21938, 21934];man26_repdip;
Can I get back to you on this?;[];;[21957];[21929];man26_repdip;
If you want to find information about ancient ruins or your 'Star Map' or whatever it is, I think this is your best choice.;[];;[21958];[21956, 21959];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07027_.mp3
But you will have time to consider your options. And when you come to the only conclusion possible, I will be here to tell you how we can work together.;[];;[];[21957];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07028_.mp3
I do not want to get involved.;[];;[21957];[21929];man26_repdip;
I'm not your errand runner!;[];;[21961];[21926, 21963];man26_repdip;
But you need our information, and I guarantee you that you will never be able to get it unless we have our secrecy guaranteed against the Sith.;[];;[21928];[21960];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07031_.mp3
What is this recording?;[];;[21963];[21926];man26_repdip;
It's intelligence information about Sith activities on Manaan, as well as some oceanographic reports on the local marine life.;[];;[21922, 21927, 21960];[21962];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07033_.mp3
[Persuade] Come on, tell me.;[];;[21965];[21921];man26_repdip;
[Failure] No, no. You do what I want and maybe I can help you out. Until then: nothing.;[];;[21922, 21966, 21969];[21964];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07035_.mp3
[Force Persuade] You want to tell me.;[{'Player': 'Persuade'}];;[21967];[21965, 21921];man26_repdip;
[Failure] Don't think you can manipulate me, Jedi! The Republic Diplomatic Corps has to deal with the Sith all the time, so we are very resistant to mental influence.;[];;[21968];[21966];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07037_.mp3
Your only real choice is to help me, so I can help you.;[];;[21922, 21969];[21967];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07038_.mp3
I think I'll be going now.;[];;[21970];[21968, 21965, 21921, 21917, 21976, 21915, 21910, 21987, 21906, 22066];man26_repdip;
Then I shall wish you good day. On behalf of the Republic, I hope you enjoy your time here on Manaan.;[];;[];[21969];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07054_.mp3
I'm investigating the Sunry case.;[];Player has been appointed Sunry arbiter;[21972];[21915, 21980, 21910, 21906, 21987, 22066];man26_repdip;
I don't know much about the facts of the case, but I find it hard to believe. I never met Sunry, but he's a hero of the Republic - not a murderer.;[];;[21973];[21971];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07040_.mp3
The so called evidence against him is an obvious frame up - it has to be! The Sith must have plotted Sunry's downfall to embarass and discredit the Republic!;[];;[21974, 21981, 21983];[21972];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07041_.mp3
That's one possibility.;[];;[21975];[21973];man26_repdip;
If you want to solve this mess, I would focus on the Sith. That, or check out the murder scene at the hotel. Talk to the other guests - maybe they know something.;[];;[21976];[21974, 21982, 21984];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07043_.mp3
I regret I could not be of more assistance in your investigation. Is there anything else?;[];;[21907, 21911, 21916, 21969, 21977];[21975];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07044_.mp3
I found this recording in your computers.;[];;[21978];[21976, 21915, 21910, 21906, 21987, 22066];man26_repdip;
You mean you sliced into our... That is a very serious crime! We could have you executed for treason if that information caused any harm!;[{'Roland Wann': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[21979];[21977];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07050_.mp3
But... I may just be willing to overlook this transgression if you NEVER EVER TELL ANOTHER LIVING BEING ABOUT IT.;[{'Roland Wann': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[21980];[21978];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07051_.mp3
And that is all I will ever tell you on the matter.;[];;[21907, 21911, 21916, 21971];[21979];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07052_.mp3
Are you so sure it was the Sith?;[];;[21982];[21973];man26_repdip;
Who else? Sunry's conviction will be a blow to Republic-Selkath relations. Who would benefit from this other than the Sith?;[];;[21975];[21981];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07046_.mp3
Any chance the Republic is involved?;[];;[21984];[21973];man26_repdip;
The Republic? That makes no sense. Sunry has no enemies in the Republic, and his conviction will make all of our jobs more difficult.;[];;[21975];[21983];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07048_.mp3
Maybe a bribe would ensure my silence.;[];;[21986];[21906];man26_repdip;
Don't be foolish! If the Republic's role in this is discovered, I will be sure the blame rests on your shoulders as well. We share a secret - and we will share the consequences if the secret is revealed.;[];;[21987];[21985];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07059_.mp3
For both our sakes you should move on. Our conversation attracts undue attention.;[];;[21907, 21969, 21971, 21977];[21986];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07060_.mp3
You have returned! I was beginning to fear that you, too, might have been lost. Did you find out what had happened down there at the facility?;[];;[21989, 21993, 22013];[None];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD08000_.mp3
The Selkath went insane.;[];;[21990];[21988];man26_repdip;
Insane? What did they do? And why?;[];;[21991, 21993];[21989];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD08002_.mp3
They killed almost everyone on the Station.;[];;[21992];[21990];man26_repdip;
They killed... everyone? And the mercenaries we sent later? That is... horrible. What caused them to all go insane at once like that?;[];;[21993];[21991];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD08004_.mp3
Your construction woke something up.;[];;[21994];[21992, 21990, 21988];man26_repdip;
Something was down there? Living in the Rift by the kolto?;[];;[21995];[21993];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD08006_.mp3
A gigantic firaxan shark that drove all the Selkath insane.;[];;[21996];[21994];man26_repdip;
That's... horrible. The entire operation wasted by a disaster we could never in a thousand years have foreseen.;[];;[21997];[21995];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD08008_.mp3
What has happened to the facility itself? Were there any survivors?;[];;[21998, 22000, 22009];[21996];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD08010_.mp3
A few scientists have survived.;[];;[21999];[21997];man26_repdip;
Well, that is good to know. Good to know indeed. But... What has happened to the facility? Was it damaged?;[];;[22000, 22009];[21998];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD08012_.mp3
The harvesting machine was destroyed.;[];;[22001];[21999, 21997];man26_repdip;
No! That is terrible. That will set our work back years... *sigh* It may even cost us the war.;[{'Roland Wann': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[22002];[22000];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD08014_.mp3
While I am glad that you were able to solve our problems, the cost may have ended up being much too high.;[];;[22003];[22001];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD08016_.mp3
But you have done your job and helped us in our time of need, and for that I thank you.;[];;[22004];[22002, 22012];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD08018_.mp3
Oh, and did you end up finding your Star Map?;[];;[22005, 22007];[22003];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD08020_.mp3
Yes I did.;[];;[22006];[22004];man26_repdip;
As you can see, by helping us you helped yourself. Perhaps we can work together again in the future.;[];;[];[22005];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD08022_.mp3
None of your business!;[];;[22008];[22004];man26_repdip;
I'll assume that means yes. As you can see, by helping us you helped yourself. Perhaps we can work together in the future.;[];;[];[22007];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD08025_.mp3
The kolto seems to have been contaminated.;[];;[22010];[21999, 21997];man26_repdip;
Contaminated? That's... That's much worse than I would ever have thought possible. It might have been better to lose the entire facility rather than damage the kolto supply.;[];;[22011];[22009];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD08028_.mp3
This must remain entirely secret. We cannot allow anyone to find out that we damaged the kolto production or we would be banned permanently from the planet.;[];;[22012];[22010];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD08030_.mp3
We can only hope that the damage that was caused will go away in time.;[];;[22003];[22011];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD08032_.mp3
I haven't finished my investigation.;[];;[22014];[21988];man26_repdip;
Please, continue your investigations and find out what happened to our facility.;[];;[];[22013];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD08035_.mp3
When you are ready to explore the Hrakert Rift, enter the Republic base. In the kolto packing room there is a door leading to the Republic submarines.;[]; after player has player has been given access to the submarines;[22016];[None];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07061_.mp3
The sub will have a course to the Hrakert Scientific Research facility charted in. It will take you to the Hrakert Rift.;[];;[22017];[22015];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07062_.mp3
I wish you luck on your quest. Hopefully a Jedi can succeed where so many others have failed.;[];;[];[22016];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07063_.mp3
Ah, you're back. Have you decided to assist us and, at the same time, yourself?;[]; before acceptance, but after knowledge;[22019, 22021, 22023];[None];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07064_.mp3
I'll get your recording for you.;[];;[22020];[22018];man26_repdip;
Good. I'm glad that you have come to accept the inevitable. Now we can really get down to work.;[];;[21931];[22019];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07066_.mp3
Not right now.;[];;[22022];[22018];man26_repdip;
Very well.;[];;[];[22021];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07094_.mp3

There is no need to be so rude.;[];;[];[22023];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07096_.mp3
Have you managed to retrieve the data from our droid in the Sith base?;[]; after acceptance, but before having data;[22026, 22064];[None];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07097_.mp3
Yes, here it is.;[]; if the player has the data in his possession;[22027];[22025];man26_repdip;
Excellent! It does not appear to have been tampered with, so the Sith did not manage to copy its contents yet.;[];;[22028];[22026];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07099_.mp3
And now for your information... We are not supposed to speak of this, but since you are a Jedi, and we have exhausted all the other options, I think I can entrust you with this.;[];;[22029];[22027];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07100_.mp3
As you know, the Republic is fighting for its very existence against the evil of the Sith Empire. As you also undoubtedly know, we are doing very poorly.;[];;[22030];[22028];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07101_.mp3
We need much in the way of supplies and material to stem the tide of battle and bring us victory.;[];;[22031];[22029];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07102_.mp3
Manaan is the sole source of kolto, the most powerful medical substance in the galaxy. Frankly, we need as much of it as we can get.;[];;[22032, 22063];[22030];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07103_.mp3
What has the Republic done?;[];;[22033];[22031];man26_repdip;
The Selkath conservatives with their neutrality treaties seek to treat the Sith and the Republic equally. This includes kolto exports.;[];;[22034];[22032, 22063];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07105_.mp3
But a few more far-sighted Selkath see that if the Sith are ever allowed to win, the galaxy will be plunged into darkness and there would be nothing to stop them from taking Manaan anyway.;[];;[22035];[22033];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07106_.mp3
So we made a deal...;[];;[22036, 22059, 22061];[22034];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07107_.mp3
What sort of deal?;[];;[22037];[22035];man26_repdip;
We recently began construction of a secret underground facility to harvest kolto directly at its source. We also hope to one day be able to synthesize it effectively.;[];;[22038];[22036, 22060, 22062];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07109_.mp3
Current techniques are insufficient for the task, so we must mine it for now. The amount we take would hardly be noticed, since most is lost naturally before it reaches the surface anyway.;[];;[22039];[22037];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07110_.mp3
We were nearing completion of the base when the digging teams reported some sort of obstruction... an ancient building or artifact. Possibly your 'Star Map'.;[];;[22040];[22038];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07111_.mp3
Transmissions from the base were cut off abruptly after that, and we haven't heard from the station since.;[];;[22041, 22055, 22057];[22039];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07112_.mp3
Why have you not investigated?;[];;[22042];[22040];man26_repdip;
As you may have noticed, we are hiring a lot of mercenaries around here. Ostensibly they're to be shipped off-world to aid in our fight against the Sith, but they are really for another purpose.;[];;[22043];[22041, 22056, 22058];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07114_.mp3
When we lost contact with the station in the Hrakert Rift, we sent our contingent of Republic soldiers down to investigate. None returned...;[];;[22044];[22042];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07115_.mp3
We have tried hiring mercenaries and sending them down as well, but none of those expeditions have returned either.;[];;[22045];[22043];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07116_.mp3
The reason we really sent that droid underwater - and the reason we needed its data back so badly - was to find out what had happened to the Hrakert Rift station.;[];;[22046];[22044];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07117_.mp3
But now that we have the data back, our operation is in no danger of exposure to the Sith. And now I must live up to my end of the bargain.;[];;[22047, 22054];[22045];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07118_.mp3
How will I get down there?;[];;[22048];[22046];man26_repdip;
I took the liberty of having a submarine prepared for your departure. Merely use this card to get past the door behind our kolto packing room and enter the sub therein.;[];;[22049];[22047, 22054];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07120_.mp3
It has been programmed to take you down to the station, and also to take you back up should you need something.;[];;[22050];[22048];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07121_.mp3
I would send soldiers to assist you, but we have lost many of ours, and nearly exhausted the mercenary population of this planet. The soldiers we have are barely enough to keep this base secure!;[];;[22051];[22049];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07122_.mp3
The Sith have also noted our interest and begun to bribe mercenaries away from us...;[];;[22052];[22050];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07123_.mp3
Please, find out what happened to the facility. There may be some survivors left down there, perhaps even the head scientist - Kono Nolan.;[];;[22053];[22051];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07124_.mp3
Good luck in your efforts.;[];;[];[22052];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07125_.mp3
What will you do for me?;[];;[22048];[22046];man26_repdip;
What happened down there?;[];;[22056];[22040];man26_repdip;
*Sigh* We don't know. We just don't know.;[];;[22042];[22055];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07128_.mp3
What does this have to do with me?;[];;[22058];[22040];man26_repdip;
Please, just let me explain.;[];;[22042];[22057];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07130_.mp3
You violated the treaty?!?;[];;[22060];[22035];man26_repdip;
Shhh! Not so loud! Yes, it is a technical violation of the treaty, but it is sanctioned by elements of the Selkath government. We need only keep it hidden from the Sith.;[];;[22037];[22059];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07132_.mp3
This is dangerous...;[];;[22062];[22035];man26_repdip;
I know... but to the senators, it seemed to outweigh the risks.;[];;[22037];[22061];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07134_.mp3
Yeah, yeah, get to the point.;[];;[22033];[22031];man26_repdip;
No I have not.;[];;[22065];[22025];man26_repdip;
Time is a critical factor. We cannot allow the Sith to decode that data recording or our operations on Manaan would be compromised.;[];;[];[22064];man26_repdip;NM26ACREPD07137_.mp3

Not much. It's a pretty barren planet, to tell the truth. Not of much interest to anyone. Unless you're a Sith, I guess... they seem to think this place is something special.;[];;[22105, 22113, 22117, 22118, 22119];[22103];kor33_mechanic;NM33AAMECH12012_.mp3
Why do the Sith think Korriban is special?;[];;[22106];[22104];kor33_mechanic;
Probably all them ruins they found on the surface. That's the reason they built their academy here, I guess, to dig all them ruins up.;[];;[22107, 22109, 22113, 22119];[22105];kor33_mechanic;NM33AAMECH12014_.mp3

The response of the Builders appears to have been to lay waste to the entire surface of Tatooine.;[];;[22152, 22163, 22169, 22174, 22177];[22161];tat20_xstory_01;NM20AAXSTO07039_.mp3

That does not mean they defeated anyone. It seems clear that the Builders simply sterilized their problem and left. The enemy judged them not worthy to fight.;[];;[22152, 22166, 22169, 22174, 22177];[22164];tat20_xstory_01;NM20AAXSTO07042_.mp3

What kind of weapon could do so much damage?;[];;[22170];[22167, 22176, 22165, 22162];tat20_xstory_01;

Hypothesis: Perhaps this is another distortion. Their climate may have begun to fail due to their unrestrained development even before the Builders arrived.;[];;[22172];[22170];tat20_xstory_01;NM20AAXSTO07047_.mp3
Looking back thousands of years later, such a shift could easily be attributed to the much-hated conquerors.;[];;[22152, 22163, 22173, 22174, 22177];[22171];tat20_xstory_01;NM20AAXSTO07048_.mp3

How could they survive such an attack?;[];;[22175];[22172, 22167, 22165, 22162];tat20_xstory_01;
Hypothesis: If his people were moving away from technology for a long time under the Builders, they may have had extensive cave systems that could grant shelter.;[];;[22176];[22174];tat20_xstory_01;NM20AAXSTO07052_.mp3
I would also suggest that, given the evidence of the massive shift in the nature of their society, most of them did not survive.;[];;[22152, 22163, 22169, 22177];[22175];tat20_xstory_01;NM20AAXSTO07053_.mp3

I want to ask something about the time of enslavement.;[];;[22183];[22159, 22157, 22154, 22145];tat20_xstory_01;
Clarification: I believe they were occupied by this technologically superior species for a substantial period. Stripping an entire planet of useable resources would have taken generations.;[];;[22152, 22177, 22184, 22185];[22182];tat20_xstory_01;NM20AAXSTO07055_.mp3

Is there anything in the galactic record that would verify this?;[];;[22190];[22188, 22194];tat20_xstory_01;
Negative: I am no library, but since there is no Republic record of this planet having sentient life before Czerka colonization, I doubt you will find such evidence.;[];;[22152, 22177, 22191, 22192];[22189];tat20_xstory_01;NM20AAXSTO07068_.mp3

I am surprised that such a thing escaped my attention. Was their camouflage so great, or was I simply too struck by grief to see anything?;[];;[22249];[22247];kas23_freyyr_01;
If more are encountered, we will deal with them in short order. My people will never be weak again.;[];;[22236, 22241, 22250, 22254];[22248];kas23_freyyr_01;
I'm looking for something called a Star Map.;[];Player has not talked to the Computer;[22251];[22249, 22240, 22272, 22277, 22280, 22235, 22287];kas23_freyyr_01;
I have no knowledge of anything like that. Wait... there was something...;[];;[22252];[22250];kas23_freyyr_01;
In my exile I encountered a strange computer in the depths of the Shadowlands. I thought it was a Czerka cast-off.;[];;[22253];[22251];kas23_freyyr_01;
You might find something of use in it. It was northwest of the area where you encountered me.;[];;[22236, 22247, 22254];[22252];kas23_freyyr_01;
I should be going.;[];;[22255, 22256];[22253, 22249, 22246, 22242, 22240, 22272, 22277, 22280, 22235, 22287];kas23_freyyr_01;
Yes, goodbye, father.;[];;[22256];[22254];kas23_freyyr_01;
Farewell to you. I thank you again.;[];;[];[22255, 22254];kas23_freyyr_01;
Oh, this isn't wise. An angry Wookiee can't be reasoned with.;[];;[22258];[22238];kas23_freyyr_01;NM23ADFREY02062_.mp3
What did you just say?;[];;[22259, 22273, 22279];[22257, 22281, 22282, 22283, 22284, 22285, 22286, 22238];kas23_freyyr_01;
[Lie] Zaalbar doesn't want the sword. Take it back and give me money.;[];"Player has Bacca's sword on him. Set state to 2, meaning the ""I want to ask about the reward you gave."" question does not appear again.";[22260];[22258];kas23_freyyr_01;
By all the lower lands, did you just have the gall to try and sell me the sword I gave to my son? I am outraged!;[];;[22261, 22266, 22271];[22259];kas23_freyyr_01;
[Persuade] Credits will help more than this sword. I'll buy better equipment.;[];;[22262, 22263];[22260];kas23_freyyr_01;
Oh, I don't think that will work this time.;[];;[22263];[22261, 22266];kas23_freyyr_01;NM23ADFREY02081_.mp3
[Failure] I... I am outraged! Such disrespect! I've seen gorryl slugs with more honor than you!;[];;[22264];[22262, 22261, 22267, 22268, 22269, 22270, 22266];kas23_freyyr_01;
For the sake of my son I won't have you beaten senseless with your own legs, but I want you out of here!;[];;[22265];[22263];kas23_freyyr_01;
You want me to talk, you bring Zaalbar. I'll speak out of respect for him, not you!;[];;[];[22264];kas23_freyyr_01;
[Force Persuade] You want to trade me credits for Bacca's Sword.;[];Evil force adjustment. This is pure greed, whether he succeeds or not. Player is trying to sell a prized possession of Zaalbar's.  Set that Freyyr is really pissed at the player. Will no longer talk to him without Zaalbar present. This is not actually a presuade check. The player is really trying to be an ass here. More a joke.;[22262, 22263, 22267, 22268, 22269, 22270];[22260];kas23_freyyr_01;
Oh boy, now you've done it. No way he'd say okay to that.;[];;[22263];[22266];kas23_freyyr_01;NM23ADFREY02083_.mp3
Cautionary: As predicted, this Wookiee has reacted poorly to your offer.;[];;[22263];[22266];kas23_freyyr_01;NM23ADFREY02085_.mp3
Now you've done it. There's no way you could convince him of that.;[];;[22263];[22266];kas23_freyyr_01;NM23ADFREY02087_.mp3
I did warn you this wouldn't work.;[];;[22263];[22266];kas23_freyyr_01;NM23ADFREY02089_.mp3
I'm sorry, forget I said anything.;[];;[22272];[22260, 22274];kas23_freyyr_01;
I will let this pass and treat you with due respect for the sake of my son, but *never* speak to me of this again.;[];;[22241, 22247, 22250, 22254];[22271, 22278];kas23_freyyr_01;
I want some credits in addition to the sword.;[];"Set state to 2, meaning the ""I want to ask about the reward you gave."" question does not appear again.";[22274];[22258];kas23_freyyr_01;
I see. So the gift of our greatest symbol is not enough for you?;[];;[22271, 22275];[22273];kas23_freyyr_01;
[Force Persuade] You want to pay me credits. Many, many credits.;[];Evil force adjustment. This is pure greed, whether he succeeds or not.;[22276, 22278];[22274];kas23_freyyr_01;
[Success] I... I want to... give you some credits as well. Here... something we salvaged from Chuundar's Czerka bribes.;[];Give player some credits;[22277];[22275];kas23_freyyr_01;
Yes, I think that is fair. I think. Better not mention it to anyone. It's just between you and me.;[];;[22241, 22247, 22250, 22254];[22276];kas23_freyyr_01;
[Failure] No I don't, you gorryl slug trail! How dare you suggest that Bacca's Sword is insufficient!;[];;[22272];[22275];kas23_freyyr_01;
Nothing. Let's just go back to my questions.;[];;[22280];[22258, 22237];kas23_freyyr_01;
I will answer if I can. Be brief.;[];;[22236, 22241, 22247, 22250, 22254];[22279];kas23_freyyr_01;
Careful, I've seen Zaalbar get this mad too. There's no persuading him when it happens.;[];;[22258];[22238];kas23_freyyr_01;NM23ADFREY02064_.mp3
Don't push him too much or we'll have a berserk Wookiee on our hands...;[];;[22258];[22238];kas23_freyyr_01;NM23ADFREY02066_.mp3
Observation: You are angering this Wookiee beyond reasoning. Caution would be best.;[];;[22258];[22238];kas23_freyyr_01;NM23ADFREY02068_.mp3
Careful. He'll be impossible to reason with if you get him any madder.;[];;[22258];[22238];kas23_freyyr_01;NM23ADFREY02070_.mp3
This Wookiee does not like this line of questioning. You'll anger him past reasoning.;[];;[22258];[22238];kas23_freyyr_01;NM23ADFREY02072_.mp3
Your should not press him too far. It may have unfortunate consequences.;[];;[22258];[22238];kas23_freyyr_01;NM23ADFREY02074_.mp3
Have you questions? I will try to answer.;[];;[22236, 22241, 22247, 22250, 22254];[22234];kas23_freyyr_01;
[This twi'lek appears to be looking for someone... maybe even one of your companions back on the Ebon Hawk.];[];;[];[None];k_hlena_dialog;
Mission? Is that you? It's me, Lena. Remember? I was dating your brother back on Taris!;[];;[22290];[None];k_hlena_dialog;NGLOBELENA12000_.mp3
Lena? What... what are you doing here? Where's Griff?;[];;[22291];[22289];k_hlena_dialog;NGLOBELENA12002_.mp3
I'm just passing through. Griff and I broke up a few months after we left Taris together. Probably for the best. Your brother can be charming, Mission, but he's bad news.;[];;[22292];[22290];k_hlena_dialog;NGLOBELENA12004_.mp3
Don't you start trashing my brother, you cantina rat! Take that back or I'll smack you so hard your head-tails will pop off!;[];;[22293];[22291];k_hlena_dialog;NGLOBELENA12006_.mp3
Wha-?? Mission, what's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?;[];;[22294, 22316];[22292];k_hlena_dialog;NGLOBELENA12008_.mp3
You took her brother away and left her all alone on Taris!;[];;[22295];[22293];k_hlena_dialog;
You've got your facts a little backwards. Mission could have come with us if she wanted to! It was her choice to stay behind!;[];;[22296];[22294];k_hlena_dialog;NGLOBELENA12010_.mp3
You liar! Griff told me you didn't want his little sister tagging along - that's why he had to leave me behind!;[];;[22297];[22295, 22317];k_hlena_dialog;NGLOBELENA12012_.mp3
Is that what the Hutt-spawn told you? I wanted you to come with us, Mission. I even offered to pay for your ticket! Why not? I paid for everything else while I was with that freeloader.;[];;[22298];[22296];k_hlena_dialog;NGLOBELENA12014_.mp3
But he told me you didn't want to leave Taris. I said we shouldn't even go then, but he said we'd come back and get you after we struck it rich on Tatooine - just another one of his lies!;[];;[22299];[22297];k_hlena_dialog;NGLOBELENA12016_.mp3
No - you're the one who's lying! Griff wouldn't... he wouldn't try to leave me behind!;[];;[22300, 22314, 22315];[22298];k_hlena_dialog;NGLOBELENA12018_.mp3
Why should we believe you, Lena?;[];;[22301];[22299];k_hlena_dialog;
Think about it. If Griff wasn't trying to ditch you, Mission, then why didn't he tell you where we were going?;[];;[22302];[22300, 22314, 22315];k_hlena_dialog;NGLOBELENA12021_.mp3
After we left Taris he told me looking after you was holding him back - Griff's always looking to blame other people for his own problems. That's why he abandoned you.;[];;[22303];[22301];k_hlena_dialog;NGLOBELENA12023_.mp3
He did the same thing to me, too, as soon as I ran out of money. He started blaming me for all his problems. Like it's my fault his get-rich-quick schemes never work out!;[];;[22304, 22310, 22311, 22313];[22302];k_hlena_dialog;NGLOBELENA12025_.mp3
Sounds like you're better off without him.;[];;[22305];[22303];k_hlena_dialog;
You damn well know it! He's nothing but a sleazy scam artist. If Mission knew what was good for her she'd forget he ever existed.;[];;[22306];[22304];k_hlena_dialog;NGLOBELENA12027_.mp3
But Griff is my brother! I can't just pretend he doesn't exist! If he was here to defend himself Lena wouldn't be saying all this bad stuff about him!;[];;[22307];[22305, 22312, 22313];k_hlena_dialog;NGLOBELENA12040_.mp3
Hey, if you want to talk to Griff go ahead. Last I heard he was going to make a fortune working the Czerka Corp mines on Tatooine. But as far as I'm concerned he's out of my life forever!;[];;[22308];[22306, 22310];k_hlena_dialog;NGLOBELENA12030_.mp3
Griff's better off without you anyway, you table-dancing, brother-stealing home wrecker!;[];;[22309];[22307];k_hlena_dialog;NGLOBELENA12032_.mp3
*sigh* I guess that's my cue to leave, then. I didn't mean to upset you, Mission. But one day you'll see I'm right about your brother. I only hope it's not too late by then.;[];;[];[22308];k_hlena_dialog;NGLOBELENA12034_.mp3
I'd like to hear Griff's side of things before I judge him.;[];;[22307];[22303];k_hlena_dialog;
So where is Griff now?;[];;[22312];[22303];k_hlena_dialog;
Still on Tatooine, as far as I know. Not that I really care anymore. And if Mission was smart she'd forget about that no-good con artist!;[];;[22306];[22311];k_hlena_dialog;NGLOBELENA12037_.mp3
This isn't my problem.;[];;[22306];[22303];k_hlena_dialog;
Maybe he thought you were better off on Taris, Mission.;[];;[22301];[22299];k_hlena_dialog;
Maybe your brother isn't the man you thought he was.;[];;[22301];[22299];k_hlena_dialog;
Mission gets a little worked up when it comes to her brother.;[];;[22317];[22293];k_hlena_dialog;
Yeah, I know how she feels. Griff can be pretty frustrating. I guess that's why Mission didn't want to come with us when we left Taris.;[];;[22296];[22316];k_hlena_dialog;NGLOBELENA12044_.mp3

I knew you boys would see reason. Now get out of here.;[];;[22325];[22323];tar03_cand032;NM03AACAND06012_.mp3
Too bad. I was looking forward to cracking some heads.;[];;[22326];[22324];tar03_cand032;NM03AACAND06014_.mp3

The time has come for you to choose the color of your lightsaber. This color also reflects your demeanor and position within the Order.;[];;[22330, 22368, 22369];[22328];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08001_.mp3
What colors are there?;[];;[22331];[22329];dan13_dorak;
Blue is the color of the Jedi Guardian. This Jedi battles against the forces of evil and the dark side. They focus more on combat training and use of the lightsaber.;[];;[22332];[22330, 22368, 22371];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08003_.mp3
Yellow is the color of the Jedi Sentinel. This Jedi ferrets out deceit and injustice, bringing it to light. They focus less on combat and more on other skills and abilities.;[];;[22333];[22331];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08004_.mp3
Green is the color of the Jedi Consular. This Jedi seeks to bring balance to the universe. They mediate between other groups, using their powers to end conflict and preserve peace.;[];;[22334, 22366, 22367];[22332];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08005_.mp3
I want to be a Jedi Guardian!;[];;[22335];[22333];dan13_dorak;

You are in combat with a Dark Jedi allied with the Sith. There is a pause in the combat. What do you do?;[];;[22340, 22362, 22363];[22338];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08012_.mp3
Attack him again.;[];;[22341];[22339];dan13_dorak;
Yes, I suspected as much. Now for the next question.;[];;[22342];[22340, 22362, 22363];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08014_.mp3
There is a locked door and your goal lies on the other side. What do you do?;[];;[22343, 22360, 22361];[22341];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08015_.mp3
Smash the door down.;[];;[22344];[22342];dan13_dorak;
I am beginning to see a pattern here, apprentice. I have a feeling about what you would be best at. But first, the final question.;[];;[22345];[22343, 22360, 22361];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08018_.mp3
You are the head of an Enclave on a contested world. The Dark Jedi have infiltrated and are causing unrest across the planet. What do you do?;[];;[22346, 22358, 22359];[22344];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08019_.mp3
Hunt them down.;[];;[22347];[22345];dan13_dorak;

As I suspected, you would be most suitable as a Jedi Guardian.;[];;[22349];[22347];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08022_.mp3
Which color and path do you believe yourself most suited to, apprentice?;[];;[22350, 22352, 22354];[22348, 22356, 22357];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08006_.mp3

Yellow. The path of the Jedi Sentinel.;[];;[22353];[22349];dan13_dorak;
Here is a yellow crystal for your lightsaber. Go speak to Master Zhar again and he will instruct you in how to construct it.;[];;[];[22352];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08025_.mp3
Green. The path of the Jedi Consular.;[];;[22355];[22349];dan13_dorak;
Here is a green crystal for your lightsaber. Go speak to Master Zhar again and he will instruct you in how to construct it.;[];;[];[22354];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08027_.mp3
As I suspected, you would be most suitable as a Jedi Sentinel.;[];;[22349];[22347];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08024_.mp3

Stop the thugs and find out why they are attacking her.;[];;[22338];[22336];dan13_dorak;
I want to be a Jedi Sentinel!;[];;[22335];[22333];dan13_dorak;
I want to be a Jedi Consular!;[];;[22335];[22333];dan13_dorak;
What positions are there?;[];;[22331];[22329];dan13_dorak;
Why do I get set with a single color?;[];;[22370];[22329];dan13_dorak;
A Jedi is not restricted to a single color. Rather, that color is a badge of pride for the Jedi path it signifies. Should you have an appropriate crystal, you may change your blade to anything you desire.;[];;[22371];[22369];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08039_.mp3
But first you should learn of the different paths a Jedi may take.;[];;[22331];[22370];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08040_.mp3
Padawan, I must speak with you. You are now one of the Jedi, an Order with a long and glorious past... a past we should all be aware of.;[];must run up and init dialog with the player if Juhani plot is done and the player has not yet spoken to Dorak.;[22373];[None];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08041_.mp3
As a chronicler of the Academy here on Dantooine, I feel it is my duty to share the history of our Order with the newly initiated. Unfortunately, our recent history is one of tragedy and bloodshed.;[];;[22374];[22372, 22448, 22450];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08042_.mp3
The Mandalorian Wars, the fall of Revan and Malak, the rise of the Sith: there are important lessons to be learned from these events if we do not wish to repeat the mistakes of our past.;[];;[22375, 22414, 22423, 22424, 22428];[22373];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08043_.mp3
I am eager to learn, Master Dorak.;[];;[22376];[22374, 22422, 22427];dan13_dorak;
"Of course I could not tell you the entire history of our Order; the Jedi have existed for thousands upon thousands of years. We are as old as the Republic itself.";[];;[22377];[22375, 22423];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08045_.mp3
Instead, I will begin forty years ago with the war of Exar Kun. Like Malak and Revan, Exar Kun was a Jedi who fell to the dark side and led an army against the Jedi and the Republic.;[];;[22378];[22376];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08046_.mp3
Exar Kun was defeated, but the war left both the Republic and our own Order severely weakened. For twenty years we struggled to rebuild, trying to erase the scars of the terrible conflict.;[];step 1 history lesson done;[22379, 22428, 22441];[22377];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08047_.mp3
What does this have to do with Revan and Malak?;[];;[22380];[22378];dan13_dorak;
All things in time. You shall learn that history is an intricate weaving of many events. No one thing can be understood without the proper context.;[];;[22381];[22379];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08049_.mp3
Twenty years ago the Mandalorians, aware the Republic was in a weakened state, began conquering small worlds on the Outer Rim. They were careful to choose only planets outside the Republic's jurisdiction.;[];;[22382];[22380, 22441, 22445];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08051_.mp3
After much debate, the Senate chose not to intervene. As long as the Mandalorians avoided planets that were members of the Republic itself, there would be no retaliation.;[];;[22383, 22439, 22440];[22381];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08052_.mp3
That sounds like a big mistake.;[];;[22384];[22382];dan13_dorak;
Well, you can hardly blame the Republic. The memory of war was fresh in everyone's mind, nobody was eager to relive the horrors in a campaign against the Mandalorians. But in the end it was unavoidable.;[];;[22385];[22383, 22439];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08054_.mp3
The Mandalorians stockpiled resources from their conquered worlds, preparing for a massive assault. Seven years ago they launched a simultaneous attack in three separate sectors of Republic space.;[];;[22386];[22384, 22440];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08057_.mp3
The Senate had no choice but to retaliate with the entire Republic fleet. The Mandalorian Wars had begun.;[];stage 2 of the;[22387, 22428, 22438];[22385];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08058_.mp3
Did the Jedi join in?;[];;[22388];[22386];dan13_dorak;
The Republic petitioned the Jedi Council for aid, but there were many factors to consider before we allowed ourselves to be drawn into another conflict so soon after the war with Exar Kun.;[];;[22389];[22387, 22438, 22446];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08060_.mp3
While the Jedi Council preached patience, there were many among our Order who were eager for us to join the battle. Two young Knights in particular demanded immediate action: Revan and Malak.;[];;[22390];[22388];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08061_.mp3
They rallied many of the Jedi to their cause and, against the wishes of their Masters, joined the Republic fleet battling the Mandalorians.;[];;[22391];[22389];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08062_.mp3
Revan was a brilliant military leader, and the Republic fleet began to win victory after victory. Four years ago the Mandalorians surrendered unconditionally.;[];;[22392, 22435, 22437];[22390];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08063_.mp3
So Revan did the right thing.;[];;[22393];[22391];dan13_dorak;
No one is denying that Revan was one of the keys to defeating the Mandalorians... but something happened out there on the Outer Rim.;[];;[22394];[22392];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08065_.mp3
Instead of returning after the war's end, the ships under Revan's command went deep into unexplored space. They claimed to be searching for the last remnants of the Mandalorian fleet.;[];;[22395];[22393, 22436];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08066_.mp3
All contact was lost. For many months it was assumed some great disaster had befallen the entire fleet. Everyone thought they were dead.;[];;[22396];[22394];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08067_.mp3
There were unsubstantiated rumors of Revan and Malak being seen on a number of different planets during these months - scattered sightings that were never confirmed.;[];;[22397, 22434];[22395];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08068_.mp3
Where did they disappear to?;[];;[22398];[22396];dan13_dorak;
Perhaps they simply went far beyond the edges of Republic space. Maybe they found previously undiscovered hyperspace routes to the ends of the galaxy. Nobody knows for certain.;[];;[22399];[22397];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08070_.mp3
"Three years ago, Revan and Malak returned at the head of a massive invasion fleet. Revan had assumed the title of Sith Lord; the hero had become a conqueror.";[];stage 3;[22400, 22428, 22431];[22398, 22434];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08071_.mp3
Where did Revan get the ships for the Sith fleet?;[];;[22401];[22399];dan13_dorak;
Some of the ships in the Sith fleet are those that were under Revan's command during the Mandalorian Wars. But many more are of an alien design we have never seen before.;[];;[22402];[22400, 22433, 22447];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08073_.mp3
The source of this massive fleet is one of the many things about the Sith we cannot explain. It seems impossible to have created it in such a short time, yet we cannot deny its existence.;[];;[22403];[22401];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08074_.mp3
The source of the Sith soldiers is, unfortunately, much easier to understand. Initially the bulk of the force were former Republic soldiers who had served under Revan.;[];;[22404];[22402];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08075_.mp3
With each conquest thousands more flocked to join the invaders, swelling their numbers. Even many of our own Order have betrayed us, lured by Sith promises of riches and power.;[];;[22405, 22430];[22403];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08076_.mp3
So what happened next?;[];;[22406];[22404];dan13_dorak;
For two years the Sith were all but invincible. Fortunately, Bastila and her Battle Meditation allowed the Republic to win a few key victories and kept the Sith from total triumph.;[];;[22407];[22405, 22430];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08078_.mp3
In desperation we set a trap for the Dark Lord. Bastila was with the strike team that tried to capture Revan, as you probably know. She was there at Revan's end.;[];;[22408];[22406];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08079_.mp3
That was nearly a year ago, but things have not improved. Malak has stepped in and assumed the mantle of Dark Lord for himself, though he is far from Revan's equal in strategy or tactics.;[];;[22409];[22407];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08080_.mp3
Still, his fleet continues to grow in both ships and soldiers. If we do not find some way to stop the Sith soon, Malak will overwhelm us with sheer numbers.;[];history set to 4 and shuts down;[22410, 22414, 22419, 22421];[22408];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08081_.mp3
What can I learn from Revan's history?;[];;[22411];[22409];dan13_dorak;
Revan's tale shows us how even the greatest of Jedi can fall to the dark side. You must always be on guard against the evil that dwells within you. Think hard upon this lesson.;[];;[22412, 22414, 22421];[22410, 22418, 22420];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08083_.mp3
I will think on this, Master Dorak.;[];;[22413];[22411];dan13_dorak;
May the Force be with you.;[];;[];[22412, 22421];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08085_.mp3
Where are the Academy's archives?;[];;[22415];[22411, 22417, 22427, 22409, 22374, 22442];dan13_dorak;
This facility is a training academy. The archives here are restricted to those who have attained the rank of Master. We must protect overeager Padawans from being exposed to dangerous knowledge.;[];;[22416];[22414];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08107_.mp3
The pursuit of knowledge is a noble goal, but there are some things that require the wisdom of a Master to truly understand.;[];;[22417, 22422];[22415];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08108_.mp3
"You should ponder the history of Revan; it contains many lessons you may need if we hope to defeat Malak and the Sith.";[];;[22414, 22418, 22419, 22421];[22416, 22449];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08121_.mp3
What am I supposed to learn from this?;[];;[22411];[22417];dan13_dorak;
Don't worry. I'll find a way to stop the Sith!;[];;[22420];[22417, 22409];dan13_dorak;
Your confidence is admirable, but you must guard against pride and arrogance. These lead to the dark side.;[];;[22411];[22419];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08127_.mp3
I'll be going now.;[];;[22413];[22417, 22411, 22409];dan13_dorak;
If you are seeking information on Revan, Malak and the Sith, I will gladly recount the recent history of our Order to you.;[];;[22375, 22423, 22424, 22428];[22416];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08109_.mp3
Very well... tell me the history of the Jedi.;[];;[22376];[22422, 22427, 22374];dan13_dorak;
I seek knowledge of the Jedi code.;[];;[22425];[22422, 22374];dan13_dorak;
All Jedi must know the code, its tenets are the fundamental teachings of our Order. Think and meditate on these truths, apprentice:;[];;[22426];[22424];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08103_.mp3
"There is no emotion; there is peace. There is no ignorance; there is knowledge. There is no passion; there is serenity. There is no chaos; there is harmony. There is no death; there is the Force.";[];;[22427];[22425];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08104_.mp3
Knowledge of the code will lead you to the rank of Padawan, and knowledge of the Order and its history will guide you down the path of the light.;[];;[22375, 22414, 22423, 22428];[22426];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08105_.mp3
I don't have time for this right now.;[];;[22429];[22427, 22422, 22399, 22386, 22378, 22374, 22442];dan13_dorak;
As you wish. I will not force you to hear what I have to say, though I think it is unwise to ignore the lessons of the past. Perhaps you can return when you have more time.;[];;[];[22428];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08111_.mp3
How can anyone hope to stop the Sith?;[];;[22406];[22404];dan13_dorak;
How did Revan get so many followers?;[];;[22432];[22399];dan13_dorak;
Initially the bulk of the Sith force were former Republic soldiers who had served under Revan. With each conquest thousands more flocked to join the invaders, swelling their numbers.;[];;[22433];[22431];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08091_.mp3
Even many of our own Order have betrayed us, lured by Sith promises of riches and power. But what is more disturbing is the size of the Sith fleet itself.;[];;[22401];[22432];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08092_.mp3
What happened next?;[];;[22399];[22396];dan13_dorak;
How did Revan fall to the dark side?;[];;[22436];[22391];dan13_dorak;
Revan and Malak were heroes, the great saviors of the Republic. A third of the Republic fleet was under their direct command... and then something happened.;[];;[22394];[22435, 22437];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08097_.mp3
Where did the Sith come from?;[];;[22436];[22391];dan13_dorak;
What about Malak and Revan?;[];;[22388];[22386];dan13_dorak;
They should have protected them!;[];;[22384];[22382];dan13_dorak;
But we ended up in a war anyway.;[];;[22385];[22382];dan13_dorak;
What about the Mandalorian Wars?;[];;[22381];[22378];dan13_dorak;

As Chronicler of the Academy here on Dantooine, I find your quest for knowledge admirable. But I do not want to overwhelm you with the long history of the Jedi Order.;[];;[22417];[22448, 22450];dan13_dorak;NM13AADORA08120_.mp3

Fearsome beasts! Predators! A danger that the settlers of this world must constantly face and do battle with!;[];;[22649];[22647];dan14_adam;
And what better way to battle them than with this handy Blaster Pistol! Crafted from the finest, sturdiest materials, it can stop a kath hound dead in its tracks at fifty paces!;[];;[22640, 22641, 22642];[22648];dan14_adam;
What do you know about ancient ruins here?;[];;[22651];[22646, 22636];dan14_adam;
I am sorry, but I have not been on this world long. I am not familiar with the rich cultural history of its hardy peoples.;[];;[22646];[22650];dan14_adam;
What do you know about the corrupted grove?;[];;[22653];[22646, 22636];dan14_adam;
I am sorry, but I have not been on this world long. I am not familiar with any specific locales in this area.;[];;[22646];[22652];dan14_adam;
Actually, I'd like to see what you have in stock.;[];;[22627];[22646, 22636];dan14_adam;
I don't have enough.;[];;[22656];[22632];dan14_adam;
Come back, then, when enough money is there, and the map I'll have.;[];;[22657];[22655];dan14_adam;
Well then, yes, what is it that you want?;[];;[22626, 22628, 22635, 22642];[22656, 22658];dan14_adam;
I'd like to ask something else.;[];;[22657];[22632, 22630];dan14_adam;
I would like a map to the area south of here.;[];;[22632];[22630];dan14_adam;
You're trying to sell me something, aren't you...;[];;[22623];[22621];dan14_adam;
I really don't think I have time for this.;[];;[22624];[22621, 22617];dan14_adam;
Noble, are you...;[];;[22663];[22617];dan14_adam;
Yes! Noble it is!;[];;[22620];[22662];dan14_adam;
Talk to the captain, not me.;[];;[];[None];kas22_czerka2_01;NM22AACZER02000_.mp3
I just carry a blaster. The captain does the talking.;[];;[];[None];kas22_czerka2_01;NM22AACZER02001_.mp3
I'm not paid to talk. Take it to the captain or the stiffs in the office.;[];;[];[None];kas22_czerka2_01;NM22AACZER02002_.mp3
Don't bother me. You're on your own here.;[];;[];[None];kas22_czerka2_01;NM22AACZER02003_.mp3
Hey, what do you think you're doing? You can't go into the cantina while you're on duty!;[];;[22669, 22671];[None];tar02_sithcantin;NM02ACSITH07000_.mp3
I'm not on duty right now.;[];;[22670];[22668];tar02_sithcantin;
Then you shouldn't be in full uniform! If you're off duty go change your outfit. If not, get back to your patrol route!;[];;[];[22669];tar02_sithcantin;NM02ACSITH07002_.mp3
Sorry, I'll be going now.;[];;[22672];[22668];tar02_sithcantin;
Good. Get back to your patrol route. We need to keep a strong presence in the streets to maintain order here.;[];;[];[22671];tar02_sithcantin;NM02ACSITH07005_.mp3
Don't bother me - I'm here on official Sith business!;[];;[];[None];tar02_sithcantin;NM02ACSITH07007_.mp3
Revan - I knew you'd come for me. Malak thought you might be afraid to enter the Temple again, but he doesn't know you like I do. Not anymore. Not since you've changed.;[];;[22675, 22703];[None];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01001_.mp3
Quickly, Bastila - come with us! We have to escape before Malak arrives!;[];;[22676];[22674];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01002_.mp3
"Escape? You don't understand. I have sworn allegiance to Lord Malak and the Sith; I am no longer a pawn of the Jedi Council.";[];;[22677, 22701];[22675, 22703];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01003_.mp3
No, Bastila! Don't go over to the dark side!;[];;[22678];[22676];unk44_evilbast;
You say that as if the dark side is some terrible entity. The Jedi Council has brainwashed you like all the others. Like they once did with me.;[];;[22679];[22677];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01005_.mp3
They speak of the dark side as if it something to be feared. But in reality their only goal is to manipulate those who are strong in the Force. The fear of the dark side is a tool to maintain control.;[];;[22680];[22678, 22702];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01006_.mp3
Why do you think the Jedi forbid you and Malak from joining the Mandalorian Wars? They knew you would realize your true potential and break free of their domination.;[];;[22681];[22679];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01007_.mp3
Malak has shown me how the Jedi Council have been using me the same way they once tried to use you. They've been holding me back because they knew one day I would surpass them all.;[];;[22682, 22699, 22700];[22680];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01008_.mp3
No - I don't believe it! How could you betray us like this, Bastila?;[];;[22683];[22681];unk44_evilbast;
I resisted at first. I endured the Sith torments with the passionless serenity of a true Jedi, emptying my mind. But after a week of endless tortures I finally saw the truth.;[];;[22684];[22682, 22699, 22700];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01012_.mp3
Malak forced me to acknowledge my anger and pain. He showed me the liberating power of these emotions. Then he made me see how the Jedi Council has denied me what is mine by right!;[];;[22685];[22683];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01013_.mp3
The Jedi Council gladly used my Battle Meditation in their wars, but they still treated me like a child - like an inferior. They were jealous of my power... of what I could become!;[];;[22686];[22684];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01014_.mp3
They wanted me to bow and call them Master and follow their Code and obey their every order. But all the while they were exploiting my Battle Meditation for their own use!;[];;[22687, 22691, 22693, 22697, 22698];[22685];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01015_.mp3
Don't do this, Bastila! Fight it! I'll help you!;[];;[22688];[22686];unk44_evilbast;
You are a sad little fool. You speak as if I were the same Bastila that you've known all along. But freed from the control of the Jedi Council I've become much, much more.;[];;[22689];[22687];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01017_.mp3
I almost wish you could see things as I do now. I wish you could join me and taste true power once again. Sadly, I doubt you are even capable any longer.;[];;[22690];[22688, 22692];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01018_.mp3
With the power of the Star Forge Malak will destroy the Republic and conquer the galaxy. And I will be the apprentice at his side - after I prove my worth by killing you!;[];;[];[22689, 22696];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01027_.mp3
I like this side of you, Bastila. Now we can truly be together.;[];;[22692];[22686];unk44_evilbast;
You think so, do you? You style yourself the Master of the Sith that you once were? To think I once envied you your passion, your power.;[];;[22689];[22691];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01020_.mp3
Don't be lured in by these Sith lies, Bastila!;[];;[22694];[22686];unk44_evilbast;
"Lies? You are the one living a lie, Revan. The Jedi Council made you into something you are not; they programmed you to be their slave.";[];;[22695];[22693];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01022_.mp3
You used to be Revan, Master of the Sith, but no longer. You are simply a pawn of the Jedi Council and the Republic they serve... like I was until Malak freed me from their shackles!;[];;[22696];[22694, 22697];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01024_.mp3
A pity the power you once had is so diluted in you. You could have been strong as I am now... stronger, even. But that will never happen, now.;[];;[22690];[22695, 22698];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01026_.mp3
I am Revan, the Dark Lord! Bow down to me, Bastila!;[];;[22695];[22686];unk44_evilbast;
If you've fallen under Malak's control you must die!;[];;[22696];[22686];unk44_evilbast;
It's not too late, Bastila! You can still turn away from the dark side!;[];;[22683];[22681];unk44_evilbast;
It didn't take long to convert you, did it? I always knew you were weak!;[];;[22683];[22681];unk44_evilbast;
A pawn of the Jedi Council? What are you talking about?;[];;[22702];[22676];unk44_evilbast;
"Surely you know what I mean, Revan. Look at what the Council did to you; they turned you into their puppet. The same thing they do to all who are truly strong in the Force.";[];;[22679];[22701];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01029_.mp3
Come on, Bastila. We have to escape before Malak shows up!;[];;[22676];[22674];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01030_.mp3
You are stronger than I would have thought possible, after what the Jedi Council did to you. Seems that Malak was wrong - the power of the dark side is not lost to you after all, Revan.;[];;[22705, 22767, 22768];[None];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01031_.mp3
I draw my power from the light now, Bastila.;[];;[22706];[22704];unk44_evilbast;
You can deny what you are, Revan, but you are only fooling yourself. I know the truth. I have seen the shadows inside your mind.;[];;[22707];[22705, 22767];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01033_.mp3
Remember: I was there when you nearly died in the trap set by the Jedi Council. I used the Force to preserve your life, Revan. We are forever linked by my actions on that bridge!;[];;[22708, 22763, 22765];[22706];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01034_.mp3
That is how I know you will come back to the light.;[];;[22709];[22707];unk44_evilbast;
These are not your true feelings, Revan. You are speaking as a tool of the Jedi Council - as I once did. But now I see how the Jedi used us both!;[];;[22710];[22708];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01036_.mp3
The Council tried to exploit the bond between us. They hoped I would draw out your memories to lead them to the Star Forge. We were slaves to their will - like all who follow the Jedi Code!;[];;[22711];[22709, 22764, 22766];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01037_.mp3
But in our shared visions of the Star Maps I also felt the so called taint within you. I resisted it at first, but now I embrace the power of the dark side - your dark side!;[];;[22712, 22758, 22760, 22761, 22762];[22710];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01038_.mp3
Learn from my mistakes. It is not too late to come back to the light!;[];;[22713];[22711];unk44_evilbast;
Mistakes? No, Revan - the only mistake you are making is the one you are making now! You deny yourself the power that is yours by right! Only now do I realize how strong you are.;[];;[22714];[22712];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01040_.mp3
You deserve to be the true Master of the Sith, not Malak. I see this now. Together we can destroy your old apprentice. Join with me and reclaim your lost identity!;[];;[22715, 22757];[22713, 22759, 22760, 22761, 22762, 22770];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01041_.mp3
I'm not Revan anymore. I don't even remember those days.;[];;[22716];[22714];unk44_evilbast;
Your mind was too badly damaged to ever fully restore your memories, Revan. But your power, your strength of will, the essence of who and what you are: these things still remain!;[];;[22717];[22715, 22757];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01043_.mp3
Once long ago you defied the Jedi Council, freeing yourself from their control. You claimed your rightful title of Dark Lord of the Sith. Together we can defeat Malak and take back what is yours!;[];;[22718, 22727, 22744, 22749];[22716];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01044_.mp3
Please, Bastila... if you feel anything for me, you won't do this!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Pleading'}];;[22719];[22717];unk44_evilbast;
I... I don't. The only Revan I could respect is one who would break free of the Council's slavery. One who would grasp the power that lies before him... not the weak fool I see.;[];;[22720, 22750];[22718];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01046_.mp3
Bastila, it is not too late for you to be saved. The teachings of the Jedi can lead you from the dark side back into the light and a true understanding of the Force.;[];;[22721];[22719, 22749];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01048_.mp3
You are beneath my contempt, Juhani. When you felt the power of the dark side you fled to a cave like some cowering animal! You know nothing of the Force or its true potential!;[{'Bastilae': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[22722];[22720];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01049_.mp3
But you, Revan - the power of the dark side is yours to command! You can use it to destroy Malak! With my help you could rule over the entire galaxy!;[];;[22723, 22726, 22727, 22744, 22752];[22721, 22751];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01050_.mp3
I don't want to rule the galaxy. I want you to return to the light.;[];;[22724];[22722];unk44_evilbast;
You are a pathetic fool, Revan! Together we could have defeated Malak and ruled over an Empire, but now I will be at Lord Malak's side instead!;[{'Bastilae': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[22725];[22723, 22726, 22734, 22740, 22748, 22753, 22754];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01081_.mp3
You will be crushed with the Republic and all the fools who bow down to the Jedi Council! No one can stand against the power of the Star Forge and the Sith fleet!;[{'Bastilae': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[];[22724];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01082_.mp3
The Dark Lord Revan is dead. I am a servant of the light now.;[];;[22724];[22722];unk44_evilbast;
Yes! Together we can rule the galaxy!;[{'Player': 'Taunt'}];;[22728, 22741];[22722, 22747, 22756, 22717];unk44_evilbast;
Listen to me... the dark side leads to death and destruction. I've seen the horrors the Sith have unleashed on the galaxy. Turn away from this path.;[];;[22729];[22727];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01056_.mp3
Shut up, old man. Your time is over! The age of the Jedi and the Republic is no more! This is the age of Darth Revan and the Sith!;[];;[22730];[22728];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01057_.mp3
Don't do this, kid. I don't want to, but I'll fight you if I have to. Even if it costs me my life.;[];;[22731, 22739, 22740];[22729];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01058_.mp3
I am the Lord of the Sith! Bow down before me!;[];;[22732, 22737];[22730, 22743];unk44_evilbast;
A true Jedi will never bow down to the Sith. If this is your decision I have no choice but to do battle against you.;[];;[22733];[22731];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01060_.mp3
Kill her! Rend her flesh! Show her the fate of all who dare stand against us! Embrace the power of the dark side!;[];;[22734, 22735];[22732];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01061_.mp3
No, I will not kill my friend. I reject the power of the dark side.;[];;[22724];[22733, 22738];unk44_evilbast;
Death to the Jedi!;[];;[22736];[22733, 22738];unk44_evilbast;
Yes! The sacrificial blood will consecrate this ancient temple in the name of the Sith! With the death of the Jedi the rebirth of Darth Revan will be complete!;[];;[];[22735, 22739];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01067_.mp3
I'm a Jedi... I'll never bow down to the Sith. If you go through with this I have no choice but to do battle against you.;[];;[22738];[22731];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01064_.mp3
Kill him! Grind his old bones to dust! Show him the fate of all who dare stand against us! Embrace the dark side!;[];;[22734, 22735];[22737];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01065_.mp3
Then you must die!;[];;[22736];[22730, 22743];unk44_evilbast;
You... you're right. I cannot do this. I reject the dark side!;[];;[22724];[22730, 22743];unk44_evilbast;
No! Do not walk down this path... it can only lead to destruction! I know of what I speak!;[{'Juhani': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[22742];[22727];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01069_.mp3
Shut up, Juhani! You know nothing of the dark side's true potential! When you felt its touch you fled to a cave and cowered in terror!;[];;[22743];[22741];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01070_.mp3
I have no wish to fight you and Bastila, but if you choose to walk down this path you know I must stand against you... even at the cost of my life.;[];;[22731, 22739, 22740];[22742];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01071_.mp3
How do I know you won't betray me?;[];;[22745, 22755];[22722, 22717];unk44_evilbast;
I need deny my passions no longer, Revan. I would stand by your side gladly, as your lover and apprentice!;[];;[22746];[22744];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01073_.mp3
I swore allegiance to Malak only because I thought you had lost the power you had once wielded. But this... this would be much better.;[];;[22747];[22745];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01074_.mp3
I would be utterly yours, master! Together we would destroy Malak and you would reclaim the mantle of Dark Lord!;[];;[22727, 22748, 22749, 22752];[22746];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01075_.mp3
No, I... don't want you like this. I want the woman I knew.;[];;[22724];[22747];unk44_evilbast;
Turn away from this path, Bastila. The dark side leads only to destruction.;[];;[22720, 22750];[22747, 22756, 22717];unk44_evilbast;
It's not to late for you, Bastila. The dark side is evil but it isn't all powerful. You can still fight against it. Don't let it consume you.;[];;[22751];[22749, 22719];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01053_.mp3
You are beneath my contempt, old man! You hid like a coward for decades on Kashyyyk! You know nothing about the true potential of the Force!;[{'Bastilae': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[22722];[22750];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01054_.mp3
I don't trust you. I think I'll just kill you instead!;[];;[22753, 22754];[22747, 22756, 22722];unk44_evilbast;
No! This is the way of the dark side! Do not give in to the anger and hatred!;[];;[22724];[22752];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01083_.mp3
No! Don't give into your anger. Remain calm, remain focused. Don't let her twist your mind like this!;[];;[22724];[22752];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01080_.mp3
It is your power that will keep me as your loyal apprentice, Revan. I swore allegiance to Malak only because I thought you had lost the power you once wielded.;[];;[22756];[22744];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01077_.mp3
"But you have proven yourself in our battle; I see you possess the strength to destroy Malak and reclaim the mantle of Dark Lord. Now I see you will make a worthy Sith Master.";[];;[22727, 22749, 22752];[22755];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01078_.mp3
How can I reclaim my identity if I can't even remember it?;[];;[22716];[22714];unk44_evilbast;
No! This isn't the Bastila I knew!;[];;[22759];[22711];unk44_evilbast;
Of course not! I have been reborn in the wake of destiny... *your* destiny! The power of the dark side is yours by right!;[];;[22714];[22758];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01086_.mp3
What are you saying, Bastila?;[];;[22714];[22711];unk44_evilbast;
If I am so powerful, then why do you serve another master?;[];;[22714];[22711];unk44_evilbast;
Then why don't we join our power together, as it was meant to be?;[];;[22714];[22711];unk44_evilbast;
There is no link between us, Bastila! Not anymore!;[];;[22764];[22707];unk44_evilbast;
Our bond is not easily broken, Revan. Even when your mind was destroyed and reprogrammed with a new identity the bond between us endured.;[];;[22710];[22763];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01091_.mp3
We are linked by more than just a bond, Bastila.;[];;[22766];[22707];unk44_evilbast;
Do not mistake the power of the Force for love, Revan. It does not exist. Power is what forged our bond, and power is what made us both tools of the Jedi Council!;[];;[22710];[22765];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01093_.mp3
Don't call me that. I'm not Revan anymore. I'm <FullName> now.;[];;[22706];[22704];unk44_evilbast;
Now you see the power of the true Dark Lord!;[];;[22769];[22704];unk44_evilbast;
"Yes, Revan! I was there when you almost died in the trap set by the Jedi Council; I used the Force to preserve your life. We are forever linked by my actions on that bridge.";[];;[22770];[22768];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01096_.mp3
The Council tried to exploit our bond. They hoped your memories would lead me to the Star Forge. But in our shared visions of the Star Maps I also tasted the power of the taint within you!;[];;[22714];[22769];unk44_evilbast;NM44ACEVIL01097_.mp3
Beep beep beep-oop!;[];;[];[None];k_hdroid1_dialog;NM35AADROI01000_.mp3
You have returned at last, Revan. I was beginning to wonder what had happened to you in the Temple.;[]; first time only;[22773, 22777, 22844, 22845];[None];unk42_redbreed01;
You know me?;[];;[22774];[22772];unk42_redbreed01;
We had met previously when last you entered our enclave, many years ago. You inquired as to my research then as well.;[];;[22775];[22773];unk42_redbreed01;
You came here and gained access to the Temple, and were never heard from again. Some thought you might have betrayed us to the others, but they were never able to penetrate our defenses.;[];;[22776];[22774, 22846];unk42_redbreed01;
But if you will help us now, then the time taken is nothing. Is there anything else you require?;[];;[22777, 22844];[22775];unk42_redbreed01;
What are you doing?;[];;[22778];[22776, 22772];unk42_redbreed01;
What am I doing? You mean, the purpose of my research here?;[];;[22779, 22841, 22842];[22777];unk42_redbreed01;
What is your research?;[];;[22780];[22778];unk42_redbreed01;
As you may have heard from our historians, in our distant past we melded technology and the Force to create truly wondrous effects.;[];;[22781];[22779, 22817, 22841, 22843];unk42_redbreed01;
We guided ships across the galaxy using our power, and incorporated its use into all aspects of our society.;[];;[22782];[22780];unk42_redbreed01;
But... something happened somewhere.;[];;[22783, 22836, 22839];[22781];unk42_redbreed01;
What happened?;[];;[22784];[22782];unk42_redbreed01;
There are a variety of theories on what happened. Perhaps we became immune to the effects of the Force from overuse. Perhaps our breeding habits rendered our species insensitive to it over time. None truly know.;[];;[22785];[22783, 22840];unk42_redbreed01;
The only discernable result was that we could no longer command the Force as we had. Its power had escaped us.;[];;[22786];[22784];unk42_redbreed01;
With its loss, our technologies could no longer hold us as far above the subjugated races we ruled, and our empire began to crumble. The races we subjugated rose up, plagues swept our worlds... we could do nothing against all these calamities.;[];;[22787];[22785];unk42_redbreed01;
In the end, only the members of our race left here, on our homeworld, survived.;[];;[22788, 22835];[22786, 22838];unk42_redbreed01;
So what is your research then?;[];;[22789];[22787];unk42_redbreed01;
Every once in a while, there is an individual born who has an affinity for the Force. Maybe not the ability to use it directly, but at least the ability to remain open to it.;[];;[22790];[22788, 22835];unk42_redbreed01;
I believe this is a sign that whatever genes our species had that gave us the ability to use the Force are not completely gone. Perhaps when the ancestors of the current tribes fled beneath the surface, some retained this trait.;[];;[22791];[22789];unk42_redbreed01;
We have been working for years to isolate this gene in an attempt to resurrect it in our species as well.;[];;[22792];[22790];unk42_redbreed01;
We of the Elders do not have Force sensitivity ourselves, but by harnessing the genetic structure of other tribes, we hope to be able to breed the gene back into our species.;[];;[22793, 22833, 22834];[22791];unk42_redbreed01;
You're capturing prisoners... for their genes?;[];;[22794];[22792];unk42_redbreed01;
You make us seem like monsters... Truly we are not.;[];;[22795];[22793, 22834];unk42_redbreed01;
We capture them, yes, but only because the tribes have become extremely xenophobic in their millenia trapped on this world. They would not aid us willingly, and killed our messengers when we asked.;[];;[22796];[22794];unk42_redbreed01;
We believe that if we get a large enough genetic sample, we can reintroduce the recessive Force sensitive genes back into our people, allowing us to once again access the heritage of our past.;[];;[22797, 22800];[22795, 22833];unk42_redbreed01;
Heritage... You mean the Temple?;[];;[22798];[22796];unk42_redbreed01;
Yes, the Temple. It can only be entered by those sensitive to the Force, so it has been barred to us for ages.;[];;[22799];[22797];unk42_redbreed01;
What we may find inside will allow us to lift the other tribes out of the barbarism into which they have fallen and restore us as a productive force in the galaxy.;[];;[22800, 22829, 22831];[22798];unk42_redbreed01;
You're trying to restore your empire, aren't you!;[];;[22801];[22799, 22796];unk42_redbreed01;
No! We do not want to fall down the path that so twisted our people before.;[];;[22802];[22800];unk42_redbreed01;
This time, perhaps we can redeem ourselves in the eyes of the galaxy, and become a force of good.;[];;[22803];[22801, 22830, 22832];unk42_redbreed01;
How close are you to finishing your research?;[];;[22804];[22802];unk42_redbreed01;
We are quite far along, having had centuries to work already, but with the arrival of another tribe on our island, we have been restricted in our movements to just our enclave.;[];;[22805];[22803];unk42_redbreed01;
We have captured a few of their warriors, but the one that really interests us is their leader... the One.;[];;[22806, 22827, 22828];[22804];unk42_redbreed01;
The One? What's special about him?;[];;[22807];[22805];unk42_redbreed01;
Those with the genes we seek seem to be marked... Marked with a destiny that causes them to rise above others as we did as a species early on.;[];;[22808];[22806, 22827, 22828];unk42_redbreed01;
In hearing the stories his warriors tell of the One, we believe that he may hold some of the genes we seek. He may be nearing Force sensitivity.;[];;[22809];[22807];unk42_redbreed01;
Unfortunately, he and his people are much too aggressive and violent for us to ever get close enough to study him. His corpse would not do either, as only a living, working body is of use to us.;[];;[22810];[22808];unk42_redbreed01;
Maybe in time, though, the differences between our peoples will lessen enough that we may study one another and gain the information we need.;[];;[22811, 22824, 22825];[22809];unk42_redbreed01;
What kind of information do you need?;[];;[22812];[22810];unk42_redbreed01;
Genetic data on drifts and changes over the many millenia we have been here. Specific data on exceptional individuals.;[];;[22813];[22811];unk42_redbreed01;
If only we had access to the knowledge of our ancestors... They must have known much, much more than us. They had a much greater population sample to work with.;[];;[22814];[22812, 22824, 22826];unk42_redbreed01;
I believe that in the Temple there may be the information we seek. Perhaps in old archives or scrolls... maybe even in an ancient computer if any is still functioning.;[];;[22815];[22813];unk42_redbreed01;
This information would help us greatly in our work, and we would be very grateful to you for it.;[];;[22816];[22814];unk42_redbreed01;
Is there anything else I can help you with?;[];;[22817, 22818, 22822];[22815, 22821];unk42_redbreed01;
Tell me about your research again.;[];;[22780];[22816, 22848];unk42_redbreed01;
What do you know about the Temple?;[];;[22819];[22816, 22848];unk42_redbreed01;
It is ancient, that we know. And it is guarded by advanced technology that only Force sensitive races can penetrate.;[];;[22820];[22818];unk42_redbreed01;
Recently we have seen ships coming and going from it, similar in design to ones that came at about the same time you did many years ago.;[];;[22821];[22819];unk42_redbreed01;
Other than that, we do not know... although we would dearly like to find out.;[];;[22816];[22820];unk42_redbreed01;
I have to go now.;[];;[22823];[22816, 22848];unk42_redbreed01;
Very well then. Come and go as you please.;[];;[];[22822, 22844];unk42_redbreed01;
How could I help with your research?;[];;[22813];[22810];unk42_redbreed01;
I don't know if your eugenics program is a good thing...;[];;[22826];[22810];unk42_redbreed01;
We would not revert to our old ways, rest assured, Revan. We merely seek data on genetic drifts and changes in the millenia of our imprisonment here.;[];;[22813];[22825];unk42_redbreed01;
How can you find these genes?;[];;[22807];[22805];unk42_redbreed01;
Do any of these warriors have what you're looking for?;[];;[22807];[22805];unk42_redbreed01;
You want to reunite the tribes?;[];;[22830];[22799];unk42_redbreed01;

I don't know how the Republic and the Sith would see you...;[];;[22832];[22799];unk42_redbreed01;

You're trying to rebuild your genetic structure?;[];;[22796];[22792];unk42_redbreed01;
Why don't you just ask them for help?;[];;[22794];[22792];unk42_redbreed01;
No Rakata can use the Force?;[];;[22789];[22787];unk42_redbreed01;

Perhaps not, but it is critical to my explanation of my work.;[];;[22838];[22836];unk42_redbreed01;
When my species began to lose control over the Force, the power we had held over the subject races began to decay, along with our empire. The races we subjugated rose up, plagues swept our worlds... we could do nothing against all these calamities.;[];;[22787];[22837];unk42_redbreed01;
I've heard this before.;[];;[22840];[22782];unk42_redbreed01;
Yes, likely you have.;[];;[22784];[22839];unk42_redbreed01;
Why do you have these prisoners?;[];;[22780];[22778];unk42_redbreed01;
You know damn well what I'm asking!;[];;[22843];[22778];unk42_redbreed01;
Yes, yes, my research.;[];;[22780];[22842];unk42_redbreed01;
I don't have time to talk.;[];;[22823];[22776, 22772];unk42_redbreed01;
Nothing much happened...;[];;[22846];[22772];unk42_redbreed01;
Indeed... Nothing much happened for many years it seems.;[];;[22775];[22845];unk42_redbreed01;
You have done our people a great service here, Revan, but your destiny lies elsewhere. May the blessings of the Elders go with you.;[]; player has been in temple;[];[None, 22851];unk42_redbreed01;

I can't thank you enough for saving me, up-worlder. If I had anything but these rags on my back it would be yours. But we have nothing.;[];first time talked to and Hendar dead Dialog Mission Statement: The first time the player approaches the gate from the interior of the village a conversation between the gatekeeper (OutcastMan045) and Hesther (OutcastWom043) will ensue as Hendar (OutcastMan046) runs for the gate with a Rakghoul in pursuit. The player can offer to help Hendar and the gatekeeper will open the gate, or he can simply sit and watch as hendar is killed (4 rounds after Hendar reaches the gate if the player does not intervene, or instantly if the player refuses to open the gate). If the player saves Hendar, he and Hesther thank the player and wander off. If Hendar dies, Hesther wanders off and reviles the player. Exit points in conversation: Exit stream 1: First time talked to either hendar or Hesther after hendar has been saved. Advances the plot global to 99 and makes Hesther and Hendar move to the village Exit stream 2: Hendar is saved, player has already spoken to Hesther and Hendar once since then. They thank player and nothing happens. Exit stream 3: If Hendar dies and the player speaks to Hesther she will reviled the player and walk to her standing in the village point. Exit stream 4: Player has promised to save Hendar, guard opens gate. Player has 4 rounds to go through the gate or Rakghoul kills Hendar then runs off. Exit stream 5: If player chooses to let Hendar die. Depending on the path the player can get a dark side hit. Exit stream 6: If Hendar is being attacked and the gate is open Hesther urges the player through. Nothing happens script wise. Exit Stream 7: When player first approaches gate from inside village, cutscene with Hesther, Hendar and guard runs.

What are you doing here, Komad? Following me?;[];;[23277];[23275];kas22_xkomad_01;
While I'm sure you would prove an interesting hunt, I don't track sentient prey. Two-legged animals do a fine job of killing each other without me.;[];;[23278];[23276];kas22_xkomad_01;
I have come here to seek even greater prey than what we faced on Tatooine, but the climate here is politically cold, and I don't know if I will be allowed to hunt.;[];;[23279, 23285, 23295];[23277, 23298];kas22_xkomad_01;
Whose permission are you looking for?;[];;[23280];[23278, 23294, 23289, 23287];kas22_xkomad_01;
An astute question.

What are you doing to gain their trust?;[];;[23283];[23281];kas22_xkomad_01;
Very little. I'm sure they have had enough of off-worlders like the Czerka claiming good intentions. I will simply try to stay out of their way.;[];;[23284];[23282];kas22_xkomad_01;
I have heard of an off-worlder that has gained respect by living in the Shadowlands for some years. Perhaps I will attempt the same. It could just be hunter tales, though.;[];;[23285, 23295];[23283];kas22_xkomad_01;

I know that I don't know enough. Even from this docking area I can see this world is a true wonder. My desert-dimmed imagination didn't do it justice.;[];;[23287];[23285];kas22_xkomad_01;
It's just a shame to see Czerka Corporation here. They lack an appreciation for the wild nature of this world. I don't like having to deal with them.;[];;[23279, 23288, 23290, 23295];[23286];kas22_xkomad_01;
I'm looking for a Star Map here. Have you heard anything?;[];;[23289];[23287, 23294];kas22_xkomad_01;
No, but I wasn't listening for such talk. I'm sorry that I can't help you.;[];;[23279, 23290, 23295];[23288];kas22_xkomad_01;
If not Czerka, who would you prefer to deal with?;[];;[23291];[23289, 23287];kas22_xkomad_01;
The native leadership of the Wookiees, of course. This is their world, after all. I can't understand why thy have allowed it to be misused.;[];;[23292, 23293];[23290];kas22_xkomad_01;
Perhaps they had no choice.;[];;[23293];[23291];kas22_xkomad_01;
There is always the option to fight, even if there is no option to win. Of course, that is easy for me to say, being an outsider.;[];;[23294];[23292, 23291];kas22_xkomad_01;

What can you tell me about Dantooine?;[];;[23330];[23328, 23321, 23310, 23346];dan14_settlerm;
Well, as you can see here, Dantooine is mostly plains and grassland, but it has nice hearty soil. A lot of new people have come in the last generation or so.;[];;[23331];[23329, 23343];dan14_settlerm;NM14AASETT11039_.mp3

But Ahlan Matale and Nurik Sandral just can't seem to get along, and now Ahlan wants to get the Council to do something.;[];;[23333, 23337, 23338];[23331];dan14_settlerm;NM14AASETT11041_.mp3
Do something? Has something happened?;[];;[23334];[23332];dan14_settlerm;
Well... from what I hear it started about a week ago. See, Nurik's son Casus is an archeologist, bright lad too, but he disappeared. Nurik of course blamed Ahlan, but even he didn't take it before the Council.;[];;[23335];[23333];dan14_settlerm;NM14AASETT11043_.mp3
But now Ahlan's son Shen has disappeared as well... and no one knows where he's gone. Ahlan blames Nurik. He thinks he's kidnapped his son.;[];;[23336];[23334];dan14_settlerm;NM14AASETT11044_.mp3
I don't know exactly what he wants to ask the Council, but from what I know of Ahlan, he's probably going to be after blood...;[];;[23321];[23335];dan14_settlerm;NM14AASETT11045_.mp3

The player can offer to help Hendar and the gatekeeper will open the gate, or he can simply sit and watch as hendar is killed (4 rounds after Hendar reaches the gate if the player does not intervene, or instantly if the player refuses to open the gate).

Arbiter?;[];;[23452];[23450, 23613];man26_selarb;
Yes, Arbiter. The one who defends you before the judges of the Selkath people.;[];;[23453];[23451];man26_selarb;
I will endeavor to prove to them that you are not guilty of the heinous crimes that you are accused of, off-worlder.;[];;[23454, 23607];[23452];man26_selarb;
I don't need anyone to represent me!;[];;[23455];[23453, 23611, 23450, 23613];man26_selarb;
While it is true that you do have that right, I would recommend against it. Due to your confinement, you have not had much of a chance to build up evidence to pursue your case.;[];;[23456];[23454];man26_selarb;
Also, I do not believe you off-worlders truly understand the minds of we Selkath. It would be best if you left your defence up to me.;[];;[23457, 23607];[23455];man26_selarb;
How will you get me free?;[];;[23458];[23456, 23608, 23611];man26_selarb;
I would first like to ask you a few questions regarding the events that led up to your arrest.;[];;[23459];[23457, 23609];man26_selarb;
I have already been given all relevant data on you and your companions, so that can be disregarded. For what reason did you enter the Sith Embassy?;[];;[23460, 23604, 23605];[23458];man26_selarb;
I was invited.;[];;[23461, 23603];[23459];man26_selarb;
Indeed... That would explain the reason a passcard for entry was found on your person.;[]; if the player has the passcard;[23462];[23460];man26_selarb;
What is your prior association with the Sith?;[];;[23463, 23598, 23601];[23461, 23603, 23606];man26_selarb;
I have no prior association.;[];;[23464, 23597];[23462];man26_selarb;
Indeed... Since you have a passcard to their base, I can only assume you believe taking this route would lessen your sentence... Very well.;[];;[23465];[23463];man26_selarb;
That should be all the information I require of you, for now. If you wish, we can begin the trial whenever you are ready.;[];;[23466, 23470, 23585, 23591];[23464, 23597, 23600, 23602];man26_selarb;
Um... Don't you need to ask more questions?;[];;[23467];[23465];man26_selarb;
I have all the information I need. We should proceed now, the judges are waiting.;[];;[23468, 23470, 23585, 23591];[23466];man26_selarb;
How can you expect to defend me without getting more information?;[];;[23469];[23467];man26_selarb;
I think this trial is relatively straight forward. It should be obvious to the judges what has transpired.;[];;[23470, 23585, 23591];[23468];man26_selarb;
Let's get the trial started.;[];;[23471];[23469, 23467, 23465];man26_selarb;

How do you plead?;[];;[23475, 23571, 23578];[23473];man26_selarb;
Not guilty.;[];;[23476];[23474, 23579];man26_selarb;
Let the record show that this trial has commenced. Presiding are judges Shelkar...;[];;[23477];[23475, 23576];man26_selarb;
Jhosa...;[];;[23478];[23476];man26_selarb;

Kota...;[];;[23480];[23478];man26_selarb;
and Duula.;[];;[23481];[23479];man26_selarb;
This trial is to determine the culpability and punishment of this individual in the recent assault on the Sith Embassy.;[];;[23482];[23480];man26_selarb;
Given the severity of this trial, we can dispense with the normal formalities of the court and proceed directly.;[];;[23483];[23481];man26_selarb;
You have pleaded not guilty, yet there were reports of weaponsfire and detonations from within the Sith Embassy.;[];;[23484];[23482];man26_selarb;
You were seen entering and leaving the Embassy. The Sith have not conferred with the authorities about this matter, but from all available evidence, it would seem that you are the source of the disturbance.;[];;[23485];[23483];man26_selarb;
What is your explanation for being in the Sith Embassy?;[];;[23486, 23514, 23531, 23552, 23562, 23568];[23484];man26_selarb;
The Sith lured me inside.;[];;[23487];[23485, 23542, 23561, 23570];man26_selarb;
Indeed. I am most skeptical of this statement.;[];;[23488];[23486];man26_selarb;
But it may be true... How was it they lured you inside? What bait did they use?;[];;[23489, 23498, 23528];[23487];man26_selarb;
I was there for diplomatic negotiations.;[];;[23490];[23488, 23534, 23542];man26_selarb;
I am skeptical of this assertion... but it does seem in the character of the Sith to reneg on their commitments.;[];;[23491];[23489];man26_selarb;
There have been many provocations before this! Their character is well known!;[{'Judge Kota': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[23492];[23490];man26_selarb;
Indeed, but that is not an issue for outsiders to hear.;[];;[23493];[23491];man26_selarb;
We will adjourn to debate your story and the charges brought against you.;[];;[23494];[23492, 23504, 23471, 23588, 23594];man26_selarb;
We have reviewed your case and decided that there is not enough evidence to convict you of this crime.;[];;[23495];[23493, 23545];man26_selarb;
The provocations of the Sith are well known, and we will be issuing a memo of censure against them. Their Embassy is considered off-limits to all Ahto City Security personnel.;[];;[23496];[23494];man26_selarb;
No calls or incidents from their base will be attended to until this matter is dealt with, as they are no longer subject to the protections of Selkath law.;[];;[23497];[23495, 23520, 23549];man26_selarb;
You have been found innocent, and may leave as you desire. This trial is now over.;[];;[];[23496];man26_selarb;
They were secretly trying to lure me to the darkside.;[];;[23499];[23488];man26_selarb;
This mystical darkside you Jedi keep speaking of is a convenient excuse. Basically, they wished to hire you away from the Republic.;[];;[23500];[23498];man26_selarb;
How, then, did the fighting start?;[];;[23501, 23505, 23506];[23499];man26_selarb;
I refused and they attacked.;[];;[23502];[23500, 23530];man26_selarb;
Preposterous!;[{'Judge Duula': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[23503];[23501, 23505];man26_selarb;
That does sound like something the Sith would do...;[];;[23504];[23502];man26_selarb;
I am inclined to believe the off-worlder.;[];;[23493];[23503];man26_selarb;
They tried to double-cross me.;[];;[23502];[23500, 23530];man26_selarb;
I felt like showing them who was boss.;[];;[23507];[23500, 23530];man26_selarb;
You... attacked them?!;[{'Judge Jhosa': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[23508];[23506];man26_selarb;
I knew the off-worlder was a danger!;[{'Judge Naleshekan': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[23509];[23507];man26_selarb;
You have willfully and blatantly broken our laws, and for that you shall be sentenced accordingly!;[{'Judge Duula': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[23510, 23513, 23514, 23521];[23508, 23538, 23540, 23551, 23566];man26_selarb;
No! I am a Republic citizen!;[];;[23511];[23509];man26_selarb;
For the crimes you have committed against the Sith and against the laws of the Ahto City Civil Authority, this court finds no alternative: We hereby sentence you to death.;[];;[23512];[23510, 23513, 23574, 23471, 23588, 23594];man26_selarb;
You will be executed immediately. This court has spoken.;[];;[];[23511];man26_selarb;
I'm innocent!;[];;[23511];[23509];man26_selarb;
I have this datapad as proof that the Sith are up to no good!;[]; if the player has the Sith Master's datapad;[23515];[23509, 23555, 23485];man26_selarb;
Let it be noted that the court has taken this new evidence into consideration.;[];;[23516];[23514, 23471, 23588, 23594];man26_selarb;
Hm... This is... most disturbing.;[];;[23517];[23515];man26_selarb;
The court will adjourn for a brief period to verify this evidence and discuss its importance.;[];;[23518];[23516, 23559];man26_selarb;
We have verified that this is indeed a Sith datapad indicating their complicity in a plot to overthrow the lawful government of Manaan.;[];;[23519];[23517];man26_selarb;
In gratitude for having discovered this heinous offense, all charges against you regarding this incident will be dropped.;[];;[23520];[23518];man26_selarb;
Pending a suitable penalty against the Sith, their Embassy is considered off-limits to all Ahto City Security personnel.;[];;[23496];[23519];man26_selarb;
If you try to punish me, I'll let everyone know that the kolto is gone.;[]; if the player has already threatened the selkath;[23522];[23509, 23572];man26_selarb;
You wouldn't!;[{'Judge Duula': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[23523];[23521];man26_selarb;
I wouldn't doubt the human... they are known for these double-dealings...;[];;[23524];[23522];man26_selarb;
Kolto is the lifeblood of Manaan. Our entire economy and independence rests upon it. Now that it is gone we must maintain a perilous pact secrecy with your Republic.;[];;[23525];[23523];man26_selarb;
We can NOT afford to jeporadize that secrecy. Not for anything.;[];;[23526];[23524];man26_selarb;
If we allow you to leave, you are a threat and a liability to the Selkath people. Therefore we cannot.;[];;[23527];[23525];man26_selarb;
Your secret will die with you, off-worlder.;[];;[];[23526];man26_selarb;
They offered me a job.;[];;[23529];[23488];man26_selarb;
Offered you a job? To a Jedi?;[];;[23530];[23528];man26_selarb;
Unlikely... but possible. How then, did the fighting start?;[];;[23501, 23505, 23506];[23529];man26_selarb;
I was working for the Republic.;[];;[23532];[23485, 23561, 23570];man26_selarb;
You were working for the Republic? So the Republic had you break in and kill the Sith? It is as I suspected...;[];;[23533];[23531, 23567];man26_selarb;
Do not jump to conclusions.;[];;[23534];[23532];man26_selarb;
Why did the Republic have you enter the Sith Embassy?;[];;[23489, 23535, 23539, 23541];[23533];man26_selarb;
To steal information.;[];;[23536];[23534];man26_selarb;
You admit that you enetered the Sith base illegally and attempted to commit crimes there!;[{'Judge Naleshekan': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[23537];[23535];man26_selarb;
It is obvious that they tried to stop you and that you initiated hostilities!;[{'Judge Naleshekan': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[23538];[23536];man26_selarb;
So like an off-worlder...;[];;[23509];[23537];man26_selarb;
To retrieve data the Sith had stolen.;[];;[23540];[23534];man26_selarb;
One crime does not permit the use of another to set it right!;[];;[23509];[23539];man26_selarb;
To stop them from learning about the secret base by the Hrakert Rift.;[]; if the player has learned of the rift;[23542];[23534];man26_selarb;
It is good that you are looking out for the joint interests of the Republic and Manaan in this issue, but was is really necessary to take such extreme measures?;[];;[23486, 23489, 23543, 23550];[23541];man26_selarb;
They had almost found out about the station.;[];;[23544, 23546];[23542];man26_selarb;
The secret must be kept from the Sith, no matter the cost!;[{'Judge Kota': 'Talk_Forceful'}]; if the player has spoken about the hrakert rift already;[23545];[23543];man26_selarb;
Indeed. We will adjourn to discuss the situation and the charges brought against you.;[];;[23494];[23544];man26_selarb;
Station? What station?;[];;[23547];[23543];man26_selarb;
This is a internal matter for Selkath alone! We will adjourn immediately to discuss these things without the interference of outsiders!;[{'Judge Jhosa': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[23548];[23546];man26_selarb;
Upon review of this case, we find that there is no basis for a case against the defendant.;[];;[23549];[23547];man26_selarb;
Additionally, the Sith will receive a censure for provoking combat within Ahto City.;[];;[23496];[23548];man26_selarb;
They needed killing.;[];;[23551];[23542, 23564];man26_selarb;
You admit to your crime!;[{'Judge Naleshekan': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[23509];[23550];man26_selarb;
I was investigating the disappearances of young Selkath.;[]; if the player has been given the plot by Shaelas  if this option has not been selected already;[23553];[23485, 23564, 23570];man26_selarb;
You believe that the Sith have had something to do with those disappearance?;[];;[23554];[23552];man26_selarb;
The off-worlder has probably been listening to Shaelas and his rumor-mongering.;[];;[23555];[23553];man26_selarb;
Most likely. Do you have any proof to back up your assumption, human? Have the Sith been implicated?;[];;[23514, 23556, 23560];[23554];man26_selarb;
I found this token on a dead Selkath inside the Sith base.;[]; if the player has the token;[23557];[23555];man26_selarb;
I recognize that token! It is from Galas, one of the youths who went missing!;[{'Judge Kota': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[23558];[23556];man26_selarb;
You found that in their Embassy?!;[{'Judge Naleshekan': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[23559];[23557];man26_selarb;
The Sith HAVE been taking them!;[{'Judge Jhosa': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[23517];[23558];man26_selarb;
Er... well, no...;[];;[23561];[23555];man26_selarb;
You will need to come up with a better excuse than that, off-worlder!;[{'Judge Naleshekan': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[23486, 23531, 23562, 23568];[23560];man26_selarb;
I was killing Sith. See? Simple.;[];;[23563];[23561, 23570, 23485];man26_selarb;
See! I knew that the off-worlder was guilty! They all are!;[{'Judge Duula': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[23564];[23562];man26_selarb;
What... what possible reason could you have to justify your actions?;[];;[23550, 23552, 23565, 23567];[23563];man26_selarb;
The Sith are a blight upon the galaxy!;[];;[23566];[23564];man26_selarb;
That does not excuse your actions! The neutrality and laws of Manaan WILL be upheld!;[{'Judge Duula': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[23509];[23565];man26_selarb;
The Republic ordered me to go into their base.;[];;[23532];[23564];man26_selarb;
It was just a coincidence.;[];;[23569];[23561, 23485];man26_selarb;
You were clearly seen entering the Sith base. You cannot deny this fact!;[{'Judge Naleshekan': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[23570];[23568];man26_selarb;
You must have had some reason for entering. What was it, human?;[];;[23486, 23531, 23552, 23562];[23569];man26_selarb;
Guilty.;[];;[23572];[23474, 23579];man26_selarb;
You... You are guilty? You admit to your crime?;[];;[23521, 23573, 23575, 23577];[23571];man26_selarb;
Yes.;[];;[23574];[23572];man26_selarb;
Well... Then I suppose we have no choice but to sentence you for your crimes.;[];;[23511];[23573, 23577];man26_selarb;
Er... no... I was just kidding.;[];;[23576];[23572];man26_selarb;
This court will not be mocked!;[{'Judge Naleshekan': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[23476];[23575];man26_selarb;
It was a lot of fun, really.;[];;[23574];[23572];man26_selarb;
I don't plead! I tell!;[];;[23579];[23474];man26_selarb;
We will not tolerate insolence! You will obey the rules of our court, or you will be summarily found guilty!;[{'Judge Naleshekan': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[23475, 23571];[23578];man26_selarb;
"The Sith have been using and manipulating the young among our race; we know this. It is up to us to decide what actions we should take, not vigilante justice by some human.";[]; player has saved the selkath youths (talked to shaelas);[23473];[23471, 23588, 23594];man26_selarb;
While you have proven the Sith to manipulative and deceitful in their activities here on Manaan, I believe you will have a much harder time defending your actions now. Some things go too far, off-worlder.;[]; player has saved sunry and sith blamed;[23473];[23471, 23588, 23594];man26_selarb;
The familiarity you gained in your successful defence of Sunry will aid you here, human. But the charges you are faced with are far more grave.;[]; player has saved sunry;[23473];[23471, 23588, 23594];man26_selarb;
Your past experience as Arbiter in the Sunry case may aid in your defence now, human, but you must do a better job yourself, given the crimes you are faced with.;[]; player has failed to save sunry;[23473];[23471, 23588, 23594];man26_selarb;
While your high standing among the off-worlders on Manaan may bring you some leniency from them, being a successful swoop rider brings you no credit here, human.;[]; player is a famous swoop rider;[23473];[23471, 23588, 23594];man26_selarb;
I think I'd rather represent myself.;[];;[23586];[23469, 23467, 23465];man26_selarb;
While that is your right, I strongly recommend against it. I am versed in all the necessary particulars of this case and Selkath law, off-worlder. You would do well to heed my advice.;[];;[23587, 23589, 23590];[23585];man26_selarb;
No, I'll represent myself.;[];;[23588];[23586];man26_selarb;
You off-worlders are not known for your mental prowess. I shall leave your demise up to you.;[];;[23472, 23473, 23493, 23511, 23515, 23580, 23581, 23582, 23583, 23584];[23587, 23590];man26_selarb;
Fine, represent me.;[];;[23471];[23586];man26_selarb;
I said no, fish-head!;[];;[23588];[23586];man26_selarb;
I have proof that the Sith are evil.;[]; if the player has the Sith Master's datapad;[23592];[23469, 23467, 23465];man26_selarb;
Indeed? And what is that?;[];;[23593, 23595];[23591];man26_selarb;
This datapad proving they are kidnapping young Selkath.;[];;[23594];[23592, 23596];man26_selarb;
This is most... disturbing. We should take this evidence and present it before the court right away.;[];;[23472, 23473, 23493, 23511, 23515, 23580, 23581, 23582, 23583, 23584];[23593];man26_selarb;
I'll show it to the judges, or no one!;[];;[23596];[23592];man26_selarb;
You must share the evidence with me before I can release you and we can proceed to the courtroom.;[];;[23593];[23595];man26_selarb;
I am skeptical of that, as will be the judges. You off-worlders tend to congregate much amongst yourself. I see no inherent differences between your two groups.;[];;[23465];[23463];man26_selarb;
I'm on a mission to stop them from taking over the galaxy.;[];;[23599];[23462];man26_selarb;
The Sith are an expansionistic power, true, and at war with the Republic. You may make it your personal mission to foil them, but the authorities take a dim view of it taking place here.;[];;[23600];[23598];man26_selarb;
I think you will need a more thorough explanation in order to convince the judges.;[];;[23465];[23599];man26_selarb;
I kill them wherever I can find them.;[];;[23602];[23462];man26_selarb;
I am... humbled by your candor. While I'm sure that you yourself see that as a noble sentiment, I doubt that those assigning your sentence will be so generous.;[];;[23465];[23601];man26_selarb;
Indeed. I find that unlikely, off-worlder, but perhaps the judges will be more sympathetic to your view.;[];;[23462];[23460, 23604];man26_selarb;
I had authorization to enter.;[];;[23603];[23459];man26_selarb;
I... er... broke in.;[];;[23606];[23459];man26_selarb;
Illegal acts seem to be a common occurance among you off-worlders. I am not terribly surprised by your actions, but the judges will want to hear a little more convincing reason.;[];;[23462];[23605];man26_selarb;
What have I been charged with?;[];;[23608];[23456, 23453, 23450, 23613];man26_selarb;
You have been charged with initiating violence within the Sith Embassy, murdering members of the Ambassadorial Commission of the Sith Empire, and disregarding our own laws regarding violence in Ahto City.;[];;[23457, 23609, 23610];[23607];man26_selarb;
What can I do?;[];;[23458];[23608, 23611];man26_selarb;
It's all the Sith's fault!;[];;[23611];[23608];man26_selarb;
Be that as it may, I doubt the judges share your view. I will endeavor, however, to make them see your point, off-worlder.;[];;[23454, 23457, 23609];[23610];man26_selarb;
Get me out of here!;[];;[23613];[23450];man26_selarb;

Grow some gills and swim the planet yourself. There's no substitute for personal experience. I have nothing else to say on the subject.;[];;[23619, 23630, 23637];[23628];man26_sithswp2;NM26ABSITH14018_.mp3

A pity we can't test the theory now.;[];;[23633];[23631];man26_sithswp2;
Yes, Manaan is a very unsatisfying world for settling disagreements. The Selkath are very insistant that even words are not used as weapons.;[];;[23634];[23632];man26_sithswp2;NM26ABSITH14024_.mp3

The tracking device reported back to us that you had been captured by the Leviathan. Once we had that information, we began digging into our sources within the Sith fleet.;[];;[23673, 23693];[23671];k_hziagrom_dlg;
Sources? What sources?;[];;[23674];[23672];k_hziagrom_dlg;
There are millions of soldiers in the Sith fleet. Surely you aren't surprised that some of them will sell information? Even high ranking officers aren't immune to the lure of easy credits.;[];;[23675];[23673];k_hziagrom_dlg;
Your escapades on the Leviathan created quite a stir in the Sith fleet. Of course Malak tried to suppress the truth about your identity: there were more than a few summary executions.;[];;[23676];[23674, 23693];k_hziagrom_dlg;
But even if security footage is destroyed and witnesses silenced, some bits of information always slip through. Spend enough credits to gather the tiny pieces and the puzzle becomes clear.;[];;[23677];[23675];k_hziagrom_dlg;
We know what happened on the Leviathan. At least, we know enough. You are Darth Revan, and you are going to kill Malak for daring to claim dominion over the Sith.;[];;[23678, 23691];[23676];k_hziagrom_dlg;
How does this involve you?;[];;[23679];[23677];k_hziagrom_dlg;
My partner and I deal in very rare and powerful items. Weapons, armor: things you could use in your battles against Malak and the Sith.;[];;[23680, 23690];[23678, 23692];k_hziagrom_dlg;
And you're just going to give these items to me?;[];;[23681];[23679];k_hziagrom_dlg;
I don't carry these items with me, of course. They're with my partner. But they're yours, if you've got the credits to buy them. We do want to make a profit on this, after all.;[];;[23682, 23688];[23680, 23690];k_hziagrom_dlg;
Just go to the Cantina here in Dreshdae. There's a Rodian there named Mika Dorin. Tell Mika that Ziagrom sent you to look at the premium items.;[];;[23683, 23686];[23681];k_hziagrom_dlg;
I'll go check it out.;[];;[23684];[23682];k_hziagrom_dlg;
Mika already knows to expect you. Like I said, just tell him you want to look at the premium items.;[];;[23685];[23683, 23687, 23689];k_hziagrom_dlg;
I guess my work here is done. Goodbye, Revan. And once Malak is beaten, don't forget who helped you to victory.;[];;[];[23684];k_hziagrom_dlg;
I can't be bothered with this.;[];;[23687];[23682, 23688];k_hziagrom_dlg;
It's up to you, I guess. But you'll be missing out on the best equipment in the galaxy! Sooner or later you'll realize this deal is to good to pass up.;[];;[23684];[23686];k_hziagrom_dlg;
Just go to the Dreshdae Cantina on Korriban. There's a Rodian in there named Mika Dorin. Tell Mika that Ziagrom sent you to look at the premium items.;[];;[23686, 23689];[23681];k_hziagrom_dlg;
I'll check it out next time on Korriban.;[];;[23684];[23688];k_hziagrom_dlg;
Let me see these items.;[];;[23681];[23679];k_hziagrom_dlg;
You're wrong. I'm not in this for revenge.;[];;[23692];[23677];k_hziagrom_dlg;
Maybe, maybe not. But whatever your motivation may be, you *do* intend to stop Malak and his followers - of that we are sure. And we want to help.;[];;[23679];[23691];k_hziagrom_dlg;
Go on.;[];;[23675];[23672];k_hziagrom_dlg;
So why are you approaching me now?;[];;[23671];[23669];k_hziagrom_dlg;
Who are you?;[];;[23665];[23663, 23697, 23699, 23701, 23661, 23703];k_hziagrom_dlg;
If you tell anyone who I am, I'll kill you!;[];;[23697];[23663, 23703];k_hziagrom_dlg;
Your secret is safe with me, Lord Revan. At least until you chose to reveal yourself. But I have come here with an offer of aid. I want to help you defeat your old apprentice.;[];;[23664, 23695];[23696];k_hziagrom_dlg;
I'm not Revan anymore.;[];;[23699];[23663, 23703];k_hziagrom_dlg;
You are what you are, human. You cannot deny that you were once the Lord of the Sith. And you cannot deny that you wish to defeat Malak!;[];;[23664, 23695];[23698];k_hziagrom_dlg;
*I* am the Dark Lord of the Sith!;[];;[23701];[23661];k_hziagrom_dlg;
Yes, human. I know. That is why I have approached you.;[];;[23664, 23695];[23700];k_hziagrom_dlg;
I don't have time for this!;[];;[23703];[23661];k_hziagrom_dlg;
Please, human - this is of importance to us both! I know who you are... Revan!;[];;[23664, 23695, 23696, 23698];[23702];k_hziagrom_dlg;

Hello again. Welcom back to Eli Gand's outpost, now under new management. What do you need?;[];;[23707, 23709, 23728];[None];kas22_dasol_01;NM22AADASO07002_.mp3
Let's see what you have for sale.;[];;[23708];[23706];kas22_dasol_01;
Right you are.;[];;[];[23707, 23718, 23727];kas22_dasol_01;NM22AADASO07004_.mp3
You're still here? I'd never be so forgiving.;[];;[23710];[23706];kas22_dasol_01;
What do you mean? I don't need to go hunting Eli's family or anything. I've seen justice done.;[{'Matton Dasol': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[23711, 23723, 23725, 23727];[23709, 23734];kas22_dasol_01;NM22AADASO07018_.mp3
[Persuade] It's not enough. This store was his life. Let it rot.;[];;[23712, 23717];[23710];kas22_dasol_01;
[Success] You know, maybe you're right. Why should I bother with this remote hole? This isn't the life I wanted.;[];;[23713];[23711];kas22_dasol_01;NM22AADASO07020_.mp3
I see your point. I'll leave his shop like his corpse. I'll take what I want, buy passage on a ship, and never look back except to spit.;[{'Matton Dasol': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[23714];[23712, 23726];kas22_dasol_01;NM22AADASO07021_.mp3
Here, take this. Thanks for reminding me about how he misused my trust. I'll make sure it never happens again. With anyone.;[];Give player reward of some sort. More than just credits in the good path.;[23715, 23716];[23713];kas22_dasol_01;NM22AADASO07022_.mp3
You have taken a good and honest man and twisted him into a bitter, hateful creature. You must be so proud of yourself.;[];;[23716];[23714];kas22_dasol_01;NM22AADASO07058_.mp3
Feeding this man's hatred is an act of malice and petty evil. The Council would not approve of your actions here, and neither do I.;[];;[];[23715, 23714];kas22_dasol_01;NM22AADASO07059_.mp3
[Failure] I'd rather move on, you know? I don't want to be mad about this for the rest of my life. I can make this work.;[];;[23718, 23720, 23723];[23711, 23725];kas22_dasol_01;NM22AADASO07023_.mp3
In that case, let's see what's for sale.;[];;[23708, 23719];[23717, 23733];kas22_dasol_01;
All right then. Actually, I feel I owe you something. Here, take a few credits. If you spend it here, all the better. I think things are looking up.;[];Give player some credits;[];[23718, 23727];kas22_dasol_01;NM22AADASO07013_.mp3
Sounds like a boring choice to me. Goodbye.;[];;[23721, 23722];[23717, 23733];kas22_dasol_01;
Safe flying to you. Hope to see you again.;[];;[];[23720, 23722, 23723, 23724, 23728, 23736];kas22_dasol_01;NM22AADASO07016_.mp3
Well, that's your opinion, I guess, but I still owe you for helping me. Here, take a few credits with you. Spend them here, if you like.;[];Give player some credits;[23721];[23720];kas22_dasol_01;NM22AADASO07015_.mp3
Never mind. Goodbye.;[];;[23721, 23724];[23717, 23710];kas22_dasol_01;
All right then. Here, I should toss you a few credits for helping. I appreciate what you did.;[];give player credits.;[23721];[23723];kas22_dasol_01;NM22AADASO07028_.mp3
[Force Persuade] Remember your hatred. Don't trap yourself here.;[];;[23717, 23726];[23710];kas22_dasol_01;
[Success] Working here when I was trapped was hell enough. Staying here now is just foolish. I don't want to be seen as weak.;[{'Player': 'Persuade'}];;[23713];[23725];kas22_dasol_01;NM22AADASO07025_.mp3
Fine, fine. Just show me what's for sale.;[];;[23708, 23719];[23710];kas22_dasol_01;
I don't want anything right now, thanks.;[];;[23721];[23706];kas22_dasol_01;
That Thaylian bog-slime. Do you know that I have been here 36 days, slaving to pay a debt in good faith?;[{'Matton Dasol': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[23730, 23741];[None];kas22_dasol_01;NM22AADASO07007_.mp3
All for nothing. He killed my crew... who knows where my ship is. Well, there's your pay, Eli. Blaster fire, and keep the change.;[{'Matton Dasol': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[23731, 23737, 23739];[23729];kas22_dasol_01;NM22AADASO07008_.mp3
I suppose that closes his little outpost here.;[];;[23732];[23730, 23740, 23745];kas22_dasol_01;
I suppose it does, though maybe I should keep it up for a while on my own. I've no ship at the moment anyway.;[];;[23733];[23731];kas22_dasol_01;NM22AADASO07010_.mp3
It'll probably take a while to convince Eli's suppliers that I'm the new boss, but eventually I'll buy my way off this rock.;[];;[23718, 23720, 23734, 23735];[23732, 23738];kas22_dasol_01;NM22AADASO07011_.mp3
If it were me, I'd wipe out all memory of him.;[];;[23710];[23733];kas22_dasol_01;
And you won't owe anyone a single credit. Good luck.;[];;[23736];[23733];kas22_dasol_01;
That's the idea. Actually, I should toss you a few credits for helping me out. Take them... maybe even spend them here.;[];Give player some credits;[23721];[23735];kas22_dasol_01;NM22AADASO07030_.mp3
What will you do now?;[];;[23738];[23730, 23740, 23745];kas22_dasol_01;
Well, there's not much for me to do but stay here. I've no ship, so I may as well make a few credits.;[];;[23733];[23737, 23746];kas22_dasol_01;NM22AADASO07032_.mp3
Did you have to kill him?;[];;[23740];[23730];kas22_dasol_01;
What did you expect I'd do? Besides, he'd have killed me. He couldn't have risked me telling everyone he was a cheat. He'd have no business.;[];;[23731, 23737];[23739];kas22_dasol_01;NM22AADASO07035_.mp3
He won't last long hiding in the Shadowlands.;[];;[23742, 23743, 23744, 23745];[23729];kas22_dasol_01;
I have to admit, I'm surprised you let him get away. I don't know if I could have been as forgiving.;[];;[23743, 23744, 23745];[23741];kas22_dasol_01;NM22AADASO07060_.mp3
I will never understand you meatbags. He cheated you and killed your friends, but you didn't terminate him when you had the chance.;[];;[23744, 23745];[23742, 23741];kas22_dasol_01;NM22AADASO07061_.mp3

Well, I could have shot out his legs and let him crawl around for a while, but I consider this far more merciful.;[];;[23731, 23737, 23746];[23744, 23743, 23742, 23741];kas22_dasol_01;NM22AADASO07034_.mp3

Greetings to you. Something I can get for you?;[];;[23748];[None];kas22_dasol_01;NM22AADASO07036_.mp3
Kindly direct your inquiries to me. Matton is merely an indebted employee. His opinions don't amount to much.;[];;[];[23747];kas22_dasol_01;NM22AADASO07037_.mp3
I think you'd better talk to Eli directly. He's the boss... for the time being.;[];;[];[None];kas22_dasol_01;NM22AADASO07038_.mp3

See, back when more people raced, I lost lots more. Now, I win pretty good. I like winning. You maybe shouldn't mess it up.;[];;[23754];[23752];man26_hukta;
So I says this, and you listen good. You don't win the Sector Champion race. If you win, maybe something bad happens to you.;[];;[23755, 23765, 23768];[23753];man26_hukta;
Can't we come to an agreement?;[];;[23756];[23754];man26_hukta;
Sure, you can agree with me. That's the only way this is gonna work, you understand? You do like I say, and you don't get hurt.;[];;[23757, 23759, 23761, 23763];[23755];man26_hukta;
I will race, and I will win.;[];;[23758];[23756, 23767, 23770, 23771];man26_hukta;
Then you and Hukta Jax are gonna have problems, I promise you that. You was warned, fair and square.;[];;[];[23757];man26_hukta;
I don't want any trouble...;[];;[23760];[23756, 23767, 23770, 23771];man26_hukta;
Then you is smarter than you look. I likes it when people are reasonable. Just stay away from the track.;[];;[];[23759];man26_hukta;
I'll think about what you said.;[];;[23762];[23756, 23767, 23770, 23771];man26_hukta;
Sure, you think. While you do that, stay away from the course. I's can make things very bad for you.;[];;[];[23761];man26_hukta;
Try anything and you'll end up dead!;[];;[23764];[23756, 23767, 23770, 23771];man26_hukta;
Maybe you end up dead first. Maybe it will be painful, too. I don't like when people don't do what they should. You win and you get hurt.;[];;[];[23763];man26_hukta;
You'd never get away with it. Cameras are everywhere.;[];;[23766];[23754];man26_hukta;
I am too smart to do something out in the open. Selkath gots cameras all over, and they lock everyone up without questions.;[];;[23767];[23765];man26_hukta;
No, I would find you when you don't know it's coming, where no cameras are. You win Sector Champion race, and I hurt you.;[];;[23757, 23759, 23761, 23763];[23766];man26_hukta;
You'd regret threatening me, piggie.;[];;[23769];[23754];man26_hukta;
I already did it, and I don't regret nothing. You don't know how much I like to race. You don't know what I can do.;[];;[23770];[23768];man26_hukta;

The war sows fear and confusion, people are lost. They want guidance, direction. They have questions, and they want answers. That is why I am here... I too seek answers.;[];;[24034, 24036, 24128];[24032];man26_hulas;
Answers? Answers to what?;[];;[24035];[24033];man26_hulas;

Who are you?;[];;[24037];[24035, 24033];man26_hulas;
A name? There is power in names, yet in the end a name alone means less than nothing. I am Hulas, a traveler from the world of Duro. And what is your name, human?;[];;[24038, 24145, 24149];[24036];man26_hulas;
Senni Vek gave me a message to see you.;[];;[24039, 24111];[24037, 24117, 24146, 24283];man26_hulas;
Senni did not think you would come, but I knew better, <FullName>. It is good that you have come alone, for if you ever come with others I will not speak to you of these things.;[];;[24040];[24038];man26_hulas;
I am Hulas of the Genoharadan - a secret society of bounty hunters. For a thousand generations we have existed, but always hidden beneath an impenetrable veil.;[];;[24041];[24039];man26_hulas;
I've never heard of you.;[];;[24042];[24040];man26_hulas;
Few ever have. We are shadow, darkness and night. We are less than a whisper or a thought. We have managed to keep our existence a secret far longer than most could ever imagine.;[];;[24043];[24041];man26_hulas;
If you are ever foolish enough to tell anyone about this meeting or the Genoharadan's existence, they would not believe you. They would probably think you were paranoid, or mentally unstable.;[];;[24044];[24042];man26_hulas;
Not even those closest to you can know we have approached you. If you ever speak to me around any of your companions, I will not discuss the Genoharadan. Do you understand, <FullName>?;[];;[24045, 24105];[24043];man26_hulas;
I understand.;[];;[24046];[24044];man26_hulas;
I believe you speak the truth, <FullName>. But remember this: if you ever betray us, this opportunity will be lost forever.;[];;[24047];[24045];man26_hulas;
Few among the galaxy have ever heard of the Genoharadan. They never see us, never know we are there. They do not even know we exist.;[];;[24048];[24046];man26_hulas;
If you do not follow our rules, we will vanish and you will be like all the others. You will never see us again. We will be nothing but a figment of your imagination.;[];;[24049];[24047];man26_hulas;
But if you swear to keep the secrets of our order, you will learn of a forbidden society known only to a handful throughout the galaxy.;[];;[24050, 24099];[24048];man26_hulas;
I will preserve the secrecy of your order.;[];;[24051];[24049];man26_hulas;
Excellent, <FullName>. We have high hopes for you within the guild... if you prove yourself worthy. Listen closely and I will give you a first glimpse into our secret world.;[];;[24052];[24050, 24109];man26_hulas;
We Genoharadan are an ancient guild of elite bounty hunters. For thousands of years we have been at work throughout the galaxy, eliminating our targets in near total secrecy.;[];;[24053, 24099];[24051];man26_hulas;
How does anybody hire you if nobody knows you exist?;[];;[24054];[24052];man26_hulas;
In the highest corridors of power a handful of people know we exist, and how to contact us. Of course, these people are smart enough to keep this knowledge a carefully guarded secret.;[];;[24055];[24053];man26_hulas;
And on very rare occasions, when we are seeking new clients, one of our guild-masters will approach a powerful political figure and offer our services when the time is ripe.;[];;[24056, 24099, 24104];[24054];man26_hulas;
You're nothing but common assassins!;[];;[24057];[24055];man26_hulas;
The Genoharadan are far from common! Even Calo Nord hadn't proven himself worthy of joining our guild, though he was getting close. Until he met you, that is.;[];;[24058];[24056];man26_hulas;
By killing Calo Nord, you have shown you have great potential. The Genoharadan could use someone like you, if you are willing. And your work for us could be of great aid to the Republic.;[];;[24059, 24102, 24103];[24057, 24104];man26_hulas;
How will killing innocent people help the Republic?;[];;[24060];[24058];man26_hulas;
Innocent people? Our victims are far from innocent, and the Genoharadan will only accept a contract if the target's death suits our greater goals - goals that often match those of the Republic.;[];;[24061];[24059];man26_hulas;
The Genoharadan have a vested interest in preserving the Republic. It is the perfect cover for our work. We operate behind the scenes, manipulating events through subtle machinations.;[];;[24062];[24060, 24102, 24103];man26_hulas;
Do you think the Republic has persisted for 15,000 years by mere accident? If not for our influence - distasteful as our methods may be to some - the Republic would have collapsed long ago!;[];;[24063];[24061];man26_hulas;
We understand the bureaucracy of the Republic, we have learned how to alter the course of political events under the existing regime. We have no wish to see the Republic fall.;[];;[24064, 24067, 24099, 24101];[24062];man26_hulas;
This is a little hard to believe.;[];;[24065];[24063];man26_hulas;
That is one of the reasons our existence has remained secret for so long. Nobody wants to believe in a secret society manipulating and controlling events on a grand scale.;[];;[24066];[24064];man26_hulas;
Rumors and hints of our existence are dismissed as paranoid fantasies. But we do exist, <FullName>. And we have come to ask you to join us.;[];;[24067, 24099, 24101];[24065];man26_hulas;
Why would I want to join you?;[];;[24068];[24066, 24063];man26_hulas;
As I said earlier, your efforts here will help the Republic. And by aiding us you will earn the right to join an exclusive organization with the power to alter the very course of galactic history.;[];;[24069];[24067, 24101];man26_hulas;
And of course there is the simplest reason of all: the Genoharadan reward their agents very, very well.;[];;[24070, 24099];[24068];man26_hulas;
Okay, what do I have to do to join?;[];;[24071];[24069];man26_hulas;
As you can imagine, joining the Genoharadan is not a simple process. To begin, we will need proof of your loyalty and your competence.;[];;[24072];[24070];man26_hulas;
When you feel you are ready, I will give you a task: a target who must be eliminated. Of course you will have to come alone whenever you wish to discuss Genoharadan business.;[];;[24073, 24097];[24071];man26_hulas;
I'm ready to prove myself worthy of the Genoharadan.;[];;[24074];[24072, 24282];man26_hulas;
Killing Calo Nord was an impressive display of your skills, but there is more to the Genoharadan than mere killing. To preserve the secrecy of our order our agents must be discrete.;[];;[24075];[24073];man26_hulas;
You must be able to find and eliminate a target without drawing undo attention. You can never mention your assignments to others - not even your closest allies.;[];;[24076];[24074];man26_hulas;
Also, you cannot ask people for information about your target. You must complete your mission using only the information I will provide.;[];;[24077, 24095];[24075];man26_hulas;
I understand. Who is my target?;[];;[24078, 24094];[24076, 24096];man26_hulas;
Your first mission is a simple one: eliminate a Rodian anti-Republic terrorist named Lorgal.;[];;[24079];[24077];man26_hulas;
Tell me about Lorgal.;[];;[24080];[24078, 24088, 24094];man26_hulas;
Lorgal is a radical who wants to destroy the Republic through terrorist acts. He is responsible for over two dozen bombings, leaving hundreds of civilians dead.;[];;[24081];[24079];man26_hulas;
He was recently captured and is being held prisoner in the Republic base here on Manaan awaiting transport to Coruscant for trial - and a chance to publicly voice his radical beliefs.;[];;[24082];[24080];man26_hulas;
We do not want to give him that chance. You must find a way to kill him before he leaves for Coruscant, but you must be subtle. It must look like an accident or an unexplainable death.;[];;[24083];[24081];man26_hulas;
The Republic would be glad to get rid of Lorgal, so they won't investigate his death closely. As long as he isn't struck down by a weapon in his cell, the Genoharadan will be satisfied.;[];;[24084, 24089];[24082];man26_hulas;
Tell me about Zuulan Sentar.;[];;[24085];[24083, 24094];man26_hulas;
Zuulan was a common inter-galactic slaver who tried to kidnap the daughter of a Coruscant Senator. He failed and the girl was recovered, but Zuulan himself escaped.;[];;[24086];[24084];man26_hulas;
He will probably try another similar kidnapping soon. If he succeeds, he might ransom his victim in exchange for dangerous political secrets that could threaten the Republic itself.;[];;[24087];[24085];man26_hulas;
The Genoharadan want to eliminate him before this happens. Our latest information places Zuulan on Dantooine - he often sells illicit goods to the wealthy settlers of that world.;[];;[24088];[24086];man26_hulas;
His land speeder was spotted near one of the settler's estates on Dantooine. Zuulan rarely strays far from his speeder in case he needs to make a quick escape. You should look for him there.;[];;[24079, 24089];[24087];man26_hulas;
Is there anything else?;[];;[24090, 24092];[24088, 24083, 24188, 24180, 24174, 24168];man26_hulas;
Remember - tell no one about this. If there are others with you when you confront Lorgal, make it seem as if you are acting on behalf of the Republic, not the Genoharadan.;[];;[24091];[24089];man26_hulas;
That is all for now. Return to me when Lorgal is dead and you will be suitably rewarded.;[];;[];[24090];man26_hulas;
Remember - tell no one about this. If there are others with you when you confront Zuulan or Lorgal, make it seem as if you are acting on behalf of the Republic, not the Genoharadan.;[];;[24093];[24089];man26_hulas;
That is all for now. Return to me when either Lorgal or Zuulan is dead and I will reward you. If you wish to complete both missions, feel free. You will be suitably rewarded for each.;[];;[];[24092];man26_hulas;
We will begin with something simple. Your first mission is to eliminate either of two targets: a Gran slaver named Zuulan Sentar or a Rodian anti-Republic terrorrist named Lorgal.;[];;[24079, 24084];[24077];man26_hulas;
What happens if I tell someone about this?;[];;[24096];[24076];man26_hulas;
They wouldn't believe you. They might even think you are insane. Telling anyone about the Genoharadan would be pointless: we are very good at hiding any proof of our existence.;[];;[24077];[24095];man26_hulas;
I'll be back later.;[];;[24098];[24072, 24274, 24269, 24264, 24250, 24246, 24238, 24196, 24162, 24282];man26_hulas;
I will be waiting here for you, <FullName>. The Genoharadan are eager to see the extent of your abilities.;[];;[];[24097];man26_hulas;
I've changed my mind. I don't want to be a part of this.;[];;[24100];[24069, 24066, 24063, 24055, 24052, 24049];man26_hulas;
As you wish. Then this is the last you will see of me, or any of the Genoharadan. Farewell, <FullName>.;[];;[];[24099, 24110];man26_hulas;
What's in this for me?;[];;[24068];[24066, 24063];man26_hulas;
Why would the Genoharadan protect the Republic?;[];;[24061];[24058];man26_hulas;
Are you saying you serve the Republic?;[];;[24061];[24058];man26_hulas;
What does this have to do with me?;[];;[24058];[24055];man26_hulas;
You can't impose your rules on me!;[];;[24106];[24044];man26_hulas;
If you do not comply, then this opportunity will be lost. Most people have never heard of the Genoharadan. They never see us, never know we are there, do not even know we exist.;[];;[24107];[24105];man26_hulas;
If you do not follow our rules, I will leave and you will be like the others. You will never see us again. The Genoharadan will be nothing but a figment of your imagination.;[];;[24108];[24106];man26_hulas;
If you swear to keep our existence a secret you will learn of a a forbidden soceity known only to a handful throughout the galaxy. If not, we will simply vanish. The choice is yours.;[];;[24109, 24110];[24107];man26_hulas;
Very well, I'll keep your secret.;[];;[24051];[24108];man26_hulas;
Forget it.;[];;[24100];[24108];man26_hulas;
Senni Vek? This name means nothing to me. Are you certain this person told you and your companions to come and see me? That is very strange.;[];;[24112];[24038];man26_hulas;
Obviously there must be some mistake. Or maybe this is a joke. I doubt anyone named 'Senni Vek' told you to bring your companions and come speak with me.;[];;[24113, 24116, 24128];[24111];man26_hulas;
He gave me this datapad. It mentions the Genoharadan.;[];;[24114];[24112];man26_hulas;
Genoharadan? That word means nothing to me. If you want to speak like a fool, you should at least have the sense not to do it in front of others.;[];;[24115];[24113, 24286];man26_hulas;
I believe we should end this discussion, before you embarrass yourself further in front of your friends.;[];;[];[24114];man26_hulas;
Never mind. I want to ask you some other questions.;[];;[24117];[24112];man26_hulas;
I will do my best to answer them, though I am only recently arrived to this world. Many of your questions would be better answered by others, I'm sure.;[];;[24038, 24118, 24128, 24130, 24134, 24141];[24116, 24127, 24147];man26_hulas;
What are you doing here on Manaan?;[];;[24119];[24117, 24133, 24144];man26_hulas;
I am an observer, a seeker of answers. The Sith and Republic vie for control of the galaxy, and I am anxious to know as much as I can about the eventual victor.;[];;[24120];[24118];man26_hulas;
On Manaan, I can observe both parties in relative safety. The Sith and the Republic co-exist here, unlike anywhere else in the galaxy. Here I watch, and study, and learn.;[];;[24121, 24127, 24128];[24119];man26_hulas;
You're a spy!;[];;[24122];[24120];man26_hulas;
No, a spy is a stealer of hidden secrets. A spy slinks in the shadows and gains entrance to forbidden rooms. I am only a simple observer.;[];;[24123];[24121];man26_hulas;
I watch the Sith on this world. I watch the Republic. I watch the Selkath. I see how they act and react and I can draw conclusions about their true natures. I see what drives them.;[];;[24124];[24122];man26_hulas;
And when an ultimate victor emerges from this war, I will know them better than they know themselves. This will give me power: the power to survive and thrive no matter what events may come.;[];;[24125, 24127, 24128];[24123];man26_hulas;
So that's all you do? Sit and watch?;[];;[24126];[24124];man26_hulas;
Sit. Watch. Study. Learn. Wait. For now, that is all. I gather knowledge and I wait for a day when this knowledge will serve me well.;[];;[24127, 24128];[24125];man26_hulas;
I want to ask you some more questions.;[];;[24117];[24126, 24124, 24120, 24140, 24137];man26_hulas;
I'll be going now.;[];;[24129];[24126, 24124, 24120, 24140, 24137, 24144, 24133, 24117, 24112, 24035, 24033, 24030, 24283];man26_hulas;
And so you leave, perhaps to return. Perhaps not. Yet I will remain here, for my work is not done.;[];;[];[24128, 24148];man26_hulas;
What can you tell me about the Republic here on Manaan?;[];;[24131];[24117, 24144];man26_hulas;
The Republic comes to Manaan with offers of alliance, but the Selkath are wary. They have no wish to join the Republic, given recent history.;[];;[24132];[24130];man26_hulas;
The Republic say they protect the galaxy, but they have seen much war: Exar Kun, the Mandalorians, the Sith. Why does the Republic breed so many enemies?;[];;[24133];[24131];man26_hulas;
Until they know the answer, the Selkath will not join. They have no wish to make the Republic's many enemies their own. More than this I cannot say.;[];;[24118, 24128, 24134, 24141];[24132];man26_hulas;
Do you know anything about the Sith here on Manaan?;[];;[24135];[24133, 24144, 24117];man26_hulas;
War is the tool of empire building. The Sith conquer world after world, taking resources as they want. They came to Manaan to plunder the most valuable resource of all - Kolto.;[];;[24136];[24134];man26_hulas;
But Manaan is different, it is difficult to conquer. If the Sith attack the Selkath can slip away to safety far below the oceans. They can hoard their Kolto - or give it to the Republic.;[];;[24137];[24135];man26_hulas;
So Manaan gives us a glimpse of how the Sith will react should they win this war. Here the Sith must use diplomacy and negotiation: tools they will need to maintain their empire.;[];;[24127, 24128, 24138];[24136];man26_hulas;
The Sith don't negotiate. They'll use brute force to maintain control.;[];;[24139];[24137];man26_hulas;
They might try, but an army can only build an empire, not sustain it. Rebellions, insurrections - in time the weight of the Sith's own policies would bring them down.;[];;[24140];[24138];man26_hulas;
It may take a century, or two, or even three. But eventually the Sith will learn diplomacy or their Empire will fall.;[];;[24127, 24128];[24139];man26_hulas;
What do you know about the Selkath?;[];;[24142];[24133, 24117];man26_hulas;
The Selkath are a species of secrets. They invite both the Sith and the Republic to their world, but welcome neither. They keep their true allegiance close to the vest.;[];;[24143];[24141];man26_hulas;
They hide their true numbers in great cities beneath the ocean that no off-worlder will ever see. They guard the secret of Kolto - where it is made, how it is made.;[];;[24144];[24142];man26_hulas;
The Selkath are a great mystery. To the Sith, to the Republic, to me... their secrets are what makes them strong. I would tell you more if I knew, but I do not.;[];;[24118, 24128, 24130, 24134];[24143];man26_hulas;
My name is <FullName>.;[];;[24146];[24037];man26_hulas;
<FullName>. Now we know something about each other... but really, we still know nothing. What do you want with me, human?;[];;[24038, 24147, 24148];[24145];man26_hulas;
I want to ask you some questions.;[];;[24117];[24146, 24151, 24285, 24283];man26_hulas;
Nothing. I'll be going now.;[];;[24129];[24146, 24151];man26_hulas;
My name is none of your business.;[];;[24150];[24037];man26_hulas;
You presume to know my business, human. Yet if your name becomes important to me I only have to check with the Selkath registry to know it.;[];;[24151];[24149];man26_hulas;
But for now, keep your secret well hidden if you wish. What is it you want with me, human?;[];;[24147, 24148];[24150];man26_hulas;
Answers? What are you talking about?;[];;[24032];[24030];man26_hulas;
"Greetings once again, <FullName>. Or should I say ""Revan""?";[];;[24154, 24279, 24280];[None];man26_hulas;
How did you know that?;[];;[24155];[24153];man26_hulas;
Don't be naive. I am of the Genoharadan. We are bounty hunters, assassins and spies. We have agents with the Republic, we have agents with the Sith.;[];;[24156];[24154];man26_hulas;
Did you really think we wouldn't know about your little encounter on the Leviathan? Although I will admit, we were as surprised as you... the Jedi did a remarkable job of faking your death.;[];;[24157, 24278];[24155, 24279];man26_hulas;
So what happens now?;[];;[24158];[24156, 24281];man26_hulas;
I will admit, my first impulse on hearing this news was to disappear. The Genoharadan don't often become directly associated with such prominent figures as a former Dark Lord of the Sith.;[];;[24159];[24157, 24278];man26_hulas;
But then I began to realize the potential advantages of the situation. Assuming you complete the tasks required for your initiation into our guild, you could be very valuable to us.;[];;[24160];[24158];man26_hulas;
So for now, little has changed. I will keep your secret, just as you have kept ours. I am curious to see how events will play out between you and your old apprentice.;[];;[24161];[24159];man26_hulas;
If the situation becomes dangerous, we Genoharadan can simply disappear as we have often done in the past. But for now, we will continue your initiation into the guild.;[];;[24162];[24160];man26_hulas;
Is there anything else, <FullName>?;[];;[24097, 24163, 24191, 24203, 24206, 24231, 24235, 24239, 24242, 24245, 24277];[24161, 24165, 24205, 24230, 24234, 24244, 24275];man26_hulas;
Zuulan Sentar is dead.;[];;[24164];[24162, 24238, 24282];man26_hulas;
Yes, <FullName>, I am aware of this. Our agents have been keeping a close eye on you, though I doubt you saw them. They were there when Zuulan met his untimely end.;[];;[24165];[24163];man26_hulas;
And, as promised, here is your reward for the task: a blaster developed exclusively for the use of those within our guild. It will serve you well, I am sure.;[];;[24162, 24166];[24164];man26_hulas;
This assignment was only the beginning, <FullName>. A small test, which I am pleased to say you passed. But now a more difficult challenge awaits you.;[];;[24167];[24165, 24205];man26_hulas;
There are three targets that the Genoharadan want you to remove. If you can eliminate all three, then you will gain full membership in our ancient guild.;[];;[24168];[24166];man26_hulas;
The first is a Gammorean named Vorn Daasraad. The second is a shapeshifter called Rulan Prolik. The third is a Selkath known as Ithorak Guldar.;[];;[24089, 24169, 24175, 24181];[24167];man26_hulas;
Tell me about Vorn Daasraad.;[];;[24170];[24168, 24180, 24188];man26_hulas;
Vorn is a freelance bounty hunter. He's very, very good but he's a bit too sadistic for our tastes. He likes to sacrifice an efficient kill for the pleasure of watching his victim suffer.;[];;[24171];[24169];man26_hulas;
The Genoharadan will tolerate a certain amount of competition, but Vorn has become too dangerous. You'd be surprised at how much political damage one rogue assassin can inflict.;[];;[24172];[24170];man26_hulas;
Vorn was last seen on Tatooine. We suspect he's taking a break from hunting sentients by going after a Krayt dragon. We don't want him to leave the Dune Sea alive.;[];;[24173, 24190];[24171];man26_hulas;
I'll find Vorn and bring him down!;[];;[24174];[24172];man26_hulas;
Just be careful when you face off against him. Vorn doesn't travel alone: he's always got his assault droid close at hand. The two of them make a formidable pair.;[];;[24089, 24175, 24181];[24173];man26_hulas;
Tell me about Rulan Prolik.;[];;[24176];[24174, 24188, 24168];man26_hulas;
We don't know much about Rulan, except that he's some kind of shapeshifter. We don't even know if it's a natural ability or the result of some powerful alien technology.;[];;[24177];[24175];man26_hulas;
But we suspect he's behind several prominent assassinations on the Outer Rim. The Genoharadan are worried he might decide to move his operations closer to the galactic core.;[];;[24178];[24176];man26_hulas;
With his ability to assume virtually any form, he could wreak havoc in the Galactic Senate. We aren't about to let that happen.;[];;[24179, 24190];[24177];man26_hulas;
So how do I find someone who could look like anyone?;[];;[24180];[24178];man26_hulas;
Finding Rulan won't be easy, but we have reports he may be on Kashyyyk. He's probably honing his skills by hunting the dangerous creatures in the Shadowlands.;[];;[24089, 24169, 24181];[24179, 24190];man26_hulas;
Tell me about Ithorak Guldar.;[];;[24182];[24180, 24174, 24168];man26_hulas;
Ithorak isn't violent like Rulan or Vorn, but in many ways he's far more dangerous. He's a con artist and blackmailer who's taken millions of credits from rich and powerful families.;[];;[24183];[24181];man26_hulas;
He also deals in secrets and information, and these can be far more deadly than any blaster. But Ithorak is careful - we know he's somewhere here on Manaan, but we don't know where.;[];;[24184];[24182];man26_hulas;
All we know is how to contact him. There's a Twi'lek named Vek at the Manaan swoop track. He can set up a meeting between you and Ithorak.;[];;[24185, 24189];[24183];man26_hulas;
Sure. I'll just tell him I want to kill his boss and book an appointment.;[];;[24186];[24184];man26_hulas;
Ithorak poses as a merchant of rare antiquities. It's the perfect cover for his real work - it gives him access to rich and powerful families without drawing suspicion.;[];;[24187];[24185, 24189];man26_hulas;
You'll have to convince Vek that you represent a buyer interested in purchasing some rare art from Ithorak. Convince Vek, and he'll set up a meeting.;[];;[24188];[24186];man26_hulas;
The meeting is your one chance to take Ithorak out, but be careful. He'll choose the time and place, and he's not going to leave himself vulnerable.;[];;[24089, 24169, 24175];[24187];man26_hulas;
Why would Vek set up a meeting between us?;[];;[24186];[24184];man26_hulas;
Any tips for this mission?;[];;[24180];[24178, 24172];man26_hulas;
[Persuade/Lie] Zuulan Sentar is dead.;[];;[24192];[24162, 24238, 24282];man26_hulas;
[Failure] I'm disappointed in you, <FullName>. Did you really believe I would fall for such an obvious lie? Didn't you think I might have agents watching you to see how you performed?;[];;[24193];[24191];man26_hulas;
I know you let Zuulan live, though the slaver's days are numbered. Even now one of our more reliable agents is hunting him down.;[];;[24194];[24192];man26_hulas;
But I am willing to forget this incident, though you would do well to learn from it. There is a lesson for you here: the Genoharadan show no mercy.;[];;[24195];[24193];man26_hulas;
Since you did not kill Zuulan I cannot give you the bounty for this assignment. In any case, <FullName>, your role in Zuulan's fate is now over.;[];;[24196];[24194, 24241];man26_hulas;
Do you have further business you wish to discuss at this time, or are we done here for now?;[];;[24097, 24197, 24201, 24203, 24206, 24231, 24235, 24242, 24245, 24277];[24195];man26_hulas;
[Force Persuade] You should give me Zuulan's bounty anyway.;[{'Player': 'Persuade'}];;[24198];[24196];man26_hulas;
[Failure.] Did you really think that Jedi mind trick could work on one of the Genoharadan? You are a fool, <FullName>!;[];;[24199];[24197];man26_hulas;
The Genoharadan have no wish to work with fools. I am disappointed in you, <FullName>, but you leave me with little choice.;[];;[24200];[24198, 24202];man26_hulas;
I gave you an opportunity to join our guild, but through your actions you have shown yourself to be unfit. This is the last you will ever see of me or the Genoharadan, <FullName>. Goodbye.;[];;[];[24199];man26_hulas;
You better give me Zuulan's bounty anyway, before someone gets hurt.;[];;[24202];[24196];man26_hulas;
Are you threatening me? Here, where the Selkath authorities will arrest anyone who breaks the peace? Empty threats are the sign of a fool, <FullName>.;[];;[24199];[24201];man26_hulas;
Lorgal is dead.;[];;[24204];[24196, 24238, 24162, 24282];man26_hulas;
Yes, <FullName>, the agents I sent to watch you have reported back to me concerning Lorgal's death. You should take pride in a job well done.;[];;[24205];[24203];man26_hulas;
And, as promised, here is your reward for the task: a poisoned vibroblade forged exclusively for the use of those within our guild. It will serve you well, I am sure.;[];;[24162, 24166];[24204];man26_hulas;
Vorn Daasraad is dead.;[];;[24207];[24196, 24238, 24162, 24282];man26_hulas;
Well done, <FullName>. And, as promised, here is your reward: a Genoharadan stealth unit. You'll find it is far superior to most.;[];;[24208, 24230];[24206];man26_hulas;
Vorn, Rulan, Ithorak - that is all of them! You have done it, <FullName>. I hardly dreamed it was possible, yet now the task is done!;[];;[24209];[24207, 24233, 24243];man26_hulas;
All the years of planning. Spying and digging to discover their true identities - it was all worth it! Now the Genoharadan are mine alone!;[];;[24210, 24229];[24208];man26_hulas;
What are you talking about?;[];;[24211];[24209];man26_hulas;
Poor, foolish <FullName>. You had no idea that the targets I sent you after were three of the Overseers of the Genoharadan, did you?;[];;[24212];[24210, 24229];man26_hulas;
The Overseers have always acted in secret, their true identities hidden from the guild and even each other to prevent one person from seizing control of the entire guild.;[];;[24213];[24211];man26_hulas;
But now they are dead, and I am the only Overseer left in the guild! All the agents of the Genoharadan are mine to command! And I couldn't have done it without your help, <FullName>!;[];;[24214, 24227, 24228];[24212];man26_hulas;
So when do I get to join the guild?;[];;[24215];[24213];man26_hulas;
I'm sorry, <FullName>. Even after all you have done for me I cannot let you join the Genoharadan now. You are far too dangerous: you know the true identity of the only surviving Overseer.;[];;[24216];[24214, 24227, 24228];man26_hulas;
I suppose I could try to have you eliminated, but I have seen your skill in dispatching the other Overseers. I think it would be in both our best interests if we were simply to part ways.;[];;[24217, 24221];[24215];man26_hulas;
Nobody plays me for a fool! You'll pay for this, Hulas!;[];;[24218];[24216];man26_hulas;
*sigh* I was afraid it would come to this. Very well, we will finish this as these things always seem to end: in bloodshed. But the streets of Manaan are no place for this confrontation.;[];;[24219];[24217, 24226];man26_hulas;
Meet me in the Dune Sea, <FullName>. There we will engage in a ritual battle according to the customs of my guild, just you and me.;[];;[24220];[24218];man26_hulas;
Goodbye, <FullName>. I will wait for you in the Dune Sea. I don't need to remind you that you must come alone. If you do not, then you won't see me and you will never have your revenge.;[];;[];[24219];man26_hulas;
So that's it? We just part ways?;[];;[24222];[24216];man26_hulas;
I'm afraid so. The other Overseers are dead, but there is still much work for me to do to cement my hold on the guild.;[];;[24223];[24221];man26_hulas;
And as for you, <FullName>, I suspect your destiny lies elsewhere. You were never meant for the shadowy, secret world of the Genoharadan. You are bound to a much more public fate.;[];;[24224, 24226];[24222];man26_hulas;
Goodbye, Hulas.;[];;[24225];[24223];man26_hulas;
Goodbye, <FullName>. This is the last you will ever see of me or the Genoharadan, though if you watch carefully you may see evidence of our work throughout the galaxy.;[];;[];[24224];man26_hulas;
This isn't over, Hulas! Nobody plays me for a fool!;[];;[24218];[24223];man26_hulas;
Glad I could help you out. What happens now?;[];;[24215];[24213];man26_hulas;
You used me!;[];;[24215];[24213];man26_hulas;
You tricked me!;[];;[24211];[24209];man26_hulas;
Vorn's death brings you closer to completing your initiation into the Genoharadan, <FullName>. However, until you have completed all your missions you cannot be accepted into the guild.;[];;[24162];[24207];man26_hulas;
Rulan Prolik is dead.;[];;[24232];[24196, 24162, 24282];man26_hulas;
I must congratulate you. Rulan was no easy target. I will admit that you are not the first to be sent after him, though you are the only one to succeed.;[];;[24233];[24231];man26_hulas;
Here, take this Genoharadan visor. Many of our agents use them to increases their senses and improve their skills. It really is quite an extraordinary item.;[];;[24208, 24234];[24232];man26_hulas;
With Rulan gone, you are another step closer to entering the guild. But until you have completed all the missions you will not be accepted into the Genoharadan.;[];;[24162];[24233];man26_hulas;
[Persuade/Lie] Rulan Prolik is dead.;[];;[24236];[24196, 24162, 24282];man26_hulas;
[Failure.] The Genoharadan are not easily fooled, <FirstName>. My agents reported Rulan fled from your battle. They tell me you didn't finish the job.;[];;[24237];[24235];man26_hulas;
If you expect to join our guild, you will have to learn that we never leave a job unfinished. Go back to Kashyyyk. Find Rulan. Finish the job.;[];;[24238];[24236, 24277];man26_hulas;
Until you do you will never be one of the Genoharadan. Now, is there some other business you wish to discuss?;[];;[24097, 24163, 24191, 24203, 24206, 24239, 24242, 24245];[24237];man26_hulas;
I can't complete the Zuulan Sentar mission. Dantooine is destroyed.;[];;[24240];[24238, 24162, 24282];man26_hulas;
Yes, I have heard how the Sith razed the planet. Such radical overreactions are one reason the Genoharadan would prefer to see the Republic remain in power.;[];;[24241];[24239];man26_hulas;
It is likely that Zuulan died in the attack, but we do not like to leave such things to chance. It will take some time before my agents can determine if Zuulan survived.;[];;[24195];[24240];man26_hulas;
Ithorak Guldar is dead.;[];;[24243];[24238, 24196, 24162, 24282];man26_hulas;
Yes, I heard he met a rather grisly end. For completing this mission you have earned another reward. Take these Genoharadan gloves. You will find they are very useful in battle.;[];;[24208, 24244];[24242];man26_hulas;
By disposing of Ithorak you bring yourself ever closer to being accepted into the Genoharadan. But you must complete all your missions before you will be admitted into the guild.;[];;[24162];[24243];man26_hulas;
I have some questions about the Genoharadan.;[];;[24246];[24238, 24196, 24162, 24282];man26_hulas;
You must understand that there is much I cannot tell you until you are accepted into the guild, of course. But ask your questions and I will tell you what I can.;[];;[24097, 24247, 24251, 24256, 24265, 24270, 24275];[24245, 24286];man26_hulas;
Who formed this guild? Where did it begin?;[];;[24248, 24264];[24246, 24269, 24274];man26_hulas;
The Genoharadan were created by the the galactic tyrant Xim the Despot, five thousand years before the Republic itself was even founded.;[];;[24249];[24247];man26_hulas;
During Xim's short but brutal reign he used Genoharadan agents to eliminate his most powerful enemies. When Xim was finally overthrown, it was believed the Genoharadan disbanded.;[];;[24250];[24248];man26_hulas;
But the Genoharadan did not disband. Instead, we vanished into the darkness. Now we carry on our work from the deepest shadows, dispatching the enemies of those who hire us.;[];;[24097, 24251, 24265, 24270, 24275];[24249];man26_hulas;
Tell me more about the Genoharadan.;[];;[24252, 24264];[24250, 24269, 24274, 24246];man26_hulas;
In the first few centuries after Xim was overthrown, the Genoharadan were nothing but hired killers. We were a mere tool to be used by those who were rich and politically ambitious;[];;[24253];[24251];man26_hulas;
"But slowly the guild evolved. We began to shape and alter events through our actions. We ceased to be a servant of the political elite; we became a powerful faction in our own right.";[];;[24254];[24252];man26_hulas;
The organizaton of the guild itself also changed at this point. Instead of a single guildmaster, it was decided there would be four Overseers to guide and lead the Genoharadan.;[];;[24255];[24253];man26_hulas;
By distributing the power in this way we were protected against becoming a tool of a single person. The Overseers' individual ambitions would serve to balance each other out.;[];;[24256];[24254];man26_hulas;
Tell me about the Overseers.;[];;[24257, 24264];[24255, 24269, 24246];man26_hulas;
The Overseers are a secret cabal of four individuals who control the Genoharadan. For their own protection, nobody knows the identity of an Overseer. They are anonymous even to each other.;[];;[24258];[24256];man26_hulas;
Through agents and go-betweens, the Overseers consult with each other on all guild business. The system ensures no one person can manipulate the guild for their own benefit.;[];;[24259, 24276];[24257];man26_hulas;
What happens if an Overseer is killed?;[];;[24260];[24258];man26_hulas;
As you can imagine, the method for choosing and replacing an Overseer is complicated. The anonymity of a candidate must be protected at all costs, or the entire system will break down.;[];;[24261];[24259, 24276];man26_hulas;
If one Overseer were ever able to somehow eliminate the other three at the same time, he could seize all the power for himself and the guild as we know it would change forever.;[];;[24262];[24260];man26_hulas;
More than this I cannot tell you, for the sake of the guild. Besides, many of the details are hidden from me, as well. They are known only to the Overseers themselves.;[];;[24263];[24261];man26_hulas;
What else can you tell me about the Genoharadan?;[];;[24264];[24262];man26_hulas;
I'm sorry, <FullName>, but I am not ready to reveal all our secrets to you yet. Perhaps after you have completed another of your missions I will tell you more of this.;[];;[24097, 24265, 24270, 24275];[24263, 24256, 24251, 24247];man26_hulas;
Why haven't the Genoharadan assassinated Malak?;[];;[24266];[24264, 24274, 24250, 24246];man26_hulas;
Malak is no easy target, even for the Genoharadan. He is far too visible a figure. We prefer to operate on the fringes of events, not plunge into their center.;[];;[24267];[24265];man26_hulas;
In any case, there is no guarantee that the Genoharadan would eliminate Malak even if we could. Not yet. He may someday be of use to us, depending how events play out.;[];;[24268];[24266];man26_hulas;
Right now we support the Republic, but the goals of our guild are many and our methods subtle. At times we intervene in wars, but often we prefer to remain behind the scenes.;[];;[24269];[24267];man26_hulas;
We have found it more effective to let the grand scope of events play themselves out, then manipulate the situation to our advantage. It is one of the keys to keeping our existence well hidden.;[];;[24097, 24247, 24251, 24256, 24270, 24275];[24268];man26_hulas;
Do the Jedi Order know about your guild?;[];;[24271];[24269, 24274, 24264, 24250, 24246];man26_hulas;
Some of the wise Masters have knowledge of our existence. Those who study galactic history carefully will see evidence of our influence throughout.;[];;[24272];[24270];man26_hulas;
"But it is unlikely that even the Jedi know the true scope of our power and influence. They permit us to exist because they see us as a minor faction in the galaxy; one of many.";[];;[24273];[24271];man26_hulas;
Still, we try to avoid crossing paths with the Order. The Jedi are powerful and difficult to manipulate. We are careful to avoid actions that would draw their full attention.;[];;[24274];[24272];man26_hulas;
Despite their wisdom, the Jedi are in many ways like everyone else. They would not believe the true extent of our secret society even if you were to tell them.;[];;[24097, 24247, 24251, 24265, 24270, 24275];[24273];man26_hulas;
I don't have any other questions.;[];;[24162];[24274, 24269, 24264, 24250, 24246];man26_hulas;
How are the Overseers selected?;[];;[24260];[24258];man26_hulas;
Rulan Prolik got away. I can't find him.;[];;[24237];[24196, 24162, 24282];man26_hulas;
I guess this changes things.;[];;[24158];[24156, 24281];man26_hulas;
Revan? I have no idea what you're talking about?;[];;[24156];[24153];man26_hulas;
I'm not Revan anymore. Don't call me that.;[];;[24281];[24153];man26_hulas;
Yes, it is probably a good idea to hide your true identity. We Genoharadan are masters of gathering information, but few others know the truth about you. There is power in secrets.;[];;[24157, 24278];[24280];man26_hulas;
Welcome back, <FullName>. I see you have come alone, this is good. I assume you are here to discuss the business of the Genoharadan.;[];;[24073, 24097, 24163, 24191, 24203, 24206, 24231, 24235, 24239, 24242, 24245, 24277];[None];man26_hulas;

Who are you again?;[];;[24285];[24283];man26_hulas;
You have forgotten my name? Knowledge is power, but information is useless if you do not make a point to remember it. I am Hulas, a traveler from the world of Duro.;[];;[24147];[24284];man26_hulas;

You need to meet with Ithorak? Forgive my skepticism, but you hardly resemble our typical client. We deal in the kind of pieces found in the chambers of a galactic senator.;[];;[24476, 24484, 24491, 24493];[24489];man26_vek;

Who are you?;[];;[24497];[24488, 24513, 24514];man26_vek;
My name is Vek. I work for Ithorak Guldar, a merchant who deals in very rare and expensive art. He serves as the go-between for buyers and sellers throughout the galaxy.;[];;[24498];[24496, 24510, 24511, 24512];man26_vek;
I serve as Ithorak's security advisor - a highly demanding job. The fact that Ithorak seems to delight in insulting and berating me makes it even more difficult.;[];;[24489, 24499, 24504, 24508, 24509];[24497];man26_vek;
You're wearing a Sith uniform. Are you with the Sith?;[];;[24500];[24498];man26_vek;
To be honest, no. Not really. I just wear this uniform to gain respect. People are less likely to give me trouble if they think I *might* be with the Sith.;[];;[24501];[24499];man26_vek;
Don't you think the Sith might take exception to that?;[];;[24502];[24500];man26_vek;
Well, maybe. I guess. But the Sith here on Manaan aren't about to do anything to get them in trouble. Not if it means getting sanctions against their Kolto shipments.;[];;[24503];[24501];man26_vek;
As long as I don't actually *say* I'm with the Sith, they don't seem to mind. So I use this outfit to give me the psychological edge I need. Being Ithorak's security advisor isn't easy!;[];;[24489, 24504, 24508, 24509];[24502];man26_vek;

She was aided by Carth Onasi, a decorated war hero of the Republic and a legendary soldier. During the Mandalore Wars he was honored many times for his bravery.;[];;[24776];[24774];stunt12;NSTN12STUN01002_.mp3

An eye witness, Lord Malak.;[];;[24780];[24778];stunt12;NSTN12STUN01006_.mp3

I trust you are not wasting my time, Admiral Karath.;[];;[24787];[24785];stunt12;NSTN12STUN01013_.mp3

An obvious conclusion, given your presence here. However, my sensory input systems are detecting some significant changes in your composition since your last visit.;[];;[24808];[24806];unk44_lib_dlg;
Your neurological patterns exhibit subtle yet substantive alterations in both thought patterns and information processing. These changes have been noted and recorded in my database.;[];;[24809, 24853, 24854];[24807, 24857];unk44_lib_dlg;
Your database?;[];;[24810];[24808];unk44_lib_dlg;
I am a completely self-sufficient, autonomous, interactive database constructed by the Rakata to record and store the entire history of the species.;[];;[24811];[24809, 24853];unk44_lib_dlg;
However, since the collapse of the Infinite Empire there have been few events worth recording, and nobody has sought to access the information stored within my database... until you came along.;[];;[24812];[24810];unk44_lib_dlg;
Due to my systems' ability to monitor and repair themselves, you will find all the data within my archives has remained fully intact. Please choose the topic you wish information on.;[];;[24813, 24817, 24828, 24830, 24832, 24836, 24844];[24811, 24827, 24854, 24860];unk44_lib_dlg;
I'm looking for genetic data on the Rakata.;[];;[24814];[24812];unk44_lib_dlg;
My storage banks contain significant quantities of information on this subject, compiled through hundreds of years of research and study.;[];;[24815];[24813];unk44_lib_dlg;
Please wait while I load the information onto a data pad for your future reference. Processing...;[];;[24816];[24814];unk44_lib_dlg;
Information transfer complete. Is there anything else you require, Revan?;[];;[24817, 24828, 24830, 24832, 24836, 24844];[24815];unk44_lib_dlg;
Tell me about the Star Forge.;[];;[24818];[24816, 24812];unk44_lib_dlg;
The Star Forge was constructed during the apex of the Infinite Empire's power. A true technological marvel, it is an enormous space station that serves as both factory and battle dreadnaught.;[];;[24819];[24817];unk44_lib_dlg;
The Star Forge can mass produce immense fleets with a minimum of time and resources. In addition, the Star Forge also shares much of the same technology used in my own construction.;[];;[24820];[24818];unk44_lib_dlg;
In many ways the Star Forge is like a living entity. It feeds, it hungers, it draws on the energy flowing through all living things - what you called the Force the last time you were here.;[];;[24821];[24819];unk44_lib_dlg;
This ability to feed and consume the living energy of the Force is the key to the Star Forge's power, but ultimately it was also what led to the destruction of the Infinite Empire.;[];;[24822, 24827, 24828];[24820];unk44_lib_dlg;
What do you mean?;[];;[24823];[24821];unk44_lib_dlg;
The Rakata are by nature a cruel and savage species. The Star Forge fueled itself with the hatred inherent in its own creators, and in doing so it accentuated these traits within the Builders.;[];;[24824];[24822];unk44_lib_dlg;
In your terminology, the Star Forge is a tool of the dark side. It corrupts those who use it so that it can generate greater and greater amounts of negative energy to fuel itself.;[];;[24825];[24823];unk44_lib_dlg;
The Builders thought they were strong enough to control this effect, but they were wrong. They became victims of their own creation, and eventually their hatred turned them against each other.;[];;[24826];[24824];unk44_lib_dlg;
Civil war destroyed the Infinite Empire... a lesson to remember. Only one who is immensely strong in mind and will can harness the power of the Star Forge without suffering a similar fate.;[];;[24827, 24828];[24825];unk44_lib_dlg;
I want to ask you something else.;[];;[24812];[24826, 24821, 24835, 24831, 24842, 24852, 24847];unk44_lib_dlg;
I'll be going now.;[];;[24829];[24826, 24821, 24835, 24831, 24842, 24852, 24847, 24816, 24812];unk44_lib_dlg;
As you wish. Please return if you find yourself in need of the information stored within my database.;[];;[];[24828];unk44_lib_dlg;
How can I shut off the disruptor field around this planet?;[];;[24831];[24816, 24812];unk44_lib_dlg;
The Disruptor Field was constructed as the Star Forge's primary defense against enemy attack, and can only be deactivated from the upper levels of the Temple.;[];;[24827, 24828, 24832];[24830];unk44_lib_dlg;
How can I get to the upper levels of the temple?;[];;[24833];[24831, 24816, 24812];unk44_lib_dlg;
My systems control the doors to the upper levels, allowing only those who are worthy of the Rakata legacy to pass. The last time you were here, Revan, I unsealed the doors for you.;[];;[24834];[24832];unk44_lib_dlg;
However, the subtle neurological changes I detected in you earlier likely caused a failure in the recognition system that would have opened the doors for you.;[];;[24835];[24833];unk44_lib_dlg;
I have updated my databases to recognize the new configurations in your mind, Revan. The doors to the upper levels will once again open for you.;[];;[24827, 24828];[24834];unk44_lib_dlg;
Do you know anything about the Star Maps?;[];;[24837];[24816, 24812];unk44_lib_dlg;
The Star Maps were built on conquered worlds as a symbol of Rakatan dominance and glory. Each map showed the whole expanse of the Infinite Empire, with the Star Forge at the center.;[];;[24838];[24836];unk44_lib_dlg;
When the Empire fell, the Rakata fled back here to their homeworld. They sabotaged the Star Maps so the enslaved species could not use them to discover the Star Forge or this planet.;[];;[24839, 24843];[24837];unk44_lib_dlg;
But I used the Star Maps to find this place!;[];;[24840];[24838];unk44_lib_dlg;
The Star Maps were created with the same technology as my own self-sufficient systems. Over the millennia the maps have been slowly rebuilding and repairing themselves.;[];;[24841];[24839, 24843];unk44_lib_dlg;
As you informed me during your last visit to this world, the Star Maps are still in a damaged and incomplete state. It is not possible to locate the Star Forge using a single map.;[];;[24842];[24840];unk44_lib_dlg;
However, the Star Maps have repaired themselves to the extent that it is possible to discover the Star Forge's location by combining bits of data from several of the maps, as you did.;[];;[24827, 24828];[24841];unk44_lib_dlg;
They didn't do a very good job of destroying them.;[];;[24840];[24838];unk44_lib_dlg;
Tell me about the history of the Infinite Empire.;[];;[24845];[24816, 24812];unk44_lib_dlg;
At its peak the Infinite Empire ruled over 500 planets and was comprised of ten billion Rakata and over a trillion slaves scattered across the galaxy.;[];;[24846];[24844];unk44_lib_dlg;
"But the glory of the Infinite Empire was built on war and slaughter; it was inevitable it should collapse upon itself. Conflict among power-hungry warlords escalated into full civil war.";[];;[24847];[24845];unk44_lib_dlg;
Worlds were ravaged and millions of lives were lost. Sensing the weakness of their oppressors, the slaves rebelled and overthrew their masters. And then came the plague.;[];;[24827, 24828, 24848];[24846];unk44_lib_dlg;
The plague?;[];;[24849];[24847];unk44_lib_dlg;
Its origins were unknown - perhaps the creation of an enslaved species, perhaps a mutation of a natural virus. It killed only Rakata, and it spread to every corner of the galaxy.;[];;[24850];[24848];unk44_lib_dlg;
The Infinite Empire crumbled into dust as the few Rakata survivors fled back here to their home world. All evidence of their existence was destroyed by the species they once enslaved.;[];;[24851];[24849];unk44_lib_dlg;
But even hidden here on their secret home world they were not safe. Millions died from the deadly plague, many more died in the never ending civil war.;[];;[24852];[24850];unk44_lib_dlg;
The history of the Rakata ended twenty thousand years ago. Now they are nothing but a few scattered tribes descended from the priest and warrior castes, still waging our never ending civil war.;[];;[24827, 24828];[24851];unk44_lib_dlg;
What are you?;[];;[24810];[24808];unk44_lib_dlg;
I need some information.;[];;[24812];[24808];unk44_lib_dlg;
I'm not Revan anymore. I'm <FullName>.;[];;[24856];[24805];unk44_lib_dlg;
An odd statement, though it does explain certain conflicting data being read by my sensory input systems.;[];;[24857];[24855];unk44_lib_dlg;
I recognize your appearance from your last visit, which is stored in my databanks. However, I am detecting some significant changes in your composition since your last visit.;[];;[24808];[24856, 24859];unk44_lib_dlg;
You recognize me?;[];;[24859];[24805];unk44_lib_dlg;
Of course. The Builders constructed me with a full range of sesnsory input systems to compliment my fully aware and self-sufficient programming.;[];;[24857];[24858];unk44_lib_dlg;
Welcome back once again, Revan. Do you need to access the data within my storage banks?;[];;[24812];[None];unk44_lib_dlg;

What what what? Something else come into my prison? Already?;[{'': 'Talk_Laughing'}];This dialogue begins and only has two actual endings: either the player succeeds in the riddle challenge and is sent back to the ebon hawk (k_pebo_rakata16 ...this script still must be completed) or the player is killed (k_pebo_rakata01 ...this causes the player to die, but needs scripting so the rakata does the appropriate effects). Otherwise everything should be scripted and working.;[24897];[None];ebo46_rakata2;
So very long a time and nothing. Then in a span of mere months three in a row! What sheer luck!;[];;[24898];[24896];ebo46_rakata2;
Well let's have a look at you. Hmm. Biped. More or less symmetrical. Far less hair than the last one. Opposable digits. Mostly water, hey? I suppose you'll have to do.;[{'': 'Persuade'}];;[24899, 25037, 25038];[24897];ebo46_rakata2;
I'll have to do for what?;[];;[24900];[24898];ebo46_rakata2;
Eh? For a body, of course. I don't want to remain in this prison forever, no no no.;[];;[24901];[24899];ebo46_rakata2;
I'm a prisoner here. As are you, yes indeed... though I suspect by accident rather than by sentence, yes? I was put here on purpose.;[];;[24902];[24900, 25037, 25039];ebo46_rakata2;
My own people put our criminals in little cages like this. Well... our minds, anyway. For really terrible criminals like me our mind gets locked away forever.;[];;[24903];[24901];ebo46_rakata2;
How long have I been here now? Hmmm... one... four... no, no, longer than that. I've never been very good with numbers.;[];;[24904, 25028, 25030, 25034];[24902];ebo46_rakata2;
This is a prison?;[];;[24905];[24903, 25029, 25033, 25036];ebo46_rakata2;
Can you think of a better prison than one without walls? What does your species use? Cages, I suppose.;[];;[24906, 25028, 25030, 25034];[24904];ebo46_rakata2;
Is there no way out of here?;[];;[24907];[24905, 25029, 25033, 25036];ebo46_rakata2;
Well, now *that* is a most interesting question. Yes yes yes indeed.;[];;[24908];[24906];ebo46_rakata2;
I've been here long enough to ponder that. How many years, now? A thousand? Ten thousand? Bah... I could never remember the numbers, even when I kept track.;[];;[24909];[24907];ebo46_rakata2;
The point is that I know a way out of this clever little prison. Interesting, that, wouldn't you say?;[];;[24910, 25024, 25026];[24908];ebo46_rakata2;
Out? Out to where? If you get out of here, your body's probably dead.;[];;[24911];[24909];ebo46_rakata2;
How clever of you to realize that? Indeed you are correct. Your body, however, is not.;[];;[24912];[24910];ebo46_rakata2;
Now before you go off getting all excited and defensive, let me tell you that I can't go jumping into your body without your willing agreement.;[];;[24913];[24911, 25025, 25027];ebo46_rakata2;
Conversely, you can't go jumping back into your body without my knowledge. This leaves us at something of an impasse, wouldn't you agree?;[];;[24914, 25021, 25023];[24912];ebo46_rakata2;
So what do you suggest?;[];;[24915];[24913];ebo46_rakata2;
What I suggest is for us to settle this now, like civilized beings.;[];;[24916];[24914];ebo46_rakata2;
It is like this, dear sentient... if you like, we could spend the next thousand years debating. You want out, I want out, it could go on and on.;[];;[24917];[24915, 25022, 25023];ebo46_rakata2;
Unless your species is remarkably long-lived, I doubt your body has a thousand years. And, frankly, I doubt either of us is going to convince the other of anything, yes?;[];;[24918];[24916];ebo46_rakata2;
So why waste the time? A simple competition between the two of us and we settle the matter. You win, you go free. I win, I go free. Yes?;[];;[24919, 24925, 25017, 25019];[24917];ebo46_rakata2;
How do I know I could trust you?;[];;[24920];[24918, 25018, 25020];ebo46_rakata2;
You have no reason not to trust me, now. If I were to betray you, then you would never trust me again... and we would be stuck here arguing forever.;[];;[24921, 24925, 25017, 25019];[24919];ebo46_rakata2;
It only takes once.;[];;[24922];[24920];ebo46_rakata2;
I suppose that's true. But if you won and I did not release you, there would never be another chance for me to escape anyway, would there? You would never agree to it.;[];;[24923, 24925, 25017, 25019];[24921];ebo46_rakata2;
You have a point.;[];;[24924];[24922];ebo46_rakata2;
Hence I may as well let you go, if you win. It is my one and only opportunity for freedom.;[];;[24925, 25017, 25019];[24923];ebo46_rakata2;
What kind of competition do you mean?;[];;[24926];[24924, 25018, 25020, 24922, 24920, 24918];ebo46_rakata2;
I have little clue as to which activities you are superior at. You are at the same disadvantage with me, I suspect.;[];;[24927];[24925];ebo46_rakata2;
So the best game is one of the mind. An exchange of riddles, perhaps. The first of us to fail at an answer loses. What do you think?;[];;[24928, 25008, 25012, 25014];[24926];ebo46_rakata2;
I don't seem to have much of a choice.;[];;[24929];[24927, 25011, 25013, 25016];ebo46_rakata2;
Now now no need to be fussy. If I seem to be moving fast it's simply because I've had an overabundance of time to consider this scenario.;[];;[24930];[24928];ebo46_rakata2;
That being the case, and seeing as this is technically my home, I'll go first. Now... let's see...;[];;[24931];[24929];ebo46_rakata2;

Yes yes yes... I suppose that was an easy one. Perhaps I should have used all this time to think of harder riddles, hey?;[];;[24938];[24936];ebo46_rakata2;

Hmmm. I do have to wonder how that happened. Are my people still about? If they were, I can't see that they'd let my prison loose so easily.;[];;[24954];[24952];ebo46_rakata2;
But even if they are gone, I doubt you'd be able to find any way to release me. No, I suppose I shall just have to wait for someone who is not as proficient at riddles as you are to come along.;[];;[24944, 24947, 24949, 24955, 24957];[24953];ebo46_rakata2;

The second dialog is when the player approaches the pile of lightsaber crystals.   The third dialog is when the player approaches Ahlan Matale in his home for the first time.   The fourth dialog is when the player enters the Rakata ruins for the first time.   The fifth dialog is when the player approaches the huge circular door in the Rakata ruins for the first time. If Carth is present he will also say his line, but Bastila will initiate the conversation.   The sixth dialog is linked in the fifth dialog and is Bastila's line after Carth has said his.   The seventh dialog is if the player tries to activate one of the computers controlling the huge circular door.   The eighth dialog is when the player tries to open the huge circular door.   The ninth dialog is when the player manages to activate a single computer by placing a crystal in it.   The tenth dialog is when the player has placed a crystal in each computer (and the huge circular door subsequently opens). Exit points in conversation: Exit stream 1: The line is said and DAN_DONE_PLAINS is changed to true to show that the player has been warned about the Kath hounds. Exit stream 2: The line is said and DAN_DONE_CRYSTAL is changed to true to show that Bastila has commented on the crystals. Exit stream 3: The line is said and the conversation ends. Exit stream 4: Bastila opens, the scene cuts to a cutscene, then back for questions, which both follow the same path and the conversation ends. Exit stream 5: Carth says his line and DAN_DONE_DOOR is changed to true to show that the door has been commented upon. The conversation goes to Bastila's line (exit stream 6) if she is present, or exits otherwise. Exit stream 6: The line is said and DAN_DONE_DOOR is changed to true to show that the door has been commented upon. Exit stream 7: The line is said and the conversation ends. Exit stream 8: The line is said and the player can either choose to accept the vision, in which case the cutscene repeats and the conversation ends, or end the conversation outright. Exit stream 9: The line is said when only a single crystal has been placed in one of the computers.

An audience with the Jedi Council? That's pretty unusual for someone who isn't even a Jedi. What's this about, Bastila?;[];;[25216];[25214];bastila;NM13AABAST01022_.mp3
I'm sorry, Carth, but I cannot tell you. All I ask is that you trust in the Force and the wisdom of the Council.;[];;[25217];[25215];bastila;NM13AABAST01024_.mp3
Well, I don't like being left out of the loop, but I'm not looking to get you in any trouble with the Jedi Masters. We'll do things your way for a while.;[];;[25218];[25216];bastila;NM13AABAST01026_.mp3

The vision again! Did you see it? You must have. Revan and Malak were here before us - I feel their dark presence. They must have come and found... this.;[];;[25221, 25240, 25241];[None];bastila;NM13AABAST01030_.mp3
What is it?;[];;[25222];[25220];bastila;
It's a map of hyperspace coordinates. Some sort of star chart. But what is this Sith Star Forge they mentioned? And why did they lust to uncover its secrets?;[];;[25223, 25239];[25221, 25240, 25241];bastila;NM13AABAST01032_.mp3
Could it have been a factory, or weapons plant?;[];;[25224];[25222];bastila;
Maybe... that might explain how the Sith were able to amass a fleet so quickly...;[];;[25225];[25223, 25239];bastila;NM13AABAST01034_.mp3
Whatever this Star Forge is, it was important enough for Revan and Malak to betray the Jedi. This Star Forge must be the seat of their power. If it could be destroyed...;[];;[25226, 25237];[25224];bastila;NM13AABAST01036_.mp3
How can we destroy it if we don't even know what it is?;[];;[25227];[25225];bastila;
The hyperspace coordinates on this map might lead us to the Star Forge, if they were complete. But there are pieces missing.;[];;[25228, 25235, 25236];[25226, 25238];bastila;NM13AABAST01038_.mp3
What good is an incomplete map?;[];;[25229];[25227];bastila;
I recognize one of the planets on the map: Korriban - a Sith world. And if that's Korriban, then this must be Kashyyyk... and Tatooine... and here's Manaan...;[];;[25230];[25228, 25235, 25236];bastila;NM13AABAST01041_.mp3
Now I think I understand. This map was only the starting point for Revan's dark journey into the ways of the Sith.;[];;[25231];[25229];bastila;NM13AABAST01043_.mp3
Tatooine, Kashyyyk, Manaan, Korriban: Revan visited each of these worlds searching for clues to reveal the hidden location of the Star Forge.;[];;[25232, 25234];[25230];bastila;NM13AABAST01045_.mp3
So now what?;[];;[25233];[25231];bastila;
Before we do anything we must inform the council of what we have discovered. They will decide our next course of action, though I suspect our task has only just begun.;[];;[];[25232, 25234];bastila;NM13AABAST01047_.mp3

Such thoughts speak of the dark side! We serve the Republic and the Jedi Council. It must be their decision as to what course of action to take.;[];;[25227];[25237];bastila;NM13AABAST01052_.mp3
Who said it had anything to do with the Sith? They may have allies in the background helping them now.;[];;[25224];[25222];bastila;
What does it mean?;[];;[25222];[25220];bastila;
It looks like some sort of map...;[];;[25222];[25220];bastila;

This is Admiral Forn Dodonna to the Ebon Hawk, do you read us?;[];;[25246];[25244];m12aa_c05;NM12AAC05001001_.mp3
Admiral Dodonna, this is Carth Onasi. We are receiving your transmission.;[];;[25247];[25245];m12aa_c05;NM12AAC05001002_.mp3
Carth, I'm glad to see you're still alive. We've begun our assault on the Star Forge, but we're taking heavy losses. How did the Sith ever manage to build something of this scope!;[];;[25248];[25246];m12aa_c05;NM12AAC05001003_.mp3
The Star Forge wasn't constructed by the Sith, Admiral. We don't have time for me to fully explain it, but that space station is far older than you can imagine.;[];;[25249];[25247];m12aa_c05;NM12AAC05001004_.mp3
Maybe we should pull the fleet back and retreat. I don't know if we have the firepower to go up against this alien technology.;[];;[25250];[25248];m12aa_c05;NM12AAC05001005_.mp3
You can't do that, Admiral.  The Star Forge is a factory of immense power.  It's been churning out the capital ships, snub fighters and assault droids that have powered the Sith war effort. ## You have to destroy the Star Forge now or you'll be fighting an unending wave of reinforcements.;[];;[25251];[25249];m12aa_c05;NM12AAC05001006_.mp3
You have to destroy the Star Forge now or you'll be fighting an unending wave of reinforcements.;[];;[25252];[25250];m12aa_c05;
Then I guess we have no choice.  But it isn't going to be easy. ## I can't even get our capital ships into position to start bombarding the Star Forge. ## The Sith fleet is too well organized.

The Sith fleet is too well organized. It's like they can guess our every move and counter our every strategy.;[];;[25255];[25253];m12aa_c05;
It's because of Bastila, Admiral.  She turned to the dark side and become Malak's apprentice. ## We suspect she's somewhere on that space station right now, ## using her Battle Meditation against you and your fleet.;[];;[25256];[25254];m12aa_c05;NM12AAC05001011_.mp3

This is Master Vandar. A number of Jedi Knights have joined our fleet under his command.;[];;[25259];[25257];m12aa_c05;NM12AAC05001014_.mp3
If Bastila is using her power to augment the Sith then Malak's fleet is invincible. Our only hope is to somehow stop Bastila from using her Battle Meditation.;[];;[25260];[25258];m12aa_c05;NM12AAC05001015_.mp3
How can we do that if she's on the space station?;[];;[25261];[25259];m12aa_c05;NM12AAC05001016_.mp3
I will send a squadron of Jedi Knights to the Star Forge to find Bastila. Their small ships will be able to fly through the Sith blockade and dock on the space station.;[];;[25262];[25260];m12aa_c05;NM12AAC05001017_.mp3
If they can find Bastila, they may be able to distract her attention from the battle overhead. ## That should allow you to move your capital ships into postion for a final assault on the Star Forge itself.;[];;[25263];[25261];m12aa_c05;NM12AAC05001018_.mp3

What are you talking about?;[];;[25290];[25288];sta_firstjedi_co;
The Star Forge is more than just a space station. In some ways, it is like a living creature. It hungers. And it can feed on the dark side that is within all of us!;[];;[25291];[25289, 25295];sta_firstjedi_co;NM45AADART04036_.mp3
Look around you, Revan. See the bodies? You should recognize them from the Academy. These are Jedi who fell when I attacked Dantooine. For all intents and purposes dead, except for one difference:;[];;[25292];[25290];sta_firstjedi_co;NM45AADART04037_.mp3
I have not let them become one with the Force. Instead I have brought them here. The Star Forge corrupts what remains of their power and transfers the dark taint to me!;[];;[25293];[25291];sta_firstjedi_co;NM45AADART04038_.mp3

The Jedi Council didn't restore your wounded mind, Revan! They merely programmed it with a new identity - one loyal to the Republic! They tried to make you their slave!;[];;[25342, 25345, 25348, 25358];[25340, 25368];lev40_darthmala2;NM40ACDART03032_.mp3
You've been lying to me this whole time, Bastila!;[];;[25343];[25341, 25347, 25351];lev40_darthmala2;
I wanted to tell you, but the Council forbid it! They were afraid you might return to the dark side if you discovered your real identity!;[];;[25344];[25342];lev40_darthmala2;NM40ACDART03034_.mp3
But now you know the truth, Revan! The Council has failed in their attempt to make you their pawn! The will of a Sith Lord is not so easily manipulated!;[];;[25345, 25348, 25352, 25358, 25365];[25343];lev40_darthmala2;NM40ACDART03036_.mp3
Why not just let me die?;[];;[25346];[25344, 25351, 25341];lev40_darthmala2;
The Jedi hold all life sacred, even that of a Sith Lord. I could not just let you die, Revan. Not if it was possible to save you.;[];;[25347];[25345];lev40_darthmala2;NM40ACDART03043_.mp3
"Bastila hides the truth behind noble words, Revan! The Jedi needed the memories buried deep in your wounded mind; there was no other way to bring them out. They had to keep you alive!";[];;[25342, 25348, 25352, 25358, 25365];[25346];lev40_darthmala2;NM40ACDART03045_.mp3
But why program me with another identity?;[];;[25349];[25347, 25344, 25341];lev40_darthmala2;
"We couldn't simply restore your true identity; Revan was too dangerous. But locked inside your mind was information the Republic needed: the secrets of the Star Forge.";[];;[25350];[25348];lev40_darthmala2;NM40ACDART03047_.mp3
"The Council created an identity for you: a soldier under my command. Your subconscious memories were supposed to lead me to the Star Forge; there was no other way to get the information.";[];;[25351];[25349];lev40_darthmala2;NM40ACDART03049_.mp3
They made you their puppet, Revan - and Bastila was the handler pulling your strings!;[];;[25342, 25345, 25352, 25356, 25358, 25365];[25350];lev40_darthmala2;NM40ACDART03051_.mp3
Why you, Bastila? Why did the Council choose you?;[];;[25353];[25351, 25347, 25344];lev40_darthmala2;
When I used my Force powers to keep you alive on that bridge it created our bond. I convinced the Council that I could use that bond to draw out your memories and lead us to the Star Forge.;[];;[25354];[25352];lev40_darthmala2;NM40ACDART03053_.mp3
Tell the truth, Bastila, you wanted to taste the dark side for yourself! You knew the only way the Council would permit you to explore the Sith's power was through Revan's lost memories!;[];;[25355];[25353];lev40_darthmala2;NM40ACDART03055_.mp3
"NO! I wanted to help you, Revan. I thought this mission would redeem you; that it would atone for your past crimes. How else could you be saved?";[];;[25356, 25358, 25365];[25354];lev40_darthmala2;NM40ACDART03057_.mp3
But what if I remembered who I really was?;[];;[25357];[25355, 25351];lev40_darthmala2;
You had to be healed so I could try and draw out the secrets of the Star Forge - it was our only hope of stopping the Sith! It was a risk the Council chose to take.;[];;[25358, 25365];[25356];lev40_darthmala2;NM40ACDART03059_.mp3
I understand, Bastila. You had no other choice.;[];;[25359];[25357, 25355, 25351, 25347, 25344, 25341];lev40_darthmala2;
"Forgiveness, Revan? You are weak; I was right to betray you. You are not fit to rule the Sith!";[];;[25360];[25358];lev40_darthmala2;NM40ACDART03069_.mp3
A small part of me has always regretted betraying you from afar. I always knew there were some who would think I acted out of fear, that I did not want to face you.;[];;[25361];[25359, 25367];lev40_darthmala2;NM40ACDART03071_.mp3
"But now fate has given me a second chance to prove myself. Once I defeat you in combat no one will question my claim to the Sith throne; my triumph will be complete!";[{'DarthMalak400': 'Pause'}];;[25362, 25364];[25360];lev40_darthmala2;NM40ACDART03073_.mp3
Your power is no match for the light!;[];;[25363];[25361];lev40_darthmala2;
The Jedi Council were foolish to let you live. I won't make the same mistake. We shall finish this alone in the ancient Sith tradition: master versus apprentice, as it was meant to be!;[{'DarthMalak400': 'Pause'}];;[];[25362, 25364];lev40_darthmala2;NM40ACDART03076_.mp3
Triumph, Malak? You seem to forget that I'm still alive!;[];Malak grabs PC, splits up party, has a throwdown with the player.;[25363];[25361];lev40_darthmala2;
You used me, Bastila! You're no better than the Sith!;[];;[25366];[25357, 25355, 25351, 25347, 25344];lev40_darthmala2;
How can you say that? Malak nearly killed you, but the Jedi Council gave you another chance to live! They gave you a chance to redeem yourself by defeating the Sith!;[];;[25367];[25365];lev40_darthmala2;NM40ACDART03038_.mp3
A rash and futile hope. The dark side is too strong, my power is too great! Even my old master is no longer a match for me!;[];;[25360];[25366];lev40_darthmala2;NM40ACDART03040_.mp3
But the memories I have... where did they come from?;[];;[25341];[25339];lev40_darthmala2;
Yes - I've seen Bastila in my visions! She was there!;[];;[25338];[25336];lev40_darthmala2;
How did they capture someone as powerful as Revan... I mean, me?;[];;[25371];[25333];lev40_darthmala2;
I helped them, Revan. I always knew that one day the title of Dark Lord would be mine! When the Jedi strike team boarded your vessel I saw my day had come.;[];;[25372];[25370];lev40_darthmala2;NM40ACDART03081_.mp3
I ordered my own ships to fire on your bridge. I thought I could destroy all my enemies with a single glorious victory! I never dreamed the Jedi would take you alive from the wreckage.;[];;[25334, 25337, 25373, 25376];[25371, 25379];lev40_darthmala2;NM40ACDART03086_.mp3
But why did you betray... your master?;[];;[25374];[25372];lev40_darthmala2;
You mean why did I betray you, Revan. You are the one who taught me the ways of the Sith: the strongest must rule if we are to survive!;[];;[25375];[25373];lev40_darthmala2;NM40ACDART03088_.mp3
You knew I would one day challenge you for supremacy, but you underestimated me. I acted sooner than you expected and seized the Sith throne with a single brilliant stroke!;[];;[25336];[25374];lev40_darthmala2;NM40ACDART03090_.mp3
Why wouldn't the Jedi simply kill me?;[];;[25377];[25372, 25333];lev40_darthmala2;
"The Jedi are fools; they do not believe in executing prisoners. Originally I assumed you had died in the battle. Imagine my surprise when I found out you were still alive, Revan.";[];;[25336];[25376];lev40_darthmala2;NM40ACDART03093_.mp3
Do you mean I'm really... your Master?;[];;[25379];[25333];lev40_darthmala2;
Once I served you, Revan, but I always knew that one day the title of Dark Lord would be mine! When the Jedi strike team boarded your vessel I saw my day had come.;[];;[25372];[25378];lev40_darthmala2;NM40ACDART03084_.mp3
I'm... Darth Revan? How is that possible?;[];;[25332];[25330];lev40_darthmala2;
Damn gizka...;[];;[];[None];yav47_gizkas;
3ab to the left, 3ad to the right;[];;[];[None];tar03_dlg_cpsp;
You're back! But where's Bastila? Is she alive? What happened inside that Temple?;[];;[25384, 25434, 25438];[None];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04000_.mp3
Bastila has fallen to the dark side. She fled to the Star Forge.;[{'Player': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[25385];[25383, 25439];unk41_carth;
The dark side? Bastila? No! No! How could that happen?;[{'': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[25386];[25384, 25436, 25437];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04002_.mp3
She was always in danger of being seduced by the dark side, Carth. Bastila was strong, but she was always impatient and headstrong. Malak preyed upon her weaknesses.;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[25387];[25385];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04003_.mp3
This planet is a tainted place, the Star Forge and the Temple have twisted the Force into an instrument of evil - just as Malak has twisted Bastila into a servant of the Sith.;[];;[25388, 25429, 25431, 25433];[25386];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04004_.mp3
She can still be saved, can't she?;[];;[25389];[25387];unk41_carth;
Malak has a strong hold on Bastila now - it will be difficult for her to break free of his influence. Especially considering her long association with you.;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[25390];[25388];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04006_.mp3
Remember the bond that was forged between you when she rekindled the spark that was your life. Through that bond she touched your memories... and also the echo of the dark taint within you.;[];;[25391];[25389, 25430, 25432];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04009_.mp3
But there's still hope for her, right? I mean, Revan rejected the dark side so Bastila could too, right? We still might be able to save her.;[];;[25392, 25427, 25428];[25390];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04010_.mp3
We can try... and we will.;[];;[25393, 25426];[25391];unk41_carth;
I don't know what fate awaits us, but I sense Bastila still has a role to play in the events to come. I have no doubt she will be waiting for us on the Star Forge.;[{'Juhani': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[25394, 25425];[25392, 25427, 25428];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04012_.mp3
No doubt. I must say that it's good to have you with us, my dear. For a minute there I thought you might decide... well, never mind what I thought.;[];;[25395];[25393];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04013_.mp3
Decide? Decide what?;[{'': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[25396, 25424];[25394];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04014_.mp3
Bastila tried to tempt her to the dark side, to reclaim Revan's heritage. She failed.;[];;[25397];[25395];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04015_.mp3
So... you did it? You turned against Revan once and for all? I knew she wasn't part of you anymore. I...I knew it.;[];;[25398, 25422, 25423];[25396, 25424];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04016_.mp3
Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Anything can still happen.;[];;[25399];[25397];unk41_carth;
I told you that you would have to make a choice eventually, that you would be tested. I think that was it, I...I can feel it.;[];;[25400];[25398, 25422, 25423];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04020_.mp3
And you did exactly what I'd hoped you would. It couldn't have been easy... I'm...I'm very proud of you.;[];;[25401, 25418, 25420];[25399];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04021_.mp3
It wasn't easy at all. Bastila made a good case.;[];;[25402];[25400];unk41_carth;
I'm sure she did. I can't say that any one of us wouldn't have been tempted.;[];;[25403];[25401];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04023_.mp3
I... I love you. And I...I can't wait until all of this is over with.;[];;[25404, 25413, 25417];[25402, 25419, 25421];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04028_.mp3
I love you, too.;[];;[25405];[25403];unk41_carth;
Hey! Sheesh... get a room, will ya?;[];;[25406];[25404];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04030_.mp3
That two spirits have found each other amidst such turmoil is a good omen, Mission. Does it not please you to see?;[];;[25407];[25405];unk41_carth;
Oh, sure. Even a good omen can get itself a room, though, don't ya think?;[];;[25408];[25406];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04032_.mp3
Well, I'm an old man and I know you should take love when you can find it. Good for you two, I say.;[];;[25409, 25411, 25412];[25407, 25416];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04037_.mp3
Beep! Beep-beep boop!!;[];;[25410, 25411];[25408];unk41_carth;
Answer: I have no idea what they speak of, droid. Organic meatbags are an eternal mystery to me.;[];;[25411, 25412];[25409];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04039_.mp3
Confidence is all well and good, Carth, but if we are going to catch up to Bastila we should leave soon, don't you think?;[];;[25412];[25410, 25409, 25408];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04040_.mp3
Okay - let's get moving. The longer we wait the harder this is going to be!;[{'': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[];[25411, 25410, 25408];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04041_.mp3
Hey, cool your engines there.;[];;[25414];[25403];unk41_carth;
Right. Sorry. I just... can't remember the last time I felt this happy. I can wait until the Star Forge is destroyed.;[];;[25415];[25413, 25417];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04034_.mp3
You make that sound so easy. Just fly over and boom, one less Star Forge in the universe, huh?;[];;[25416];[25414];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04035_.mp3
I feel more confident now than I ever did before. The Force is with us, Mission.;[];;[25408];[25415];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04036_.mp3
We've got a long way to go yet, Carth.;[];;[25414];[25403];unk41_carth;
I could never do what Bastila did.;[];;[25419];[25400];unk41_carth;
I know. I can't blame Bastila for being turned, however... she's...she's just so young and doesn't deserve this kind of fate.;[];;[25403];[25418];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04025_.mp3
Thank you. I appreciate the support.;[];;[25421];[25400];unk41_carth;
Always. I'm not certain any one of us wouldn't have been tempted by Bastila's offer.;[];;[25403];[25420];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04027_.mp3
I chose the light side. It's true.;[];;[25399];[25397];unk41_carth;
Once and for all? What are you talking about?;[];;[25399];[25397];unk41_carth;
Bastila tried to tempt her to the dark side, to reclaim Revan's heritage. She failed.;[];;[25397];[25395];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04043_.mp3
No doubt. Let's go, then, before she has time to organize a bigger welcoming committee.;[];;[];[25393, 25426];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04044_.mp3
I'm not sure what's in store for us, but I sense Bastila still has a role to play. I have no doubt she'll be waiting for us on the Star Forge.;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[25425];[25392, 25427, 25428];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04045_.mp3
It took the whole Jedi Council and a mind wipe to save me. What chance does she have?;[{'Player': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[25393, 25426];[25391];unk41_carth;
It's too late for her. Just accept it.;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[25393, 25426];[25391];unk41_carth;
I can't help but feel this is partly my fault.;[{'Player': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[25430];[25387];unk41_carth;
In the end we all choose our own path, but keep in mind the role that you played in her downfall. You and the task assigned to her by the Jedi Council.;[];;[25390];[25429, 25433];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04008_.mp3
Malak corrupted Bastila because she was weak.;[];;[25432];[25387];unk41_carth;
Weakness has nothing to do with the corruption of the dark side. A Jedi must always guard against pride and the desire for power. Especially you.;[{'Jolee': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[25390];[25431];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04049_.mp3
Bastila is lost to us now. She deserves to die.;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[25430];[25387];unk41_carth;
Bastila is dead, Carth. Malak killed her.;[{'Player': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[25435];[25383, 25439];unk41_carth;
Dead? I... I can't believe it.;[{'': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[25436, 25437];[25434];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04052_.mp3
She is not dead, Carth - though maybe that might have been easier for you to accept. She has fallen to the dark side and fled to the Star Forge.;[];;[25385];[25435];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04053_.mp3
She's not dead, Carth - though that might have been easier for you to accept. She's fallen to the dark side and fled to the Star Forge.;[];;[25385];[25435];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04054_.mp3
No time! We have to get off this planet and get to the Star Forge!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[25439];[25383];unk41_carth;

Bastila - you're alive! I was worried about you. For a minute there I was sure we'd never see you again once Malak got his... w... wait a minute.;[];;[25441, 25491];[None];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04057_.mp3
Where are Juhani and Jolee Bindo? Are they okay? What happened inside that temple?;[];;[25442, 25489, 25490];[25440];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04058_.mp3
I have reclaimed the title of Darth Revan! Bow before me!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[25443];[25441, 25491];unk41_carth;

The Jedi Council has failed, Carth - Darth Revan has been reborn! Together we will destroy Malak and seize control of his fleet, then use it to crush the Republic!;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[25445, 25488];[25443];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04061_.mp3
Juhani and Jolee would not swear loyalty to the new ruler of the Sith. They died for their foolishness. Now swear loyalty to Darth Revan, or face your own death!;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[25446, 25485];[25444];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04062_.mp3

This is my choice, Carth, whether you like it or not.;[];;[25451];[25449];unk41_carth;
I refuse to believe that! We'll...we'll stop you if we have to, all of us. We'll save you from yourselves!;[{'': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[25452, 25478, 25479];[25450, 25482];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04073_.mp3
Don't resist me, Carth, or I'll be forced to destroy you.;[];;[25453];[25451, 25481];unk41_carth;
Wait, Lord Revan. Carth speaks only for himself - he does not speak for the others. He may find he stands alone here!;[];;[25454];[25452, 25479, 25486];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04080_.mp3
The droids will continue to serve you Revan - they are programmed to obey their master. And there may be others who will choose to join us.;[];;[25455];[25453, 25478, 25487];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04081_.mp3
The Republic is doomed, Revan has returned! Who will now swear loyalty to the second coming of the Dark Lord?;[];;[25456];[25454];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04082_.mp3
You're Revan and I'll follow you anywhere. It doesn't matter who you're fighting against, I'll be at your side. Mandalorians don't have any great love for the Republic anyway.;[];;[25457];[25455];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04083_.mp3
Light side, dark side - it doesn't make any difference to me, Revan. I'll stick by you no matter what comes.;[];;[25458, 25475, 25476, 25477];[25456];unk41_carth;NM41AACART04084_.mp3

Kashyyyk... my home. I should have prepared you for coming here... but I don't know if I've prepared myself.;[];This dialogue is launched by the player crossing a trigger in 22aa, halfway between the Ebon Hawk and Eli Gand If Zaalbar ISN'T in the party, the dialogue fires ONCE for some other party member to say something. If Zaalbar is in the party later and croses the trigger, but the plot has not been completed, then this dialogue would launch again for him and him only (this would happen if the player left the Ebon Hawk, explored a bit of Kashyyyk but DID NOT talk to Chuundar, then returned to the ship and picked up Zaalbar);[25494, 25513];[None];22aa_zaalb01_01;
Prepared me? What do you mean?;[];;[25495];[25493];22aa_zaalb01_01;
I didn't leave Kashyyyk voluntarily. Mission must have told you how I was fleeing slavers... but there was more.;[{'Zaalbar': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[25496];[25494];22aa_zaalb01_01;
I am an exile. The slavers on Kashyyyk only took me after I was forced to leave my village home, 20 years ago.;[{'Zaalbar': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[25497, 25512];[25495, 25514];22aa_zaalb01_01;
Why were you forced to leave?;[];;[25498];[25496];22aa_zaalb01_01;
My brother made deals with the slavers and allowed them to get a foothold. I found out and attacked him.;[];;[25499];[25497];22aa_zaalb01_01;
The fight was stopped, but my father did not believe me when I told him about my brother's actions.;[{'Zaalbar': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[25500];[25498];22aa_zaalb01_01;
I was made an exile, disowned by my home and people. I should not be here. They will not accept me back.;[{'Zaalbar': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[25501, 25507, 25510];[25499];22aa_zaalb01_01;
Why didn't your father believe you?;[];;[25502];[25500, 25509];22aa_zaalb01_01;
When I attacked my brother I was so mad... I used my claws. You don't understand what that means to a Wookiee.;[];;[25503];[25501];22aa_zaalb01_01;
Our claws are tools, not weapons. To use them in battle is to become an animal. It is madness without honor.;[];;[25504];[25502];22aa_zaalb01_01;
I am forever a madclaw in the eyes of my people. Nothing I say is to be trusted. They were right to cast me out.;[{'Zaalbar': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[25505, 25507, 25510];[25503];22aa_zaalb01_01;
We'll deal with that if we have to. Let's go.;[];;[25506];[25504, 25509];22aa_zaalb01_01;
I don't have much hope.;[{'Zaalbar': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[];[25505];22aa_zaalb01_01;
Time has passed. Things will have changed.;[];;[25508];[25504, 25500];22aa_zaalb01_01;
The slavers are still here... this dock is theirs. I doubt anyone has risen to try and fight. Nothing has changed.;[];;[25509];[25507];22aa_zaalb01_01;
I just hope I can prove myself to my people. It will be difficult to make them listen. I just don't know.;[{'Zaalbar': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[25501, 25505, 25510];[25508];22aa_zaalb01_01;
That's enough. I'll learn the rest on my own.;[];;[25511];[25509, 25504, 25500];22aa_zaalb01_01;
Then stumble blindly. I won't speak of it again until it is in your face.;[];;[];[25510, 25512];22aa_zaalb01_01;
I don't care, I'll learn what I need myself.;[];;[25511];[25496];22aa_zaalb01_01;
It's a little late for warnings, fur ball.;[];;[25514];[25493];22aa_zaalb01_01;
Don't mock me, this is hard. Mission may have told you I was taken from here by slavers... but there is more.;[];;[25496];[25513];22aa_zaalb01_01;

I'm not saying that I know better than you, but this is Zaalbar's home. Don't you think he'd know some things?;[];;[25520];[25518];22aa_zaalb01_01;NM22AAZAAL01033_.mp3
Besides, he's got things here he needs to take care of.;[];;[];[25519];22aa_zaalb01_01;NM22AAZAAL01035_.mp3

Besides, I had to see for myself if it was true. Even now I can hardly believe my eyes... tell me, why did the Jedi spare you? Is it vengeance you seek at this reunion?;[];Inits dialog when player enters area 40.32 Leads to major revelation cutscene (done by animators) Comes back from cutscene and inits dialog Several actions have to happen - all action nodes are commented Conversation ends with Malak using force power to toss player into room 40.33, following him and then sealing the doors behind so that Carth and Bastila cannot come to help. When the player deals 100 damage to Malak another cutscene will run (the one where Bastila sacrifices herself to save the player);[25758, 25762, 25763];[25756];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03006_.mp3
Reunion? What are you talking about?;[];;[25759];[25757];lev40_darthmalak;
What? Ha-ha-ha! You mean you don't know? Ha-ha-ha! All this time, and you still haven't figured it out? Ha-ha-ha!;[];;[25760];[25758, 25762];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03008_.mp3
I wonder how long you would have stayed blind to the truth? Surely some of what you once were must have surfaced by now.;[];;[25761];[25759];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03010_.mp3
Even the combined power of the Jedi Council couldn't keep your true identity buried forever, could it?;[];;[];[25760, 25764];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03012_.mp3
Why did the Jedi spare me? I don't understand...;[];;[25759];[25757];lev40_darthmalak;
This meeting was inevitable, Malak!;[];;[25764];[25757];lev40_darthmalak;
As is the outcome. I am actually surprised this confrontation did not happen sooner, given how powerful your mind once was.;[];;[25761];[25763];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03016_.mp3
You cannot hide from what you once were, Revan! Recognize that you were once the Dark Lord - and know that I have taken your place!;[];;[25766, 25815];[None];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03018_.mp3
No... this is some type of trick! A Sith lie!;[];;[25767];[25765];lev40_darthmalak;
You do not yet remember, Revan? The Jedi set a trap. They lured us into battle against a small Republic fleet. During the attack a team of Jedi knights boarded your ship.;[];;[25768];[25766, 25815];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03020_.mp3
"The Jedi strike team captured you and the Council used the Force to reprogram your mind; they wiped away your identity and turned you against your own followers.";[];;[25769, 25805, 25811, 25813];[25767];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03022_.mp3
No, I don't believe you, Malak!;[];;[25770];[25768, 25807];lev40_darthmalak;
"You must have seen flashes of your old life in your dreams, Revan; memories bubbling up to the surface? Surely you must remember the battle in which you were captured?";[];;[25771];[25769];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03024_.mp3
"How you survived the final battle is a mystery to me. Perhaps you should ask Bastila; after all, she was part of the Jedi strike team that captured you!";[];;[25772, 25804];[25770, 25810, 25812];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03026_.mp3
Bastila, is this true?;[];;[25773];[25771, 25807];lev40_darthmalak;
It's true. I was part of the team sent to capture Revan... to capture you. When Malak fired on the ship you were badly injured. We thought you were dead.;[];;[25774];[25772, 25804];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03028_.mp3
Your mind was destroyed, but I used the Force to preserve the flicker of life in your body. I brought you to the Jedi Council. They were the ones who healed your damaged mind.;[];;[25775, 25803];[25773];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03030_.mp3
Then why don't I remember being Revan?;[];;[25776];[25774];lev40_darthmalak;
The Jedi Council didn't restore your wounded mind, Revan! They merely programmed it with a new identity - one loyal to the Republic! They tried to make you their slave!;[];;[25777, 25780, 25783, 25793];[25775, 25803];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03032_.mp3
You've been lying to me this whole time, Bastila!;[];;[25778];[25776, 25782, 25786];lev40_darthmalak;
I wanted to tell you, but the Council forbid it! They were afraid you might return to the dark side if you discovered your real identity!;[];;[25779];[25777];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03034_.mp3
But now you know the truth, Revan! The Council has failed in their attempt to make you their pawn! The will of a Sith Lord is not so easily manipulated!;[];;[25780, 25783, 25787, 25793, 25800];[25778];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03036_.mp3
Why not just let me die?;[];;[25781];[25779, 25786, 25776];lev40_darthmalak;
The Jedi hold all life sacred, even that of a Sith Lord. I could not just let you die, Revan. Not if it was possible to save you.;[];;[25782];[25780];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03043_.mp3
"Bastila hides the truth behind noble words, Revan! The Jedi needed the memories buried deep in your wounded mind; there was no other way to bring them out. They had to keep you alive!";[];;[25777, 25783, 25787, 25793, 25800];[25781];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03045_.mp3
But why program me with another identity?;[];;[25784];[25782, 25779, 25776];lev40_darthmalak;
"We couldn't simply restore your true identity; Revan was too dangerous. But locked inside your mind was information the Republic needed: the secrets of the Star Forge.";[];;[25785];[25783];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03047_.mp3
"The Council created an identity for you: a soldier under my command. Your subconscious memories were supposed to lead me to the Star Forge; there was no other way to get the information.";[];;[25786];[25784];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03049_.mp3
They made you their puppet, Revan - and Bastila was the handler pulling your strings!;[];;[25777, 25780, 25787, 25791, 25793, 25800];[25785];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03051_.mp3
Why you, Bastila? Why did the Council choose you?;[];;[25788];[25786, 25782, 25779];lev40_darthmalak;
When I used my Force powers to keep you alive on that bridge it created our bond. I convinced the Council that I could use that bond to draw out your memories and lead us to the Star Forge.;[];;[25789];[25787];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03053_.mp3
Tell the truth, Bastila, you wanted to taste the dark side for yourself! You knew the only way the Council would permit you to explore the Sith's power was through Revan's lost memories!;[];;[25790];[25788];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03055_.mp3
"NO! I wanted to help you, Revan. I thought this mission would redeem you; that it would atone for your past crimes. How else could you be saved?";[];;[25791, 25793, 25800];[25789];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03057_.mp3
But what if I remembered who I really was?;[];;[25792];[25790, 25786];lev40_darthmalak;
You had to be healed so I could try and draw out the secrets of the Star Forge - it was our only hope of stopping the Sith! It was a risk the Council chose to take.;[];;[25793, 25800];[25791];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03059_.mp3
I understand, Bastila. You had no other choice.;[];;[25794];[25792, 25790, 25786, 25782, 25779, 25776];lev40_darthmalak;
"Forgiveness, Revan? You are weak; I was right to betray you. You are not fit to rule the Sith!";[];;[25795];[25793];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03069_.mp3
A small part of me has always regretted betraying you from afar. I always knew there were some who would think I acted out of fear, that I did not want to face you.;[];;[25796];[25794, 25802];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03071_.mp3
"But now fate has given me a second chance to prove myself. Once I defeat you in combat no one will question my claim to the Sith throne; my triumph will be complete!";[];;[25797, 25799];[25795];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03073_.mp3
Your power is no match for the light!;[];;[25798];[25796];lev40_darthmalak;
The Jedi Council were foolish to let you live. I won't make the same mistake. We shall finish this alone in the ancient Sith tradition: master versus apprentice, as it was meant to be!;[];;[];[25797, 25799];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03076_.mp3
Triumph, Malak? You seem to forget that I'm still alive!;[];Malak grabs PC, splits up party, has a throwdown with the player.;[25798];[25796];lev40_darthmalak;
You used me, Bastila! You're no better than the Sith!;[];;[25801];[25792, 25790, 25786, 25782, 25779];lev40_darthmalak;
How can you say that? Malak nearly killed you, but the Jedi Council gave you another chance to live! They gave you a chance to redeem yourself by defeating the Sith!;[];;[25802];[25800];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03038_.mp3
A rash and futile hope. The dark side is too strong, my power is too great! Even my old master is no longer a match for me!;[];;[25795];[25801];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03040_.mp3
But the memories I have... where did they come from?;[];;[25776];[25774];lev40_darthmalak;
Yes - I've seen Bastila in my visions! She was there!;[];;[25773];[25771];lev40_darthmalak;
How did they capture someone as powerful as Revan... I mean, me?;[];;[25806];[25768];lev40_darthmalak;
I helped them, Revan. I always knew that one day the title of Dark Lord would be mine! When the Jedi strike team boarded your vessel I saw my day had come.;[];;[25807];[25805];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03081_.mp3
I ordered my own ships to fire on your bridge. I thought I could destroy all my enemies with a single glorious victory! I never dreamed the Jedi would take you alive from the wreckage.;[];;[25769, 25772, 25808, 25811];[25806, 25814];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03086_.mp3
But why did you betray... your master?;[];;[25809];[25807];lev40_darthmalak;
You mean why did I betray you, Revan. You are the one who taught me the ways of the Sith: the strongest must rule if we are to survive!;[];;[25810];[25808];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03088_.mp3
You knew I would one day challenge you for supremacy, but you underestimated me. I acted sooner than you expected and seized the Sith throne with a single brilliant stroke!;[];;[25771];[25809];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03090_.mp3
Why wouldn't the Jedi simply kill me?;[];;[25812];[25807, 25768];lev40_darthmalak;
"The Jedi are fools; they do not believe in executing prisoners. Originally I assumed you had died in the battle. Imagine my surprise when I found out you were still alive, Revan.";[];;[25771];[25811];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03093_.mp3
Do you mean I'm really... your Master?;[];;[25814];[25768];lev40_darthmalak;
Once I served you, Revan, but I always knew that one day the title of Dark Lord would be mine! When the Jedi strike team boarded your vessel I saw my day had come.;[];;[25807];[25813];lev40_darthmalak;NM40ACDART03084_.mp3

What are you doing here?;[];;[25916];[25914, 25961];unk41_ithor01;
We had crashed here when our mining survey vessel encountered some strange sort of energy field. It disrupted our engine and power system and forced us to make a crash landing on this world.;[];;[25917];[25915];unk41_ithor01;
Our ship sank far out to sea, but a handful of us were able to make it to this island... more than you see here, though.;[];;[25918, 25942, 25943];[25916];unk41_ithor01;
Where are the rest of your companions?;[];;[25919];[25917];unk41_ithor01;
Many have been killed at the hands of the locals. A few tried to swim to one of the closer islands, but we have not heard from them in many days.;[];;[25920];[25918, 25942];unk41_ithor01;
Of the 10 of us who remained here, we two are the only remaining survivors...;[];;[25921, 25930, 25934];[25919];unk41_ithor01;
The native creatures killed the others?;[];;[25922];[25920];unk41_ithor01;
They attack any they come across. They are barbaric savages who feast upon the bodies of the dead!;[];;[25923];[25921, 25945, 25947];unk41_ithor01;
The only beings who crash here that can hold them off are the Mandalorians, and we dare not go near them... we know of their depredations too well.;[];;[25924, 25936, 25938];[25922];unk41_ithor01;
There are Mandalorians here??;[];;[25925];[25923, 25941];unk41_ithor01;
Yes, there are. More than you might think, although that may just be because they aren't killed as easily as we are.;[];;[25926];[25924];unk41_ithor01;
With their weapons they raid and kill other survivors, and can fight off the natives as well. They seem to have some sort of invisibility or light cloaking shield that hides them until they strike.;[];;[25927, 25936, 25938];[25925];unk41_ithor01;
Where are they?;[];;[25928];[25926];unk41_ithor01;
They are north of here by a large temple structure. We dare not approach it, for they would surely kill us.;[];;[25929];[25927];unk41_ithor01;
But we cannot delay here much longer... The longer we stay, the more likely either the Mandalorians or the natives will find us and kill us.;[];;[25930, 25934, 25936];[25928, 25937];unk41_ithor01;
Why don't you try to get to one of the other islands?;[];;[25931];[25929, 25935, 25920];unk41_ithor01;
I believe that would be the best choice... The others have not returned, but it may be because they could find no way to.;[];;[25932];[25930];unk41_ithor01;
It would be worth the risk, rather than stay here and face certain death...;[];;[25933];[25931];unk41_ithor01;
I thank you one last time, human, for saving us. We shall remember you, and hope that, should you escape, you will tell the Republic of those of us stranded here.;[];;[];[25932];unk41_ithor01;
You could stay in our ship if you want.;[];;[25935];[25929, 25920];unk41_ithor01;
No, we dare not. If we remain here, it will only be a matter of time before the natives or the Mandalorians find us and kill us.;[];;[25930];[25934];unk41_ithor01;
Tell me of the natives.;[];;[25937];[25929, 25926, 25941, 25923];unk41_ithor01;
We know little beyond what we have told you already... savages who eat the dead and attack anyone on sight. If it were not for them, this world might almost be habitable...;[];;[25929];[25936];unk41_ithor01;
Has anyone found a way off this world?;[];;[25939];[25926, 25923];unk41_ithor01;
The Sith... we have seen Sith interceptors in the sky once or twice... They appear to be able to fly unimpeded through the field which forced us to crash. If we could somehow find a ship of theirs...;[];;[25940];[25938, 25953, 25954];unk41_ithor01;
But it is too much to hope for. The Sith would surely kill us on sight if we were found. Much better to hide and hope the Republic finds us here eventually.;[];;[25941];[25939];unk41_ithor01;
We believe they may have something to do with the large temple structure to the north of here. We have been suspicious of that structure since we landed, but we cannot approach it... the Mandalorians hunt in that area.;[];;[25924, 25936];[25940];unk41_ithor01;
What happened?;[];;[25919];[25917];unk41_ithor01;

How do you know I'm friendly to you?;[];;[25947];[25914, 25961];unk41_ithor01;
Why... why would you not be? All we survivors on this strange world must band together, else the marauding inhabitants would slaughter us all!;[];;[25922];[25946];unk41_ithor01;

Even the Sith would think twice before attacking Dantooine. There are many Jedi here, including several of the most powerful Masters of the Order. There is great strength within this place.;[];;[26100, 26105];[26098];ebo_bast_vision;NM12AABAST01002_.mp3

I don't have time for your visions, Bastila!;[];;[26119];[26108, 26125, 26128, 26132];ebo_bast_vision;
The visions are as much yours as mine - and they are the key to finding the Star Forge and stopping Malak!;[];;[26110, 26120, 26122, 26124];[26118];ebo_bast_vision;NM12AABAST01018_.mp3

If the Star Map is located far beneath us on the planet's surface, as our vision seems to suggest, it is unlikely the Wookiees even know of its existence.;[];;[26111];[26120];ebo_bast_vision;NM12AABAST01022_.mp3
The Star Map would likely have to be within some kind of shelter to protect it against dust and sandstorms.;[];;[26123];[26119, 26129, 26131];ebo_bast_vision;NM12AABAST01026_.mp3
I suspect there are many such caves and caverns hidden in the sands of the Dune Sea. The creatures of this world probably use them as their lairs.;[];;[26111];[26122];ebo_bast_vision;NM12AABAST01027_.mp3
The ocean floor is vast and much of it is uncharted, even by the native Selkath. But how could Revan and Malak have found their way down?;[];;[26111];[26119, 26133, 26135];ebo_bast_vision;NM12AABAST01032_.mp3
Kashyyyk is a lush but simple and undeveloped world. I would not have expected to find the alien technology of a Star Map here.;[];;[26118, 26126, 26127];[26107, 26136, 26137];ebo_bast_vision;NM12AABAST01019_.mp3

Do you think the Wookiees are involved?;[];;[26120];[26125];ebo_bast_vision;
Tatooine is known for little but blowing sand. I find it surprising that there would be a Star Map somewhere in its desolate wastes.;[];;[26118, 26129, 26130];[26107, 26136, 26137];ebo_bast_vision;NM12AABAST01024_.mp3

Maybe Tatooine wasn't always a desert.;[];;[26131];[26128];ebo_bast_vision;
Perhaps, though that would have been tens of thousands of years in the past. Now there is nothing but the howling emptiness of the Dune Sea.;[];;[26122];[26130];ebo_bast_vision;NM12AABAST01029_.mp3
"It is strange that anyone would have built a Star Map here; the entire surface of Manaan is covered by nothing but vast oceans.";[];;[26118, 26133, 26134];[26107, 26136, 26137];ebo_bast_vision;NM12AABAST01030_.mp3

Maybe the land was once above the surface.;[];;[26135];[26132];ebo_bast_vision;
It is possible. The melting of polar caps or a cataclysmic earthquake could have buried the land beneath the waves eons ago. Records from that time are incomplete.;[];;[26124];[26134];ebo_bast_vision;NM12AABAST01034_.mp3

What do you know of the Council?;[];;[26183];[26170, 26164, 26192];dan13_tareelok;
They are great and powerful Jedi, all. Do not be intimidated by them, however. If there is something you wish to know from them, merely ask.;[];;[26170];[26182];dan13_tareelok;
What is this Cortosis ore you mentioned?;[];;[26185];[26170, 26164, 26192];dan13_tareelok;
The Cortosis mineral is a rare and unique substance that has the property of being able to deflect the beam of a lightsaber.;[];;[26186];[26184];dan13_tareelok;
Although the process for forging it into blades was developed by the Echani for their dueling culture, it has since spread across the galaxy.;[];;[26187];[26185];dan13_tareelok;
The Sith have taken to providing blades of this type to their mercenaries and pawns, so that they would prove more effective against us.;[];;[26188];[26186];dan13_tareelok;
It does raise the possibility of those same mercenaries being effective against their Sith masters in turn, but given the overpowering military might of the Sith at the moment, it is unlikely.;[];;[26170];[26187];dan13_tareelok;

Alas, even a poor Hutt businessman is not exempt from the fires of the conflict that now rage between the Sith and the Republic.;[];;[26348];[26346];dan13_shuma;
The world my business was based on, Neka, was subject to a most unexpected and unfortunate attack by the Sith armada.;[];;[26349];[26347];dan13_shuma;
The space lanes were clear one day, then the next they were filled with Sith interceptors and closed to traffic.;[];;[26350];[26348];dan13_shuma;
I had under my employ - quite unwittingly, of course - certain transport pilots who knew ways to slip me past the blockade above that world.;[];;[26351];[26349];dan13_shuma;
That is the only means by which I managed to escape Neka before the Sith commander deemed it worthless and virus-bombed all intelligent life from it...;[];;[26352];[26350];dan13_shuma;
It gives one a new appreciation of the value of the... sometimes troubling Jedi Order.;[];;[26353];[26351];dan13_shuma;
Is there anything else you wish?;[];;[26344, 26354, 26360];[26352];dan13_shuma;
You're a Hutt!;[];;[26355];[26353, 26345, 26343, 26362, 26363, 26364];dan13_shuma;
Hahaha! You are most perceptive, I see! Not many people can tell that at first glance.;[{'': 'Talk_Laughing'}];;[26356];[26354];dan13_shuma;
But I know that is not what you meant. I labor under the misconceptions and biases against my species.;[];;[26357];[26355];dan13_shuma;
We have the unfortunate reputation, you see, of being criminals and murderers and worse...;[];;[26358];[26356];dan13_shuma;
But I am merely a businessman who has been cast out from his home in this most cruel war. Your Council has seen fit to grant me asylum here away from the dangers in this sector.;[];;[26359];[26357];dan13_shuma;
But enough about my troubles. What more would you have of me?;[];;[26344, 26346, 26360];[26358];dan13_shuma;
I must be going now.;[];;[26361];[26359, 26353, 26345, 26343, 26362, 26363, 26364];dan13_shuma;
Good luck to you then, in all your endeavors. Should you come back to me, I would be grateful for any conversation.;[];;[];[26360];dan13_shuma;

Who's that with you?;[];;[26478];[26476];missdoor_dlg;
These are my new friends, Big Z. Without them I never could have got you out.;[];;[26479, 26522, 26523];[26477];missdoor_dlg;NM05AAZAAL03003_.mp3
Good to meet you, Zaalbar. I'm <FullName>.;[];;[26480];[26478];missdoor_dlg;
"You know the language of my people? That is rare among your species; I am impressed.";[];;[26481];[26479, 26522, 26523];missdoor_dlg;
You have saved me from a life of servitude and slavery. There is only one way I can ever repay such an act: I will swear a lifedebt to you.;[];;[26482];[26480];missdoor_dlg;
A lifedebt? Are you sure about that, Big Z? Think about it carefully. You better be sure about this.;[];;[26483];[26481];missdoor_dlg;NM05AAZAAL03006_.mp3
I am sure, Mission. This is an issue of great importance to me. Because of our great physical strength, Wookiees are being used as slave labor on our own homeworld.;[];;[26484];[26482];missdoor_dlg;
"They see us as brutes and animals to be exploited. Over the years slavers have taken many of my people; we must always be on guard against raids against our villages.";[];;[26485];[26483];missdoor_dlg;
When the Gamorreans captured me, I thought I was doomed to a life of servitude. I have been saved from such a fate, and the only way I can repay that is through a lifedebt.;[];;[26486];[26484];missdoor_dlg;
Big Z swearing a Wookiee lifedebt to you. Wow - this is major. Do you realize what this means?;[];;[26487, 26517, 26518, 26520];[26485];missdoor_dlg;NM05AAZAAL03010_.mp3
It's some kind of loyalty vow, isn't it?;[];;[26488];[26486];missdoor_dlg;
A lifedebt is the most solemn vow a Wookiee can make. It means he'll stay by your side for the rest of your life - wherever you go, whatever you do, Zaalbar will be with you.;[];;[26489];[26487, 26517, 26519, 26521];missdoor_dlg;NM05AAZAAL03013_.mp3

I'm honored to accept his vow.;[];;[26491];[26489];missdoor_dlg;
I guess this means you're stuck with me too. Wherever Big Z goes, I'm going. I almost lost him once - it's not going to happen again.;[];;[26492, 26511, 26513];[26490, 26515];missdoor_dlg;NM05AAZAAL03016_.mp3
I'm glad to have you aboard, Mission.;[];;[26493];[26491];missdoor_dlg;
So... I guess I still owe you one secret path into the Vulkar base. That was the deal, wasn't it? Don't worry, I know a backdoor into that scum den!;[];;[26494, 26510];[26492, 26512];missdoor_dlg;NM05AAZAAL03018_.mp3
Good. The sooner we get there the better.;[];;[26495];[26493];missdoor_dlg;
I better come with you - the Vulkars put up a force shield to keep the sewer dwellers out. I'm one of the only non-Vulkars on Taris who can get you past it.;[];;[26496];[26494, 26510];missdoor_dlg;NM05AAZAAL03020_.mp3
I can't remember exactly how to get there, but I know it was somewhere here in the sewers. Over to the northeast, if I remember right. I just hope the rancor monster isn't still there.;[];;[26497, 26507, 26508];[26495];missdoor_dlg;NM05AAZAAL03021_.mp3
Rancor? Are you serious!;[];;[26498];[26496];missdoor_dlg;
There used to be a rancor monster that made its nest in that part of the sewers. Pretty much eats anything it can get its claws on. That thing is huge!;[];;[26499];[26497, 26507];missdoor_dlg;NM05AAZAAL03023_.mp3
Luckily rancors aren't too bright. I was able to sneak past it before, so I'm sure we'll figure something out. That is, unless you want to change your mind.;[];;[26500, 26505, 26506];[26498, 26509];missdoor_dlg;NM05AAZAAL03024_.mp3
That's not really an option. Let's go.;[];;[26501];[26499];missdoor_dlg;
Okay then, off we go. Like I said, somewhere to the south-east. Just look for the force shield and we'll know we're there.;[];;[26502];[26500, 26505, 26506];missdoor_dlg;NM05AAZAAL03026_.mp3

A rancor monster? Good - I'm spoiling for a fight!;[];;[26509];[26496];missdoor_dlg;
You did a good job mopping up those Gamorreans, but I don't think you want to take on a rancor! Those things are huge!;[];;[26499];[26508];missdoor_dlg;NM05AAZAAL03031_.mp3

Why won't this nightmare end!;[];;[26512];[26491];missdoor_dlg;
I don't want a Wookiee following me around all the time!;[];;[26515];[26489];missdoor_dlg;
Sorry, but there's not much you can do about it. Zaalbar's already sworn the lifedebt and it's not something they can just take back. This is a sacred, irreversible vow.;[];;[26491];[26514, 26516];missdoor_dlg;NM05AAZAAL03037_.mp3

I've always wanted a Wookiee slave!;[];;[26521];[26486];missdoor_dlg;

Well, you've been slipping in and out of consciousness for a couple of days now, so I imagine you're pretty confused about things. Try not to worry. We're safe... at least for the moment.;[];;[27192];[27190, 27266, 27267, 27268];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02005_.mp3
We're in an abandoned apartment on the planet of Taris. You were banged up pretty bad when our escape pod crashed, but luckily I wasn't seriously hurt.;[];;[27193];[27191];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02006_.mp3
I was able to drag you away from our crash site in all the confusion, and I stumbled onto this abandoned apartment. By the time the Sith arrived on the scene we were long gone.;[];;[27194, 27263, 27265];[27192];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02007_.mp3
The Sith?;[];;[27195];[27193];tar02_carth022;
Taris is under Sith control. Their fleet is orbiting the planet, they've declared martial law and they've imposed a planet-wide quarantine. But I've been in worse spots.;[];;[27196];[27194, 27264, 27265];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02012_.mp3
I saw on your service records that you understand a remarkable number of alien languages. That's pretty rare in a raw recruit, but it should come in handy while we're stranded on a foreign world.;[];;[27197];[27195];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02013_.mp3
There's no way the Republic will be able to get anyone through the Sith blockade to help us. If we're going to find Bastila and get off this planet, we can't rely on anybody but ourselves.;[];;[27198, 27262];[27196];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02014_.mp3
Why is it so important to find Bastila?;[];;[27199];[27197];tar02_carth022;
That smack to your head did more damage than I thought. Bastila's a Jedi. She was with the strike team that killed Darth Revan, Malak's Sith master.;[];;[27200];[27198, 27262];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02016_.mp3
Bastila is the key to the whole Republic war effort. The Sith must have found out she was on the Endar Spire and set an ambush for us in this system.;[];;[27201];[27199];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02017_.mp3
I believe Bastila was on one of the escape pods that crashed down here on Taris. For the sake of the Republic war effort, we have to try and find her.;[];;[27202, 27212, 27255, 27256, 27259];[27200];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02018_.mp3
How can one person, even a Jedi, be so important?;[];;[27203];[27201, 27258, 27261];tar02_carth022;
Bastila is no ordinary Jedi. She has a rare gift the Jedi call Battle Meditation. Bastila's power can influence entire armies.;[];;[27204];[27202];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02020_.mp3
Through the Force Bastila can inspire her allies with confidence and make her enemies lose their will to fight. Often, that's all it takes to tip the balance in a battle.;[];;[27205];[27203];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02021_.mp3
Of course, there are limits to what she can do. But from what I understand of her ability, it requires great concentration and focus to maintain her Battle Meditation.;[];;[27206];[27204];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02022_.mp3
The attack on the Endar Spire happened so fast she never had a chance to use her Battle Meditation. Like us, she barely got out alive.;[];;[27207, 27255, 27256, 27259];[27205];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02023_.mp3
So what do you suggest we do next?;[];;[27208];[27206, 27261, 27258];tar02_carth022;
Bastila's going to need our help. Many of Darth Malak's followers can use the dark side of the Force, and the Sith have already killed more than their share of Jedi in this war.;[];;[27209];[27207, 27255];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02026_.mp3
"Nobody will be looking for a couple of common soldiers like us. And if we're careful we can move about the planet without attracting notice; a luxury Bastila won't have.";[];;[27210];[27208];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02027_.mp3
She's going to have half the Sith fleet looking for her. They know how important she is to the war effort.;[];;[27211];[27209];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02028_.mp3
The whole planet is under quarantine. No ships can land or take-off. So if Bastila's going to escape Taris, she's going to need our help. And we'll probably need hers.;[];;[27212, 27245, 27252, 27253];[27210];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02038_.mp3
Any idea where we should start looking for Bastila?;[];;[27213];[27211, 27201];tar02_carth022;
While you were out I did some scouting around. There are reports of a couple escape pods crashing down into the Undercity. That's probably a good place to start.;[];;[27214];[27212, 27248];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02040_.mp3
But the Undercity is a dangerous place. We don't want to go in there unprepared. It won't do Bastila any good if we go and get ourselves killed.;[];;[27215, 27237, 27241];[27213];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02041_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;[];;[27216];[27214];tar02_carth022;
I'll tell you whatever I can, though I...I don't know how much help it'll be.;[];;[27217, 27229, 27234, 27241];[27215, 27226];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02050_.mp3

Everything I know about Malak is pretty much common knowledge. He escaped the trap that killed Darth Revan, his Sith Master. With Revan's death, Malak became the new Dark Lord.;[];;[27219];[27217];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02055_.mp3
It's obvious that Malak's a ruthless tyrant who'll crush anyone who stands in his way... just like Revan was. Experience has shown that the Sith won't stop until the Republic lies in ruins.;[];;[27220];[27218];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02056_.mp3
Malak and his Sith don't respect anything except raw, brutal power. It's hard to imagine how someone who used to be a Jedi could become such a monster!;[];;[27221, 27226, 27227, 27237, 27242];[27219];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02057_.mp3
A Jedi? What do you mean?;[];;[27222];[27220];tar02_carth022;
Malak and Revan were once both part of the Jedi Order, but they were young and headstrong. And against the wishes of the Council they went to battle the Mandalorians on the Outer Rim.;[];;[27223];[27221];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02059_.mp3
Something happened out there. Something corrupted them and drew them over to the dark side. Or maybe there was something rotten inside them all along. I don't know.;[];;[27224];[27222];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02060_.mp3
They formed an army of ex-Republic soldiers and Jedi who had fallen to the dark side, with Revan at their head... until Revan was killed by Bastila's Jedi strike team.;[];;[27225];[27223];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02061_.mp3
But even that didn't slow the Sith down. Malak just stepped in and assumed Revan's role. He took control of the Sith armada and resumed the bloody conquest of the Outer Worlds.;[];;[27226, 27227, 27237, 27242];[27224];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02062_.mp3
I want to ask you something else.;[];;[27216];[27225, 27244, 27220];tar02_carth022;
Don't worry. We'll find a way to stop the Sith.;[];;[27228];[27225, 27244, 27220];tar02_carth022;
I hope you're right. But the Republic hasn't been able to stop them so far, even with the support of the Jedi Council. I think Bastila might be the galaxy's last hope.;[];;[27229, 27237];[27227];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02067_.mp3
What can you tell me about this planet we're on?;[];;[27230];[27228, 27236, 27216];tar02_carth022;
Taris was once a magnificent planet-wide metropolis of towering skyscrapers. But that was a long time ago.;[];;[27231];[27229];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02071_.mp3
The Upper City, where the rich citizens live, is...is still pretty safe. If it wasn't for the Sith occupation and the planet-wide quarantine it might not even be that bad a place to live.;[];;[27232];[27230];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02072_.mp3
But farther down things have degenerated. The...the Lower City is nothing but a slum overrun by swoop-bike gangs waging a never-ending war for control. And the Undercity is, well, even worse.;[];;[27233];[27231];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02073_.mp3
"The lowest level of Taris is a wasteland overrun by rakghouls; mindless, diseased mutants that attack on sight. I've already entered all this info into your data-pad journal.";[];;[27217, 27234, 27237, 27241];[27232];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02074_.mp3
I'd like to know some more about you, Carth.;[];;[27235];[27233, 27216];tar02_carth022;
"I understand why you want to know more about me; I...I kinda get the feeling we'll be spending a lot of time together over the next while.";[];;[27236];[27234];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02052_.mp3
"But this isn't really the best time for long introductions; we should stay focused on the task at hand. There'll be time for that later.";[];;[27217, 27229, 27237];[27235];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02053_.mp3
The sooner we start looking for Bastila the sooner we find her. Let's go.;[];;[27238];[27236, 27233, 27228, 27244, 27225, 27220, 27214];tar02_carth022;
Good idea. We can use this abandoned apartment as a base, and we can probably get some equipment and supplies here in the Upper City. Just remember to keep a low profile.;[];;[27239];[27237, 27241];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02077_.mp3
I've heard some grim stories about the Dark Jedi interrogation techniques. They say the Force can do terrible things to a mind. It can wipe away your memories and destroy your very identity!;[];;[27240];[27238];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02078_.mp3
But I figure if we don't do anything stupid we should be okay. I mean, after all, they're... they're looking for Bastila, not a couple of grunts like us. Alright, soldier, let's move out.;[];;[];[27239];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02079_.mp3
Come on. I want to scout this planet out a bit.;[];;[27238];[27233, 27216, 27214];tar02_carth022;
Sounds like Malak and the Sith have the right idea.;[];;[27243];[27225, 27220];tar02_carth022;
How can you say that? The Sith are butchers! Soldiers, civilians - I mean, they don't care who they kill! Even...even children!;[];;[27244];[27242];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02064_.mp3
Right now the Republic is the only thing keeping Malak's brutal fist from crushing the entire galaxy... and it won't be long until even the Republic falls to the Sith fleet.;[];;[27226, 27227, 27237];[27243];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02065_.mp3
What's in this for me if I help you out?;[];;[27246];[27211];tar02_carth022;
You mean besides a chance to get off this planet before the Sith find you? Do you...do you have any idea what the Sith do to prisoners of war?;[];;[27247, 27249, 27252];[27245];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02082_.mp3
Okay, you made your point. I'll help you out.;[];;[27248];[27246, 27251, 27254];tar02_carth022;
Good. We need to work together if we're going to survive.;[];;[27213];[27247, 27252];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02084_.mp3
If you want my help you better make it worth my while.;[];;[27250];[27246, 27254];tar02_carth022;
Oh, I get it. Never mind that the Sith will destroy the Republic and ravage the galaxy. You're only in this for the credits.;[];;[27251];[27249];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02086_.mp3
Don't worry. The Republic pays its mercenaries well. You help me find Bastila and they'll make it more than worth your while, I'm sure. Plus, it might be your only chance to get off Taris.;[];;[27247, 27252];[27250];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02087_.mp3
If it means getting off this planet, I guess I can help you find Bastila.;[];;[27248];[27251, 27246, 27254, 27211];tar02_carth022;
I think I'll take my chances on my own.;[];;[27254];[27211];tar02_carth022;
Don't be a fool! You're not getting off this world without help, and you can't hide here forever. Do you have any idea what will happen when the Sith find you?;[];;[27247, 27249, 27252];[27253];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02089_.mp3
If Bastila's a Jedi, she can probably look after herself.;[];;[27208];[27206, 27258, 27261, 27201];tar02_carth022;
How do you even know Bastila's still alive?;[];;[27257];[27206, 27261, 27201];tar02_carth022;
I don't. But Bastila's young, and she has a powerful command of the Force. We survived the crash landing, so I'm willing to bet that she may have, too.;[];;[27258];[27256];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02093_.mp3
Besides, what's the alternative? I mean, if she's dead, then no one can stop Malak and his Sith from wiping out the Republic. And I'd rather operate on the assumption that she survived.;[];;[27202, 27207, 27255, 27259];[27257];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02094_.mp3
Forget it! I'm not risking my life to try and save her!;[];;[27260];[27258, 27206, 27201];tar02_carth022;
I don't think you understand the situation. We can't hide on this planet forever. Eventually the Sith will find us... and, trust me, you don't want that.;[];;[27261];[27259];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02096_.mp3
Getting off this world isn't going to be easy... we'll probably need Bastila's help. Not to mention that without her, the whole Republic war effort is doomed.;[];;[27202, 27207, 27255, 27256];[27260];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02097_.mp3
Bastila? She's the one from the Endar Spire, right?;[];;[27199];[27197];tar02_carth022;
I guess I owe you my life. Thanks.;[];;[27264];[27193];tar02_carth022;
You don't have to thank me. I've never abandoned anyone on a mission, and I'm not about to start now. Besides, I'm going to need your help.;[];;[27195];[27263];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02010_.mp3
So are we just going to wait here for the Republic to rescue us?;[];;[27195];[27193];tar02_carth022;
Right. I'm <FullName>, by the way. How did we get here?;[];;[27191];[27188];tar02_carth022;
Carth, the one on the communicator. I remember.;[];;[27191];[27188];tar02_carth022;
Where am I? How did I get here?;[];;[27191];[27188];tar02_carth022;
Whoa, hold on. Don't try to get up yet. You were smashed up pretty bad when we crash landed here on Taris.;[];;[27270];[None];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02000_.mp3
Don't worry, we should be safe here in this apartment. I gave you something to help you sleep. Just get some rest and let the kolto packs do their job.;[];Fade To Black;[];[27269];tar02_carth022;NM02AACART02001_.mp3
[This unsavory looking man appears to be looking for someone... maybe even one of your companions back on the Ebon Hawk.];[];;[];[None];k_hxor_dialog_k;
*grunt* What the hell is your kind doing here? Bad enough I have to deal with all these other idiots, but now there's a stinkin' Cathar on this world too?;[];;[27273];[None];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15000_.mp3
I have as much right to be here as you do, SIR!;[];;[27274, 27327, 27329];[27272];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15002_.mp3
Do not seek to aggravate us.;[];;[27275, 27326];[27273];k_hxor_dialog_k;
Ooooo! Big man, the Jedi, shooting his mouth off from behind a lightsaber, or whatever you're carrying.;[];;[27276];[27274, 27329];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15082_.mp3
Hiding behind your pet Cathar... And a woman at that!;[];;[27277];[27275, 27326];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15084_.mp3
We should have exterminated all you Cathar when we had the chance.;[];;[27278];[27276];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15086_.mp3
Wha... What do you know about my world?;[];;[27279];[27277, 27328];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15007_.mp3
I know enough that... Hey, wait a minute... you look familiar somehow...;[];;[27280];[27278];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15009_.mp3
What? You...;[];;[27281, 27324, 27325];[27279];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15011_.mp3
Do you two know each other?;[];;[27282];[27280];k_hxor_dialog_k;
This doesn't concern you, Jedi trash.;[];;[27283];[27281, 27324, 27325];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15015_.mp3
Hm... now where could I have... No, he's dead and she likely is too. I...;[];;[27284];[27282];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15017_.mp3
What are you talking about??;[];;[27285];[27283];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15019_.mp3
Maybe I was wrong. Still, I think a specimen like you would be a nice addition to my collection.;[];;[27286];[27284];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15021_.mp3
So what would it take, Jedi, for you to sell your pet here to me?;[];;[27287, 27320, 27321];[27285];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15023_.mp3
She is not for sale!;[];;[27288];[27286, 27301];k_hxor_dialog_k;
Now don't be so selfish. We both know Cathar aren't real people anyway.;[];;[27289];[27287, 27320, 27323];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15025_.mp3
The females make amusing pets, but males should be put down like the animals they are. I remember one time on Taris...;[];;[27290];[27288];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15027_.mp3
What?! WHAT DID YOU SAY?!;[];;[27291, 27318, 27319];[27289];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15029_.mp3
What are you saying?;[];;[27292];[27290];k_hxor_dialog_k;
WHAT DID YOU DO ON TARIS, YOU SCUM?!;[];;[27293];[27291, 27318, 27319];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15031_.mp3
Put one of you down like the animals you are. So easy... then I saw one of the females on the auction block, but those darn Jedi...;[];;[27294];[27292];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15033_.mp3
It was you!;[];;[27295];[27293];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15035_.mp3
What? Me? Oh ho! Now I recognize where I've seen that face before.;[];;[27296];[27294];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15037_.mp3
You were the little Cathar I was going to purchase. But those Jedi came and stole my pet away from me!;[];;[27297, 27316, 27317];[27295];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15039_.mp3
You bought Juhani?;[];;[27298];[27296];k_hxor_dialog_k;
When I was fighting with the Mandalorians against the Cathar, I developed an appreciation for these creatures. They make excellent servants if properly trained.;[];;[27299];[27297, 27316, 27317];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15041_.mp3
You Jedi act all prim and proper, but inside you must feel the same way I do about the lesser, non-human species. The Sith at least let their feelings show on the outside.;[];;[27300];[27298];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15043_.mp3
You... My homeworld...;[];;[27301];[27299];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15045_.mp3
Come now, will you let your pet go? I'm sure we can come up with a price we both think is fair.;[];;[27287, 27302, 27315];[27300];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15047_.mp3
You'll only hurt her if I let her go.;[];;[27303];[27301];k_hxor_dialog_k;
NO, I WILL NOT BE SOLD!;[];;[27304];[27302, 27315];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15051_.mp3
And I will see you dead for what you have done to my people!;[];;[27305];[27303];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15053_.mp3
Uh... hold on a second! Don't be hasty!;[];;[27306, 27311, 27313];[27304];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15055_.mp3
Do not fall to the dark side again, Juhani.;[];;[27307];[27305];k_hxor_dialog_k;
I... I will remain calm. I am a Jedi now.;[];;[27308];[27306, 27312];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15057_.mp3
My lust for vegeance must be curbed.;[];;[27309];[27307, 27314];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15059_.mp3
Yes, yes... Say no to the dark side...;[]; backs away from the conversation;[27310];[27308];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15061_.mp3
But I will have you yet! Heh.;[]; from far away  runs and disappears;[];[27309];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15063_.mp3
There is no emotion...;[];;[27312];[27305, 27352];k_hxor_dialog_k;
...There is peace.;[];;[27307];[27311];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15066_.mp3
Let's get him!;[];;[27314];[27305];k_hxor_dialog_k;
Yes, we.... NO! I must not fall prey to the dark side again.;[];;[27308];[27313];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15069_.mp3
Show me the money first.;[];;[27303];[27301];k_hxor_dialog_k;
You were buying Cathar slaves?;[];;[27298];[27296];k_hxor_dialog_k;
What are you talking about?;[];;[27298];[27296];k_hxor_dialog_k;
You were on Taris?;[];;[27292];[27290];k_hxor_dialog_k;
Calm down, Juhani.;[];;[27292];[27290];k_hxor_dialog_k;
She is her own person.;[];;[27288];[27286];k_hxor_dialog_k;
Well... what are you offering?;[];;[27322];[27286];k_hxor_dialog_k;
Heh, I knew we could work something out.;[];;[27323];[27321];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15077_.mp3
I am not for sale!;[];;[27288];[27322];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15079_.mp3
We should just leave, Juhani.;[];;[27282];[27280];k_hxor_dialog_k;
You annoy me, worm.;[];;[27282];[27280];k_hxor_dialog_k;
Ooooo! Big woman, the Jedi, shooting her mouth off from behind a lightsaber, or whatever you're carrying.;[];;[27276];[27274, 27329];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15088_.mp3
Just ignore him, Juhani.;[];;[27328];[27273];k_hxor_dialog_k;
Heh, yeah, do like the Jedi tells you and back off! Your people are pathetic, it's no wonder we crushed your world so easily.;[];;[27278];[27327];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15005_.mp3
A big mouth like that can get you killed.;[];;[27275, 27326];[27273];k_hxor_dialog_k;
Ack! *cough* Heh, you seem to have defeated me, Cathar worm, but I'll have the last laugh in the end!;[];;[27331];[None];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15090_.mp3
What do you mean?;[];;[27332, 27367, 27369];[27330];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15092_.mp3
Yes, what do you mean?;[];;[27333];[27331];k_hxor_dialog_k;
*cough* You may have killed me here, today, but I had the pleasure of killing off your species!;[];;[27334];[27332, 27368, 27369];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15094_.mp3
Not everyone who fought alongside the Mandalorians did it for their stupid concept of 'honor'. Some of us did it just for the pleasure: the pleasure of seeing your world burn.;[];;[27335];[27333];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15096_.mp3
You... you animal! You wretch!;[];;[27336];[27334];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15098_.mp3
*cough* *cough* Heh, but I'm beyond your petty vengeance now, girl. You can never have your revenge!;[];;[27337, 27364, 27365];[27335];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15100_.mp3
Do not give in to the dark side, Juhani.;[];;[27338];[27336];k_hxor_dialog_k;
I will not give him the satisfaction of seeing me give in to the dark side.;[];;[27339];[27337, 27364];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15103_.mp3
Worm!;[];;[27340];[27338, 27366];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15108_.mp3
I killed your people on Cathar in the sky, on the ground, in their homes. I hunted them down like the animals they were, just to see them burn.;[];;[27341];[27339];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15110_.mp3
But the treacherous beasts fought back and left me with injuries that meant I could never fight again... or so they thought!;[];;[27342, 27361, 27362];[27340];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15112_.mp3
Stop trying to provoke her!;[];;[27343];[27341];k_hxor_dialog_k;
No, I will not give in to him.;[];;[27344];[27342, 27361, 27363];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15114_.mp3
I ended up in the Lower City of Taris, and what did I find? A few of those stinking beasts living there!;[];;[27345];[27343];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15116_.mp3
The male was easy enough to best, but the females proved elusive. I didn't know what happened to them after I killed the male, until I saw this cursed woman on the auction block.;[];;[27346];[27344];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15118_.mp3
But then the Jedi came and ruined everything before I could have my revenge... *cough*;[];;[27347];[27345];k_hxor_dialog_k;NGLOBEHXOR15120_.mp3

Revan - I knew you'd come for me. Malak thought you might be afraid to enter the Temple again, but he doesn't know you like I do. Not anymore. Not since you've changed.;[];;[27507, 27535];[None];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01001_.mp3
Quickly, Bastila - come with us! We have to escape before Malak arrives!;[];;[27508];[27506];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01002_.mp3
"Escape? You don't understand. I have sworn allegiance to Lord Malak and the Sith; I am no longer a pawn of the Jedi Council.";[];;[27509, 27533];[27507, 27535];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01003_.mp3
No, Bastila! Don't go over to the dark side!;[];;[27510];[27508];unk44_evilbast2;
You say that as if the dark side is some terrible entity. The Jedi Council has brainwashed you like all the others. Like they once did with me.;[];;[27511];[27509];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01005_.mp3
They speak of the dark side as if it something to be feared. But in reality their only goal is to manipulate those who are strong in the Force. The fear of the dark side is a tool to maintain control.;[];;[27512];[27510, 27534];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01006_.mp3
Why do you think the Jedi forbid you and Malak from joining the Mandalorian Wars? They knew you would realize your true potential and break free of their domination.;[];;[27513];[27511];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01007_.mp3
Malak has shown me how the Jedi Council have been using me the same way they once tried to use you. They've been holding me back because they knew one day I would surpass them all.;[];;[27514, 27531, 27532];[27512];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01008_.mp3
No - I don't believe it! How could you betray us like this, Bastila?;[];;[27515];[27513];unk44_evilbast2;
I resisted at first. I endured the Sith torments with the passionless serenity of a true Jedi, emptying my mind. But after a week of endless tortures I finally saw the truth.;[];;[27516];[27514, 27531, 27532];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01012_.mp3
Malak forced me to acknowledge my anger and pain. He showed me the liberating power of these emotions. Then he made me see how the Jedi Council has denied me what is mine by right!;[];;[27517];[27515];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01013_.mp3
The Jedi Council gladly used my Battle Meditation in their wars, but they still treated me like a child - like an inferior. They were jealous of my power... of what I could become!;[];;[27518];[27516];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01014_.mp3
They wanted me to bow and call them Master and follow their Code and obey their every order. But all the while they were exploiting my Battle Meditation for their own use!;[];;[27519, 27523, 27525, 27529, 27530];[27517];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01015_.mp3
Don't do this, Bastila! Fight it! I'll help you!;[];;[27520];[27518];unk44_evilbast2;
You are a sad little fool. You speak as if I were the same Bastila that you've known all along. But freed from the control of the Jedi Council I've become much, much more.;[];;[27521];[27519];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01017_.mp3
I almost wish you could see things as I do now. I wish you could join me and taste true power once again. Sadly, I doubt you are even capable any longer.;[];;[27522];[27520, 27524];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01018_.mp3
With the power of the Star Forge Malak will destroy the Republic and conquer the galaxy. And I will be the apprentice at his side - after I prove my worth by killing you!;[];;[];[27521, 27528];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01027_.mp3
I like this side of you, Bastila. Now we can truly be together.;[];;[27524];[27518];unk44_evilbast2;
You think so, do you? You style yourself the Master of the Sith that you once were? To think I once envied you your passion, your power.;[];;[27521];[27523];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01020_.mp3
Don't be lured in by these Sith lies, Bastila!;[];;[27526];[27518];unk44_evilbast2;
"Lies? You are the one living a lie, Revan. The Jedi Council made you into something you are not; they programmed you to be their slave.";[];;[27527];[27525];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01022_.mp3
You used to be Revan, Master of the Sith, but no longer. You are simply a pawn of the Jedi Council and the Republic they serve... like I was until Malak freed me from their shackles!;[];;[27528];[27526, 27529];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01024_.mp3
A pity the power you once had is so diluted in you. You could have been strong as I am now... stronger, even. But that will never happen, now.;[];;[27522];[27527, 27530];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01026_.mp3
I am Revan, the Dark Lord! Bow down to me, Bastila!;[];;[27527];[27518];unk44_evilbast2;
If you've fallen under Malak's control you must die!;[];;[27528];[27518];unk44_evilbast2;
It's not too late, Bastila! You can still turn away from the dark side!;[];;[27515];[27513];unk44_evilbast2;
It didn't take long to convert you, did it? I always knew you were weak!;[];;[27515];[27513];unk44_evilbast2;
A pawn of the Jedi Council? What are you talking about?;[];;[27534];[27508];unk44_evilbast2;
"Surely you know what I mean, Revan. Look at what the Council did to you; they turned you into their puppet. The same thing they do to all who are truly strong in the Force.";[];;[27511];[27533];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01029_.mp3
Come on, Bastila. We have to escape before Malak shows up!;[];;[27508];[27506];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01030_.mp3
You are stronger than I would have thought possible, after what the Jedi Council did to you. Seems that Malak was wrong - the power of the dark side is not lost to you after all, Revan.;[];;[27537, 27599, 27600];[None];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01031_.mp3
I draw my power from the light now, Bastila.;[];;[27538];[27536];unk44_evilbast2;
You can deny what you are, Revan, but you are only fooling yourself. I know the truth. I have seen the shadows inside your mind.;[];;[27539];[27537, 27599];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01033_.mp3
Remember: I was there when you nearly died in the trap set by the Jedi Council. I used the Force to preserve your life, Revan. We are forever linked by my actions on that bridge!;[];;[27540, 27595, 27597];[27538];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01034_.mp3
That is how I know you will come back to the light.;[];;[27541];[27539];unk44_evilbast2;
These are not your true feelings, Revan. You are speaking as a tool of the Jedi Council - as I once did. But now I see how the Jedi used us both!;[];;[27542];[27540];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01036_.mp3
The Council tried to exploit the bond between us. They hoped I would draw out your memories to lead them to the Star Forge. We were slaves to their will - like all who follow the Jedi Code!;[];;[27543];[27541, 27596, 27598];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01037_.mp3
But in our shared visions of the Star Maps I also felt the so called taint within you. I resisted it at first, but now I embrace the power of the dark side - your dark side!;[];;[27544, 27590, 27592, 27593, 27594];[27542];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01038_.mp3
Learn from my mistakes. It is not too late to come back to the light!;[];;[27545];[27543];unk44_evilbast2;
Mistakes? No, Revan - the only mistake you are making is the one you are making now! You deny yourself the power that is yours by right! Only now do I realize how strong you are.;[];;[27546];[27544];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01040_.mp3
You deserve to be the true Master of the Sith, not Malak. I see this now. Together we can destroy your old apprentice. Join with me and reclaim your lost identity!;[];;[27547, 27589];[27545, 27591, 27592, 27593, 27594, 27602];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01041_.mp3
I'm not Revan anymore. I don't even remember those days.;[];;[27548];[27546];unk44_evilbast2;
Your mind was too badly damaged to ever fully restore your memories, Revan. But your power, your strength of will, the essence of who and what you are: these things still remain!;[];;[27549];[27547, 27589];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01043_.mp3
Once long ago you defied the Jedi Council, freeing yourself from their control. You claimed your rightful title of Dark Lord of the Sith. Together we can defeat Malak and take back what is yours!;[];;[27550, 27559, 27576, 27581];[27548];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01044_.mp3
Please, Bastila... if you feel anything for me, you won't do this!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Pleading'}];;[27551];[27549];unk44_evilbast2;
I... I don't. The only Revan I could respect is one who would break free of the Council's slavery. One who would grasp the power that lies before him... not the weak fool I see.;[];;[27552, 27582];[27550];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01046_.mp3
Bastila, it is not too late for you to be saved. The teachings of the Jedi can lead you from the dark side back into the light and a true understanding of the Force.;[];;[27553];[27551, 27581];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01048_.mp3
You are beneath my contempt, Juhani. When you felt the power of the dark side you fled to a cave like some cowering animal! You know nothing of the Force or its true potential!;[{'Bastilae': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[27554];[27552];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01049_.mp3
But you, Revan - the power of the dark side is yours to command! You can use it to destroy Malak! With my help you could rule over the entire galaxy!;[];;[27555, 27558, 27559, 27576, 27584];[27553, 27583];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01050_.mp3
I don't want to rule the galaxy. I want you to return to the light.;[];;[27556];[27554];unk44_evilbast2;
You are a pathetic fool, Revan! Together we could have defeated Malak and ruled over an Empire, but now I will be at Lord Malak's side instead!;[{'Bastilae': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[27557];[27555, 27558, 27566, 27572, 27580, 27585, 27586];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01081_.mp3
You will be crushed with the Republic and all the fools who bow down to the Jedi Council! No one can stand against the power of the Star Forge and the Sith fleet!;[{'Bastilae': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[];[27556];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01082_.mp3
The Dark Lord Revan is dead. I am a servant of the light now.;[];;[27556];[27554];unk44_evilbast2;
Yes! Together we can rule the galaxy!;[{'Player': 'Taunt'}];;[27560, 27573];[27554, 27579, 27588, 27549];unk44_evilbast2;
Listen to me... the dark side leads to death and destruction. I've seen the horrors the Sith have unleashed on the galaxy. Turn away from this path.;[];;[27561];[27559];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01056_.mp3
Shut up, old man. Your time is over! The age of the Jedi and the Republic is no more! This is the age of Darth Revan and the Sith!;[];;[27562];[27560];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01057_.mp3
Don't do this, kid. I don't want to, but I'll fight you if I have to. Even if it costs me my life.;[];;[27563, 27571, 27572];[27561];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01058_.mp3
I am the Lord of the Sith! Bow down before me!;[];;[27564, 27569];[27562, 27575];unk44_evilbast2;
A true Jedi will never bow down to the Sith. If this is your decision I have no choice but to do battle against you.;[];;[27565];[27563];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01060_.mp3
Kill her! Rend her flesh! Show her the fate of all who dare stand against us! Embrace the power of the dark side!;[];;[27566, 27567];[27564];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01061_.mp3
No, I will not kill my friend. I reject the power of the dark side.;[];;[27556];[27565, 27570];unk44_evilbast2;
Death to the Jedi!;[];;[27568];[27565, 27570];unk44_evilbast2;
Yes! The sacrificial blood will consecrate this ancient temple in the name of the Sith! With the death of the Jedi the rebirth of Darth Revan will be complete!;[];;[];[27567, 27571];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01067_.mp3
I'm a Jedi... I'll never bow down to the Sith. If you go through with this I have no choice but to do battle against you.;[];;[27570];[27563];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01064_.mp3
Kill him! Grind his old bones to dust! Show him the fate of all who dare stand against us! Embrace the dark side!;[];;[27566, 27567];[27569];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01065_.mp3
Then you must die!;[];;[27568];[27562, 27575];unk44_evilbast2;
You... you're right. I cannot do this. I reject the dark side!;[];;[27556];[27562, 27575];unk44_evilbast2;
No! Do not walk down this path... it can only lead to destruction! I know of what I speak!;[{'Juhani': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[27574];[27559];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01069_.mp3
Shut up, Juhani! You know nothing of the dark side's true potential! When you felt its touch you fled to a cave and cowered in terror!;[];;[27575];[27573];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01070_.mp3
I have no wish to fight you and Bastila, but if you choose to walk down this path you know I must stand against you... even at the cost of my life.;[];;[27563, 27571, 27572];[27574];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01071_.mp3
How do I know you won't betray me?;[];;[27577, 27587];[27554, 27549];unk44_evilbast2;
I need deny my passions no longer, Revan. I would stand by your side gladly, as your lover and apprentice!;[];;[27578];[27576];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01073_.mp3
I swore allegiance to Malak only because I thought you had lost the power you had once wielded. But this... this would be much better.;[];;[27579];[27577];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01074_.mp3
I would be utterly yours, master! Together we would destroy Malak and you would reclaim the mantle of Dark Lord!;[];;[27559, 27580, 27581, 27584];[27578];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01075_.mp3
No, I... don't want you like this. I want the woman I knew.;[];;[27556];[27579];unk44_evilbast2;
Turn away from this path, Bastila. The dark side leads only to destruction.;[];;[27552, 27582];[27579, 27588, 27549];unk44_evilbast2;
It's not to late for you, Bastila. The dark side is evil but it isn't all powerful. You can still fight against it. Don't let it consume you.;[];;[27583];[27581, 27551];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01053_.mp3
You are beneath my contempt, old man! You hid like a coward for decades on Kashyyyk! You know nothing about the true potential of the Force!;[{'Bastilae': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[27554];[27582];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01054_.mp3
I don't trust you. I think I'll just kill you instead!;[];;[27585, 27586];[27579, 27588, 27554];unk44_evilbast2;
No! This is the way of the dark side! Do not give in to the anger and hatred!;[];;[27556];[27584];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01083_.mp3
No! Don't give into your anger. Remain calm, remain focused. Don't let her twist your mind like this!;[];;[27556];[27584];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01080_.mp3
It is your power that will keep me as your loyal apprentice, Revan. I swore allegiance to Malak only because I thought you had lost the power you once wielded.;[];;[27588];[27576];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01077_.mp3
"But you have proven yourself in our battle; I see you possess the strength to destroy Malak and reclaim the mantle of Dark Lord. Now I see you will make a worthy Sith Master.";[];;[27559, 27581, 27584];[27587];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01078_.mp3
How can I reclaim my identity if I can't even remember it?;[];;[27548];[27546];unk44_evilbast2;
No! This isn't the Bastila I knew!;[];;[27591];[27543];unk44_evilbast2;
Of course not! I have been reborn in the wake of destiny... *your* destiny! The power of the dark side is yours by right!;[];;[27546];[27590];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01086_.mp3
What are you saying, Bastila?;[];;[27546];[27543];unk44_evilbast2;
If I am so powerful, then why do you serve another master?;[];;[27546];[27543];unk44_evilbast2;
Then why don't we join our power together, as it was meant to be?;[];;[27546];[27543];unk44_evilbast2;
There is no link between us, Bastila! Not anymore!;[];;[27596];[27539];unk44_evilbast2;
Our bond is not easily broken, Revan. Even when your mind was destroyed and reprogrammed with a new identity the bond between us endured.;[];;[27542];[27595];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01091_.mp3
We are linked by more than just a bond, Bastila.;[];;[27598];[27539];unk44_evilbast2;
Do not mistake the power of the Force for love, Revan. It does not exist. Power is what forged our bond, and power is what made us both tools of the Jedi Council!;[];;[27542];[27597];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01093_.mp3
Don't call me that. I'm not Revan anymore. I'm <FullName> now.;[];;[27538];[27536];unk44_evilbast2;
Now you see the power of the true Dark Lord!;[];;[27601];[27536];unk44_evilbast2;
"Yes, Revan! I was there when you almost died in the trap set by the Jedi Council; I used the Force to preserve your life. We are forever linked by my actions on that bridge.";[];;[27602];[27600];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01096_.mp3
The Council tried to exploit our bond. They hoped your memories would lead me to the Star Forge. But in our shared visions of the Star Maps I also tasted the power of the taint within you!;[];;[27546];[27601];unk44_evilbast2;NM44ACEVIL01097_.mp3

Rakata? The One? What are you talking about?;[];;[27614, 27615, 27629, 27630, 27631, 27632, 27633, 27634];[27612];unk41_blackrak;

You have used strange magics and weapons to slaughter our raiding parties, Interloper. You have bathed in the blood of fierce Rakatan warriors.;[];;[27616];[27614, 27629, 27630, 27631, 27632, 27633, 27634, 27613, 27635];unk41_blackrak;
Your power and skill in battle has impressed the One. He wishes an audience with you: a great honor. Come with us now and we will take you to him.;[];;[27617, 27619, 27620, 27627];[27615];unk41_blackrak;
Who is the One? What's going on here?;[];;[27618];[27616];unk41_blackrak;
The One is the leader of our tribe, the Great Champion of the Rakata. He has feasted on the flesh of many foes. Come with us and we will take you to him now.;[];;[27619, 27620];[27617];unk41_blackrak;
Okay. Take me to the One.;[];;[];[27618, 27621, 27623, 27616];unk41_blackrak;
I'm not going anywhere with you.;[];;[27621];[27618, 27616];unk41_blackrak;
The will of the One cannot be denied, Interloper. You will come with us now to see our Champion, or our rancor war beasts will destroy you.;[];;[27619, 27622];[27620, 27628];unk41_blackrak;
I think I'll just kill you instead!;[];;[27623];[27621];unk41_blackrak;
Are you blind, Interloper? Our war beasts will crush you if you defy us! This is your last chance: come with us to see the One, or we will feast on your bones!;[];;[27619, 27624, 27626];[27622];unk41_blackrak;

Bastila, I was wondering something. How did those Vulkars manage to capture a famous Jedi like you? Were you knocked out when your escape pod crashed?;[{'Player': 'Listen'}];;[27671];[None];banter;NGLOBEBANT00000_.mp3
No, I was conscious. But my Force powers were exhausted from using my Battle Meditation in the battle for the Endar Spire. Without my help you might never have gotten off the ship alive.;[];;[27672];[27670];banter;NGLOBEBANT00001_.mp3
Fair enough. But I've seen you Jedi in action. There's no way those thugs would have stood a chance against your lightsaber.;[];;[27673];[27671];banter;NGLOBEBANT00002_.mp3
My lightsaber was... misplaced. I couldn't find it after the crash. I looked *everywhere* in that pod. The Vulkars came and overwhelmed me even as I was searching for my weapon.;[];;[27674];[27672];banter;NGLOBEBANT00003_.mp3
Wait a minute, let me get this straight. You *lost* your lightsaber? Ha-ha! I mean, isn't that a violation of some kind of Jedi code or something?;[{'Carth': 'Talk_Laughing'}];;[27675, 27679, 27680];[27673];banter;NGLOBEBANT00004_.mp3
Of all the Jedi in the galaxy, why do we get one who's absent-minded?;[];;[27676];[27674];banter;
This is no laughing matter! During the crash my lightsaber must have... it must have fallen from my belt and rolled under my seat! The Vulkars probably found it there when they searched the wreckage.;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[27677];[27675, 27679, 27680];banter;NGLOBEBANT00008_.mp3
Hey, hey, hey, don't get mad. I'm sorry. It's just funny to think of a legendary Jedi losing her lightsaber. Take my advice: this is one detail you might want to keep out of the history texts.;[];;[27678];[27676];banter;NGLOBEBANT00009_.mp3
I hardly consider myself a legend, Carth. Though I will consider your advice when I relate these events to the Jedi Council. There is no need for them to know *every* detail of what transpired.;[];;[];[27677];banter;NGLOBEBANT00010_.mp3
Maybe losing lightsabers is a side-effect of her Battle Meditation.;[];;[27676];[27674];banter;
Leave her alone, Carth.;[];;[27676];[27674];banter;
Bastila, did you ever think about joining all the Jedi who were running off to follow Revan and Malak when they went to fight the Mandalorians?;[{'Player': 'Listen'}];;[27682];[None];banter;NGLOBEBANT00011_.mp3
That was nearly five years ago. I was still an apprentice, my Battle Meditation hadn't even manifested itself. Yet even then I had the wisdom to obey the will of the Council. Unlike Revan.;[];;[27683];[27681];banter;NGLOBEBANT00012_.mp3
I guess. Still, do you ever wonder if things could have been different? Would Revan and Malak still have been corrupted if the Council had supported them instead of dragging its feet?;[];;[27684];[27682];banter;NGLOBEBANT00013_.mp3
Do not blame Revan's corruption on the Council! Your Republic saw only the threat of the Mandalorians, but the wisdom of the Masters saw beyond the immediate threat.;[];;[27685, 27692];[27683];banter;NGLOBEBANT00014_.mp3
What did they see, exactly?;[];;[27686];[27684];banter;
There was something lurking out there, something that devoured Revan and Malak - and many other Jedi. Had the Council sent us all into the unknown, how many more would have fallen?;[];;[27687];[27685, 27692];banter;NGLOBEBANT00016_.mp3
So you're saying we should have done nothing? Just let the Mandalorians conquer us unopposed? I mean, the Republic was under attack, and the Order abandoned us!;[{'Carth': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[27688];[27686];banter;NGLOBEBANT00017_.mp3
We did not abandon you! But the Council were not about to throw lives away foolishly. In time, we would have aided you against the Mandalorians. But you couldn't wait.;[];;[27689];[27687];banter;NGLOBEBANT00018_.mp3
Revan and Malak offered a quicker answer, and the Republic chose to walk the easy path rather than the path of wisdom. Now we see the results all around us.;[];;[27690];[27688];banter;NGLOBEBANT00019_.mp3
You asked me if I think things could have been different? I *know* they could have! If Revan had only listened to the Council, millions of innocent people would still be alive.;[{'Bastila': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[27691];[27689];banter;NGLOBEBANT00020_.mp3
Yeah, right. And every single one of them would be speaking Mandalorain. I think we're done here. Let's just get back to the task at hand.;[{'Carth': 'Persuade'}];;[];[27690];banter;NGLOBEBANT00021_.mp3
Sounds like you're just making excuses, Bastila.;[];;[27686];[27684];banter;
Hey, Carth. You're a pilot for the Republic, right? You've been all over the galaxy I bet, right? So tell me, how would you rate Taris compared to other worlds you've seen?;[{'Player': 'Listen'}];;[27694];[None];banter;NGLOBEBANT00023_.mp3
I'll be honest, Mission, Taris would rate pretty low. The prejudice, the rich spoiling themselves while the poor are crushed beneath them - not a pretty picture.;[];;[27695];[27693];banter;NGLOBEBANT00024_.mp3
Yeah, but that's only since the Sith occupation. Before that... well, I guess it wasn't all that different, really. Hmm... maybe Taris ain't as great as I thought, you know?;[];;[27696];[27694];banter;NGLOBEBANT00025_.mp3
Trust me, Mission. There are a lot of worlds better than Taris. There are worse, too. But Taris is no place for a kid to live on her own - even a kid who's got a Wookiee to look out for her.;[];;[27697];[27695];banter;NGLOBEBANT00026_.mp3
Hey, I ain't no kid! And I look out for Zaalbar as much as he looks out for me. Big Z's my friend, not my babysitter! Geez, I come ask you a question and you give me a lecture!;[{'Mission': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[27698];[27696];banter;NGLOBEBANT00027_.mp3
Don't you snap at me, missy! You want a lecture? How's this: only bratty little children fly off the handle because of a simple comment.;[{'Carth': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[27699, 27702];[27697];banter;NGLOBEBANT00028_.mp3
Settle down right now - both of you!;[];;[27700];[27698];banter;
I don't have to listen to you, Carth! You ain't my father - though you're sure old enough to be! So keep your lectures inside your withered old head, 'cause I don't need 'em!;[{'Mission': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[27701];[27699, 27702];banter;NGLOBEBANT00031_.mp3
And I sure as hell don't need this. Let's just drop it and get back to what we were doing.;[{'Carth': 'Persuade'}];;[];[27700];banter;NGLOBEBANT00032_.mp3
You're not going to take that from him, are you Mission?;[];;[27700];[27698];banter;
Uh, hey Carth. Can I... can I talk to you for a second?;[{'Player': 'Listen'}];;[27704];[None];banter;NGLOBEBANT00033_.mp3
Are you ready to have a civil chat? Or are is this going to be another childish tantrum?;[];;[27705];[27703];banter;NGLOBEBANT00034_.mp3
Tantrum? I'm trying to apologize, you nerf-herder! Uh... I mean... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to get mad at you. It's just that I'm sick of everyone treating me like I'm a helpless kid.;[];;[27706];[27704];banter;NGLOBEBANT00035_.mp3
Yeah, I know. And I'm sorry about what I said, too. I'm just a little on edge lately. Not surprising considering all we've been through. But I shouldn't take it out on you.;[];;[27707, 27712];[27705];banter;NGLOBEBANT00036_.mp3
It's about time you two made up.;[];;[27708];[27706];banter;
Mission, you have to know that we don't think you're helpless. Look where we are, look at what we're doing. You're not just along for the ride.  We need you.;[{'Carth': 'Greeting'}];;[27709];[27707, 27712];banter;NGLOBEBANT00038_.mp3
You really mean it, don't you? Nobody's ever said anything like that to me before, not even Big Z. He might think it, but he's not really one for words, you know. Thanks, Carth.;[];;[27710];[27708];banter;NGLOBEBANT00039_.mp3
Ah, it's no big deal. I know how it is. Sometimes you just need to hear a few words of encouragement. Kids are like that.;[];;[27711];[27709];banter;NGLOBEBANT00040_.mp3
Kids are like that?? Listen you... oh, I get it. Okay, you got me. You're pretty funny, Carth. For an old guy. Come on, you geezer - let's get back to what we were doing.;[{'Mission': 'Flirt'}];;[];[27710];banter;NGLOBEBANT00041_.mp3
What's with all the apologies? I was hoping for another fight!;[];;[27708];[27706];banter;
Carth, you fought in the Mandalorian Wars, didn't you? We may have faced each other in combat. What battles were you in?;[{'Player': 'Listen'}];;[27714];[None];banter;NGLOBEBANT00043_.mp3
I try not to think about my past battles too much. The horrors of war are something I'd rather not relive.;[];;[27715];[27713];banter;NGLOBEBANT00044_.mp3
The horrors of war? My people know only the glory of battle. I'm disappointed in you, Carth. I thought a warrior like you would understand.;[];;[27716, 27722, 27723];[27714];banter;NGLOBEBANT00045_.mp3
Carth isn't like you, Canderous.;[];;[27717];[27715];banter;
I'm not a warrior, I'm a soldier. There's a difference. Warriors attack and conquer, they prey on the weak. Soldiers defend and protect the innocent - mostly from warriors.;[];;[27718];[27716, 27722, 27723];banter;NGLOBEBANT00048_.mp3
Nice speech. I bet you tell yourself that every night so you can sleep. But I accept who and what I am. I don't have to justify it with words - victory in battle is my justification!;[];;[27719];[27717];banter;NGLOBEBANT00049_.mp3
Justification through victory? So what happens when you lose? You know, like you did against us.;[];;[27720];[27718];banter;NGLOBEBANT00050_.mp3
You had us outnumbered five to one. You had more ships, more troops, more supplies and the Jedi on your side. And we still made the Republic tremble before we fell!;[];;[27721];[27719];banter;NGLOBEBANT00051_.mp3
Nice speech. I bet you tell yourself that every night so you can sleep. I don't want to talk about this anymore, Canderous. The war is over. You lost.;[];;[];[27720];banter;NGLOBEBANT00052_.mp3
Yeah, Carth. When did you get all peace-loving on me?;[];;[27717];[27715];banter;
Keep it cool, you two. I don't want this getting out of hand.;[];;[27717];[27715];banter;
So, Bastila, I heard a rumor that the Vulkars captured you without much of a struggle. It must be embarrassing to be bested by a handful of street thugs.;[{'Player': 'Listen'}];;[27725];[None];banter;NGLOBEBANT00054_.mp3
There were extenuating circumstances. And I can assure you it took far more than a handful of Vulkars to subdue me.;[];;[27726, 27733];[27724];banter;NGLOBEBANT00055_.mp3
Okay, let's not get into this.;[];;[27727];[27725];banter;
Whatever you say. All I know is that if we had more Jedi like Bastila fighting against us in the Mandalorian Wars, my side might not have lost.;[];;[27728];[27726, 27733];banter;NGLOBEBANT00057_.mp3
Bold talk from a broken-down merceneray who was serving at Davik's heel. I'd call you his pet kath hound, but they have enough loyalty not to turn on their masters.;[];;[27729];[27727];banter;NGLOBEBANT00058_.mp3
Insults? Maybe if your Master had trained your lightsaber to be as quick as your tongue you could have escaped those Vulkars, you spoiled little Jedi princess!;[];;[27730];[27728];banter;NGLOBEBANT00059_.mp3
"I was not spoiled! I was given the same training as everyone else in the Order! You are nothing but a... no. I must not do this. There is no emotion; there is peace.";[];;[27731];[27729];banter;NGLOBEBANT00060_.mp3
That's the problem with you Jedi. Always chanting about peace and control, never up for a good fight. Well, except for Revan, I guess.;[];;[27732];[27730];banter;NGLOBEBANT00061_.mp3
Enough, Mandalorian. I won't rise to your bait any more. The game is over. Let us continue on with what we were doing.;[];;[];[27731];banter;NGLOBEBANT00062_.mp3
Yeah, I'm sure there were twenty of them. I mean, fifty... no, wait... a hundred!;[];;[27727];[27725];banter;
Hey, Big Z, we've got to do something about your breath.  I didn't want to say anything, but it's bad. Worse than usual, which is hard to believe.;[{'Player': 'Listen'}];;[27735];[None];banter;NGLOBEBANT00064_.mp3
In fact, now that I think about it, your breath has been pretty rancid ever since we rescued you from those Gammorean slavers. What did they feed you, buddy?;[];;[27736];[27734];banter;NGLOBEBANT00065_.mp3
They didn't. I wasn't their guest, Mission. I was a prisoner. I don't think they cared much what happened to me.;[];;[27737];[27735];banter;
Oh, Zaalbar, that's terrible! I know how grouchy you get if you don't get your eight square meals a day. I'm amazed you didn't pass out from hunger.;[];;[27738];[27736];banter;NGLOBEBANT00067_.mp3
I did manage to take a chunk out of the arm of a guards that wandered too close to my cage. But it tasted awful, so I spit it out.;[];;[27739];[27737];banter;
Ewww! No wonder your breath is so bad, Big Z. Gammoreans smell like bantha poo-doo! We'll have to pick you up a toothbrush to clean that stench out of your choppers.;[];;[27740];[27738];banter;NGLOBEBANT00069_.mp3
Wookiees do not brush their teeth, Mission! It... it just isn't done! What humiliation will you use on me next? A comb?;[];;[27741];[27739];banter;
Okay, relax. No toothbrush. Sheesh. Just try to eat something else to cover up that smell, okay? Stay away from anything that's smart enough to lock you in a cage this time.;[];;[27742];[27740];banter;NGLOBEBANT00071_.mp3
*sigh* I'll take care of it as soon as I can, Mission. For now, let's stay focused on the task at hand.;[];;[];[27741];banter;
Hey, Big Z. Don't take this the wrong way, but lately I've noticed you're starting to look a little bit scruffy.;[{'Player': 'Listen'}];;[27744];[None];banter;NGLOBEBANT00073_.mp3
Scruffy? What are you talking about? I hope you aren't suggesting I take a bath!;[];;[27745];[27743];banter;
No, I'm not suggesting a bath. I know how well that went over last time. But your hair's getting all tangled. And if you look close, you can see a few gray strands starting to poke through.;[];;[27746];[27744];banter;NGLOBEBANT00075_.mp3
You're making this up! I groom every day! My hair is not tangled, and it's not going gray!;[];;[27747, 27753];[27745];banter;
She's got a point, Zaalbar. You could use a good makeover.;[];;[27748];[27746];banter;
Don't worry, Big Z. It's nothing I can't fix. A little trim, a splash of coloring and you'll be as good as new. Best looking Wookiee on the planet. Maybe a nice suit...;[];;[27749];[27747, 27753];banter;NGLOBEBANT00079_.mp3
You don't trim a Wookiee! You don't color a Wookiee! And you certainly don't dress a Wookiee!;[];;[27750];[27748];banter;
I know Wookiees aren't into the whole clothing thing, but you could start a whole new trend! You'd be on the cutting edge.;[];;[27751];[27749];banter;NGLOBEBANT00081_.mp3
Rargh! Leave me alone!;[];;[27752];[27750];banter;
Okay, okay. Sheesh. Try to offer some constructive criticism and this is the thanks I get? Let's move on. You can just stay naked and scruffy for all I care.;[];;[];[27751];banter;NGLOBEBANT00083_.mp3
Zaalbar looks fine to me.;[];;[27748];[27746];banter;
Hey, Bastila. You ever just use the Force for fun? You know, a little jolt of the Force to trip some jerk who's ticking you off?;[{'Player': 'Listen'}];;[27755];[None];banter;NGLOBEBANT00084_.mp3
I would never use the Force for such a petty and trivial revenge! The mere thought of it is preposterous!;[];;[27756];[27754];banter;NGLOBEBANT00085_.mp3
Ah, come on. There's got to be times when you've thought about it. Don't be so stuck up - you can tell me.;[];;[27757];[27755];banter;NGLOBEBANT00086_.mp3
I am not stuck up. I merely have the years of training to give me the wisdom and understanding to see how childish such an act would be.;[];;[27758];[27756];banter;NGLOBEBANT00087_.mp3
Childish? Is that a crack about my age? You ain't much older than me, miss high and mighty! Just 'cause you're some Jedi doesn't mean you can be a prissy little...;[{'Mission': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[27759];[27757];banter;NGLOBEBANT00088_.mp3
What the -?? Hey, that wasn't funny!;[];Mission tripped by Bastila using Force powers;[27760];[27758];banter;NGLOBEBANT00089_.mp3
I have no idea what you're talking about, Mission. Come now, we have to get going. Please do try to be less clumsy in the future.;[];;[];[27759];banter;NGLOBEBANT00090_.mp3
Jolee, may I have a moment? There is something I wish to speak to you about.;[{'Player': 'Listen'}];;[27762];[None];banter;NGLOBEBANT00091_.mp3
"Yep, I figured it was only a matter of time until we had the whole ""come back to the Order"" discussion. Well, I guess there's no avoiding it now, so let's get it over with.";[];;[27763];[27761];banter;NGLOBEBANT00092_.mp3
I know you have... issues... with the Order. But you are a Jedi, Jolee. You command the Force. Without the guidance of the Council how can you avoid falling to the dark side?;[];;[27764];[27762];banter;NGLOBEBANT00093_.mp3
Well, I've managed to avoid it the last 20 years or so. Besides, light side, dark side: they don't mean the same to me as they do to you. I don't see in absolutes.;[];;[27765, 27770, 27771];[27763];banter;NGLOBEBANT00094_.mp3
Malak and the Sith are evil, Jolee! Surely you can see that.;[];;[27766];[27764];banter;
I want to stop Malak as much as anyone. But I don't have to join the Order to do it. Look at Carth, or Canderous. They're with us in this quest, but they aren't Jedi.;[];;[27767];[27765, 27770, 27771];banter;NGLOBEBANT00097_.mp3
The capacity for good or evil, like the Force itself, is in all living creatures. And belonging to the Jedi Order, or the Sith, or any group, won't change what you are at your core.;[];;[27768];[27766];banter;NGLOBEBANT00098_.mp3
I see you are quite adamant. No doubt you've had ample time to think on this during your long seclusion. I guess it was foolish of me to think I could sway your position so easily.;[];;[27769];[27767];banter;NGLOBEBANT00099_.mp3
Yeah, I'm old and stubborn. But I appreciate the effort. But from now on you can just think of me as any other non-Jedi in our little group - with a lightsaber. And Force powers.;[];;[];[27768];banter;NGLOBEBANT00100_.mp3
So you don't have a problem with Malak and the Sith?;[];;[27766];[27764];banter;
Of course! Malak isn't evil, he's just misunderstood!;[];;[27766];[27764];banter;
So, Jolee, you decided to leave your little hermitage in the forest and come help us stop the Sith. I guess you realized this was worth coming out of retirement for, huh?;[{'Player': 'Listen'}];;[27773];[None];banter;NGLOBEBANT00102_.mp3
Yeah, that's right, sonny. The Sith are the greatest evil to hit the galaxy since, well, the Mandalorians. And they're the worst thing since Exar Kun. Blah, blah, blah, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.;[];;[27774];[27772];banter;NGLOBEBANT00103_.mp3
Okay, old man, you lost me there. Are you trying to make a point?;[];;[27775];[27773];banter;NGLOBEBANT00104_.mp3
Look, everybody always figures the time they live in is the most epic, most important age to end all ages. But tyrants and heroes rise and fall, and historians sort out the pieces.;[];;[27776, 27781, 27782];[27774];banter;NGLOBEBANT00105_.mp3
Are you saying what we're doing isn't important?;[];;[27777];[27775];banter;
Malak is a tyrant who should be stopped. If he conquers the galaxy we're in for a couple of rough centuries. Eventually it'll come around again, but I'd rather not wait that long.;[];;[27778];[27776, 27781, 27782];banter;NGLOBEBANT00107_.mp3
So we do what we have to do, and we try to stop the Sith. But don't start thinking this war - your war - is more important than any other war just because you're in it.;[];;[27779];[27777];banter;NGLOBEBANT00108_.mp3
"That's an interesting theory, but I don't buy it. The Republic stands for something; it's stood for something for fifteen thousand years. And if it falls, everything will change forever.";[];;[27780];[27778];banter;NGLOBEBANT00109_.mp3
You believe whatever you need to to get you through this, sonny. The bottom line is we both want to stop Malak, so let's not get hung up on the details. Let's just get back to stopping him.;[];;[];[27779];banter;NGLOBEBANT00110_.mp3
If you feel that way, why did you come with us?;[];;[27777];[27775];banter;
I think it's pretty clear that Malak is the tyrant in this case.;[];;[27777];[27775];banter;

The light side is stronger than you know, Malak.;[];;[27951];[27949];k_sta_darthmalak;
I am tempted to try and capture you alive, Revan. Then I could break your will and bind you to me as my apprentice, as I did Bastila.;[];;[27952];[27950];k_sta_darthmalak;NM45AADART04046_.mp3
You would be a far greater asset to me than even Bastila and her Battle Meditation, if I could control you. But is it worth the risk?;[];;[27953];[27951];k_sta_darthmalak;NM45AADART04047_.mp3

I will never serve the dark side again, Malak!;[];;[27955];[27953];k_sta_darthmalak;
Foolish words. The darkness and the light wage a constant war within you. The balance is tipped one way now, but it can easily be tipped back.;[];;[27956];[27954];k_sta_darthmalak;NM45AADART04050_.mp3
Savior, conqueror, hero, villain. You are all things Revan... and yet you are nothing. In the end you belong to neither the light nor the darkness. You will forever stand alone.;[];;[27957, 27961, 27964, 27966];[27955];k_sta_darthmalak;NM45AADART04051_.mp3

We have been inexorably pushed to this final confrontation, Revan. I see now that this can only be settled when one of us destroys the other.;[];;[27960];[27958, 27963];k_sta_darthmalak;NM45AADART04065_.mp3

You're still making the mistake of underestimating me, Malak.;[];;[27962];[27956, 27953];k_sta_darthmalak;
I cannot deny your resilience. You survived my first betrayal, thanks to Bastila's inteference. You escaped the destruction of Taris and you escaped me on the Leviathan.;[];;[27963];[27961, 27973, 27974];k_sta_darthmalak;NM45AADART04063_.mp3
You even survived my attempt to destroy you with the Star Forge itself. Fate and destiny have conspired to keep you alive despite all my efforts.;[];;[27959];[27962];k_sta_darthmalak;NM45AADART04064_.mp3
This is your last chance, Malak. Surrender.;[];;[27965];[27956, 27953, 27949];k_sta_darthmalak;
No, Revan, this time our confrontation can only end in death... yours or mine.;[];;[27960];[27964];k_sta_darthmalak;NM45AADART04067_.mp3
Enough words! Now we end this!;[];;[27967];[27956, 27953, 27972, 27969, 27949];k_sta_darthmalak;

I was always stronger than you, Malak! That was why I was the Master!;[];;[27969];[27949];k_sta_darthmalak;
Once you were stronger than me, Revan. But as your apprentice I surpassed you. The Master must always be stronger than the apprentice... that was why I betrayed you.;[];;[27966, 27970, 27974];[27968];k_sta_darthmalak;NM45AADART04056_.mp3
You betrayed me from afar. You were afraid to face me, Malak.;[];;[27971];[27969];k_sta_darthmalak;
No! I was prepared to face you, Revan. But fate presented me with a better option. I saw my opportunity and seized it.;[];;[27972];[27970];k_sta_darthmalak;NM45AADART04058_.mp3
The trap set by the Jedi only hastened my decision. If they had not attacked I would have challenged you for mastery of the Sith soon enough.;[];;[27966, 27973, 27974, 27975];[27971];k_sta_darthmalak;NM45AADART04059_.mp3

No, Malak. I am the true Sith Master!;[];;[27978];[27976];k_sta_darthmalak;

You were the one who found the first Star Map on Dantooine, Revan. [cough] It was you who lead us on our quest for the Star Forge. I only followed in your wake.;[];;[27980];[27978];k_sta_darthmalak;NM45AADART04017_.mp3
I tried to usurp your rule, to steal the title of Sith Master from you. But now I understand... The destiny is yours, Revan. Not mine.;[];;[27981];[27979];k_sta_darthmalak;NM45AADART04018_.mp3
You... you are Darth Revan, Lord ... [cough] Lord of the Sith. And I... I am nothing.;[];;[27982, 27984];[27980];k_sta_darthmalak;NM45AADART04019_.mp3

And so it ends as I somehow always knew it must: in darkness.;[];;[];[27982, 27984];k_sta_darthmalak;NM45AADART04021_.mp3
You should have known you could never defeat me, Malak!;[];;[27983];[27981];k_sta_darthmalak;
The Star Forge is mine now, Malak!;[];;[27978];[27976];k_sta_darthmalak;
This is the way of the dark side, Malak: all things end in death.;[];;[27987];[27976];k_sta_darthmalak;
Still... [cough] still spouting the wisdom the Jedi, I see. Maybe there is more truth in their code than I ever believed.;[];;[27988];[27986, 27994];k_sta_darthmalak;NM45AADART04025_.mp3
I... I cannot help but wonder, Revan. What would have happened had our positions been reversed? What if fate had decreed I would be captured by the Jedi?;[];;[27989];[27987];k_sta_darthmalak;NM45AADART04026_.mp3
Could I have returned to the light, as you did? [cough] If you had not led me down the dark path in the first place, what destiny would I have found?;[];;[27990, 27993];[27988];k_sta_darthmalak;NM45AADART04027_.mp3
You cannot blame me for the path you chose.;[];;[27991];[27989];k_sta_darthmalak;
I suppose... I suppose you speak the truth. I alone must accept responsibility for my fate. I wanted to be Master of the Sith and ruler of the galaxy.;[];;[27992];[27990, 27993];k_sta_darthmalak;NM45AADART04029_.mp3
But that destiny was not mine, Revan. [cough] It might have been yours, perhaps... but never mine. And in the end, as the darkness takes me, I am nothing.;[];;[];[27991];k_sta_darthmalak;NM45AADART04030_.mp3
I am sorry I started you on this path. But you chose to continue down it.;[];;[27991];[27989];k_sta_darthmalak;
The power of the light will always be stronger than the dark side.;[];;[27987];[27976];k_sta_darthmalak;
You continue to amaze me, Revan. If only you had been the one to uncover the true power of the Star Forge you might have become truly invincible.;[];Checks if BodySuck Global is at 1;[27996];[None];k_sta_darthmalak;NM45AADART04033_.mp3
But you were a fool. All you saw was an enormous factory, all you ever imagined was an infinite fleet rolling forth to crush the Republic. You were blind, Revan - blind and stupid!;[];;[27997, 28003];[27995];k_sta_darthmalak;NM45AADART04034_.mp3
What are you talking about?;[];;[27998];[27996];k_sta_darthmalak;
The Star Forge is more than just a space station. In some ways, it is like a living creature. It hungers. And it can feed on the dark side that is within all of us!;[];;[27999];[27997, 28003];k_sta_darthmalak;NM45AADART04036_.mp3
Look around you, Revan. See the bodies? You should recognize them from the Academy. These are Jedi who fell when I attacked Dantooine. For all intents and purposes dead, except for one difference:;[];;[28000];[27998];k_sta_darthmalak;NM45AADART04037_.mp3
I have not let them become one with the Force. Instead I have brought them here. The Star Forge corrupts what remains of their power and transfers the dark taint to me!;[];;[28001];[27999];k_sta_darthmalak;NM45AADART04038_.mp3
You cannot beat me, Revan. Not here on the Star Forge. Not when I can draw upon the power of all these Jedi!;[];;[28002];[28000];k_sta_darthmalak;NM45AADART04040_.mp3
And once you are beaten I will do the same to you. You will be trapped in a terrible existence between life and death, your power feeding me as I conquer the galaxy!;[];;[];[28001];k_sta_darthmalak;NM45AADART04041_.mp3
Is there some point to this?;[];;[27998];[27996];k_sta_darthmalak;

Well, human, you find yourself in a most difficult situation. The Hrakert Rift is the most precious resource on Manaan, and anything that threatens it or the kolto it produces threatens our entire species.;[];;[28200];[28198];man26_pcexile;

When we... we monitor the Rift constantly. How could the Sith have approached it without us knowing?;[];;[28225, 28230, 28234];[28223];man26_pcexile;
[Lie] They had built a station down there already.;[];;[28226];[28224, 28233];man26_pcexile;

Impossible! Our own sta...;[{'Judge Kota': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[28228];[28226];man26_pcexile;

It is impossible... that's all...;[];;[28230, 28234, 28257];[28228];man26_pcexile;
[Lie] Maybe they have some sort of stealth field.;[];;[28231];[28229, 28224];man26_pcexile;
[Success] That they could smuggle onto Manaan without our knowing about it? Impossible!;[];;[28232];[28230];man26_pcexile;
You fail to realize that if they had such a stealth field, we would not be able to detect them bringing it either.;[];;[28233];[28231];man26_pcexile;
But that area is closely monitored... We would have detected any new vessels approaching it just by perturbations in the currents.;[];;[28225, 28234, 28257];[28232];man26_pcexile;
[Lie] Maybe some Selkath were helping them.;[];;[28235];[28233, 28229, 28224];man26_pcexile;
[Success] Some... Selkath?;[];;[28236];[28234];man26_pcexile;
Selkath would not be helping off-worlders to disrupt our most valuable resources!;[];;[28237, 28339];[28235];man26_pcexile;

It is likely that you have sabotaged our efforts AND the facilities at the Hrakert Rift. For this you must pay the price.;[];;[28247];[28245];man26_pcexile;

What has happened at the research station? What caused the explosions?;[];;[28267, 28290, 28318];[28265];man26_pcexile;
The machinery had woken up a giant firaxan shark.;[];;[28268];[28266, 28322, 28326];man26_pcexile;
A giant firaxan? Could it be...;[];;[28269];[28267, 28296, 28302];man26_pcexile;

I didn't kill the shark!;[];;[28273];[28271];man26_pcexile;
The Progenitor... it must have been!;[];;[28274];[28272, 28287, 28288];man26_pcexile;
Be quiet! That is merely a myth, and not fit for outsiders to hear!;[{'Judge Duula': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[28275];[28273];man26_pcexile;
But if it was the life-bringer... the ancestor of our species... Think of what this could mean!;[];;[28276];[28274];man26_pcexile;
If it always laired there... then perhaps the kolto...;[];;[28277];[28275];man26_pcexile;
Enough! Off-worlders are not to hear of such things!;[{'Judge Shelkar': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[28278, 28286];[28276];man26_pcexile;
But he said he saved it... He destroyed the harvesters to save it.;[];;[28279];[28277];man26_pcexile;
Indeed. This casts your actions in a new light, human.;[];;[28280];[28278, 28286];man26_pcexile;
This, I believe, will require more thought... both on your actions, and on what we must do in response.;[]; player is found innocent;[28281];[28279];man26_pcexile;
This court will adjourn while we deliberate.;[];;[28282];[28280];man26_pcexile;
We have reviewed your actions and the situation, human.;[];;[28283];[28281];man26_pcexile;
We thank you for the destruction of the machinery and saving the giant firaxan which, we believe, is the source of our kolto... or at least its guardian.;[];;[28284];[28282];man26_pcexile;
We will not detain you any longer. While we cannot show our gratitude overtly, know that you have earned our respect.;[];;[28285];[28283];man26_pcexile;

But she said she saved it... She destroyed the harvesters to save it.;[];;[28279];[28277];man26_pcexile;
I destroyed the machinery to save it.;[];;[28273];[28271];man26_pcexile;
The machine was making it drive everyone mad.;[];;[28273];[28271];man26_pcexile;
But she said she killed it... didn't she?;[];;[28271];[28269];man26_pcexile;
The entire station had been driven mad.;[];;[28291];[28266, 28322, 28326];man26_pcexile;
Mad? I find that hard to believe, human.;[];;[28292];[28290];man26_pcexile;
We did receive those transmission just before the station went silent...;[];;[28293];[28291];man26_pcexile;
Ask the human what happened!;[{'Judge Naleshekan': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[28294];[28292];man26_pcexile;
Well, human? What drove all the sentients down there mad?;[];;[28295, 28297, 28305];[28293];man26_pcexile;
A giant firaxan shark was woken up by the harvester.;[];;[28296];[28294, 28307, 28309];man26_pcexile;
And you destroyed the harvester to kill a giant firaxan...;[];;[28268];[28295];man26_pcexile;
Only the Selkath went mad.;[];;[28298];[28294];man26_pcexile;
You accuse us of being to blame for this?;[];;[28299];[28297];man26_pcexile;
Calm yourself. We are more advanced than that.;[];;[28300];[28298];man26_pcexile;
Why do you say that only we Selkath went mad?;[];;[28301, 28303, 28317];[28299];man26_pcexile;
A giant firaxan shark sent out some sort of psychic call.;[];;[28302];[28300, 28304];man26_pcexile;
The explosion... to kill a giant firaxan?;[];;[28268];[28301];man26_pcexile;
Because they were all insane and had eaten everyone else...;[];;[28304];[28300];man26_pcexile;
But why? If the entire station was driven mad, as would seem to be the case, surely there must have been some evidence that something had transpired down there. What was it?;[];;[28301, 28305];[28303, 28317];man26_pcexile;

Impossible! That machinery was constructed by us to last a thousand years!;[{'Judge Kota': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[28321];[28319];man26_pcexile;

You... YOU destroyed the machinery?!;[];;[28325];[28323];man26_pcexile;
You have ruined our efforts! All our work to synthesize kolto is worthless now!;[{'Judge Jhosa': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[28326];[28324];man26_pcexile;
Why did you do this... this thing, human?;[];;[28267, 28290, 28327];[28325];man26_pcexile;
I had no choice... but I can offer the data the Republic gained as compensation.;[];;[28328, 28333];[28326];man26_pcexile;

No. If we are rash, then we may never get the information we need to synthesize kolto.;[];;[28330];[28328, 28333];man26_pcexile;
This would seem to be a necessary evil...;[];;[28331];[28329];man26_pcexile;
We agree, human. In return for this data, we shall not execute you. But you cannot go unpunished.;[];;[28332];[28330];man26_pcexile;
We will allow the Republic to remain on this world, but you must answer for your own actions.;[];;[28209];[28331];man26_pcexile;

This is Admiral Forn Dodonna to the Ebon Hawk, do you read us?;[];;[28576];[28574];m12aa_c06;NM12AAC06001002_.mp3
Admiral Dodonna, this is Bastila Shan of the Jedi Order.  We are receiving your transmission.;[];;[28577];[28575];m12aa_c06;NM12AAC06001003_.mp3
It is good to hear your voice Bastila.  We had thought you were lost to us.  Carth's transmission reported that Malak had taken you prisoner.;[];;[28578];[28576];m12aa_c06;NM12AAC06001004_.mp3
The Jedi sent to rescue me from the Dark Lord did their job well - though I am sorry to report Carth did not survive the mission.;[];;[28579];[28577];m12aa_c06;NM12AAC06001005_.mp3
His loss is a great blow to the Republic.  We could have used him in this battle.;[];;[28580];[28578];m12aa_c06;NM12AAC06001006_.mp3
We were about to pull back.;[];;[28581];[28579];m12aa_c06;NM12AAC06001007_.mp3
We're taking heavy losses against the Star Forge.;[];;[28582];[28580];m12aa_c06;NM12AAC06001008_.mp3
Don't pull back, Admiral.  You have to attack the Star Forge now, otherwise the Sith will use its power to destroy the Republic.;[];;[28583];[28581];m12aa_c06;NM12AAC06001009_.mp3
I'll try to press the attack but we can't hold out much longer.  Not unless you can use your Battle Meditation to turn the tide.;[];;[28584];[28582];m12aa_c06;NM12AAC06001010_.mp3
This is Master Vandar.  A number of Jedi Knights have joined the fleet, under his command.;[];;[28585];[28583];m12aa_c06;NM12AAC06001011_.mp3
Bastila's power could help you win this battle, Admiral, but it will mean nothing if Malak escapes.  Destroying the Star Forge is secondary to stopping the Sith threat once and for all.;[];;[28586];[28584];m12aa_c06;NM12AAC06001012_.mp3
What are you proposing?;[];;[28587];[28585];m12aa_c06;NM12AAC06001013_.mp3
A small squadron of Jedi Knights in snub fighters could penetrate the Sith blockade and dock on the space station.  If they can find Malak we can end the threat of the Sith ## ...forever.;[];;[28588];[28586];m12aa_c06;NM12AAC06001014_.mp3
I'll order the fleet to press the attack and provide some cover for your fighters.  But what of Bastila and her Battle Meditation?;[];;[28589];[28587];m12aa_c06;NM12AAC06001016_.mp3
Bastila, you and... the Padawan... should join us.  We will need the combined strength of our entire Order to defeat Malak.;[];;[28590];[28588];m12aa_c06;NM12AAC06001017_.mp3
As you wish, Master Vandar.;[];;[28591];[28589];m12aa_c06;NM12AAC06001018_.mp3
And may the Force be with you.;[];;[28592];[28590];m12aa_c06;NM12AAC06001019_.mp3
The fools!  Even Master Vandar did not realize you have reclaimed your identity as the Dark Lord! ## The Jedi strike team and the Republic forces will provide the perfect distraction as we hunt down your ex-apprentice.  And once we have slain Malak, I can use my Battle Meditation ## and the power of the Star Forge to crush the Republic fleet.;[];;[28593];[28591];m12aa_c06;NM12AAC06001020_.mp3
All our enemies will be destroyed in a single glorious day!;[];;[];[28592];m12aa_c06;NM12AAC06001021_.mp3

Master, why have you summoned me? Without my Battle Meditation there is a chance the Republic capital ships could break through and attack the Star Forge itself!;[];;[28649];[None];k_sta_lightcut;NM45AALIGH01000_.mp3
This will not take long, Bastila. You will be able to resume your Battle Meditation soon enough. I only wanted you to know that Revan is here on the Star Forge.;[];;[28650];[28648];k_sta_lightcut;NM45AALIGH01001_.mp3

Y-yes, Lord Malak.;[];;[28654];[28652];k_sta_lightcut;NM45AALIGH01005_.mp3

Not so fast. I need to know if what Malak said about you is true or not, first. You aren't... you *can't* be, can you?;[];;[28665, 28770, 28771];[28663, 28777];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01005_.mp3
I don't care what Malak said! I'm not Darth Revan, I'm <FullName>.;[];;[28666];[28664, 28773];ebo_carth;
Revan? What... what are you talking about? Is this some kind of joke?;[];;[28667];[28665, 28770, 28772, 28774, 28776];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01011_.mp3
No, it's no joke. The Jedi Council captured Revan and erased the Dark Lord's mind, programming in a new identity. Saul Karath told me on the Leviathan and Bastila confirmed it!;[];;[28668];[28666];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01012_.mp3
You're Darth Revan? This is... this is big. Do you... do you remember anything about being the Dark Lord?;[];;[28669, 28768];[28667];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01013_.mp3
Small bits. A few strange dreams and visions. That's all.;[];;[28670];[28668];ebo_carth;
Just a few flashes? That's it? Nothing more? Then I don't think there's a problem.;[];;[28671];[28669, 28769];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01015_.mp3
It seems to me that if you don't really remember anything about being Revan, then it doesn't really matter anymore. You are who you are now, right?;[];;[28672];[28670];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01016_.mp3
Of course it still matters! How do we know more memories won't come flooding back? How do we know Revan won't suddenly turn on us?;[{'': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[28673, 28765];[28671];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01017_.mp3
I've been such a fool! I... I swore to protect you! And here you were the enemy all this time!;[];;[28674, 28759, 28761, 28763];[28672];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01018_.mp3
I'm not your enemy, Carth, I swear!;[];;[28675];[28673];ebo_carth;
But... you're the one responsible for the death of my wife, the destruction of my home world! You destroyed my life!;[];;[28676];[28674];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01020_.mp3
How could I have been such a fool! How could I have not known?! How could you betray me like this?!;[];;[28677, 28754, 28755];[28675, 28760, 28762, 28764];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01021_.mp3
I didn't know I was Revan! How could I have known?!;[];;[28678];[28676];ebo_carth;
You should have known. I...*sigh* I should have figured it out. I just can't... was, was everything a lie, then? Everything we talked about?;[];;[28679, 28750, 28752];[28677, 28754];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01023_.mp3
Everything that was important was real, Carth.;[];;[28680];[28678];ebo_carth;
Are you sure? I'm not sure what to believe any more. Who's to say that your old life won't come back... all of it?;[];;[28681];[28679];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01025_.mp3
Was the woman we knew Revan or... or someone else? Will you change into Revan? How...how can any of us trust you?;[];;[28682];[28680, 28751, 28753];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01030_.mp3
Well, I trust you! I know you... and you're not Revan anymore. Whatever you used to be, you're one of us now!;[];;[28683, 28685, 28749];[28681];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01031_.mp3
I agree with Mission. I swore a life-debt to the person you are, not to the person you were.;[];;[28684];[28682, 28758];ebo_carth;
"Big Z and I will stick by you. We owe you our lives; we won't desert you now!";[];;[28685, 28749];[28683];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01050_.mp3
I don't know if I can get over it that easily, Mission. I mean... after all Revan did... how could any of us forgive her?;[];;[28686, 28746];[28684, 28682, 28758];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01051_.mp3
It was Saul Karath who commanded the fleet that attacked your people, Carth. And it was Malak who gave the order. You know this.;[];;[28687];[28685, 28749];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01053_.mp3
"I have felt the presence of the dark side in you, Revan - as it is in all of us. I know the dangers of that path; yet I also know the fallen can be redeemed.";[];;[28688, 28744, 28745];[28686];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01054_.mp3
I judge you by your actions, and as long as we have been together I have seen you act as a servant of the light.;[];;[28689, 28692, 28696, 28711, 28714, 28729];[28687];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01055_.mp3
What about you, Jolee?;[];;[28690];[28688, 28695, 28710, 28713, 28744, 28745, 28747, 28748];ebo_carth;
What about me? I already knew who you were, though it wasn't my place to tell you. Better off that you know, if you ask me.;[];;[28691];[28689];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01057_.mp3
Does it change anything? I'm not here to judge you. You'll do what you have to, and I'll help if I can.;[];;[28692, 28696, 28711, 28714, 28729];[28690];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01058_.mp3
What do you think, Canderous?;[];;[28693];[28691, 28710, 28713, 28688, 28744, 28745, 28747, 28748];ebo_carth;
You defeated the Mandalore clans in the war, Revan. You were the only one in the galaxy who could best us.;[];;[28694];[28692];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01060_.mp3
We had never met one like you before, and never since. How can you even ask if I will follow you?;[];;[28695];[28693];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01061_.mp3
Whatever you are fighting, it will be worthy of my skill. I'm your man until the end, Revan, no matter how this plays out.;[];;[28689, 28696, 28711, 28714, 28729];[28694];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01062_.mp3
What do you have to say, HK-47?;[];;[28697];[28695, 28713, 28691, 28688, 28744, 28745, 28747, 28748];ebo_carth;
Commentary: I am... experiencing something unusual, master.;[];;[28698];[28696];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01064_.mp3
Why? What's happening?;[];;[28699];[28697];ebo_carth;
Answer: My programming is activating my deleted memory core. I believe I have a... a homing system that is restoring it, master.;[];;[28700, 28739, 28742, 28743];[28698];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01066_.mp3
So this is the... stimuli you were waiting for?;[];;[28701];[28699];ebo_carth;
Explanation: I believe so, master. I was unaware of my homing system until it had been activated.;[];;[28702];[28700];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01068_.mp3
It seems that the homing system deliberately restores my deleted memory core upon... upon returning to my original master.;[];;[28703];[28701, 28741];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01072_.mp3
You mean... Revan?;[];;[28704];[28702];ebo_carth;
Affirmation: Correct, master. Sith protocols maintain that all droid knowledge be deleted before assassination missions, and restored upon return.;[];;[28705];[28703];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01074_.mp3
I have returned to you, and my full functionality is now under your personal command. It is a distinct pleasure to see you again, master.;[];;[28706, 28733, 28735, 28737];[28704];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01075_.mp3
Well... that makes a lot of sense, actually.;[];;[28707];[28705];ebo_carth;
Observation: Indeed. I do hope we shall have the chance to engage in combat together again soon, master.;[];;[28708];[28706];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01077_.mp3
Wow. What are the chances of that happening?;[];;[28709, 28732];[28707, 28734, 28736, 28738];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01084_.mp3
Remember we're talking about the Force, here. At this point Malak himself could drop out of the sky and I wouldn't bat an eyelash.;[];;[28710];[28708];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01087_.mp3
Good point.;[];;[28689, 28692, 28711, 28714, 28729];[28709, 28732];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01086_.mp3
You won't abandon me, will you T3?;[];;[28712];[28710, 28695, 28691, 28688, 28744, 28745, 28747, 28748];ebo_carth;
Beep! Beep! Beep! Woop-woooop!;[];;[28713];[28711];ebo_carth;
I knew the little guy would come through for you - droids don't hold grudges.;[];;[28689, 28692, 28696, 28714, 28729];[28712];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01092_.mp3
Well, Carth - will you stand with me against Malak?;[];;[28715];[28713, 28710, 28695, 28691, 28688, 28744, 28745, 28747, 28748];ebo_carth;
Well, the others seem to trust you... and I don't see any other way that we can stop the Sith. And I suppose that Malak is the real enemy here... I really don't have any other choice, do I?;[];;[28716, 28726, 28727];[28714];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01094_.mp3
I won't let you down, Carth. I promise.;[];;[28717];[28715, 28731];ebo_carth;
I want to believe you. You've proven yourself time and time again during our mission, but this is a little much for me to wrap my mind around.;[];;[28718, 28724, 28725];[28716, 28726];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01096_.mp3
You have to try... for Bastila's sake.;[];;[28719];[28717];ebo_carth;
This must be even more of a shock to you... I don't know how you even keep going. I guess we both just have to find a way to push forward.;[];;[28720, 28722];[28718, 28724];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01098_.mp3
Don't worry about me - I'm a soldier. I can put aside my misgivings for now. We can, uh... we can talk later, you and I. Just give me time.;[];;[28721];[28719, 28725];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01099_.mp3
So I guess that's it then... we keep going. We've still got one more Star Map to uncover if we're going to find that Star Forge and save Bastila, so let's do it before it's too late.;[];;[];[28720, 28723];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01107_.mp3
Don't worry - I won't let my personal feelings get in the way of my assignments or this mission. But don't forget: I've sworn an oath to defend the Republic!;[];;[28723];[28719, 28725, 28728, 28727];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01105_.mp3
As long as this mission stays on course I'll stick with you. But I won't let you betray the Republic under any circumstances!;[];;[28721];[28722];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01106_.mp3
How do you think I feel?;[];;[28719];[28717];ebo_carth;
You have to find a way to deal with this, Carth.;[];;[28720, 28722];[28717];ebo_carth;
I'm not Revan anymore, Carth. You have to believe that.;[];;[28717];[28715, 28731];ebo_carth;
You're right - you don't have a choice! I'm in charge here!;[];;[28722, 28728];[28715, 28731];ebo_carth;
I see. Well, I guess that answers a lot of my questions about who you really are.;[];;[28722];[28727];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01104_.mp3
Well, Carth... what are you going to do?;[];;[28730];[28713, 28710, 28695, 28691, 28688, 28747, 28748];ebo_carth;
I don't know. Maybe I just need time to, uh... to think about it.;[];;[28731];[28729];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01109_.mp3
The others seem to trust you... and we need you to stop the Sith. And I suppose Malak is the real enemy here. But I don't have much choice but to go along with this for now, do I?;[];;[28716, 28726, 28727];[28730];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01110_.mp3
Beep! Beep-beep boop! Bwoooop.;[];;[28710];[28708];ebo_carth;
But I found you, you didn't find me!;[];;[28734];[28705];ebo_carth;
Think you'd never heard of the Force before. Seems obvious enough to me it was meant to be.;[];;[28708];[28733];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01079_.mp3
I'm not exactly Revan anymore, HK-47...;[];;[28736];[28705];ebo_carth;
Observation: That does not matter, master. I am your droid, regardless of your actions or personality.;[];;[28708];[28735];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01081_.mp3
Good. So long as you're loyal.;[];;[28738];[28705];ebo_carth;
Commentary: I believe I have served you well in the past, master, and will continue to do so for as long as you have need of me.;[];;[28708];[28737];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01083_.mp3
Everyone be careful... there's no telling what this means!;[];;[28740];[28699];ebo_carth;
Observation: That is unnecessary, master. My intent is not hostile. I am receiving no combat override commands.;[];;[28741];[28739, 28743];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01089_.mp3
Observation: My homing system is a function of my assassination protocols... that which I told you had been de-activated. This system was not.;[];;[28702];[28740, 28742];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01071_.mp3
Your homing system? What's that?;[];;[28741];[28699];ebo_carth;
I'll destroy you if you make a move, droid!;[];;[28740];[28699];ebo_carth;
I have seen signs of the taint of the dark side in your actions and deeds, but I will not give up on you as you did not give up on me. I will stay with you, Revan.;[];;[28689, 28692, 28696, 28711, 28714];[28687];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01111_.mp3
I can tell there is conflict between light and darkness within you. I do not know which way the struggle will turn, but I will not abandon you in this difficult time, as you did not abandon me.;[];;[28689, 28692, 28696, 28711, 28714];[28687];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01112_.mp3
Everyone knows it was Malak who gave the order to attack your people, Carth. You can't blame Revan for that.;[];;[28747, 28748];[28685, 28749];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01113_.mp3
It, uh... it all makes sense now... Revan. I've watched you, I've seen your cruelty. I've seen your... your dark side. And now this! I don't know if I can trust you. Can any of us?;[];;[28689, 28692, 28696, 28711, 28714, 28729];[28746];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01114_.mp3
I... I suppose you've proven yourself to be a friend of the Republic by your actions so far... Revan. But can I trust you? Can any of us?;[];;[28689, 28692, 28696, 28711, 28714, 28729];[28746];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01115_.mp3
How can you say that, Mission? The Sith bombed my home world! Revan took away my family and destroyed my life!;[];;[28686, 28746];[28684, 28682, 28758];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01052_.mp3
I don't know. Everything has changed, now.;[];;[28751];[28678];ebo_carth;
That's what I feared. Who's to say your old life won't come back... everything you felt and thought, all of it?;[];;[28681];[28750];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01027_.mp3
Why? Were you lying to me all that time?;[];;[28753];[28678];ebo_carth;
This isn't a joke. You know what I'm talking about. I'm talking about you, about the way you felt...;[];;[28681];[28752];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01029_.mp3
Please, Carth... don't do this to me!;[];;[28678];[28676];ebo_carth;
Get over it, Carth. We've got more important things to think about.;[];;[28756];[28676];ebo_carth;
Get over it? Yeah... yeah, I can get over it. I should have figured out earlier you weren't what you seemed. That's my fault.;[];;[28757];[28755];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01034_.mp3
Do you think everybody else is going to be so quick to 'get over it'? You think they're going to follow a Sith Lord?;[];;[28758];[28756];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01035_.mp3
I don't see the Sith Lord standing here, I see a friend who's been with us through thick and thin! Remember - Malak's the one who tried to destroy Taris!;[];;[28683, 28685, 28749];[28757, 28766, 28767];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01046_.mp3
I'm sorry, Carth... I wish this wasn't true.;[];;[28760];[28673, 28765];ebo_carth;
But it is true. It's horribly true! It was...it was you... you killed my wife, you ravaged my world. You...you destroyed my life!;[];;[28676];[28759];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01037_.mp3
Blame the Jedi Council for this, Carth - not me!;[];;[28762];[28673, 28765];ebo_carth;
It doesn't matter who's to blame. You're still the one who did it. You killed my wife... you betrayed everything that I believed in! You destroyed my life!;[];;[28676];[28761];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01039_.mp3
This changes nothing. I am who I am.;[];;[28764];[28673];ebo_carth;
Oh, it changes everything! It was... it was you! You were the one that attacked my world! You were the one that destroyed my life!;[];;[28676];[28763];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01041_.mp3
"The whole time we've been chasing after Malak we've had his old Sith Master right at our side; listening to our secrets; hearing our plans!";[];;[28759, 28761, 28766, 28767];[28672];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01042_.mp3
But I'm not the Dark Lord anymore, I'm <FullName>. I'm one of you!;[];;[28758];[28765];ebo_carth;
This changes nothing! I still want to stop Malak!;[];;[28758];[28765];ebo_carth;
I don't remember anything about being Revan.;[];;[28769];[28668];ebo_carth;
And so the lies begin. It was obvious you remembered something back there when Malak confronted you with the truth. It might have only been small pieces, but there was something there!;[];;[28670];[28768];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01117_.mp3
It looks that way. I'm... Darth Revan.;[];;[28666];[28664];ebo_carth;
Back off, Carth! There's nothing you can do about it!;[];;[28772];[28664];ebo_carth;
I suppose I shouldn't be surprised by your attitude now that I know who you really are... Revan.;[];;[28666];[28771];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01008_.mp3
Not so fast. We've got a bigger issue to deal with here. They deserve to know the truth about you. Do you want to tell them what Malak said, or should I?;[];;[28665, 28774, 28775];[28663, 28777];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01009_.mp3
I'll tell them. I'm... I'm Darth Revan.;[];;[28666];[28773];ebo_carth;
Say one word and you're dead, Carth!;[];;[28776];[28773];ebo_carth;
Threats? You can't bully me - though I shouldn't be surprised now that I know who you really are... Revan.;[];;[28666];[28775];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01120_.mp3
We can't help Bastila - not unless we find the Star Forge first.;[];;[28664, 28773];[28662, 28778, 28779];ebo_carth;
The Dark Lord will not kill her. He will want to use her battle meditation ability against the Republic. He will take her alive so he can turn her to the dark side. I am sure of it.;[];;[28663, 28777];[28661];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01122_.mp3
Malak won't kill her. I think he'll want to use her battle meditation against the Republic. He'll keep her alive so he can turn her to the dark side!;[];;[28663, 28777];[28661];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01123_.mp3
Where is Bastila? What happened on that ship?;[];;[28660];[None];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01124_.mp3
Hey, where's Bastila? What happened on the ship?;[];;[28660];[None];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01125_.mp3
Let's get out of here before they close those docking bay doors!;[];;[];[None];ebo_carth;NM40ADCART01126_.mp3
[Trask has bought you the time you need to escape. You should make your way to the Starboard Section of the ship.];[];;[];[None];end_door03;

If I remember the layout of this ship our equipment should be in a storage chamber just through the north doors. After we grab our stuff we need to get to the main bridge controls.;[];;[29009];[29007, 29028, 29029, 29030, 29031];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01061_.mp3
The bridge is the only place we can open the docking gates of the hangar where they've got the Ebon Hawk. We have to open those gates before we can fly out of here!;[];;[29010];[29008];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01062_.mp3
We better get moving. I can feel the darkness of Malak's presence approaching, and I don't want to be here when he arrives. None of us is a match for the Sith Lord.;[];;[29011, 29013, 29027];[29009];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01063_.mp3

Count me in, then. I've got a score to settle with the Admiral before we get off this ship, and I have a feeling I'm gonna find him on the Leviathan's bridge!;[];;[29016, 29023, 29026];[29014];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01068_.mp3
I'm coming, too!;[];;[29017];[29015];lev40_bast400;

The three of us will get our equipment and make our way to the bridge. The rest of you head down to the docking hangar where they've got the Ebon Hawk.

Good. Get to the equipment room, grab what you need, and get going.;[];;[29021];[29019];lev40_bast400;

We still have to get our equipment.  Let's go.;[];;[];[29021];lev40_bast400;
Careful, Carth, there's more at stake here than personal revenge.;[];;[29024];[29015];lev40_bast400;
That's true, Carth. You can come, but don't let your hatred of Saul Karath jeopardize our true mission: getting the Ebon Hawk safely off the Leviathan.;[];;[29025];[29023];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01075_.mp3
You better come with me and Carth. The others can find their way on their own, but we might run into trouble. We'll need you and your powerful Force abilities to deal with it.;[];;[29018];[29024, 29026];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01077_.mp3

Don't try to move too quickly, you might not be fully recovered yet. Admiral Karath had his guards continue to torture you even after you passed out.;[];;[29033];[None];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01000_.mp3
They tortured all of us, though you got the worst of it by far. Saul wanted them to make us suffer. He's become some sort of sadistic monster.;[];;[29034];[29032];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01001_.mp3
The dark side has perverted him, Carth. Once you start down the tainted path it leads you ever further into the depths of evil. I fear he is forever lost.;[];;[29035, 29086];[29033];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01002_.mp3
No one is without hope of redemption, Bastila.;[];;[29036];[29034];lev40_bast400;
Yes, hmm, I suppose you are correct. Sometimes it is easy to lose sight of that hope in the face of such unbridled cruelty, but you speak the truth.;[];;[29037];[29035];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01004_.mp3
I suppose I'm taking the news of Dantooine's destruction quite hard. First Taris, now the Academy... is there no end to the killing?;[];;[29038, 29084, 29085];[29036, 29088];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01005_.mp3
Maybe Admiral Karath was lying.;[];;[29039];[29037];lev40_bast400;
I'd like to believe that Saul was lying to us, but even as he said the words I knew they were true. The Academy is gone.;[];;[29040];[29038, 29084];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01007_.mp3
We should have felt a disturbance in the Force when the attack came. The fact that we did not is a bad sign. I fear the dark side is growing stronger, casting shadows our vision cannot pierce.;[];;[29041];[29039, 29085];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01008_.mp3
I can only hope that some of the Jedi escaped. Vrook, Vandar, Zhar... I cannot imagine all of them being gone. In any case, we have lost our one place of refuge in the galaxy.;[];;[29042];[29040];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01009_.mp3
None of this will matter if we don't get out of this prison before Saul gets back!;[];;[29043, 29083];[29041];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01010_.mp3
Where is Saul Karath now?;[];;[29044];[29042];lev40_bast400;
Saul mentioned that Lord Malak was on his way. I think the Admiral left to prepare for his arrival... and to report the results of our interrogation.;[];;[29045, 29070];[29043, 29083];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01012_.mp3
I only wish you had been able to resist the Admiral's questioning. I hope the information you revealed does not bring the entire galaxy under the dominion of the Sith.;[];;[29046, 29063, 29065, 29067];[29044];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01013_.mp3
I'm sorry, Bastila, but I couldn't just let you be tortured!;[];;[29047];[29045];lev40_bast400;
I appreciate your... feelings... for me. But you can't let your feelings override your judgment. Remember the Jedi code: There is no emotion, there is peace.;[];;[29048];[29046];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01015_.mp3

No, you would have just left someone you care about screaming in agony!;[];;[29052];[29050];lev40_bast400;
Stop it, both of you! Bastila, you... you can't honestly say how you would have reacted in that situation - nobody can! Besides, Saul already had all the information. I could tell.;[];;[29053];[29051];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01020_.mp3
The interrogation was a sham. Saul was toying with us. He didn't care what we told him. I think it was just an excuse to torture us before Malak arrived.;[];;[29054];[29052, 29062, 29064, 29069];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01027_.mp3
Did you feel that? A disturbance in the Force. The Admiral has sent his message, the Dark Lord knows we are here now. Malak is coming.;[];;[29055, 29056, 29057, 29058, 29059, 29060];[29053, 29074, 29078, 29082];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01028_.mp3

I'm... I'm sorry I failed you. I didn't know what else to do.;[];;[29062];[29050, 29048];lev40_bast400;
Don't be so hard on yourself. I've known the Admiral a long time. I could see that he already knew the answers to the questions he was asking.;[];;[29053];[29061];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01022_.mp3
Saul already knew the answers to the questions he was asking.;[];;[29064];[29048, 29045];lev40_bast400;
I've known Admiral Karath a long time and I think you're right.;[];;[29053];[29063, 29075];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01026_.mp3
I'm sorry, Bastila, but I couldn't just let Carth be tortured!;[];;[29066];[29045];lev40_bast400;
I appreciate your... feelings... for Carth. But you can't let your feelings override your judgment. Remember the Jedi code: There is no emotion, there is peace.;[];;[29048];[29065];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01024_.mp3
Why should I endure torture just to protect the Republic and the Jedi?;[];;[29068];[29045];lev40_bast400;
Your attitude disturbs me. Such selfishness is a sign of the dark side's taint, and it does little to fill me with confidence in you.;[];;[29069];[29067];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01036_.mp3
Forget about it, Bastila. It doesn't matter anyway. I've known the Admiral a long time. I could see that he already knew the answers to the questions he was asking.;[];;[29053];[29068];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01037_.mp3
It is fortunate you were able to resist the Admiral's questioning. The fate of the galaxy could be changed by revealing the slightest piece of vital information.;[];;[29071, 29079];[29044];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01038_.mp3
I have to confess something. There was a moment - just a moment - when part of me was hoping you would tell him what he wanted to know. Just to make the horrible pain stop.;[];;[29072, 29075, 29076];[29070];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01039_.mp3
I'm sorry, Bastila. Watching you suffer tore me apart.;[];;[29073];[29071];lev40_bast400;
I know you wouldn't ever do anything to intentionally cause me pain. But you did the right thing.;[];;[29074];[29072];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01041_.mp3
I don't honestly know if I could have been as strong in your position. To watch you suffer like that... it might have been too much for me to bear.;[];;[29054];[29073];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01042_.mp3
Saul would have tortured us no matter what I told him.;[];;[29064];[29071, 29079];lev40_bast400;
The only reason I stayed silent was to watch you suffer.;[];;[29077];[29071, 29079];lev40_bast400;
You wanted me to suffer? You enjoyed my torment? I don't know what to say. I thought there was a bond between us.;[];;[29078];[29076];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01045_.mp3
Maybe... maybe you're not the man I thought you were.;[];;[29054];[29077];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01046_.mp3
I, uh... I have to confess something. There was a... there was a moment - just a moment - when part of me was hoping that you would tell him what he wanted to know. Just to make the horrible pain stop.;[];;[29075, 29076, 29080];[29070];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01047_.mp3

No, I know you wouldn't ever do anything to intentionally cause me pain. But you had no other choice. You couldn't betray our cause.;[];;[29082];[29080];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01049_.mp3
I... I don't honestly know if I could have been as strong in your position. To watch you suffer like that I... I might have cracked.;[];;[29054];[29081];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01050_.mp3
I'm not afraid of him!;[];;[29044];[29042];lev40_bast400;

It's their own fault. They should have seen the attack coming.;[];;[29040];[29037];lev40_bast400;
Blah, blah, blah. Don't you ever get tired of being so preachy?;[];;[29087];[29034];lev40_bast400;

I'm sorry. Forgive me. Snapping at you like that won't help our situation.;[];;[29037];[29087];lev40_bast400;NM40AABAST01059_.mp3
Yes, I promised you an answer when we reached the Ebon Hawk, didn't I? But I'm afraid you won't like it. We should have some privacy for this.;[];;[29090, 29128];[None];test;
I can't deny that there are parts of you I am drawn to. Your power, your will. You are so much stronger than I am.;[];;[29091];[29089];test;
In some ways you make me feel weak, like I am caught up in the wake of our destiny. But at the same time, you make me feel stronger, more alive.;[];;[29092, 29127];[29090, 29128];test;
So what does this mean for us?;[];;[29093];[29091];test;
"I realize now these feelings are part of the bond we share. The Jedi Council surely realized this; they knew my loyalty to the doctrines of our Order would be tested on this mission.";[];;[29094];[29092, 29127];test;
By facing and overcoming my feelings for you I have learned a valuable lesson about control and the dangers of emotion. This is an important step in understanding the Force.;[];;[29095];[29093];test;
I'm sorry if this is not what you wanted to hear. But I felt it was important you know our... infatuation... was nothing more than a result of our powerful bond.;[];;[29096, 29116, 29122, 29123];[29094];test;
So I was just a stepping stone to you becoming a Master?;[];;[29097];[29095, 29124, 29126];test;

Difficult for you? What about me?;[];;[29099];[29097];test;
Why do you think I came to this decision? I know how hard this is for both of us! You just kept pressing forward, so I had to be the one to step up and do the right thing!;[];;[29100];[29098];test;
You're the one who can't face the truth! Malak has to be stopped. How can I do that if I let myself be blinded by my feelings for you?;[{'': 'Talk_Pleading'}];;[29101, 29116, 29119];[29099, 29121, 29122];test;
I'm going to stop Malak, Bastila. But I want to do it with you at my side.;[];;[29102];[29100];test;
You... you mean it, don't you? But how can I be sure you aren't making a mistake. I... I have to resist. I have to be strong for both of us.;[{'': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[29103, 29115, 29116, 29119];[29101];test;
You know I'm right, Bastila.;[];;[29104];[29102];test;

It didn't feel wrong to me.;[];;[29109];[29107];test;
It was... it was a moment of weakness. When I kissed you... we shouldn't have... no, I'm sorry.;[{'': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[29110];[29108, 29112];test;
I know we both wanted it, but we shouldn't have given in to our desire. We're Jedi! We can't act like this. Not now, not while we still have to deal with Malak!;[];;[29111];[29109];test;
I'm... I'm sorry. I don't blame you, but... it was a mistake. I have to get out of here before somebody sees us together!;[{'': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[];[29110];test;
We're not going back to this again, are we?;[];;[29109];[29107];test;
I love you Bastila. And I know you love me.;[];;[29114];[29104];test;
Okay, you've made your point. Now shut up and kiss me, you fool!;[{'': 'Flirt'}];;[29107];[29113];test;
You don't always have to be strong, Bastila. Give in just this once.;[];;[29104];[29102];test;
That's okay - I never felt anything for you anyway.;[];;[29117];[29102, 29100, 29097, 29126, 29124, 29095];test;
Oh, I thought... No, this is good. I'm glad you told me. This makes everything much easier.;[{'': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[29118];[29116];test;
Don't worry - I can put this behind me. Let's just continue on with what we must do. It is better this way.;[];;[];[29117];test;
I... I understand, Bastila.;[{'Player': 'Talk_Sad'}];;[29120];[29102, 29100, 29126];test;
I hope you can put this behind you. You need to focus on stopping Malak, as difficult as that may be. Come, we should continue our mission.;[];;[];[29119];test;
This is nothing but an excuse! You're afraid to face your feelings!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[29100];[29097];test;
You're rationalizing, Bastila. You're just scared to face the truth!;[{'Player': 'Talk_Forceful'}];;[29100];[29095, 29124, 29126];test;
So that's it? It's all over?;[];;[29124];[29095];test;
I'm... afraid so. Although I suppose I should thank you for all you've done. For the lessons you helped me learn.;[];;[29096, 29116, 29122, 29125];[29123];test;
Great - you learn a lesson and I get dumped!;[];;[29126];[29124];test;
I wish it could be otherwise, but you have to understand that this is the way it must be. I am a Jedi, after all.;[];;[29096, 29116, 29119, 29122];[29125];test;
And I feel more alive when I'm with you.;[];;[29093];[29091];test;
You're stronger than I am, and there's no point in telling me otherwise. You will be a great Jedi, I think. I hope.;[];;[29091];[29089];test;

Bastila - you're alive! Finally, things are looking up. Now we just need to figure out a way to get off this planet.;[];;[29143];[None];tar02_carbast;NM02AACARB01000_.mp3
You mean you don't have a plan to get off Taris yet? What have you been doing all this time?;[];;[29144, 29162, 29163];[29142];tar02_carbast;NM02AACARB01002_.mp3
We were trying to find you, remember?;[];;[29145];[29143];tar02_carbast;
"I see. Now that I'm back in charge of this mission, perhaps we can start doing things properly. Hopefully our escape from Taris will go more smoothly than when you ""rescued"" me from Brejik.";[];;[29146];[29144, 29162];tar02_carbast;NM02AACARB01004_.mp3
I know you're new at this, Bastila, but a leader doesn't berate her troops just because things aren't going as planned. Don't let your ego get in the way of the real issues here.;[];;[29147];[29145, 29164];tar02_carbast;NM02AACARB01006_.mp3
That hardly strikes me as an appropriate way of addressing your commander, Carth. I am a member of the Jedi Order and this is my mission. Don't forget that!;[];;[29148];[29146];tar02_carbast;NM02AACARB01008_.mp3
My Battle Meditation ability has helped the Republic many times in this war, and it will serve us well here I am sure.;[];;[29149];[29147];tar02_carbast;NM02AACARB01010_.mp3
Your talents might win us a few battles, but that doesn't make you a good leader! A good leader would at least listen to the advice of those who have seen more combat than she ever will!;[];;[29150, 29158, 29161];[29148];tar02_carbast;NM02AACARB01012_.mp3
Both of you settle down! This isn't helping.;[];;[29151];[29149];tar02_carbast;
Yes... You're right, of course. I apologize, Carth. This has been a difficult time for me. Of course I'm happy to listen to your advice. What do you suggest we do?;[];;[29152];[29150];tar02_carbast;NM02AACARB01014_.mp3
"First off we can't get hung up on who's in charge; we all need to work together if we want to get off this rock. The answer's out there, we just have to find it.";[];;[29153];[29151, 29160];tar02_carbast;NM02AACARB01016_.mp3
"Well said, Carth. And the sooner we start looking the better; I've already been a prisoner of the Vulkars and I don't plan on being captured by the Sith.";[];;[29154, 29156, 29157];[29152];tar02_carbast;NM02AACARB01018_.mp3
Don't worry. I won't let that happen!;[];;[29155];[29153];tar02_carbast;
I think we'll need some help getting off Taris. Maybe if we ask around one of the locals can help us out. We should probably start by asking around in the cantinas.;[];;[];[29154, 29156, 29157];tar02_carbast;NM02AACARB01021_.mp3
Okay, so what now?;[];;[29155];[29153];tar02_carbast;
Let's go find a way off this planet.;[];;[29155];[29153];tar02_carbast;
He's right. You aren't showing much leadership ability right now, Bastila.;[];;[29159];[29149];tar02_carbast;
You know, I had my doubts about this mission but I figured the Jedi Council wouldn't put you in charge if you weren't prepared. But here you are, acting like a spoiled child!;[];;[29160];[29158, 29161];tar02_carbast;NM02AACARB01025_.mp3
"I see. It's true I that don't have much military experience; perhaps I should not be so quick to judge. Very well, Carth: what do you suggest we do?";[];;[29152];[29159];tar02_carbast;NM02AACARB01027_.mp3
Carth! You can't talk to your commanding officer like that!;[];;[29159];[29149];tar02_carbast;

What is it?;[];;[29186];[29184];dan15_bastila;

We could use this map to follow their path and find the Star Forge ourselves. But we must be wary... they may have laid traps or concealed what they found.;[];;[29188, 29200];[29186];dan15_bastila;NM15AABAST02004_.mp3
So what is the Star Forge, exactly?;[];;[29189];[29187];dan15_bastila;
I... I don't know, but Revan and Malak were very interested in finding it. It must be a tool of some type... or maybe a weapon. Perhaps the Council can tell us more.;[];;[29190];[29188, 29200];dan15_bastila;NM15AABAST02007_.mp3

Perhaps those worlds have more clues.;[];;[29194];[29192];dan15_bastila;
I was thinking that, too. This map can't take us to the Star Forge, but I know that Revan and Malak visited Korriban at least once. Perhaps they discovered something more there.;[];;[29195];[29193, 29199];dan15_bastila;NM15AABAST02012_.mp3
They may have found something on each of the other worlds that completed this map. Maybe if we find all the pieces they will lead us to the Star Forge... and some way to destroy it.;[];;[29196, 29198];[29194];dan15_bastila;NM15AABAST02013_.mp3
