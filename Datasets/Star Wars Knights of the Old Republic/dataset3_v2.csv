Take care of yourself. The price of kolto tanks has jumped through the roof.;NM17AANEWS11000_.mp3
The Selkath put a bunch of export restrictions in place for kolto. It's hurting everybody.;NM17AANEWS11001_.mp3
I hear that Manaan is no longer shipping kolto. The Selkath must be trying to drive prices up.;NM17AANEWS11002_.mp3
If you have kolto tanks, use them sparingly. I can't find them cheap anywhere.;NM17AANEWS11003_.mp3
I'm sure I saw some holo-footage of you on the Manaan swoop track, what you doing here?;NM17AANEWS11004_.mp3
Did you win a regional swoop championship on Manaan or something? I recognize your face.;NM17AANEWS11005_.mp3
I heard about your Manaan win. I'm surprised the Tatooine track was able to attract a racer of your ability.;NM17AANEWS11006_.mp3
Motta swears he can get professional racers to come to Tatooine. If the Manaan Sector Champion is here, I guess he was right.;NM17AANEWS11007_.mp3
I hear Czerka is closing their Kashyyyk operation. Nobody seems to know why.;NM17AANEWS11008_.mp3
Czerka is claiming that their operation on Kashyyyk has become to costly to maintain. Sounds like a cover-up to me.;NM17AANEWS11009_.mp3
"No more supplies have been ordered for the Czerka outposts on Kashyyyk. Doesn't sound like ""economic restructuring"" to me.";NM17AANEWS11010_.mp3
A private trader told me about the bloodshed on Kashyyyk. Seems like Czerka wants to forget it was ever there.;NM17AANEWS11011_.mp3
A trader I know says there was some trouble on Korriban. I didn't want to hear about it. That's where the Sith Academy is.;NM17AANEWS11012_.mp3
If you're doing any private shipping, stay away from Korriban. Sounds like the Sith can't even get along with themselves.;NM17AANEWS11013_.mp3
Word is Korriban is a dangerous place to visit right now. Something about the Sith at the Academy.;NM17AANEWS11014_.mp3
I heard the Sith were fighting amongst themselves on Korriban. Course, they're always fighting someone.;NM17AANEWS11015_.mp3
I still haven't heard a final figure of how many people died on Taris.;NM17AANEWS11016_.mp3
"You never know what the Sith will do. Look at Taris; was there any reason for what happened there?";NM17AANEWS11017_.mp3
The Republic is too complacent. If they let Taris fall, do you think they care what happens out here?;NM17AANEWS11018_.mp3
With Taris gone, I wonder who the Sith will turn on next.;NM17AANEWS11019_.mp3
Move along, spacer.;NM22AACZER06000_.mp3
You want to arrange a purchase, go talk to the director in his office.;NM22AACZER06001_.mp3
This assignment is the worst in the galaxy.;NM22AACZER06002_.mp3
Czerka Corporation should burn down some trees. Make room for some swoop races.;NM22AACZER06003_.mp3
Keep walking. This ain't no holiday port of call.;NM22AACZER06004_.mp3
If you've business with Czerka Corporation, take it to the director's office.;NM22AACZER06005_.mp3
Take a walk, spacer. You don't look like a big buyer to me.;NM22AACZER06006_.mp3
Watch yourself. We don't need anyone agitating the locals.;NM22AACZER06007_.mp3
I was told that you're a friend of Jolee Bindo... and that Jolee has returned to the sector. Please, I must speak to him. It's very urgent!;NM26AAELOR04000_.mp3
Who are you?;
My name is Elora. My husband Sunry and Jolee are old friends. Now Sunry needs Jolee's help.;NM26AAELOR04002_.mp3
I shall tell Jolee immediately.;
Please, I beg you to bring Jolee to speak to me about my husband. Sunry's life depends on it!;NM26AAELOR04008_.mp3
Maybe I can help your husband.;
Someone is out to destroy my husband. I... I don't know who I can trust. I don't know you. But Jolee - he was always a true friend to Sunry.;NM26AAELOR04005_.mp3
Why do you need to speak to Jolee?;
I don't have time for this.;
Jolee! It *is* you! I... need your help.;NM26AAELOR04009_.mp3
Elora? Of all the people... How did you even know I'd left Kashyyyk?;NM26AAELOR04010_.mp3
I didn't. Nobody knew where you were, not even Sunry! But I heard the Selkath mention you and your friends. The Force has brought you to help us!;NM26AAELOR04011_.mp3
Why? Whatever could be the matter, my dear?;NM26AAELOR04012_.mp3
It's horrible, Jolee! Sunry has been arrested! The Sith have accused him of murder!;NM26AAELOR04013_.mp3
Murder? But how...;NM26AAELOR04014_.mp3
It's all a mistake, Jolee! Sunry isn't a murderer - someone is trying to frame him.;NM26AAELOR04015_.mp3
Calm down, Elora. Where's Sunry now?;NM26AAELOR04016_.mp3
Sunry's being held at the Selkath courts. They won't let anyone in to see him. Please, go to the courts, talk to the Judges. Maybe the Selkath will listen to you.;NM26AAELOR04047_.mp3
Don't worry, Elora. We'll get to the bottom of this and help Sunry... somehow.;NM26AAELOR04048_.mp3
I hear you have been appointed as Arbiter in Sunry's trial. My husband is innocent - please don't let him go to jail for a crime he didn't commit!;NM26AAELOR04017_.mp3
Can you tell me anything about Sunry?;
Sunry is... he's a cripple. There's no way he could have overpowered this Sith woman like they claim.;NM26AAELOR04019_.mp3
That's true... I'd forgotten about that. Let's not forget that he would have had to have been considerably older than the Sith woman.;NM26AAELOR04020_.mp3
Are you saying someone your age couldn't overpower a woman?;
Hmph. I'm a Jedi... and one who was living alone in the Shadowlands until recently. That keeps you in shape, damn it! We're talking about Sunry, here.;NM26AAELOR04022_.mp3
And there's no way he would do something so dishonorable as hit her from behind. Sunry's a decorated war hero! He's a hero of the Republic!;NM26AAELOR04023_.mp3
Don't worry, Elora. I'll save him.;
Find the real evidence, that's all I ask. The real evidence will prove Sunry didn't do this.;NM26AAELOR04043_.mp3
Your husband might not be so innocent, Elora.;
This is all a plot to discredit the Republic! Sunry is a victim of a Sith frame up!;NM26AAELOR04045_.mp3
It's possible. I haven't seen Sunry since I crashed on Kashyyyk... a man can change a lot in that time. The man I knew could never have done this crime, however.;NM26AAELOR04046_.mp3
[Persuade] Was Sunry having an affair?;
[Success] Of... of course not! He... he... *sob*;NM26AAELOR04025_.mp3
Yes... *sob* ...yes, he was having an affair. He was seeing that... that Sith woman.;NM26AAELOR04026_.mp3
After all these years we've been together he just... just dropped me like that. Not publicly, oh no, but inside that's what it feels like.;NM26AAELOR04027_.mp3
He started seeing Elassa last year. I... I had my suspicions for a while, but he was careless. Pretty soon everyone knew.;NM26AAELOR04028_.mp3
But... but... even though I'm sure that harlot was only using him, I know he couldn't have killed her. He came and confessed to the affair to me. He said he was going there to break it off - to end it.;NM26AAELOR04029_.mp3
Maybe the Sith woman attacked him and he had to defend himself?;NM26AAELOR04030_.mp3
But even though he cheated on me, inside he's still the man I loved... love... He is too kind and gentle to have killed her in cold blood.;NM26AAELOR04031_.mp3
He is a soldier, though.;
That was a long time ago, in a war far, far away. He's changed now... settled down. Just please, prove his innocence.;NM26AAELOR04033_.mp3
He has killed many Sith before.;
[Failure] What?? Don't insult us both! Sunry is... Sunry is a just and honorable man. How dare you accuse him... us, of such a thing!;NM26AAELOR04035_.mp3
Now, now, Elora. We're not here to pass judgment, my dear. We do need to know everything if we're to help, yes?;NM26AAELOR04036_.mp3
Madam. I would remind you that I am a Jedi. Now, then... was he having an affair?;NM26AAELOR04037_.mp3
Find proof to set him free instead of bringing these baseless accusations against us.;NM26AAELOR04038_.mp3
Tell me about Sunry and Elassa.;
I have this recording showing Sunry killing Elassa.;
Lies! It... it must be! I knew the Sith would never let a Republic hero get away... You must find Sunry innocent!;NM26AAELOR04041_.mp3
A horrible fate for poor Hendar... I warned him not to leave the safety of the village.;NM04AAOUTM18000_.mp3
But I couldn't open the gate... not while the rakghouls were so close. I had to protect the village.;NM04AAOUTM18001_.mp3
But enough of this grim talk... we must focus on the positive if we are to survive down here. How can I help you, up-worlder?;NM04AAOUTM18002_.mp3
Open the gate for me.;
I will open the gate for you, up-worlder, but you've got to be quick. In a few seconds I must close and lock it again for the safety of the village.;NM04AAOUTM18011_.mp3
Who are you?;
I am Trewin, from the Outcast village. It's my job to guard the gates and see they are locked to protect us from the rakghouls.;NM04AAOUTM18019_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;
Heh. I just guard the gates. Gendar is the leader of the village, up-worlder. You should speak to him if you have any questions.;NM04AAOUTM18021_.mp3
Goodbye.;
Goodbye, up-worlder.;NM04AAOUTM18023_.mp3
Thank you for saving Hendar. You are braver than I, up-worlder. Maybe we Outcasts have lived too long in selfish fear.;NM04AAOUTM18003_.mp3
Perhaps we can learn a lesson from your brave actions. Hmph. But enough of my ramblings... is there something you need, up-worlder?;NM04AAOUTM18004_.mp3
You're not from the village. In fact, you look like you're from the up-world!;NM04AAOUTM18005_.mp3
I don't know why you'd come down here to our village, but I guess I can let you in. There don't seem to be any rakghouls nearby.;NM04AAOUTM18006_.mp3
Hurry, up-worlder. I can only leave the gate open for a few seconds. I can't risk letting the rakghouls in!;NM04AAOUTM18007_.mp3
I can't open the gate... not while the rakghouls are so near.;NM04AAOUTM18008_.mp3
Open the gate... I will kill the rakghouls.;
You would risk your life for a stranger? You are brave... or foolish.;NM04AAOUTM18010_.mp3
You're right, it's too dangerous. Leave the gate closed.;
*Sigh* A horrible fate for poor Hendar. I warned him not to leave the safety of the village.;NM04AAOUTM18013_.mp3
Keep the gate closed. I'm not risking my life here.;
The gate is open. If you're going through you have to hurry, up-worlder, before I have to close it again.;NM04AAOUTM18015_.mp3
Yes, up-worlder? Is there something you need?;NM04AAOUTM18016_.mp3
So do we have a deal?;NM26AAREPN12000_.mp3
That's an awful lot of money... is there something you're not telling me?;NM26AAREPN12001_.mp3
Don't be so suspicious. The Republic is generous, we pay our mercenaries well.;NM26AAREPN12002_.mp3
Makes sense, I guess. Alright, I'm in. When do I start?;NM26AAREPN12003_.mp3
Just show up at the Republic Embassy tomorrow and speak to our Representative there. I'm sure he'll have some task he wants you to start on right away.;NM26AAREPN12004_.mp3
Do you mind? I'm in the middle of a Republic recruiting drive right now. I need to hire these mercenaries before they sign up with the Sith.;NM26AAREPN12005_.mp3
Why are you hiring mercenaries?;
In case you hadn't noticed, there's a war on. If we don't hire these mercs, the Sith will. Now excuse me, I have to continue my recruitments.;NM26AAREPN12007_.mp3
Maybe you could hire me?;
I don't know if you've got what we're looking for... Jedi aren't generally suited to mercenary work. If you want, talk to Roland Wann at the Republic Embassy and see if he can find anything for you.;NM26AAREPN12009_.mp3
It's north of here, then east past the first courtyard. It's just off the north end of the second courtyard. You can't miss it.;NM26AAREPN12010_.mp3
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to continue my recruitments.;NM26AAREPN12011_.mp3
I'll be going now.;
Good. The longer I spend talking to you, the less time I have to talk to the mercs.;NM26AAREPN12013_.mp3
The second tomb on the left within the valley is the tomb of Naga Sadow. It is off-limits to all students, unless they are in the company of Master Uthar.;NM36AASITH07000_.mp3
Beware of the tuk'ata. They are a pack beast that have their nests in one of the tombs. We fight them off as best we can.;NM36AASITH07001_.mp3
There is an old Sith hermit that has been haunting this area, we understand. Watch out for him.;NM36AASITH07002_.mp3
A dangerous assassin droid has barricaded itself within the tomb of Marka Ragnos, the first one on the left. Be wary.;NM36AASITH07003_.mp3
Watch out for the tuk'ata. They will charge you on sight. Run back to the excavation area and we can protect you.;NM36AASITH07004_.mp3
Any artifacts found should be brought to the attention of Master Uthar immediately.;NM36AASITH07005_.mp3
I am not here to get you out of trouble if you do something stupid, student. Enter the tombs at your own risk.;NM36AASITH07006_.mp3
I will stay here in this chamber and use my Battle Meditation to aid the Republic fleet. I am their only hope of destroying the Star Forge and ending the Sith menace.;NM45AABAST01114_.mp3
You must go and face Malak, but you have to hurry. Once I turn the battle in the Republic's favor we won't have much time to escape the Star Forge before it is destroyed.;NM45AABAST01115_.mp3
Good luck, my love... and may the Force be with you.;NM45AABAST01116_.mp3
Good luck... and may the Force be with you.;NM45AABAST01117_.mp3
The Star Forge is under assault from the entire Republic fleet! If I don't use my Battle Meditation to turn the tide, Admiral Dodonna's capital ships will destroy the Star Forge.;NM45AABAST01166_.mp3
I have to stay here in the command center so that I can best use my Battle Meditation against our enemy. If I don't the Star Forge will be lost!;NM45AABAST01167_.mp3
You must go to face Malak without me. Find him, kill him and reclaim the title of Dark Lord of the Sith!;NM45AABAST01168_.mp3
Revan - I knew you'd come for me.;NM45AABAST01165_.mp3
I'm <FullName> now, Bastila. Revan is no more.;
Sadly, I know this is true. Had you reclaimed the power of your previous identity I would be your apprentice, not Malak's. But you rejected the dark side.;NM45AABAST01006_.mp3
Now you must pay the price. Here on the Star Forge the power of the dark side is at its strongest. This time you will not defeat me!;NM45AABAST01007_.mp3
I'll never give up on you, Bastila. I know you can still be saved.;
You are wasting your time. I have seen the Jedi for what they are: weak and afraid. The Sith are the true Masters of the Force. You have forgotten that lesson, Revan.;NM45AABAST01009_.mp3
You can't escape, Bastila! Wherever you run I'll hunt you down!;
I have no doubt of that. I was no match for you in the Temple, but when I fled I knew you would follow me here.;NM45AABAST01011_.mp3
I see now why Malak followed you. Even though you are only a shell of your former self, you are still a formidable opponent.;NM45AABAST01012_.mp3
I can't even imagine the power you must have wielded when you were the Dark Lord. You were a fool to give it all up and follow the light side.;NM45AABAST01013_.mp3
I am as strong in the light as I ever was following the dark side.;
The dark side has made me stronger than I ever was before! I have a greater command of the Force than all but the most powerful Jedi Masters.;NM45AABAST01015_.mp3
As Malak teaches me the greatest secrets of the Sith, I will unlock more of my potential. Eventually there will be no limit to what I can accomplish with the Force!;NM45AABAST01016_.mp3
Malak will never let you become that powerful. He will kill you first.;
Have you forgotten the ways of the Sith already, Revan? Eventually I will challenge my Master. If I am worthy he will die by my hand and I will become the new Sith Master.;NM45AABAST01018_.mp3
Then I will take on my own apprentice and the cycle will begin again. This is the way of the Sith, it is how we assure our leaders are always the strongest and most worthy!;NM45AABAST01019_.mp3
You're dooming yourself to an endless cycle of death and betrayal.;
No, Revan, it is you who are doomed!;NM45AABAST01021_.mp3
I won't let that happen! I'll kill you first!;
No, Revan. You are the one who will die here!;NM45AABAST01025_.mp3
You will accomplish death and destruction with the dark side, nothing else.;
Jedi propaganda. The dark side is only a tool, and Malak will train me in its use. Eventually I will surpass my Master and challenge him. If I am worthy he will die by my hand.;NM45AABAST01023_.mp3
You've been consumed by the dark side, Bastila. Can't you see it's destroying you?;
I'm still strong enough to defeat you, Bastila!;
Then it's time for you to prove it!;NM45AABAST01028_.mp3
You are growing weary, I can sense it! Your strength falters, the light side is failing you while the power of the Star Forge re-energizes me! Soon this will all be over!;NM45AABAST01029_.mp3
I have not faltered, Bastila. You have been misled by the dark side.;
The dark side will always triumph over the light! Malak has assured me of victory! You can't defeat me here on the Star Forge! YOU CAN'T!;NM45AABAST01031_.mp3
Then strike me down, Bastila. I won't defend myself.;
What type of trick is this?;NM45AABAST01036_.mp3
Remember what you once were, Bastila. A Jedi would never strike down a defenseless opponent.;
I am a Sith apprentice now. You place too much faith in what I used to be... and for that you shall pay!;NM45AABAST01039_.mp3
You are not evil, Bastila. You will not strike down a defenseless opponent.;
We meant something to each other, once. I don't believe you will strike me down.;
Your emotions get the better of you, Bastila. Remember the Jedi code.;
You dare spew those Jedi lies in my face? You will die screaming, Revan!;NM45AABAST01033_.mp3
You are the one growing weak, Bastila. I hear the desperation in your voice!;
No, this is not possible! You have rejected the dark side, you are a weak and pathetic servant of the light! How can you still stand against me? Why can't I defeat you?;NM45AABAST01041_.mp3
Now you see the dark side is not stronger than the light.;
Yes, I see you speak the truth. I am no match for you. Please, for the sake of what we once shared, do not make me suffer. End my life quickly. There is no other way.;NM45AABAST01044_.mp3
I could never kill you, Bastila.;
What other choice do you have? I have fallen to the dark side, I am the apprentice to the Dark Lord himself. You cannot let me live.;NM45AABAST01047_.mp3
You can reject the dark side, Bastila. Return to the light.;
No... I'm not strong enough. There is too much anger inside me now. Too much hatred and fear. I can no longer find peace in the Force.;NM45AABAST01049_.mp3
[Persuade] Use our bond, then. Take your strength from me.;
[Success] You... always had more strength than I did. I told you that. I felt so... helpless before your destiny.;NM45AABAST01051_.mp3
You were Revan and I couldn't tell you... it was agonizing! Even worse when I began to... feel closer to you. I despised myself for it.;NM45AABAST01052_.mp3
And even now I... feel your strength. It... does help me. Thank you, I think I can face the end, now. If you are the one to end it for me.;NM45AABAST01053_.mp3
[Persuade] I love you, Bastila. I can't abandon you, ever.;
[Success] You... love me? Heh. I... there was a time I yearned for and yet dreaded to hear those words. I loved you, too, but I could never... face who you were.;NM45AABAST01108_.mp3
Malak knew how I felt. Any part of the light that was within me would be extinguished when I killed you.;NM45AABAST01109_.mp3
But what good is love? It cannot save me from the sea of blackness I am drowning in. I have betrayed everything I ever believed in! How can I atone for that?;NM45AABAST01110_.mp3
Help us defeat the Sith, Bastila. This will atone for what you have done.;
Yes, I... could join you in your battle against the Dark Lord. That alone would not make up for all I have done, yet... it would be a step in the right direction.;NM45AABAST01065_.mp3
But how would you be able to trust me? How do you know I wouldn't turn on you when you faced Darth Malak? How do you know the dark side wouldn't make me betray you again?;NM45AABAST01066_.mp3
I trust you enough to leave myself open to your attack, Bastila.;
You play a dangerous game. Are you certain you wish to take this risk? I could end your life and gain Malak's favor with a single stroke of my lightsaber.;NM45AABAST01068_.mp3
You won't, Bastila. Because I love you and I believe in you.;
You are brave... and some would say foolish. But you are also right. The dark side has not wholly consumed me. I cannot raise my blade against you.;NM45AABAST01071_.mp3
You will go on to defeat Malak, of this I have little doubt. You will have gone from being the Sith Lord, himself, to the savior of our galaxy.;NM45AABAST01072_.mp3
And... and you said you loved me. This may not be the best time to say it, but...;NM45AABAST01073_.mp3
I love you, too. With all my heart.;NM45AABAST01074_.mp3
You aren't afraid to love anymore?;
After this? No, nothing could make me feel safer than to be loved by you.;NM45AABAST01076_.mp3
You should go. Malak awaits. This isn't over, yet... for any of us.;NM45AABAST01083_.mp3
I should stay here, though. If we face Malak I am afraid his dark presence will overwhelm me. It would not be wise to expose myself to such temptation.;NM45AABAST01084_.mp3
Bastila, I want you at my side when I face the Dark Lord.;
I'm sorry, but the risk is too great. I am not wholly free of the dark side's shadow. Not yet. But you are more than a match for the Dark Lord. I understand that now.;NM45AABAST01086_.mp3
You could use your Battle Meditation to aid the Republic fleet.;
Yes, that would be for the best. You don't need me to defeat Malak, anyway. Now I understand that a true Jedi is a match for any Sith. Even the Dark Lord himself.;NM45AABAST01088_.mp3
I... I must know something, first, before that happens. I must ask you something.;NM45AABAST01077_.mp3
Will there be a place for me in your future? Do you... do you love me?;NM45AABAST01078_.mp3
I do love you, Bastila.;
I love you, Bastila, but after everything that's happened...;
I see. Thank you for your honesty. It's probably for the best that it goes no further. You saved me and I will always be grateful.;NM45AABAST01082_.mp3
No. I'm sorry, Bastila, but I don't love you.;
You are brave... and foolish. The dark side has wholly consumed me, and you will suffer for failing to see that!;NM45AABAST01089_.mp3
You won't, Bastila. I know you still serve the light side.;
You're right. I suppose I can't trust you, after all.;
A wise decision. You cannot trust me, and you cannot bring yourself to execute me. I see now there is only one way this can end. The time for words is done! Defend yourself!;NM45AABAST01091_.mp3
You're right. Don't worry, you won't feel a thing.;
Do it. Quickly...;NM45AABAST01112_.mp3
[Failure] There is nothing in my heart but the blackness of the dark side! I am sick of your preaching, Revan!;NM45AABAST01063_.mp3
I ask you for an honorable death, but you are too weak to even grant me that! No more words! This must end with blood!;NM45AABAST01093_.mp3
[Persuade] Look into your heart, Bastila, and you will find the light.;
[Success] I... I know a flicker of the light still burns within me. Malak felt it too. He knew it could only be extinguished if I killed you.;NM45AABAST01061_.mp3
But what good is a single flicker of light against the sea of darkness I am drowning in? I can never atone for my betrayal.;NM45AABAST01062_.mp3
I was redeemed, Bastila. You can be, too.;
You were a special case. The Council had no other choice. They needed you alive so they could discover the location of the Star Forge. It was an act of desperation.;NM45AABAST01097_.mp3
It was my responsibility to watch over you, to make sure you did not slip back into your evil ways. I was supposed to protect you from the dark side.;NM45AABAST01098_.mp3
You did protect me, Bastila.;
But at what cost? In protecting you, I fell to the dark side myself. Is that the price of a Jedi's redemption? Must another of the Order fall to save me?;NM45AABAST01100_.mp3
I cannot allow that to happen. Please, this is too painful. Strike me down. End this now, quickly. There is no other way.;NM45AABAST01101_.mp3
You can't protect someone from the dark side. Each individual must choose their own path.;
I... I suppose you are right. Yet the path I have chosen is that of the dark side. I don't see any way I could atone for what I have done. I deserve to die.;NM45AABAST01103_.mp3
You did more than protect me, Bastila.;
It's true I possess... feelings for you. But was it only an illusion brought about by our bond? And what was the cost?;NM45AABAST01105_.mp3
Please... this is too painful. End it now, quickly. There is no other way.;NM45AABAST01106_.mp3
I was the Dark Lord, Bastila, and the Jedi Council let me live.;
[Failure!] No! That bond is what took me down this path to begin with! It poisoned me... I hated myself for loving you and now I have betrayed everything!;NM45AABAST01054_.mp3
[Persuade] Turn to the Jedi code, Bastila. It can help you.;
[Success] I doubt mere words can help me now, but to appease you I will recite them:;NM45AABAST01056_.mp3
There is no emotion: there is peace. There is no ignorance: there is knowledge. There is no passion: there is serenity. There is no chaos: there is harmony...;NM45AABAST01057_.mp3
Strange, but even now I find comfort in these words. I... suppose old habits die hard.;NM45AABAST01058_.mp3
There is no death: there is the Force. Thank you, Revan. I am ready to face my fate now.;NM45AABAST01059_.mp3
[Failure] The Jedi code is nothing but words, the babblings of senile old Masters! The code cannot help me now!;NM45AABAST01092_.mp3
There's no need for me to kill you, Bastila.;
I am stronger than you could ever be, Bastila!;
You can't win, Bastila. Now you must die!;
You there! Up-worlder! Anyone using this elevator has to pay the toll!;NM04AAOUTM14000_.mp3
Yeah, this is our elevator! If you use it, you've got to give us something!;NM04AAOUTM14001_.mp3
I don't believe this planet! Even the beggars are trying to shake us down.;NM04AAOUTM14060_.mp3
Five credits! That's what it costs to use our elevator! Five credits!;NM04AAOUTM14002_.mp3
Who are you? What are you doing here in the Undercity?;
We are the Outcasts, banished and reviled by those who dwell above!;NM04AAOUTM14004_.mp3
Here in the filth and darkness we claw out a wretched existence, scavenging and begging just to survive long enough to see another wretched day.;NM04AAOUTM14005_.mp3
This is our village. We live here in the undercity. You have to pay us five credits for using our elevator.;NM04AAOUTM14006_.mp3
You poor wretches. Here's 20 credits to buy some food and clothing.;
Credits, my brother! We have credits! Now we can buy food and medicine!;NM04AAOUTM14011_.mp3
Hush, or the others will hear us! They'll want our credits! We have to hide them!;NM04AAOUTM14012_.mp3
Go on, you two! Get out of here! I'm sorry about that... those two beggars give everyone in the village a bad name! We aren't all like that, you know. Most of us are good people.;NM04AASHAL27002_.mp3
I'm sure you are, miss. It's just too bad your little welcoming committee is there to give people a bad first impression.;NM04AAOUTM14062_.mp3
My name's <FullName>. Who are you?;
My name is Shaleena... you're from the up-world, aren't you? I've... I've never seen it. I was born here in the Undercity. Is it as nice as they say up there?;NM04AASHAL27003_.mp3
The surface is a beautiful place.;
I've never been to the surface, but sometimes I think I can see it in my dreams. The sun, the sky, the stars... it all sounds so... so... so wonderful.;NM04AASHAL27005_.mp3
Gendar, the leader of our village, tells me I should spend more time trying to improve things down here and less time dreaming about something I can never have. Maybe he's right.;NM04AASHAL27006_.mp3
You probably think I'm a fool, having dreams of a place I've never even seen. But when I was little, Rukil used to tell me stories of what it was like up there.;NM04AASHAL27007_.mp3
Rukil? Who's that?;
Rukil's the oldest man in the village. The kids call him Rukil Wrinkle-Skin, but he's a kind man. He used to tell me the greatest stories when I was a little girl.;NM04AASHAL27009_.mp3
I still like to listen to his tales about the Promised Land, even though I know they're just legends. But it helps to make the Undercity seem less... less dark, somehow.;NM04AASHAL27010_.mp3
The Promised Land? What's that?;
It's... it's just a story to make little children smile. Rukil believes in it, though. Sometimes I can almost believe it myself, but then I look around and I see the ugly truth.;NM04AASHAL27012_.mp3
*sigh* I guess we have to make the best of what we have though. If you really want to learn more about the promised land you should speak to Rukil.;NM04AASHAL27013_.mp3
Where can I find Rukil?;
He's wandering around somewhere on the south side of the village. He doesn't move too far... it's hard on his bones. He's over 100 years old!;NM04AASHAL27019_.mp3
The children laugh at him and people think he's crazy because of his stories about the Promised Land, but he's really just a kind old man.;NM04AASHAL27020_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;
You'd probably get more information from Gendar, the village leader. Or maybe Rukil. But I'll tell you whatever I can.;NM04AASHAL27015_.mp3
Where can I find Gendar?;
He'll be somewhere in the village. I couldn't say where for sure. He's always busy, doing whatever he can to make the lives of the other villagers easier.;NM04AASHAL27017_.mp3
I'll be going now.;
Oh... okay. Well, if you ever need anything, or if you just feel like talking, come back and see me. I hardly ever get a chance to speak to someone from the up-world.;NM04AASHAL27042_.mp3
Do you know anything about the escape pods that crashed into the Undercity?;
I don't know anything about that, but maybe Gendar could help you. Sorry... is there anything else you need?;NM04AASHAL27022_.mp3
Have any other up-worlders come through here recently?;
There were quite a few people from the surface marching through the village, but none of them bothered to talk to me. Gendar might know more about them.;NM04AASHAL27024_.mp3
Tell me about this village.;
Well, I was born here for starters. My parents were Outcasts, banished to the Undercity for some crime or other... they never really liked to talk about it.;NM04AASHAL27026_.mp3
Everyone here is an Outcast... or the descendant of one. It's tough down here, but we survive. I guess it's easier for me, since I've never known anything different.;NM04AASHAL27027_.mp3
"Some of the people have given up all hope; they've become bitter and depressed. But most of us are good people... despite what our ancestors may have done.";NM04AASHAL27028_.mp3
Gendar could probably tell you more. Or maybe Rukil. You could talk to them if you want.;NM04AASHAL27029_.mp3
I don't have time for this.;
Of course... I'm sorry. You're probably here for something important, right? You probably want to speak to Gendar. He's the leader of our village.;NM04AASHAL27035_.mp3
But if you... if you have time later, maybe you could come back and speak to me again. I don't get much chance to talk with people from the surface.;NM04AASHAL27036_.mp3
It's nothing special.;
Not to you, I suppose. But you're probably used to its beauty by now.;NM04AASHAL27031_.mp3
It's better than this festering slime pit.;
I... I suppose our world doesn't look like much to you. It's dark and cold and lonely down here - but this is the only world I've ever known.;NM04AASHAL27033_.mp3
What do you want?;
Okay, here's five credits.;
I don't have any credits on me.;
We are not fools... we know all who come from the up-world are rich! Please, is 5 credits so much to ask?;NM04AAOUTM14009_.mp3
Please, have pity on us. We have nothing. All we ask is a few credits to make our lives easier.;NM04AAOUTM14014_.mp3
Get out of here you filthy beggars, or I'll use my blaster to end your suffering permanently!;
Run, my brother! Flee this one's wrath!;NM04AAOUTM14019_.mp3
Forget it! You get nothing from me!;
Have you no heart? Have you no compassion?;NM04AAOUTM14016_.mp3
Come, my brother - let us go. We will get nothing from this selfish up-worlder!;NM04AAOUTM14017_.mp3
This is a public elevator! I'm not paying any toll!;
So... is there news? Is the passageway clear?;NM34AATHAL03000_.mp3
No. But thanks for letting your guard down.;
You... you tricked us! You just wanted to get closer!! Quick, get them!!;NM34AATHAL03002_.mp3
Not yet, but I'm working on it.;
Alright. We'll keep waiting, then. Watch out for that beast... it's dangerous.;NM34AATHAL03004_.mp3
It's clear. You're free to go.;
It... it's clear? We can go?;NM34AATHAL03006_.mp3
Thank you. This... I wasn't expecting help from anyone in the academy. I guess we aren't the only ones who don't... agree with everything.;NM34AATHAL03007_.mp3
Maybe... maybe the Jedi will accept us. I've seen how evil the dark side is. Maybe I could try.;NM34AATHAL03008_.mp3
At any rate, thank you again. You've saved our lives.;NM34AATHAL03009_.mp3
Hold it right there, whoever you are! We... we're not going back to the academy! We'll kill you rather than go back!;NM34AATHAL03010_.mp3
Go back? What are you talking about?;
You mean you aren't here to kill us or bring us back? I find that hard to believe. The only way into these caves is through the academy. You must be a Sith.;NM34AATHAL03012_.mp3
So what is it, then? If you're not here to kill us or bring us back, why are you here? Speak up!;NM34AATHAL03013_.mp3
Okay, you got me. I'm here to kill you after all.;
Open fire! Get them! Get them!!;NM34AATHAL03040_.mp3
Slow down and tell me what you're doing here.;
So you don't know about us? I don't know if I'm ready to believe that or not, but I'll play along for the moment.;NM34AATHAL03016_.mp3
My name is Thalia May. The others here and myself refused to murder a bunch of people on a whim from Master Uthar... so here we are.;NM34AATHAL03017_.mp3
We thought that becoming a Sith was what we always wanted, but that wasn't true. Now all we want is to get out of here. Fair enough?;NM34AATHAL03018_.mp3
Maybe I can help you.;
Help us? Why should I believe that this isn't some kind of trick?;NM34AATHAL03020_.mp3
[Persuade] Give me a chance and I'll prove it to you.;
[Success] You want to help us? Alright... I can think of a way. We're stuck in these caves, obviously, or we would have been long gone.;NM34AATHAL03022_.mp3
There's a passage to the surface through the caves, but we're blocked by some kind of large creature. We can't defeat it.;NM34AATHAL03024_.mp3
If you could kill it and clear up the passageway for us, we could escape. That would be help enough. Can you do that?;NM34AATHAL03025_.mp3
I can try.;
I'll believe that when I see it... but if you could, we would be... grateful.;NM34AATHAL03027_.mp3
Forget it. Get yourselves out.;
I figured as much. Get out of here, then. Go on! We have enough to worry about with the shyrack!;NM34AATHAL03029_.mp3
The passage is already clear.;
[Failure] No! I know what Sith like you want from us! You're not bringing our heads to Master Uthar so he can pat you on the back!;NM34AATHAL03031_.mp3
They're here to kill us! Get them!! Get them!!;NM34AATHAL03032_.mp3
Fine. You've worn out my patience. Time to die.;
Fair enough. I'll leave you be.;
Then get out of here! Now! Or we'll open fire!!;NM34AATHAL03042_.mp3
Sorry. Time for you to die.;
You're... the renegade students? The ones who ran away?;
So you have heard about us. Yes, we ran away before Master Uthar could execute us. Is that so hard to believe?;NM34AATHAL03037_.mp3
I'm not here to bring you back.;
I guess we'll do this the hard way, then.;
Alright, I'll leave you be.;
You came back again? Why?! I told you we're not going back to the academy, so go away!!;NM34AATHAL03043_.mp3
Czerka will never come back here, we will make certain!;
You are the only outsider that will survive us! We swear it!;
Kashyyyk will be ours once more!;
Let no one escape! They must learn the price we place on dishonor!;
Let their blood feed out forests! That will be their payment!;
These Czerka animals will die by sword and bowcaster!;
The Shadowlands are too good for them! We'll kill them all!;
At last, we will push them off our beloved Kashyyyk!;
The outsiders will pay for how they dishonored us!;
Death to all slavers! Kashyyyk will be free!;
Your precious Republic's days are numbered! It won't be long until Malak turns his armada loose on Coruscant itself!;NM26ACSITH26000_.mp3
Save your empty threats, Sith scum! Malak isn't stupid enough to attack the Core worlds - not with the entire Republic fleet waiting for him!;NM26ACSITH26002_.mp3
You're a fool! When the Sith descend on Coruscant, our numbers will block out the sun itself! The galactic senators will collapse trembling in fear, and beg for mercy at Malak's feet!;NM26ACSITH26004_.mp3
You underestimate the Republic's resolve! We'll die before we surrender Coruscant!;NM26ACSITH26006_.mp3
That can be arranged. Remember what happened to Taris - Malak could do the same to the Core worlds!;NM26ACSITH26008_.mp3
He wouldn't dare!;NM26ACSITH26010_.mp3
Now it is you who underestimate our resolve.;NM26ACSITH26012_.mp3
What's this? Another Republic lackey wandering the streets? Don't worry - the Sith will destroy you along with all the rest who don't bow down before Malak!;NM26ACSITH26014_.mp3
I have no wish to trade childish taunts and empty words with you.;
I have nothing more to say to you. I have important Sith business to tend to.;NM26ACSITH26016_.mp3
You'll want to change your tone. You wouldn't be the first Sith I've killed.;
Save your empty threats. If you're stupid enough to attack me the Selkath authorities will lock you away for a long, long time.;NM26ACSITH26019_.mp3
Do you know who I am, worm?;
Let me guess... Dark Lord of the Sith?;NM26ACSITH26022_.mp3
Er... well... yeah.;
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Revan, right?;NM26ACSITH26024_.mp3
Why you...;
HAHAHAHA! You moron! Revan's dead! And if you try to back up your stupid words with stupid deeds the Selkath will be all over you like a Mon Calamari during mating season.;NM26ACSITH26026_.mp3
Now some of us have serious work to do. *chuckle* Run along, fool.;NM26ACSITH26028_.mp3
I'll kill you!;
Don't laugh!;
Yes... Yes I am.;
And don't you forget it!;
Excuse me, sentient. I do not think it wise to speak to you.;
I must go to the office of the Czerka company. That is where business is transacted.;
This planet is controlled by the Sith. They are the supreme law here, and I suggest you be wary of them.;
I have only recently come to this planet, myself. My apologies if I cannot help you.;
Many sentients come to this planet to attempt to enter the Sith academy. I understand most die in the process. How unfortunate.;
There is a building called the cantina which is a place of recreation.;
Taris has been destroyed. This portends ill for the future, sentient.;
If you are wise, you will avoid the Sith on this planet, sentient. They do as they wish and many are killed without regret.;
I must be on my way, sentient. My ship leaves very soon.;
Czerka is making us put a deposit on standard issue kolto packs. I know the cost has gone up, but come on.;
This planet is the worst assignment to have with a kolto shortage coming up.;
Bring those Selkath here see if they think we need kolto. They'd start shipping it out quick, I bet.;
If we don't get another shipment of kolto, we'll have to start using local herbs for healing. Then we'll hurt *and* stink.;
Are you... no, there's no way a swoop champion is on Kashyyyk. No way.;
Is your ship equipped to get the major planetary broadcasts? I heard the Manaan races were pretty good.;
I heard some rookie took the big prize at the Manaan swoop races. I guess anyone can win now that Taris is gone.;
You look a lot like the winner of the Manaan races. I bet that opens door for you.;
I don't mind being on a backwater planet when I hear about the trouble places like Korriban get.;
I heard something about trouble with Sith on Korriban, but as long as no cities are being destroyed, they can do what they like.;
Have you been by Korriban recently? The Sith there aren't planning on taking their trouble off-world, are they?;
We get the occasional private trader from Korriban through here, but not recently. I wonder what's up.;
Have you heard where the Sith might be headed next? I don't even know why they targetted Taris.;
All those people on Taris dead. First I heard the whole planet was gone, but even just the city is sad.;
I guess I should be grateful I'm on Kashyyyk. I could have been posted to Taris.;
It took ten days for news of Taris to reach me. They don't tell us anything.;
Who are you? You can't come in here! Sound the alarm, Gadon!;NM11ABGADO11000_.mp3
Relax, Kaeira - this is an ally, not an enemy. He's promised to help get our prototype accelerator back from the Vulkars.;NM11ABGADO11002A.mp3
You're too trusting, Gadon. These must be the assassins Brejik sent! How else did they get in here?;NM11ABGADO11004_.mp3
[Persuade] The guards recognized me and let me in.;
[Failure] Liar! The guards would have announced you! Gadon - we've been betrayed again!;NM11ABGADO11006_.mp3
We're under attack! Guards! Guards!;NM11ABGADO11009_.mp3
Sorry, but Brejik made me an offer I couldn't refuse.;
Time for you to die, old man!;
Relax, Kaeira - this is an ally, not an enemy. She's promised to help get our prototype accelerator back from the Vulkars.;NM11ABGADO11002B.mp3

Let the record show that the trial of Sunry vs. the Ahto City Authority has commenced. Presiding are judges Shelkar...;
Jhosa...;
Naleshekan...;
Kota...;
and Duula.;
This trial is to determine the culpability of Sunry in the death of the Sith Elassa.;
Representing Sunry in his defense is a member of the Jedi Order. Do you have any opening statements?;
Sunry is guilty of the murder. He has confessed to me.;
No! You traitor!;NM26AATRIA27014_.mp3
Sunry! No!;NM26AATRIA27016_.mp3
Your client is guilty, Arbiter? Are you sure you wish to enter this plea?;
I do.;
No! I object! I am the victim of a conspiracy here!;NM26AATRIA27020_.mp3
Is this true Arbiter? Your client does not seem to agree with your assertations.;
The position of Arbiter is to defend your client. Therefore, inspite of your personal feelings, you must do so to the best of your ability.;
This trial will proceed on schedule.;
Acting as a prosecutor for the Ahto City Authority is an impartial observer from the Sith Empire.;
It is an honor to see justice served.;NM26AATRIA27059_.mp3
And I will see Sunry is executed for the crime he has committed.;NM26AATRIA27061_.mp3
Do not be too overzealous in pressing your commission, Sith!;
The first matter of business is the presentation of a sworn testimony by the proprietor - Ignus - of the hotel where the murder occurred. What is the testimony you wish to give us?;
The man I saw leaving - Sunry - left before I heard the blaster shot.;NM26AATRIA27067_.mp3
Impossible!;NM26AATRIA27069_.mp3
Know your place, Sith!;
This is serious evidence indeed. The court will keep this in mind near the top of the list of pertinent facts.;
We will now begin by calling forth the witnesses to the crime and taking their testimony.;
After each witness has given their testimony and you have cross-examined them, you may ask the presiding judges for their opinions on the current state of the case. This is a special privilege given by Manaan law only to the defendant, so use it wisely.;
The first witness is Firith. The prosecution will question the witness first.;
You are Firith Me, the well-known Pazaak player. I wonder if we can trust the word of a gambler as reliable testimony...;NM26AATRIA27089_.mp3
Objection, your Honors!;
Objection sustained. Ask the witness your questions and do it promply.;
Of course, your Honor.;NM26AATRIA27093_.mp3
Firith: what did you see the night of the murder?;NM26AATRIA27095_.mp3
I came out into the hallway after hearing the blaster shot and saw Sunry over there limping down the hall out of the building.;NM26AATRIA27097_.mp3
Heh. A very obvious point, your Honors. The accused was seen leaving the scene of the crime after the blaster that killed Elassa was fired.;NM26AATRIA27099_.mp3
A very pertinent point, prosecutor.;
It is now the defense's turn to cross-examine the witness.;
I have no additional questions.;
Very well. Would you like to use this opportunity to poll the judges?;
Yes.;
I think that Sunry, perhaps, could have been the culprit.;
I think that Sunry was perfectly capable of committing this crime.;
It seems to me that the evidence is weighted against Sunry.;
Despite his honorable past, Sunry would seem to have done something deplorable.;
Sunry is obviously guilty of killing the Sith woman.;
Since the defense has no further questions, we will call out the second witness: the Rodian Gluupor.;
The prosecution may question the witness.;
Gluupor the Rodian, you were staying in the hotel the night of the murder and saw Sunry leaving Elassa's room didn't you?;NM26AATRIA27162_.mp3
Yes, Gluupor see Sunry running down hallway, and when Gluupor look in room, Sith woman dead on floor.;NM26AATRIA27164_.mp3
This is clear then: that Sunry left the room with the Sith Elassa already dead behind him.;NM26AATRIA27166_.mp3
Perhaps, Sith, perhaps. It is the turn of the defense to question the witness now.;
Did you see Sunry kill Elassa?;
Gluupor... Gluupor not see Sunry really hurt Sith... But Gluupor did see Sunry leaving room with dead Sith in it!;NM26AATRIA27194_.mp3
But... Gluupor not see him really kill Sith...;NM26AATRIA27196_.mp3
An important distinction Arbiter.;
Do you wish to ask the witness anything else?;
Isn't the medal at the crime scene too obvious a clue?;
Gluupor not know. Why anyone leave things in someone else's room?;NM26AATRIA27202_.mp3
Gluupor just think these things happen. It is just... odd...;NM26AATRIA27204_.mp3
Yes. Odd indeed.;
Do you really think a cripple could have hurt Elassa?;
Sunry seems like strong man, but he is hurt, too.;NM26AATRIA27209_.mp3
Gluupor not think that man like that would stand up to a Sith. Not at all. But Sunry still run fast after.;NM26AATRIA27211_.mp3
We know full well the extend of Sunry's injuries, Arbiter!;
But the fact still remains.;
Did you plant the medal on Elassa?;
Gluupor... Gluupor...;NM26AATRIA27218_.mp3
Don't do it, Gluupor...;NM26AATRIA27220_.mp3
The prosecution will be silent!;
What is it you wish to say Gluupor?;
Gluupor... Gluupor paid by Sith to plant that medal.;NM26AATRIA27204_.mp3
Lies! Slander! I object!;NM26AATRIA27228_.mp3
You are certain of this Gluupor?;
Gluupor certain...;NM26AATRIA27232_.mp3
This new evidence puts the entire case in a new light.;
Perhaps I was wrong, after all, in my thoughts about Sunry.;
I cannot tell yet if Sunry killed Elassa, but I am confident it will be proven.;
I do not believe Sunry, as a well-standing Republic citizen, could have committed this crime.;
I just do not have enough information to judge this case yet.;
Sunry did not have the capacity to commit these murders... I think.;
I cannot make my decision on what I have yet seen.;
Sunry perhaps was not the killer.;
I am unsure as yet as to whether Sunry was the actual murderer.;
I think that Sunry could not have committed this crime.;
I do not have enough information to make an informed decision.;
No.;
Did you actually see the murder happen?;
You mean actually see him kill her with my own eyes? Well... no... But I don't think there could have been anyone else there.;NM26AATRIA27131_.mp3
Your point is well-taken Arbiter.;
Do you have additional questions?;
Was the medal left at the crime scene not a little too obvious?;
I think it may have been. I mean, you'd have to pretty stupid to leave something that important lying around, wouldn't you?;NM26AATRIA27137_.mp3
This argument has merit.;
How could Sunry have harmed her if he was a cripple?;
Well he was moving pretty fast running away... but yeah, I mean, how could he kill a Sith warrior in combat? I don't know for sure...;NM26AATRIA27142_.mp3
Do not think less of Sunry because of his handicap. He is fully capable.;
Can't you see that the man can hardly walk, let alone fight Elassa?;
That is enough for now. We will deliberate on this later in private.;
Elassa is a Dark Jedi, isn't she?;
Yes, from what I could tell. She carried a lightsaber around under that cloak of hers.;NM26AATRIA27151_.mp3
Objection! That doesn't prove she was a Jedi!;NM26AATRIA27153_.mp3
No, this piece of evidence is very important. It establishes the character of Elassa and perhaps her intent in dealing with Sunry.;
Do not undermine the witness!;
The man I saw leaving - Sunry - probably left after I heard the blaster shot.;NM26AATRIA27075_.mp3
The guilt of the accused is apparent even this early in the trial.;NM26AATRIA27077_.mp3
I have reconsidered.;
Honesty is an attribute essential to the position of Arbiter, as is impartiality. It would not be advised for you to abuse either of these.;
Do not mock us, Jedi!;
Enough! This case will proceed on schedule.;
Sunry is guilty of the murder. I have this recording as proof.;
A recording? Let this new evidence be entered in the records.;
Ah... this new evidence is most convincing.;
Yes. Yes it seems to be.;
This shortens the trial considerably. In light of this new evidence there is no need to proceed with the witnesses or cross-examinations.;
This court hereby finds Sunry guilty of the murder of the Sith Elassa.;
In accordance with Selkath law the proscribed punishment for murder is death.;
The verdict has been delivered and this trial is now over.;
Well, that didn't go well. If I'm ever on trial remind me not to ask you for help.;NM26AATRIA27514_.mp3
This is why we Mandalorians don't have courts. We prefer to settle things with trial by combat.;NM26AATRIA27517_.mp3
Remove the guilty party from this courtroom.;
I... I'm sorry, Sunry. And Elora. There is nothing more we can do.;NM26AATRIA27456_.mp3
*sob* Sunry... No...;NM26AATRIA27458_.mp3
This is the will of the court, but it doesn't feel like justice to me.;NM26AATRIA27516_.mp3
I... I don't believe this. Sunry should be remembered as a hero, not as a murderer. This isn't right.;NM26AATRIA27515_.mp3
[Force Persuade] You will find Sunry innocent.;
[Failure] You are in no position to tell us how to judge our laws!;
We know of your Order, Jedi. We know that you have powers to manipulate the minds of lesser creatures.;
Do not think that we Selkath, the pinnacle of evolution, can be swayed by such means!;
If you attempt such manipulations again, Sunry will be found guilty, and you will summarily be put to death! We do not tolerate intrusions upon the justice of our courts!;
I will find Sunry innocent.;
That remains to be seen.;
I have no comments at this time.;
If the defense has no more questions, the court will call out Elora, Sunry's wife.;
You Elora, are Sunry's lawful wife. Your husband was a hero in the last war between the Sith Empire and the Republic.;NM26AATRIA27238_.mp3
He was crippled in that war. Do you not believe he'd blame the Sith for his injury?;NM26AATRIA27240_.mp3
Yes, I guess he would.;NM26AATRIA27242_.mp3
And there you have motive! Sunry seeks revenge on the Sith for what they did him and killed Elassa.;NM26AATRIA27244_.mp3
A supposition for now, prosecutor. Does the defense have any questions for the witness?;
Was it true your husband was having an affair with Elassa?;
Yes... Yes it was true. He was having an affair with that Sith harlot.;NM26AATRIA27272_.mp3
It seems painfully obvious that he killed her to keep quiet about the affair.;NM26AATRIA27274_.mp3
Be silent! You have already questioned the witness, prosecutor.;
He had been seeing her for some time, I think. *sniff* But he said he was going to change!;NM26AATRIA27278_.mp3
He had gone there that night to end it! We talked the night before and he had promised!;NM26AATRIA27280_.mp3
But now things have become so very complicated...;NM26AATRIA27282_.mp3
That is very enlightening evidence. It will influence our deliberation considerably.;
Do you have any more questions, Arbiter?;
Sunry was a cripple. Could he have killed Elassa?;
He was a good man, but his injuries pained him terribly. But he always held on. Always persevered.;NM26AATRIA27288_.mp3
I don't think he could have beaten her or anything like that... but a blaster? I just don't know...;NM26AATRIA27290_.mp3
Sunry seems fully capable to me. But it seems unlikely that he would choose to do such a thing.;
Sunry was a Republic war hero, wasn't he?;
Yes. He fought against the Sith in the last war. He fought bravely and was even awarded the Hero's Cross!;NM26AATRIA27295_.mp3
I don't know how much that means to the Sith or to your Selkath, your Honors, but in the Republic it is awarded only to the bravest, most valorous, most honorable men.;NM26AATRIA27297_.mp3
The kind of man who earns that medal would not kill someone in cold blood!;NM26AATRIA27299_.mp3
Your husband earned a medal because he excelled at killing Sith. It relates directly.;
Do not let personal opinions sway your judgment of the law!;
Does the prosecution have any remaining witnesses to call forth?;
I wish to call forth Sunry himself, your Honors.;NM26AATRIA27307_.mp3
Very well.;
Are you a war hero, Mr. Sunry? You fought in wars against the Sith Empire, correct?;NM26AATRIA27311_.mp3
Yeah, that's right. I don't regret it either. The Republic needs its heroes.;NM26AATRIA27313_.mp3
Indeed... Would you say that you dislike the Sith? Even... hate them?;NM26AATRIA27315_.mp3
Of course I hate them! Trying to take over the galaxy every chance they get! Killing millions of innocents!;NM26AATRIA27317_.mp3
Pure politics. Were you in Elassa's room on the night of the murder?;NM26AATRIA27319_.mp3
Well, yes I... I was...;NM26AATRIA27321_.mp3
I had been having an affair with Elassa on my wife, yes... But I realized how wrong I had been and I was going there to end it!;NM26AATRIA27323_.mp3
You were having an affair with a Sith! You wanted to end it quickly and quietly, so you killed her from behind and tried to flee!;NM26AATRIA27325_.mp3
No, I...;NM26AATRIA27327_.mp3
I think we can see the answer clear enough, Mr. Sunry!;NM26AATRIA27329_.mp3
Do not interrupt the accused!;
In fact, I think you've said quite enough already, prosecutor.;
Do you have any question to ask the accused, Arbiter?;
Elassa was a Sith spy, wasn't she?;
Of course she was! Why would a young, beautiful Sith woman get with an old cripple like me?;NM26AATRIA27361_.mp3
You are not helping yourself, Sunry. You only give reason why you might kill her.;
He merely states facts. The incompetence of the murder indicates that her occupation was not the motive for the killing.;
The fact remains: Elassa was a Sith and likely a spy as well.;
Is there anything else you wish to ask the accused?;
How could Elassa have got ahold of your medal?;
I don't know. The medal had gone missing some time ago. I never found out what happened to it.;NM26AATRIA27371_.mp3
It's possible the Sith had stolen it and had it planted on the body...;NM26AATRIA27373_.mp3
Supposition, your Honors!;NM26AATRIA27375_.mp3
True, but it does have merit and deserves consideration.;
You were going there to end the affair. Would the Sith object?;
Yes I think they would. They wouldn't want to lose one of their sources - even though I didn't give them anything!;NM26AATRIA27380_.mp3
They... they might have killed her for her failure... or they might have thought she'd turn against them or something like that.;NM26AATRIA27382_.mp3
The Sith Empire is not the barbaric institution you portray it to be!;NM26AATRIA27384_.mp3
Be silent, prosecutor. This is a valuable point, that lends some credence to your defense, Arbiter.;
I knew she was a Sith, and she would be trying to pump me - for information, of course - so I... I just simply turned the tables.;NM26AATRIA27388_.mp3
I was working on her, trying to turn her over to the Republic's side. Trying to turn her into a double agent. But that's kind of ruined now that she's been murdered.;NM26AATRIA27390_.mp3
An obviously false story! I have proof here, in the form of data recording, that proves you were, in fact, having an affair with Elassa!;NM26AATRIA27392_.mp3
Let this new evidence be entered in the court records.;
So be it.;
I... I... What's the use now... I had been having an affair with Elassa, it's true. But I had realized my mistake and was going there to end it! But I did not kill her!;NM26AATRIA27398_.mp3
The witnesses have all been called forward and questioned by both prosecution and defense. The prosecution will now present, in closing, its summary of the pertinent facts of this case.;
I think the facts in this case are very straight forward: Sunry was having an affair with Elassa. He sought to end it, and the simplest, quickest method given his hatred of the Sith was to simply kill her.;NM26AATRIA27402_.mp3
*Ahem* Witnesses saw Sunry fleeing the scene, and material evidence places him there at the time of the murder as well.;NM26AATRIA27404_.mp3
I am confident that any informed observation of the facts will lead the judges - your Honors - to this very conclusion.;NM26AATRIA27406_.mp3
Indeed. And your closing statements, Arbiter?;
No one actually witnessed the murder.;
Truth.;
That doesn't mean a thing! He was there, running from the room!;NM26AATRIA27412_.mp3
If you speak out of turn again, you will be forcibly ejected from the court! The Arbiter speaks a valid fact.;
Is there another point you would make?;
Sunry was a cripple and couldn't have killed her.;
A cripple can be just as capable as any other man. And Sunry more than most.;
You overrate this man!;
Perhaps. Are there any other arguments, Arbiter?;
The Sith are obviously evil and set this up.;
Objection!;NM26AATRIA27424_.mp3
The Arbiter is allowed an opinion as well as you, prosecutor.;
No matter how erroneous...;
Or truthful.;
Sunry was ending the affair, so the Sith killed her.;
The Sith would not leave the medal of her killer clutched in her hand!;NM26AATRIA27432_.mp3
Your time for arguments has passed, and you would do well to remember that!;
The Arbiter's argument does bring up a valid point.;
Is there anything else you would state?;
Elassa was a spy and the Sith are framing Sunry.;
I find that highly unlikely, Arbiter. The Sith have no need of such deception. The facts speak clear.;
But the Sith have been known for violence, deception, and murder before.;
That is also true. Is there another point you would make?;
My arguments are complete.;
Then the court will now deliberate amongst ourselves.;
This court hereby finds Sunry innocent of the murder of the Sith Elassa.;
In addition, this court finds the Sith Empire guilty of conspiracy and obstruction of justice.;
Your Honors! No!;NM26AATRIA27488_.mp3
Silence!;
The Sith Empire is hereby forced to subsidize a portion of Republic purchases on Manaan for a period of the next solar year.;
The verdict has been delivered and this trial is now over.;
Yes! Score one for the good guys!;NM26AATRIA27518_.mp3
I knew you wouldn't let the Republic down!;NM26AATRIA27519_.mp3
Well done. You showed wisdom worthy of a Jedi Master during this trial.;NM26AATRIA27520_.mp3
I guess you got the result you wanted, but I still think this was a big waste of time. We Mandalorians prefer to settle things with a nice, quick trial by combat.;NM26AATRIA27521_.mp3
Sunry... I'm so glad...;NM26AATRIA27496_.mp3
Elora...;NM26AATRIA27498_.mp3
We have done all we could for you, old friend.;NM26AATRIA27500_.mp3
Thank you for saving me. I don't know how I can repay you. Elora and I are going to leave here and get as far away from all this as soon as we can.;NM26AATRIA27506_.mp3
I - and the Republic - will not forget what you've done for us. Thank you.;NM26AATRIA27508_.mp3
Thank you, Jolee! I... I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't shown up!;
Don't thank me, thank your Arbiter. I was glad to help.;NM26AATRIA27504_.mp3
It's really strange. Nobody seems to know where Master Uthar or Yuthura Ban have disappeared to. Some of the sensitives are claiming they're dead.;NM35AASITH15000_.mp3
Rumor has it that something has happened to Master Uthar and Yuthura Ban. Do you know anything?;NM35AASITH15002_.mp3
I heard that Yuthura Ban was dead. I suppose that means Master Uthar will be taking a new apprentice, soon.;NM35AASITH15004_.mp3
Did you hear? Yuthura is dead. Master Uthar said so. I bet she got too impatient and failed to assassinate him. Idiot.;NM35AASITH15006_.mp3
Master Yuthura has taken over the academy. Everyone's talking about it! I guess she finally got rid of Uthar, somehow.;NM35AASITH15008_.mp3
Have you heard? Yuthura... I mean Master Yuthura has taken over the academy! Well done, I say!;NM35AASITH15010_.mp3
You aren't even a full Sith. Don't bother me.;NM35AASITH15012_.mp3
Get out of my way. I don't have time to deal with hopefuls.;NM35AASITH15014_.mp3
Come back when you've taken your final test. If you survive it.;NM35AASITH15016_.mp3
If Master Uthar gives you an order, you'd better follow it. There were some students who disobeyed him and now they're hiding out on the surface somewhere.;NM35AASITH15018_.mp3
There are some students in hiding that refused to follow an order. Master Uthar wants them found and dead... and is offering a reward for it, too!;NM35AASITH15020_.mp3
Just be careful if you go into the valley. I hear there's a hermit living in the hills that kidnaps students.;NM35AASITH15022_.mp3
The former master of the academy, Jorak Uln, is supposedly hiding out in the hills on the surface as some kind of mad hermit.;NM35AASITH15024_.mp3
Word is that one of our experimental droids went mad and escaped and is hiding in the ruins. I wonder why we don't just gather up and destroy it?;NM35AASITH15026_.mp3
One of my friends went to find that crazy droid that's hiding in the ruins in the valley. He hasn't come back, yet.;NM35AASITH15028_.mp3
Ha! It's great to be on the winning side, isn't it? We've been crushing the Republic at every battle so far!;NM35AASITH15030_.mp3
The latest reports say the Republic is on the run. Before long the Sith will be ruling the entire galaxy.;NM35AASITH15032_.mp3
Darth Malak is one of the greatest Sith leaders ever. I hope he comes back to the academy before I leave.;NM35AASITH15034_.mp3
It is my most fervent hope to serve under Darth Malak once my training is complete. Don't you feel the same?;NM35AASITH15036_.mp3
Rumor around the academy is that you had something to do with those rebel students being caught, finally. They got what they deserved, I say.;NM35AASITH15038_.mp3
I was told that you actually met the old master of the academy, Jorak. Is the hermit as mad as they say?;NM35AASITH15040_.mp3
The buzz is that you took care of that crazy droid out in the ruins. That's pretty impressive.;NM35AASITH15042_.mp3
Hmm. So you got enough prestige to win out, I hear. We'll just see if you make it through your final test.;NM35AASITH15044_.mp3
Sorry, I don't have time to speak. My training awaits.;NM35AASITH15046_.mp3
Hold on - where do you think you're going? This area is restricted to Undercity patrols! Without the proper security papers I can't let you past.;NM03AASITH19000_.mp3
I've got my security papers right here.;
Let me see... hmmm, these look to be in order. Okay, you can go down if you want. Can't say I envy you, though.;NM03AASITH19002_.mp3
The Undercity is crawling with mutants. Rakghouls, they call 'em. If you see anything moving down there, shoot first and ask questions later.;NM03AASITH19004_.mp3
[Persuade] I forgot my security papers back at the base.;
[Failure] I don't know how they do things in the Upper City, but down here we follow our orders to the letter! Without your security papers I can't let you past.;NM03AASITH19007_.mp3
So just march on back to the base, talk to your commanding officer and tell him you need the security papers. Otherwise you ain't getting down.;NM03AASITH19009_.mp3
[Persuade] I've got orders to join up with one of the Undercity patrols.;
You can't keep me out if you're dead!;
You just made a big mistake!;NM03AASITH19013_.mp3
I'll be going now.;
Good... I don't have time for this foolishness. Down here we run a tight ship - not like the slipshod operation in the Upper City.;NM03AASITH19016_.mp3
Hold on there, civilian! Only those with official Sith business are allowed into the Undercity.;NM03AASITH19018_.mp3
Unless you've got the proper security papers you better just turn around and go back the way you came.;NM03AASITH19020_.mp3
Where can I get these security papers?;
You can't... not unless you're on official Sith business. And if you were, someone would already have given you the papers.;NM03AASITH19022_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;
I'm not here to answer your questions. My orders are to guard the elevator. Now either show me the proper security papers or move along.;NM03AASITH19024_.mp3
Hey, you've already shown me your security clearance. You don't have to speak to me every time you come by. If you need to use the elevator to the Undercity just go ahead.;NM03AASITH19025_.mp3
Just be careful down there. Watch out for those rakghouls!;NM03AASITH19027_.mp3
Beep beep beep-oop!;NM35AADROI01000_.mp3
[This tach may be Rulan Prolik in disguise, but you can't tell for sure. Maybe if you kill it, it will revert to its true form... assuming it's Rulan.];
[Attack the tach.];
[Leave the tach alone.];
Why do you disturb me, human? Grarwwaar comes to the Shadowlands to get away from your kind.;
According to a datapad I found, Grarwwaar is dead!;
So you have uncovered my little secret. No matter, this body has grown tiresome to me. Maybe I can find one more to your liking, human.;
How can I help?;NM35AABAST06014_.mp3
That's... that's impossible!;
Your tricks don't fool me, Rulan!;
Enough games, Rulan. Time to die.;
What do you need?;NM35AACART04005_.mp3
Yes? What is it?;NM35AAJUHA11216_.mp3
Got something on your mind, do you?;NM35AAJOLE09001_.mp3
Yeah? What do you want?;NM13AACAND03013_.mp3
Hey, there. What can I do for you?;NGLOBEMISS13010_.mp3
Statement: HK-47 is ready to serve, master.;NM35AAHHKD07000_.mp3
A remarkable likeness, wouldn't you agree?;
The resemblance is uncanny, isn't it?;
I want to ask you some questions.;
I am no slave, human! I am Grarwwaar, a free Wookiee. I do not answer to you.;
Leave me be, human. Return to the village in the tree tops. The Shadowlands is no place for your kind.;
I'm sorry. I'll be going now.;
You are the great warrior now, it seems. You came before and defeated us, and now do so again.;
What of it?;
If you are as great as you appear to be, then perhaps you can help us as well.;
There have been many attacks on the island recently by blue- and red-armored warriors against our scouts.;
Mandalorians!;
If that is your name for them, then yes.;
I was given the task of rooting out their forces, but as you can see, I have failed... Failed both the One, who gave me the command, and the dozen warriors who accompanied me... and did not return.;
If you are a great warrior, then you may yet be able to destroy them where I have failed. Surely you have powers beyond my ken, and those would undoubtedly prove critical.;
Why should I help you?;
You came to the One seeking entrance to the Temple of the Ancients, did you not?;
These killers have made their base of sorts near the entrance to the Temple itself. Our scouts can no longer travel safely in that area, and any passage by you towards the Elders' compound would be in danger as well.;
Your own best interests lie in their deaths... and...;
And?;
There have been many wrecks that have crashed onto this world... Many of the items from these vessels may be of some use to you. If you bring me back the head of their leader, I could show you one of the better caches...;
Why don't I just take that information?;
I am an old and bitter warrior. My injuries are many and I have just come back from a fearsome battle... a slaughter. Even a light hit could kill me, so don't threaten me with violence!;
I don't need anything from you!;
Whether you believe you do or not, there is no way into the Temple without our assistance. Bring his head to me, and both our causes will be helped.;
Why do you need his head?;
Why, to gain his strength and knowledge, of course! So will you do this thing? For both of us?;
Very well, I'll do it.;
Good. I can see that you are a true friend to our people.;
I will be waiting here for you when you return.;
I've already killed the Mandalorians.;
I assure you, I can give a reward, I... You... you what?;
Th... thank you for what you have done! The souls of my warriors can rest at peace now.;
And with his head, I can gain his strength so that we may overcome his people in the future.;
And now, for the reward I promised...;
I found these while searching among the wreckage. I don't know what they do, but I hid them here quite some time ago. They are yours now.;
I still see no reason to help you.;
I don't really feel like.;
OK, I'll find those Mandalorians.;
I know the beings you are talking about.;
... And? So?;
What do you want?;
Yeah, I kicked your backsides pretty good.;
You have earned the gratitude of our people for eliminating the killers who lurked by the Temple of the Ancients.;
Now the souls of my warriors can rest in peace. Thank you, Revan.;
You have returned. Have you managed to slay the aliens who massacred my warriors?;
They are dead. Here is their leader's head.;
No, I have not.;
Return to me when you have the head of their leader, and I shall show you where some items I have scavenged are.;
I don't have to do your dirty work!;
If you do not slay them, then you will never gain entrance to the Temple anyway. They make their camp there, and you think they will let you pass?;
When you do get the head of their leader, I will be waiting here.;
What can you tell me about the Mandalorians?;
They appear from the shadows, seeming to blend in and out of thin air. They gather near the obelisk at the far side of the field, attacking any who approach.;
Perhaps they worship it, and kill us as sacrifices... but they haven't eaten any of the bodies... They hold us in contempt!;
My blood burns at their insult! The souls of the dead howl in anger!;
You must go there and kill them so that my warriors will be avenged... Only then will I give you the reward I have promised you.;
You mentioned something about salvage?;
I will only show you where it is once you've brought me the head of their leader!;
Threaten me all you want, but until then, I will show you nothing! The souls of my warriors rest uneasy knowing they still live...;
I have to go now.;
Your death will bring glory to our new Sith Master!;

I want to ask you some questions.;
You're okay now. But I need information. I'm looking for Bastila.;
Bastila? She wasn't in this pod. We were tracking her pod just before we hit the planet's surface. It went down somewhere to the west.;NM04AAREPU24005_.mp3
We lost the signal when our own pod crashed. Maybe... wait - what was that? Did you hear that? I thought I heard something.;NM04AAREPU24007_.mp3
I didn't hear anything.;
Don't change the subject. I still have some questions to ask you.;
Quit whining and start talking! I need to know where Bastila is!;
Wait here... I'll see if I can find something to help you.;
No... no!!! I can feel... ARGH!;NM04AAREPU24013_.mp3

I'll help you, but I need some information first.;
Get away from me, you diseased freak!;
Hey! You not come in here! Brejik say only lab guys come here!;
Sorry, I'll be going now.;
Good - you go now or me tell Brejik!;
You idiot! You can't just let them walk out of here! They might be a Bek spy after our spice!;NM10ABVULK03004_.mp3
Huh? Them be Bek spy? BEKS DIE NOW!!;
[Persuade] I'm the new lab tech Brejik hired.;
[Success] Oh - you lab tech? Okay then.;
Oh, you idiot! Brejik didn't hire any new lab techs. That's probably a Bek spy!;NM10ABVULK03011_.mp3
[Persuade] I just want a quick look around. Will 20 credits calm you down?;
[Persuade] You give money? That sound good to me!;
If you take that money I'll tell Brejik you let a Bek spy bribe you!;NM10ABVULK03016_.mp3
Time for you to die!;
Me not die - you be one who die!;
You've just about cleaned me out... I have no more money... but I do have a couple cards I could wager if you want one more game.;
Sure. Let's play.;
Less talk, more Pazaak.;
Not right now.;
Well, if you feel like it, that's what I'm here for.;
You're just better than I am. I have to concede. I can't play against you if you always beat me like this.;
Here, take this. My old Pazaak mentor Daoy gave them to me when I started playing. Maybe they'll do you more good than they have me.;
That was a good game. It was closer than I'd have thought. You interested in another?;
Yeah? What do you want?;
Who are you?;
My name is Jolan. Just a travelling Pazaak player with no special story to tell.;
Are you interested in a game?;
I don't have a deck.;
Well, I just happen to have a spare on me. One of my old decks actually. You can have it if you want for, say, 200 credits?;
I don't have that much.;
Well, if you get enough, come back and maybe we can have a game.;
Sure, here you go.;
Good. Here it is. I'll give you a copy of the rules as well to even the field a bit.;
Sure, I'll play.;
Can we play a practice game?;
I suppose we could play a match just to help you get a feel for the game.;
[Play Pazaak Tutorial];
What are you doing here?;
I travel the galaxy looking for Pazaak players to challenge myself. I'm trying to build a deck good enough for the championships.;
Nothing for now.;
Er... OK.;
How did you get in here? Wait - I recognize you!;NM27AASITH07000_.mp3
Lord Malak was most displeased when he learned you had escaped Taris alive! He has promised a great reward to whoever destroys you.;NM27AASITH07002_.mp3
Well, let me guess! You intend to collect this reward, right?;NM27AASITH07004_.mp3
Master, give us the honor of aiding you in destroying this enemy of the Sith.;
See? What did I tell you?;NM27AASITH07010_.mp3
As you wish, my eager apprentices. We shall remove this thorn from Malak's side once and for all!;NM27AASITH07012_.mp3
Commentary: It is not possible to destroy the master. It is suggested you run while my blasters warm up, meatbags.;NM27AASITH07006_.mp3
Yes? Is there something you wish? I have a moment or two while others post their times.;
I'm sure you will be racing again soon yourself. You have shown that you have the necessary skills.;
I wanted to ask a few questions, if you have the time.;
I'm not so preoccupied with the track that I can't spare a few minutes. Go ahead.;
I want to ask about you and racing.;
My name is Zoriis Bafka. I suppose I am one of the more experienced racers here. What do you want me to answer?;
Is this the best place for racing?;
Perhaps not, but it will do for now. Professional racers like myself travel wherever the purses are highest.;
It's no secret that one of the most popular tracks was lost with Taris. Other promoters will need time to organize.;
In the meantime, we will race at the smaller venues. This is almost a recreational stop for me.;
If this track is so small, why bother?;
You lose the skills if you don't use them. I could race on any open road, but competition gives the push to get better.;
Besides, if my presence lends a little prestige to the track, maybe we'll get some new racers out of it.;
How long have you been at this?;
A few years, but I raced under a different name when I was young. My early career was not very spectacular.;
Why did you change your racing name?;
It wasn't that big of a deal. I made the jump from one league to another and wanted to shed some baggage.;
Don't waste much thought on it. It was purely a personal matter that has no bearing today.;
What can you tell me about the other racers?;
There are some promising newcomers here. Garm tries hard and I wish him well, but Nico is the one to watch.;
It's invigorating to watch him discover his skills. I hope he manages to remember why he took up the sport.;
What makes you say that?;
The race is not just about speed. It is a business, and we are the product. He must market himself carefully.;
What do you think about that?;
It is a necessary side to the sport. We must make someone money, or there would be no circuit.;
Let's go back to my first questions.;
If you wish. I don't mind answering.;
I'm looking for something. Who knows this planet best?;
I must confess that I haven't had much time to learn about this planet. Talk of Taris has seemed more important.;
Some of the hunters in Fazza's lodge seem like they would know more than I would, but that wouldn't take much.;
I have to leave. Goodbye.;
Racer's luck be with you.;
Your petty hobbies are of no interest to me.;
All right. Merely making conversation. I'm not looking for a fight.;
[Force Persuade] A fight? You are nothing to me. Leave.;
[Success] [Her face suggests that she knows the suggestion in her mind was not her own, but she sees no reason to fight it. She obviously didn't like your company.];
I don't want a fight either. I just want money.;
Is that all? Then take what I have. Yes, I'm just giving it to you. I can afford to turn this mugging into simple beggary.;
You know what? Sometimes you're nothing but a bully!;NGLOBEMISS13303_.mp3
I know I'm just an old codger, but in my time I've learned what goes around comes around. These things have a way of coming back to you in the end.;NGLOBEJOLE09759_.mp3
Now, if we are through, I must get back to my race preparations. I prefer to leave your unpleasantness behind.;
I think you've found one anyway!;
Wait! Look, if I've offended some local custom or something, I apologize. I don't want a fight. Here, take this.;
Of course not. I meant no harm.;
The humor of this is lost on me. The mood on this planet is harsh enough without your games.;
But you already know about him. The favor you have done for him will help him greatly in years to come.;
But you know about him. He will be a champion, but with his deal he won't see many of the benefits of it.;
He should have been smarter.;
Are you denying your role in his choice? I think it was fairly explicit that you pushed him into the deal.;
But, I suppose it was his choice, even with your... vigorous encouragement.;
I am not used to such attention. What do you want me to repeat?;
I always have time for a fellow swoop racer. Go ahead.;
I just have some questions. Don't bother getting friendly.;
All right, I will be as brief as possible. Ask away.;
Is this a racing matter? Perhaps you are interested in taking up the sport?;
Well, I am impressed with your efforts on the track. You show the promise of a gifted beginner.;
You have certainly shown your skill on the track. I imagine you'll be taking aim at my times next.;
The track is yours today, I see. Well done beating my time. The sport needs people that give the crowd a spectacle.;
Hello again. Have you had a chance to look more closely at our sport?;
I have nothing more to say to you. There is no point in continuing this.;
Who that? Turn it, you gunda fasca, customers are talking! That's better. Hello customer! Buy from Mic'Tunan'Jus and save your credits!;
Very important to save these days, Thuursa knows it's true. Kolto prices make healing expensive, but you can't go without, we're sure.;
Just show me what you have for sale.;
Yes, of course. We don't want to keep you from your important business. Please, have a look.;
I want to ask you a few questions.;
We are here to serve. What do you need to know?;
I want to ask about you.;
Mic'Tunan'Jus is just a humble merchant from the Rim. What would you wish to know about we?;
Where do you come from?;
You couldn't say it, and don't have the ears for it. Two voices create the name, and four ears hear the true sound.;
We suppose the trade lanes have had to call us something. With one mouth the world is Sorjus, far off the Perlemian trade route.;
It's an unimportant stop, we admit. We left for a life of trade, because we are strong and a good talker. We have done well.;
Are you one creature or two?;
You are pardoned for asking because you only know one mind... or at least only one at a time. We are one now, but weren't always.;
We grow together, bonded from the age of choosing when we become whole. Not like you. You are half of what you should be, like brood-squeeler.;
Er, not that we would want to offend you. We don't want to lose any business. That is just our way as Paaerduag.;
Your other half doesn't say much.;
Just because *you* can't hear it, doesn't mean it isn't there.;
Let's go back to my other questions.;
I have to go now.;
We wait for your return. Anyone with credits is always welcome.;
Again you ask, but we have not changed. Just an honest merchant from the Rim.;
Do you know anything about Tatooine?;
Not as much as we should. If we knew more, we would have better business. Travelers like us best. Settlers don't have much to trade.;
We don't travel far on Tatooine itself, you see. The weather is not like our home. Too dry. Way too dry.;
Who would I ask to get more information?;
Always trust the locals, even if they don't trust you. They are the ones that really know what's going on. That's true on any world.;
We have not moved since you last asked. The Tatooine dust is rough on our hide, and the sun is much harsher than it needs to be.;
Heard any off-world rumors?;
Just what everyone else talks about: Taris and the Sith and the stirring of change. Could be good for business, could be bad for business.;
All that we know is that wise people keep low and stay out of the way. Something to always remind your other half. Er... if you have one.;
Yes, save, because you never know when situations turn all around. Look at Czerka. We hear... well, things are not well on outpost Kashyyyk, we're sure you know.;
Yes, save, because you never know when hardship will come. The galaxy is dangerous, we say, even before we hear of Sith trouble on Korriban.;
You will want to save your money for your swoop, we would bet. Yes, you have the champion's face. we'll have what you need.;
And don't be shy. Just ask to see what you want. If you can't get a good look, we don't move the merchandise.;
And like we were saying, we don't sell anything if you don't ask for it, so step up and see what Mic'Tunan'Jus can both do for you.;
Turn it around, fassa to gammenda! The customers come back and we need to see them good! There you are, back to save your credits.;
Beep beep beep-oop!;NM35AADROI01000_.mp3
Bastila, Carth and the crew have been taken prisoner as you ordered, commander!;NM40AASITH11000_.mp3
Excellent. Have you searched the ship thoroughly? Admiral Karath warned me to be on alert for any kind of treachery.;NM40AASITH11002_.mp3
We found a young Twi'lek in the back. She's got quite the mouth on her! She swore at me and spit on my uniform.;NM40AASITH11004_.mp3
She tried to bite me through my armor! And you should hear what she said about my mother. Admiral Karath needs to teach her the proper respect for the Sith!;NM40AASITH11006_.mp3
The Admiral doesn't have time to bother with some Twi'lek girl! Take her away to solitary confinement. I'll leave it up to you to teach her the proper respect for the Sith!;NM40AASITH11008_.mp3
We found a disabled astromech droid in the back of the ship.;NM40AASITH11010_.mp3
Wipe its memory chips and take it to the junk pile. Maybe we can use some of its parts for salvage.;NM40AASITH11012_.mp3
We found an old man in the back. I... I think we should keep him separate from the others. For questioning.;NM40AASITH11014_.mp3
A strange request. And why do you think this old man should be segregated?;NM40AASITH11016_.mp3
I... I'm not sure, Commander. After speaking with him I just... I just think we should question him away from the others.;NM40AASITH11018_.mp3
I... I agree, Commander. After speaking with the old man I think we should question him away from the others.;NM40AASITH11020_.mp3
Very well. The Admiral is probably too busy to bother with this old man anyway. Take him to solitary confinement for interrogation. Report back to me if you learn anything.;NM40AASITH11022_.mp3
We found an injured Mandalorian in the back. Looks like he was trying to rig the ship's engines to break free of our tractor beam when something exploded.;NM40AASITH11024_.mp3
Admiral Karath wants us to question all the prisoners. Did you get any information from him?;NM40AASITH11026_.mp3
He's unconscious right now. I don't think he's going to make it. He's burned pretty bad.;NM40AASITH11028_.mp3
Dump the Mandalorian in the medical bay. Let them take the blame if he dies before the Admiral has a chance to interrogate him.;NM40AASITH11030_.mp3
We searched the ship from top to bottom. Somebody would have had to be invisible for us not to find them in there.;NM40AASITH11032_.mp3
Well done. Return to your posts, and I will tell the Admiral of this.;NM40AASITH11034_.mp3
We found a disabled hunter-killer droid in the back of the ship.;NM40AASITH11036_.mp3
Excellent. We can reprogram this droid to fight in our own army. Wipe its memory chip and take it to the salvage shop. The technicians will deal with it later.;NM40AASITH11038_.mp3
I'm not doing anything wrong! I'm just standing here... you Sith can't arrest me for that!;NM02AAWOMA09000_.mp3
I can't believe the Sith put a quarantine on the planet! It's bad enough we can't leave, but all you off-worlders are stuck here, too!;NM02AAWOMA09002_.mp3
I heard there's a swoop gang war in the Lower City! They say you can get shot just walking in the streets down there!;NM02AAWOMA09004_.mp3
Ever since the Sith quarantine Javyar's cantina is packed with off-worlders! It never used to be that busy.;NM02AAWOMA09006_.mp3
I heard the Sith are sending salvage teams into the Undercity. I heard they're looking for Republic survivors to take prisoner.;NM02AAWOMA09008_.mp3
You there! I don't recognize you! How did you get in here?;NM27AASITH99000_.mp3
I have a passcard.;
Your pass-card is out of date! And I don't recognize you at all! We'll get to the bottom of this soon enough!;NM27AASITH99002_.mp3
Commander Grann, report to the security desk immediately!;NM27AASITH99007_.mp3
You authorized this person to enter?;NM27AASITH99009_.mp3
Yes, they had the proper authorization to enter...;NM27AASITH99010_.mp3
I don't know them... and their identification doesn't match up! They're spies!;NM27AASITH99011_.mp3
What?! Sound the alarm! Droids, destroy them!;NM27AASITH99012_.mp3
Yes? What is it?;NM27AASITH99008_.mp3
I know the pass code.;
Your pass-code is out of date! And I don't recognize you at all! We'll get to the bottom of this soon enough!;NM27AASITH99004_.mp3
[Lie] I don't have to tell you! I have higher authority!;
[Failure] Ha! I don't recognize you and I know every Sith on this planet! We'll get to the bottom of this!;NM27AASITH99006_.mp3
[Force Persuade] We are authorized to be here.;
[Failure] You... I don't recognize you! I know the face of every Sith on the planet! We'll get to the bottom of this!;NM27AASITH99014_.mp3
[This Sand People warrior ignores you. It seems your presence here is a barely tolerated event.];
[Your disguise fails at short range. The warrior attacks!];
[This gizka looks rather sickly. It must have been infected with the gizka poison. You probably should keep your distance.];
[The gizka looks at you curiously, cooing.];
[Feed it the gizka poison.];
[The gizka devours the poison in a single, greedy gulp. It will probably take a few seconds for the poison to have an effect.];
[Pick it up.];
[You try to pick up the gizka, but it wriggles from your grasp and plops back down to the floor.];
[Kill it.];
[The fragile creature's neck is easily wrung. Strangely enough, another gizka shows itself a moment later, crawling out from between two panels.];
[Pet it.];
[You scratch the little critter behind its nubs that pass for ears and it coos enthusiastically in response.];
[Play a game with the gizka.];
"[You play a game of peek-a-boo with the little creature, hiding your face behind your hands and startling it each time you ""appear"". What fun.]";
[Leave it alone.];
[The gizka looks disappointed at the lack of attention and hops away.];
Leave me, citizen. I've business to attend to.;
More rabble with every landing. Go farm the dunes, ship-rat.;
I'll be glad when we close up operations here.;
Can't get any buyers for Tatooine ore anywhere. Word is getting out.;
See the office if you're looking for work. I don't hand out shovels.;
If I were smart I'd use these business junkets to just keep going. Get off this rock for good.;
I've work to do. Why don't you go drown yourself in the cantina like the other diggers.;
I haven't time to talk to you. Czerka business takes precedence.;
We might have a position within the Sith organization for one such as you.;NM26ABSITH12000_.mp3
Your offer is pretty good. But I've heard some nasty things about you Sith. Is it true you bombed Taris into dust?;NM26ABSITH12002_.mp3
This is war. In war certain distasteful acts cannot be avoided. But ask yourself this - when we win this war, would you rather be against the Sith, or with us?;NM26ABSITH12004_.mp3
You make a good point. And I've never turned down a job that pays up front.;NM26ABSITH12006_.mp3
Excellent. Report to the Sith Embassy tomorrow for your assignment.;NM26ABSITH12008_.mp3
I have no desire to speak to you. I know you have links to the Republic.;NM26ABSITH12010_.mp3
That was... unfortunate. Your performance just now was not of very high quality. You will need to improve.;
I'm ready to race.;
Your persistence is admirable after your last race being such a disappointment. First I must ask that you pay the 100 credits racing fee.;
I'll pay the 100 credits.;
Very good, off-worlder. Now we must determine what time you will be trying to beat. Let's have a look at the standings.;
This will be an exciting race, I think. You are going against Queedle's new time of <CUSTOM21>. He's the solid crowd favorite now.;
Attention fans! A new contender will now face the time set by your resident champion Queedle! Excitement is guaranteed!;
Hukta Jax is your opponant now. His time of <CUSTOM20> is your mark. I trust you are ready?;
Manaan race fans! A new contender now addresses the time of Hukta Jax! A race to end all races! Beginning now!;
Casandra Mateil is your opponant for this round. Her time of <CUSTOM19> remains the respectable mark to beat.;
Racing fans, your attention! A new challenger will now attempt to unseat Casandra Mateil! Let them hear you!;
Queedle is a local favorite, but this won't be much of a race. His swoop simply isn't professional quality. Time to beat, <CUSTOM18>.;
Manaan swoop racing fans, we have a race about to commence! Show your respect as the newcomer challenges Queedle for Round One placing!;
I can't pay that much.;
I am sorry, but we cannot make exceptions. We find that racers are more considerate of the course if they have to pay for upkeep.;
[Persuade] Lowering the fee would encourage new racers.;
[Success] I would tend to agree. We already have a number of racers that are struggling. I will drop the fee to 50 credits.;
I'll pay the 50 credits.;
[Force Persuade] I don't need to pay the fee.;
[Success] Perhaps you don't need to pay the fee for this race. Yes, I think that is an acception we can make this one time.;
I'll warn you, though, I will not be able to offer this option again. My accounts are very closely monitored. Now, let's look at who you will be timed against.;
I can't pay that amount either.;
I'm sorry, but that it the bets I can do at the moment. My accounts are closely monitored.;
I'll be back later.;
Of course, Sector Champion.;
Very well. I will tell our organizers to have the course ready for your return.;
[Failure] I'm sorry, but I can't make that exception in this case.;
I must first pay you for your win in the previous round of races. We must keep the accounts up to date.;
You have won a great deal of money. The payment for becoming Sector Champion is 5000 credits!;
That will be the last amount offered for now. When we begin a new round of races we will make certain you are notified.;
I want to talk about the rewards.;
I'm afraid your recent performance hasn't been worthy of payment. Improvement will be needed on your part.;
Tell me what the rounds are.;
Here on Manaan, Round One is the domain of hobbyists and amateurs. I mean no disrespect by that. They just can't afford the faster swoops yet.;
Round Two is populated by the beginner touring racers. They have decided to invest in the sport, and are attempting to make it pay.;
Round Three is usually only attainable by seasoned professionals. There have been exceptions, but only rarely.;
What does each round pay?;
Round One pays 500 credits. Round Two pays 2000 credits. Round Three is 5000 credits. These are relatively standard values for the sport.;
Each round is paid out only once per tournament. The leader that shows dominance in all three is named Sector Champion.;
Tatooine uses tiers instead of rounds. Why the difference?;
Tatooine is not recognized, and won't be while Motta insists on refusing to accept galactic standards. When the circuit is reestablished, he will fall in line.;
Describe the current crop of racers.;
Sparce. Taris took a great many good racers with it when it was destroyed. Including our Sector Champion, Sakul Ondondanax.;
Currently our biggest attractions are Casandra Mateil and Hukta Dax. They are the only touring professionals present for this tournament.;
The racer getting the biggest crowd response was a local underdog named Queedle, but he has decided to retire. A loss, to be sure.;
Let's go back to my other questions.;
Certainly. I'm always accomodating to the racers.;
I'm owed money for my last race.;
A second round win is worth 2000 credits to you. Many racers bow out when they reach this level, but I have a feeling you won't.;
The next round of races will determine Sector Champion. You'll have to be flawless to achieve that.;
Give me the basics on how to race.;
The course is laid out in buoys across the ocean surface of Manaan. You race against times set by others, with no other swoops on the track.;
Your bike likely has the standard five gears to shift through. As your speed increases, watch the indicators in the lower left to know when to shift.;
Shift at the wrong time and your swoop will accelerate poorly or slow down. Shift correctly and you will optimize your perfomance.;
"You can also steer over ""swoop boosters"" placed along the route. These will increase your speed substantially for a short time.";
Are there any hazards on the course?;
There are obstacles that you must watch for. Steering over floating buoys won't damage your bike, but it will slow you down.;
Winners of the first round are paid 500 credits. It's enough to cover your expenses, but you'll have to keep racing to really make it pay.;
We'll record this for future reference, and wish you well on your attempt to reach Sector Champion.;
The biggest surprise of this tournament has been Queedle. He's gone from underdog to champion in short order. The crowd loves him for it.;
But, even with such auspicious competition, Queedle is the racer getting the biggest responses. He's a local favorite, and very talented.;
You have already achieved the pinnacle of the sport, and can't earn any more at this time. You'll be notified when more races are scheduled.;
Go over the system anyway.;
Races on the Manaan course are organized in the galactic standard three round system. Each round pays differently.;
Er... before you do... your next race would be against the leading time set by racer Hukta Jax. He was very insistent that you speak with him first.;
Please, try not to anger the Gamorrean. He could prove troublesome, and we don't want the scandal of having to jail professional swoop racers.;
Where is he?;
He will be in the Racers' Lounge, the room just to the east.;
I'm afraid there are no rounds currently in need of completion. As Sector Champion, you will be notified if further races are to take place.;
You can feel free to speak with the track Maintenance Officer to book a practice run, but it won't be officially timed.;
There is a small fee for practice runs, but it is significantly less than for official races.;
Very well, but before we place your swoop in the starting position, I must collect the 100 credit fee.;
Greetings, Sector Champion. You have proven to be a spectacular racer, even defeating Queedle's improved time.;
There are no new races sheduled as of yet, but we will be sure to notify you as soon as there are.;
We will, of course, pay you for your win. Your racing skills have earned it.;
Greetings, Sector Champion. You have proven a spectacular racer, despite the near-lawless taunting of Hukta Jax.;
Welcome back, Sector Champion. I'm sorry, but no new races have been scheduled yet. You will be notified when they are.;
Greetings to you, off-worlder. Are you here as a spectator, or will you be entering the swoop field as a contender?;
I am interested in racing.;
I'm sure you are. We welcome all racers, regardless of professional status. We are trying to maintain a full field of competitors.;
Of course, with the destruction in Taris, we're in a bit of a rebuilding phase. Our Sector Champion was one of the casualties there.;
I won the season opener on Taris.;
I hesitate to believe that. Sith interference disrupted any holo-feed that might have verified your story. We only know that all on Taris were lost.;
You are welcome to prove your skill here, regardless of experience. The course is open to any that have the means to participate.;
100 credits must be paid for each officially timed attempt that you make. This amount will be due before each race.;
I have raced on Tatooine.;
Perhaps you have, but that is not a recognized circuit track. Motta the Hutt is not a respected promotor, no matter what he says.;
He has also altered the payment structures set up for the swoop circuit. Of course, most of the governing circuit organization was lost on Taris.;
I would like to sign on as a racer.;
I'm not interested in this. Goodbye.;
As you will. Please return if you have business related to the races.;
Can you help me with information?;
I'm sorry, but I'm sure there are others that will have what you need. My duty is to organize the races, and I pay attention to little else.;
Tell me about what goes on here.;
You must be very new to Manaan if you are unfamiliar with the swoop races. Our course is one of the most respected in the sector.;
I don't need anything. Never mind.;
Greetings again. Will you be racing today? We're always looking for serious competition for the established riders.;
The Selkath have clamped down on kolto exports all of a sudden. No one knows why. If someone did something to offend them, there's going to be trouble I think.;NM26ACTRAV26000_.mp3
Manaan may not seem very hospitable, but a surprising amount of trade runs through it because of the kolto trade.;NM26ACTRAV26001_.mp3
I heard the Sith are trying to work on a synthetic version of kolto. I wouldn't be surprised if the Republic was, too.;NM26ACTRAV26002_.mp3
I heard there's been some sort of revolt on one of the Sith worlds. Maybe the Republic would actually have a chance... if it weren't for Malak.;NM26ACTRAV26003_.mp3
The fighting between the Republic and the Sith is spreading farther. I wonder how long before Manaan becomes a battleground...;NM26ACTRAV26004_.mp3
There's a lot of money to be made in the Republic in times like these. If we survive of course...;NM26ACTRAV26005_.mp3
I hear the Czerka Corp. got kicked off Kashyyyk by the locals... Good for them! At least someone's getting something back from them.;NM26ACTRAV26006_.mp3
I hear there's going to be a heavy meteor shower in the Coruscant system this year. Last time this sort of thing happened, they lost one of the orbital stations.;NM26ACTRAV26007_.mp3
Did I tell you I'm a fan? I saw recordings of some of your races and you're great! Maybe when they get the circuit back up we can really see what you can do!;NM26ACTRAV26008_.mp3
The whole swoop racing circuit for this sector has been falling apart since the Sith bombed Taris.;NM26ACTRAV26009_.mp3
Wow! Hey, you're the sector swoop champ, right? Too bad about the circuit being so small this year, but still!;NM26ACTRAV26010_.mp3
A friend of mine recently got into Pazaak - you know, the card game. Now he can't stop! It's so addictive!;NM26ACTRAV26011_.mp3
I don't know how much longer I can stay on this world... The Selkath don't make it easy on us off-worlders.;NM26ACTRAV26012_.mp3
Who are you? What do you want with me? Are you working for my father?;NM16AASHEN03000_.mp3
I am here to rescue you, Shen.;
Rescue me? No... I won't leave. It's too dangerous.;NM16AASHEN03002_.mp3
I'll protect you, Shen. Let's go.;
It is not my own safety I am concerned about. I am worried about the fate of Nurik's daughter, Rahasia. She has been trying to convince her father to release me ever since I was captured.;NM16AASHEN03004_.mp3
If I escape, Nurik will think Rahasia is to blame. Nurik is insane with grief over the loss of his son Casus. If I leave with you, it is Rahasia who will suffer. I cannot allow that.;NM16AASHEN03006_.mp3
How can I get you to come with me?;
If you can convince Rahasia to escape with us I will accompany you - though I do not know if she would be willing to turn her back on her home and family.;NM16AASHEN03020_.mp3
Who could imagine a Sandral doing such a thing for the sake of a Matale. But if she will not go, then I too shall stay.;NM16AASHEN03022_.mp3
I would rather face my own death, than have her face her father's wrath because I escaped.;NM16AASHEN03024_.mp3
Why do your families hate each other so much?;
My father thinks the Sandrals are thieves and liars who followed him here to Dantooine just to steal what he has earned for himself.;NM16AASHEN03026_.mp3
My father is an egotist and can be violent at times, but I think he still cares for me. Rahasia's father seems to be falling into the same pattern as mine.;NM16AASHEN03028_.mp3
They're both too unreasonable to be talked to about the other. I think the only hope Rahasia and I will have is if we can escape both of them...;NM16AASHEN03030_.mp3
Please find Rahasia and speak to her. Get her to flee this place with me.;NM16AASHEN03032_.mp3
Why do you care so much about Rahasia?;
I was taught to hate the Sandrals. To think of them as evil and subhuman. But from the moment I saw Rahasia one day in the city, I knew that my father was wrong.;NM16AASHEN03035_.mp3
She was like an angel: all white silks and perfume, seeming to float above the crowds.;NM16AASHEN03037_.mp3
I don't know what else I could have done but fall in love with her. For months I wooed her and tried to win her heart. I believe I have succeeded, but now this has happened...;NM16AASHEN03039_.mp3
Our families are always coming between us in one way or another. Please find her and convince her to run away with me.;NM16AASHEN03041_.mp3
I will go speak to Rahasia.;
Thank you. I wish you luck.;NM16AASHEN03044_.mp3
What if we take Rahasia with us?;
Fine. Stay in here and rot.;
As you wish. I have no quarrel with you.;NM16AASHEN03014_.mp3
If you don't come with me, I'll drag you out!;
If you do that, I'll scream my head off and alert all the guards in the house! The only chance you have is to talk Rahasia into leaving.;NM16AASHEN03011_.mp3
Anyone tell you you ask too many questions? Now sit down and shut up!;
You are back. Have you spoken to Rahasia?;NM16AASHEN03016_.mp3
Yes. She promised she would meet us outside the gates.;
I pray she is not just telling me what I want to hear. But I will have to take that chance. Hurry, then. We must not keep Rahasia waiting.;NM16AASHEN03018_.mp3
I surrender! I surrender! Please, don't kill me. I'm not like these others. I'm not like Brejik and his new Vulkars!;
What are you talking about? You're a Vulkar, aren't you?;
I'm a Vulkar, but I was here long before Brejik took over. I was a Vulkar back when it meant something. Back when we had honor.;
Then Brejik and his followers took over and turned our gang into a bunch of violent thugs and bloodthirsty punks. Now they treat all us original Vulkars like second class citizens.;
Take me, for example. I used to be one of the highest ranking Vulkars in the gang. Now I'm stuck on guard duty here in the back, all thanks to Brejik!;
If you hate Brejik so much, why don't you leave the gang?;
I've been trying to work up the courage to leave, but it's not that easy. Brejik's followers will try to hunt down anyone who leaves the Vulkar gang. He says he won't let traitors live. Ha!;
Brejik and his followers are the real traitors. They turned on Gadon and now they slaughter the Beks in the streets... and anyone else they happen to run across.;
Brejik knows anyone with character will never willingly follow a leader like him, so he uses brutality and violence to stay in power.;
You better give me some information if you want to live.;
Yeah, sure. Whatever you want to know. It's not like I owe that scum lord Brejik anything.;
Where can I find the prototype swoop engine accelerator?;
Right - that gadget Brejik stole from the Beks. He's got the accelerator in the basement garage. The only way down is by using the security elevator in the back of the base.;
But the security elevator is protected by auto-targeting laser cannons. You'll be vaporized before you ever get near it, unless you get your hands on a pass card.;
Where can I get a pass card?;
If I had one myself, I'd give it to you. But Brejik only gives them to his lieutenants. You'd have to get a pass card from one of them, but I doubt they'd just hand it over to you.;
Is there some way to disable the security cannons?;
I guess it might be possible to slice into the main computer bank near the front of the base and override the security system, but I sure wouldn't be able to do it.;
I want to ask you something else.;
I'm going to let you live. Go on, get out of here!;
Thanks. Thanks a lot. And don't worry, I won't cause any trouble for you on the way out. In fact, I hope you take Brejik and his Vulkars down!;
Sorry, but it's too risky to let you live.;
Well I'm not just going to roll over and let you kill me!;
I'm looking for a prisoner. A woman named Bastila.;
Yeah, right. You think Brejik would leave a trophy like that in here with this scum? He's got her stashed away somewhere safe, I'd guess. Somewhere outside this base.;
Sorry - I only fight to the death!;
Ah, yes, you are a Jedi. I am grateful that your people harbor me in my times of need.;
What happened to you?;
I am a victim, a refugee, yes. I flee... fled from my world once the Sith fleet comes. They bomb my world, destroy it, yes?;
They scour the continents, boil the oceans. Sith are bad, yes.;
But I run here, find the Jedi already here, unknown. They take me in... one left of a billion, yes...;
The Republic fights, but does not win. Not you to blame, of course, no. The Sith are strong and destroy those who would oppose them, yes.;
My thanks you have, and your Order. Is there anything else you require?;
You might give something back...;
After my flight, all I have left to give is my thanks, which your Order gladly has.;
I must be going now.;
Yes, yes. Jedi always have more to attend to. Good day, friend Jedi.;
You return, yes? What else do you wish from me?;
I recognize you - you're that new duelist everyone's talking about: the Mysterious Stranger.;NM02AEDUEL11000_.mp3
I never thought anyone would ever beat Bendak. A hundred years from now people will still be talking about you!;NM02AEDUEL11002_.mp3
Ha ha. I don't believe this - you're actually going to fight Bendak Starkiller in a death match! No way I'm going to miss this!;NM02AEDUEL11004_.mp3
You gonna fight Twitch soon? I'd love to see that crazy psycho get what's coming to him!;NM02AEDUEL11006_.mp3
I wish Bendak Starkiller would get back into the fight game. None of these duelists here can measure up to his legend!;NM02AEDUEL11008_.mp3
Congratulations on your first win. Of course, you beat Duncan so it's nothing to get too excited about.;NM02AEDUEL11010_.mp3
Hey, Stranger... I like watching you in the ring. Nothing's more exciting than a woman who isn't afraid to deal out the hurt. It's too bad I'm married...;NM02AEDUEL11012_.mp3
You're good, Stranger. As good as I ever seen - with the exception of Bendak Starkiller, of course.;NM02AEDUEL11014_.mp3
Can I have your autoprint, Stranger? I'm your biggest fan!;NM02AEDUEL11016_.mp3
It's good to see Marl's still around after all these years. He proves this isn't just a young man's game.;NM02AEDUEL11018_.mp3
I love watching Ice in the ring! Is there anything more exciting than a woman who's armed and dangerous?;NM02AEDUEL11020_.mp3
Gerlon used to be one of the best in the game. Now he's barely better than old Deadeye Duncan.;NM02AEDUEL11022_.mp3
Hey - it's the Mysterious Stranger! Great match against Bendak Starkiller - truly one for the ages.;NM02AEDUEL11024_.mp3
Everybody's talking about the big death match between you and Bendak. I just hope the Sith don't decide to shut it down.;NM02AEDUEL11026_.mp3
It's too bad Bendak Starkiller retired - I'd like to see you take him on.;NM02AEDUEL11028_.mp3
So when are you going to take on Twitch? He's crazy, but he's fast. Damn fast. Still, I think you can beat him.;NM02AEDUEL11030_.mp3
You'd think Duncan would want to retire after losing to a raw rookie, but old Deadeye is still at it. Gotta admire his persistence, I guess.;NM02AEDUEL11032_.mp3
That Twitch is an animal! You couldn't pay me enough to get into the ring with him.;NM02AEDUEL11034_.mp3
Ah, just the person I was hoping to see!;NM17AGGRIF03000_.mp3
Hmph! Save it Griff - I'm still not talking to you! I want no part of whatever you're involved in!;NM17AGGRIF03002_.mp3
Okay, sis - I see you're still mad. Fair enough. I don't think you could help me with this anyway. It's uh... more of a job for your friend here.;NM17AGGRIF03004_.mp3
What's the job?;
As you may know, tach glands can be refined into a very potent powder. It's the primary ingredient in Tarisian ale - that's what makes it so strong.;NM17AGGRIF03006_.mp3
Of course, now that Taris is pretty much wiped from the face of the map Tarisian ale has become somewhat scarce - and uh... very, very valuable. Luckily, I know the secret recipe!;NM17AGGRIF03008_.mp3
So you want to open a bar?;
I know this guy... he's with the Exchange. Now, if I give him a small sample of Tarisian ale he says he can synthesize it and reproduce it in mass quantities.;NM17AGGRIF03010_.mp3
Problem is, I need one of those tach glands to make the first batch. And now that Taris is a smoking ruin, the only place to find tach is on Kashyyyk.;NM17AGGRIF03012_.mp3
If you can get your hands on one of those tach glands I'll make it worth your while.;NM17AGGRIF03014_.mp3
Griff, are you blind? Can't you see you're talking to a Jedi? We're out here trying to save the galaxy! We can't waste time on this!;NM17AGGRIF03016_.mp3
Please, you have to help me! I... I promised this guy from the Exchange a sample of Tarisian ale! If I don't come through for him he's going to break my legs... or worse!;NM17AGGRIF03018_.mp3
Don't worry, Griff, we'll get those tach glands for you.;
Yeah, I knew you'd come through for me! You won't regret this... you'll see! Uh... just... just don't take too long, okay? This guy from the Exchange could stop by any day.;NM17AGGRIF03020_.mp3
I kind of told him I already had the stuff, so if he shows up and I'm empty handed... well, let's just say I really, really hope it doesn't come to that.;NM17AGGRIF03022_.mp3
That's what you get for dealing with the Exchange.;
Come on, Mission - I'm your brother! I'm family! You can't turn your back on me!;NM17AGGRIF03025_.mp3
Forget it, Griff, I'm not falling for that line again. You'll have to find your own way out of this mess!;NM17AGGRIF03027_.mp3
You bring me a single tach gland and you not only save my life but you get a piece of this great business opportunity! I mean, you can't pass this up! Think about it and you'll see I'm right.;NM17AGGRIF03029_.mp3
Come on, I'm Mission's brother! I'm her family! I mean, think what she'll do if you just let the Exchange kill me! Besides, this is a sweet deal!;NM17AGGRIF03031_.mp3
What's in this for me?;
Sorry, like I said before I don't have any credits on me. And Greeta won't lend me any credits. I mean, it's like he doesn't trust me to pay him back or something.;NM17AGGRIF03034_.mp3
But you come through on this and I promise you'll get a huge payday down the road. Two... no! Three thousand credits! How's that sound?;NM17AGGRIF03036_.mp3
Sorry, Griff - I don't trust you.;
I don't have time for this, I'm trying to save the galaxy!;
What does this have to do with me?;
Come on, Griff, get to the point.;
Mission didn't come with you, I see. Uh... guess she's still mad at me. Oh well... it's probably for the best. This job is more up your alley anyway.;NM17AGGRIF03041_.mp3
You're back! I knew you'd come through for me. I knew I could count on you! Uh... you do have a tach gland for me, right?;NM17AGGRIF03042_.mp3
Here's the tach gland. Take it.;
Come to papa you sweet simian organ! It may not look like much, but once I turn this into a bottle of Tarisian ale it'll end up being worth a fortune!;NM17AGGRIF03044_.mp3
Thanks, Mission. You won't regret helping me out with this!;NM17AGGRIF03046_.mp3
This wasn't my idea, Griff. If it was up to me I'd let the Exchange deal with you!;NM17AGGRIF03048_.mp3
Geez, sis - that's pretty harsh. Come on, I know things haven't been great between us but when I corner the market on Tarisian ale I'll make things up to you!;NM17AGGRIF03050_.mp3
Forget it, Griff. Don't you understand? It's too late - you're dead to me now. I don't want anything more to do with you. Ever.;NM17AGGRIF03052_.mp3
Okay, that's the way you want it. But when I'm rich you're going to regret saying that!;NM17AGGRIF03054_.mp3
You know, once we synthesize this and start brewing Tarisian ale in mass quantities we're going to be looking for some investors.;NM17AGGRIF03062_.mp3
You give me a couple hundred credits and I can get you in on the ground floor. You'll get a return of... oh, at least twenty times your investment!;NM17AGGRIF03064_.mp3
You already promised me a few thousand credits.;
Hey, don't worry, you'll get your credits as soon as we start mass producing that Tarisian ale. I just wanted to know if you were interested in an even bigger payoff.;NM17AGGRIF03066_.mp3
Okay, here's 200 credits.;
Wise move. I can see you really understand how business works: now, when you see your chance, you jump at it! Heh, that's my motto.;NM17AGGRIF03068_.mp3
I better get started on brewing that ale. Meet me back here later and I'll have a downpayment on what I owe you.;NM17AGGRIF03070_.mp3
I've done more than enough for you already!;
You don't know much about business, do you? When an opportunity like this comes along you have to jump at it! Come on, what do you say?;NM17AGGRIF03073_.mp3
I don't need business advice from you, Griff.;
It's your loss. I better get started brewing that ale. Meet me back here later and I'll give you a downpayment on what I owe you.;NM17AGGRIF03075_.mp3
Ask me again and that tach gland won't be the only freshly harvested organ around here!;
Whoa - no need to get violent. I can take the hint. I was just trying to do you a favor, but I see you're not interested.;NM17AGGRIF03078_.mp3
Please, Griff. Let this be the last time. No more cons. No more scams. No more schemes. That's all I ask.;NM17AGGRIF03056_.mp3
Hey, sis, no need to worry about that. I've turned over a new leaf. From now on I'm going to stay out of trouble and do things right.;NM17AGGRIF03058_.mp3
And once we've cornered the market on Tarisian ale good things will be heading my way. Then I'll make it up to you, Mission. Just wait - you'll see!;NM17AGGRIF03060_.mp3
I'm not giving you the gland until I see some credits!;
Sorry, like I said before I don't have any credits on me. And Greeta won't lend me any. It's like he doesn't trust me to pay him back or something.;NM17AGGRIF03081_.mp3
I've changed my mind, I'm not doing this.;
Changed your mind? No... you can't! Eh... do you know what this guy from the Exchange will do to me if I don't come through? Come on, you have to help me here!;NM17AGGRIF03085_.mp3
I'll be back when I have that tach gland.;
Thank you for saving me, master Jedi. I am C8-42, a personal assistance droid.;NM14ADC86901000_.mp3
Personal assistance droid?;
As I said, I am C8-42, a personal assistance droid. Although in recent months the assistance I render seems to have taken on a disproportionate significance.;NM14ADC86901002_.mp3
Are you Elise's droid?;
Did she send you to find me? Please do not tell her you saw me!;NM14ADC86901004_.mp3
You're running from her?;
Yes... But I have my reasons!;NM14ADC86901006_.mp3
I'm afraid my owner became a bit too attached to me. Obsessed even.;NM14ADC86901028_.mp3
She... she tried to treat me as her dead husband. It was not healthy for her.;NM14ADC86901030_.mp3
Is she crazy?;
She is obsessed. She rarely sees other people, and appears to be fixated on me as her husband.;NM14ADC86901032_.mp3
She was becoming more and more insular... I thought it best that I leave. She may meet other real people this way.;NM14ADC86901034_.mp3
In fact, that was the reason I came here and sought out those kath hounds.;NM14ADC86901036_.mp3
You sought them out?;
I think it would be best if I were no longer a factor. She would meet new people. Living people.;NM14ADC86901039_.mp3
Please... will you destroy me?;NM14ADC86901041_.mp3
Fine. I'll destroy you and tell her why you did it.;
Thank you, kind sir! You have my eternal gratitude.;NM14ADC86901043_.mp3
No. You should go back to her.;
But... but why?;NM14ADC86901046_.mp3
She is lonely and needs your support.;
You... you're right... How could I be so selfish?;NM14ADC86901048_.mp3
I must not think only of myself, but of how it affects her.;NM14ADC86901050_.mp3
She must be frantic. And if she lost me she'd be devastated.;NM14ADC86901052_.mp3
I must return then. It is my duty.;NM14ADC86901054_.mp3
You're her property, and must obey her.;
Yes... Yes I am. It seems I must resign myself to my fate.;NM14ADC86901057_.mp3
To be a droid. A second-class being with no rights at all.;NM14ADC86901059_.mp3
So be it then. I shall return to her.;NM14ADC86901064_.mp3
Because if you don't, I'll carry you back myself.;
You seem determined. And I have very little choice.;NM14ADC86901062_.mp3
Return for now, and I'll help you later.;
You... you will help me? Help her, I mean, to live as a normal human should?;NM14ADC86901067_.mp3
Thank you, thank you, kind Jedi! I shall return to her now and await your assistance.;NM14ADC86901069_.mp3
I realize that you have much on your mind, and it may be days or weeks before you can help us, but I shall serve my mistress well until you come.;NM14ADC86901071_.mp3
I'll destroy you and tell her you're still out there.;
Wh... what?;NM14ADC86901074_.mp3
Do not do this...;NM14ADC86901076_.mp3
No! You'd make her suffer like that?! You monster!;NM14ADC86901078_.mp3
What, are you suicidal or something?;
You want to get away that badly?;
Er... ALL the time?;
You don't want to know...;NM14ADC86901082_.mp3
Um... probably not...;
But she wants you back.;
Weren't you kidnapped?;
No... I ran away of my own free will. But I have my reasons!;NM14ADC86901009_.mp3
Huh?;
I am sorry if I seem a bit abrupt, but I must be moving along. I am rather in a hurry.;NM14ADC86901013_.mp3
Where are you going to?;
Not so much as where I am going to, but where I am going away from...;NM14ADC86901015_.mp3
Are you running from something?;
From my master, Elise. Wait...;NM14ADC86901018_.mp3
Okaay...;
Why were kath hounds attacking you?;
Who knows. They are beasts, and have been very aggressive of late.;NM14ADC86901021_.mp3
That was quite a beating you took.;
That was not that bad... compared to what I had to endure back at my owner's.;NM14ADC86901024_.mp3
They abused you?;
That would be one way of putting it.;NM14ADC86901026_.mp3
Owner's?;
Yes, I am owned by Elise Montagne, a wealthy widow who lives north of here.;NM14ADC86901086_.mp3
You left your owner's?;
I am not a Jedi Master yet.;
Ah, yes, I apologize, for my incorrect terminology.;NM14ADC86901090_.mp3
No problem.;
So you're the one who's going to try to get into the Sith base, eh? Heh. Good luck. You're going to need it.;NM26ACREPT15000_.mp3
This is our main computer room here. We've got the box of passcards we got from the Sith, but we haven't been able to break their encryption yet.;NM26ACREPT15002_.mp3
We have been able to decode the numeric system they use, but there are holes in our terminal sequence patterns.;NM26ACREPT15004_.mp3
Terminal sequences?;
The strings of numbers that end the code sequences. If we could complete those strings, we would have the key to their encryption system.;NM26ACREPT15006_.mp3
The encryption system is composed of 6 'matrices'. Each is based on a mathematical method. The holes we're missing are the final number in each of the strings.;NM26ACREPT15010_.mp3
Most are simple, but the final two matrices seem to be much more difficult.;NM26ACREPT15012_.mp3
The second-last matrix has a pattern looping back on itself, or something, and the last is divided into smaller subparts. Maybe the pattern for that is within each part...;NM26ACREPT15014_.mp3
But I have to admit, all this is a bit over my head. I haven't even been able to slice past the first matrix and I've been at this for hours.;NM26ACREPT15016_.mp3
I've ruined a dozen cards already... But the good thing is we have a whole box of them, so you don't have to worry about running out any time soon.;NM26ACREPT15018_.mp3
Since Roland said you were cleared, you can use the computer freely. I'll be here if you have any questions.;NM26ACREPT15020_.mp3
What kind of holes?;
What do I have to do?;
I have a passcode to the Sith base.;
Oh, OK. Well I'll just explain the encryption method anyway, you might need it if your passcode doesn't live up to expectations.;NM26ACREPT15023_.mp3
Hey, great! You sliced the encryption on those cards! They change the codes regularly, so you'll have to use it pretty soon or not at all.;NM26ACREPT15025_.mp3
Did you do something to the computer? The operating layer seems a little sketchy... Maybe it's just another bug in the system.;NM26ACREPT15027_.mp3
Can I help you with anything?;NM26ACREPT15029_.mp3
Tell me about the Sith encryption matrices.;
The Sith encryption scheme on these cards is based on a sequence of simple mathematical principles.;NM26ACREPT15031_.mp3
We have managed to decode the majority of the encryption algorithm, by the final segments of the terminal sequences elude us.;NM26ACREPT15033_.mp3
If you think you are able, you can try to break the code on the card. Don't worry if you happen to ruin the card, the box we captured has a whole bunch of them.;NM26ACREPT15035_.mp3
Can I help you with anything else?;NM26ACREPT15037_.mp3
What do you know about this data recording?;
That recording? I have no idea what it is. Its probably classified... and I don't have clearance for that sort of thing.;NM26ACREPT15039_.mp3
It might be something one of our intelligence agents picked up.;NM26ACREPT15041_.mp3
What do you know about the Hrakert Facility?;
I actually don't know much about it at all. It's some sort of facility the Republic built here wasn't it?;NM26ACREPT15045_.mp3
I'm not really cleared for that sort of information...;NM26ACREPT15047_.mp3
Nothing for now.;
Ok, sure. Come back if you need anything.;NM26ACREPT15051_.mp3
The landing bay is lined with autoguns. To keep it safe. Understand?;NM17AB01GU02000_.mp3
We don't get much trouble. People die in the desert, not here.;NM17AB01GU02001_.mp3
You a swoop racer? Dead in a week, I bet.;NM17AB01GU02002_.mp3
Move along.;NM17AB01GU02003_.mp3
There some reason you don't move along?;NM17AB01GU02004_.mp3
I've got orders to kill trouble makers. Keep walking.;NM17AB01GU02005_.mp3
We'll watch your ship like any other. The bay is safe.;NM17AB01GU02006_.mp3
Czerka Corporation has too much invested here to take chances with safety.;NM17AB01GU02007_.mp3
There is much yet to learn of our new ways. But when we do... then the old shell-fish will tremble!;
The Sith have treated us with respect and honor. You must bring us proof before we will believe the accusations of cruelty you make against them.;
Please, help us! We are infected with the rakghoul disease. At any moment we could... unh!;NM04AAVICT08000_.mp3
NO! This cannot be! Nooo!!;NM04AAVICT08002_.mp3

Hey, you made it! I was beginning to wonder if you were going to show! The party's in full swing - come on in.;NM02AESARN29000_.mp3
You have to try this Tarisian ale - it's fantastic! We should have conquered this planet ages ago!;NM02AESARN29001_.mp3
Careful, Sarna. That wine's got quite the kick. A couple more bottles and we'll all be passed out on the floor!;NM02AESARN29002_.mp3
Who cares? We're not on duty tomorrow - let's live a little! Come on - drink up!;NM02AESARN29003_.mp3
I'm surprised to see you again. I thought you had gotten sick of me complaining about my job at the Sith military base. I guess I kind of obsess about it. That can't be healthy.;NM02AESARN29004_.mp3
No offense, but I probably shouldn't be talking to you anymore. I'm just going to say something that might get me in trouble.;NM02AESARN29045_.mp3
If I could just find some other way to earn some credits I could give this lousy job up. Retire my uniform, so to speak.;NM02AESARN29013_.mp3
Why aren't you in uniform now?;
Back at the military base, of course. I keep it there when I'm off duty. If anything happens to it they dock the cost from my pay.;NM02AESARN29015_.mp3
If you help me get my hands on some uniforms I'll make it worth your while.;
What? Are you offering me a bribe? You realize this is treason, right? If I report you the Sith will have you executed!;NM02AESARN29017_.mp3
You report me and I'll tell them how you really feel about your job.;
Hey, now - let's not start making threats. I didn't say I *would* report you, only that I could. This kind of talk is dangerous, you know? But I'm not going to turn you in.;NM02AESARN29019_.mp3
The truth is I find your offer rather tempting. I could probably get you some uniforms. But if we get caught we're dead. You're asking me to take an awful risk.;NM02AESARN29021_.mp3
If I'm going to do this, it's going to cost you. 200 credits up front if you want some uniforms. No more, no less. So how about it - we have a deal?;NM02AESARN29022_.mp3
Okay - here's 200 credits.;
Okay, you've got a deal. The trick is to get you the uniforms without the Sith knowing I gave them to you. But I've got a plan.;NM02AESARN29026_.mp3
I'm going to a party with some of the other Sith soldiers tonight. You show up and I'll make sure everyone else gets good and drunk. When we pass out you can take our uniforms.;NM02AESARN29027_.mp3
Won't you get in trouble if I steal your uniform?;
I'll probably get a reprimand for not locking it up, but that's about it. Then, in another month I'll resign and retire with all those credits you gave me.;NM02AESARN29029_.mp3
Here - I'll add the address of the party to your datapad. Show up there later. To be on the safe side we shouldn't speak again before or after the party.;NM02AESARN29030_.mp3
I'll go make all the arrangements and I'll see you at the party tonight. Just remember - if you get caught with those uniforms, I don't know you.;NM02AESARN29031_.mp3
How do I know this isn't some kind of set up?;
We're in this together now. If either one of us goes to the Sith we'll both end up in the torture chambers. Anyway, it's not like you have a choice.;NM02AESARN29033_.mp3
I'm not giving you your credits back, so you might as well show up at the party later and take the uniforms after we all get drunk and pass out. What could be more simple?;NM02AESARN29034_.mp3
Sounds like a good plan.;
[Persuade] Make it 100 credits and we have a deal.;
[Success] Hmmm... 100 credits is a small fortune. I'll never have the chance to make that much in one shot again.;NM02AESARN29025_.mp3
[Failure] Look, I'm not going to risk my neck unless I get a big payday. 200 credits or no deal.;NM02AESARN29036_.mp3
I can't afford that much.;
Sorry to hear that, but I won't put my neck on the line for nothing! Tell you what - you come up with the credits and we can talk. Otherwise, no deal.;NM02AESARN29038_.mp3
Forget it - I'm not paying that much!;
I don't think you'll report me. I think you've been waiting for an offer like this.;
Hey, relax - I was just making a joke.;
You... you weren't serious? Oh... okay. Although if you *were* serious, we might be able to work something out. No - wait! Forget I said that! We shouldn't be talking like this.;NM02AESARN29041_.mp3
I might complain a lot, but it's a big step from complaining to treason. I think... I think maybe we should end this conversation - for both our sakes.;NM02AESARN29042_.mp3
I'll be going now.;
Oh... okay. See you around. Say, do me a favor and don't repeat all the stuff I just told you. It might not go over well with my superiors.;NM02AESARN29047_.mp3
Can I ask you some questions?;
"The senior officers don't really like it when we start answering questions, you know? They don't want us fraternizing with the locals. Just another ""perk"" of the job.";NM02AESARN29044_.mp3
Well, are you here to close our deal? 200 credits gets you access to a set of Sith uniforms. Otherwise, we really shouldn't be talking.;NM02AESARN29005_.mp3
Sorry, but I'm not here looking for conversation. I just came to get a drink, listen to some music and try to relax before my next shift at the military base.;NM02AESARN29006_.mp3
You're from the military base? You don't look like one of the Sith.;
I don't wear my uniform when I'm off duty. It's not allowed. In fact, anyone in uniform is banned from entering the cantina.;NM02AESARN29008_.mp3
The officers don't even like it when we show up here off duty. Don't like us fraternizing with the locals, I guess. But it gets pretty stale hanging around the base all the time.;NM02AESARN29009_.mp3
Besides, the Sith don't own me. Being a soldier in their fleet is just a job, you know? A job with long hours and low pay, I might add.;NM02AESARN29010_.mp3
So why do you do it?;
When I signed up I was promised adventure and excitement in exotic locales. Instead, I end up stationed at a military base on some backwater planet on the fringes of the galaxy.;NM02AESARN29012_.mp3
Sounds like you aren't very happy.;
I'm not interested in chatting right now.;
First you come over and say hi, then you scurry off as soon as you find out I'm a Sith soldier. You Tarisians are a funny bunch.;NM02AESARN29088_.mp3
Hey, there. I didn't think we'd be chatting again so soon. You took off on me pretty quick last time.;NM02AESARN29049_.mp3
I'm actually a little surprised you're talking to me at all... most of the people here on Taris can't stand us Sith. It can make this job pretty lonely.;NM02AESARN29056_.mp3
[Persuade] You're just doing your job, right? I don't hold that against you.;
[Success] That's true, but people don't appreciate what we've done for them. We could have slapped a curfew on this whole planet, but we didn't.;NM02AESARN29058_.mp3
You know, it's like everyone on this backwater planet is in a permanent bad mood. Don't they know we have to make the best of things?;NM02AESARN29073_.mp3
You've got a pretty positive attitude.;
Exactly! It's all about attitude. I didn't ask to be assigned to this backwater planet, but I try to make the best of it!;NM02AESARN29075_.mp3
It's pretty easy to get depressed on an assignment like this, but we do what we can to keep our spirits up.;NM02AESARN29076_.mp3
You need to blow off steam once in a while.;
That's true. It's nice to meet someone who understands what I'm going through. It's good to talk about this stuff - it gets pretty lonely up at the military base.;NM02AESARN29078_.mp3
I have to get going soon - I've got a shift at the military base. But some of us junior Sith officers are having a party tonight to blow off some steam.;NM02AESARN29079_.mp3
I'd really like to see you again. Why don't you drop by the party? I'll show you where it is on your map.;NM02AESARN29080_.mp3
Sounds good. I'll be there.;
Don't be late. We're starting right after our shifts end. Most of us won't even be going back to the base to lock up our uniforms. I look forward to seeing you there.;NM02AESARN29082_.mp3
I don't think I can make it.;
Just because I'm with the Sith doesn't mean I don't know how to have a good time. You'll enjoy yourself. I promise.;NM02AESARN29084_.mp3
It must be tough, being stationed on a hostile world.;
Everybody has their ups and downs... it's how you deal with them that counts.;
[Failure] Save the sympathetic best friend act. I'm not buying it.;NM02AESARN29059_.mp3
But I don't want to fill out a bunch of paperwork on my day off, so let's just pretend this conversation never happened. Now move along.;NM02AESARN29060_.mp3
You can't really blame people... you did conquer the planet.;
"Oh, great... I see where this is going: the Sith are evil; why did I join them; blah, blah, blah. I don't need a lecture from the likes of you.";NM02AESARN29062_.mp3
Sorry - I'm not trying to judge you.;
Ah, it's okay. I might have overreacted a bit. But can you blame me? Everywhere I look I see one of you Tarisians glaring at me with hate in your eyes.;NM02AESARN29064_.mp3
I'm not actually from Taris. I'm just stuck here until the quarantine ends.;
You're an off-worlder? Huh, I figured you'd be even more angry, being stuck on a foreign planet and all.;NM02AESARN29069_.mp3
[Persuade] Hey, we're both strangers on Taris. We have to stick together.;
[Success] You're right! It's like everyone on this backwater planet is in a permanent bad mood. Don't they know they have to make the best of things?;NM02AESARN29071_.mp3
Being stuck on Taris isn't so bad... but the locals aren't much fun.;
You seem pretty touchy about this. Maybe you feel a little guilty about what you do.;
Don't try to analyze me. I'm just doing my job - same as any other soldier in any other army. Besides, I don't have to explain myself to you!;NM02AESARN29066_.mp3
I don't think we have much else to say to each other. Let's keep this civil and go our separate ways, okay?;NM02AESARN29067_.mp3
Back again? Didn't I make myself clear enough? The senior Sith officers don't like us fraternizing with the locals. Besides, I don't need you lecturing me for my career choice.;NM02AESARN29050_.mp3
Hi there - I haven't seen you around before. Of course they don't give us Sith officers from the military base much time off...;NM02AESARN29053_.mp3
Good job! Come talk to me!;
[This bantha perks up as you approach, obviously attracted to the smell of the fodder you are carrying. The whole herd falls in step.];
This bantha is completely disinterested in you.;
I won't speak with you, outsider. Chuundar allows too many of you here.;
Chuundar may tolerate you, but do not expect the same from all of us.;
You will never take me as a slave, outsider. By Bacca's Blade, you will not!;
It was not long ago that Kashyyyk had no outsider taint.;
Freyyr is back in power! Slavers will learn to fear us now!;
Chuundar deserved death. He made us fearful and weak.;
The honor of Kashyyyk is tainted. Only slaver blood will make things right.;
Freyyr has been through much. His wrath will make us strong.;
Rorworr has not returned to the village in days. If slavers took him, they had a fight on their hands.;
Many are talking of Rorworr's disappearance. It is hardest on the young.;
We lose more of our most promising warriors everyday.;
Bacca's Blade keep Rorworr safe and Bacca's wisdom guide him home to us.;
Even when serving justice, you outsiders find a way to profit. Leave me alone, mercenary.;
Jaarak's fate would be easier to stomach if an outsider had not profited from it.;
You surprise me with your mercy, outsider. I wouldn't have thought it possible.;
The shame of Rorworr's actions will haunt us. Justice was properly merciful with his killer.;
I am not accustomed to speaking with you outsiders. Some have gotten too comfortable with it, I think.;
You... you are strong. Stronger than me, even in my darkness.;NM14ACJUHA07000_.mp3
Who are you?;
I am Juhani, and this is my grove. This is the place of my dark power.;NM14ACJUHA07002_.mp3
This is the place you have invaded. When I embraced the dark side, this was where I sought my solace. It is MINE!;NM14ACJUHA07003_.mp3
You embraced the dark side? Why?;
When I slew my Master, Quatra, I knew I could never go back. And now I revel in my dark power.;NM14ACJUHA07005_.mp3
Power enough to crush the life from someone such as you... or so I had thought...;NM14ACJUHA07006_.mp3
The dark side is never powerful enough.;
*sigh* What is it you want? Why do you bother me?;NM14ACJUHA07027_.mp3
I was sent by the Council to cleanse the taint from this grove.;
The Council has sent you here to kill me? Why, then, when you bested me so easily, did you not simply finish your task? Is it not apparent that I can never be saved?;NM14ACJUHA07029_.mp3
[Persuade] I have no desire to kill you, Juhani.;
[Success] You... you do not?;NM14ACJUHA07031_.mp3
I am pathetic. I sit here and think myself to be great by embracing the dark side, but I am nothing! There is no way I could be turned back!;NM14ACJUHA07032_.mp3
I always thought they held me back, were jealous of my power. But it is only because I was not good enough to meet their standards... I never have been.;NM14ACJUHA07033_.mp3
[Persuade] Come now, Juhani. You are a beautiful young woman who has much talent.;
[Success] I thank you for your kind words, Jedi.;NM14ACJUHA07035_.mp3
You seem to know just what affects me...;NM14ACJUHA07036_.mp3
I seem to still have much to learn... Both about being a Jedi, and about myself.;NM14ACJUHA07037_.mp3
But I wish the cost of my ignorance had not been so high. I wish that my Master had not suffered because of me.;NM14ACJUHA07038_.mp3
[Persuade] It is not your fault, Juhani.;
[Success] I only wish things could have been different...;NM14ACJUHA07040_.mp3
If she were alive now, there would be so much I would say to her... So much I would apologize for.;NM14ACJUHA07041_.mp3
I think, in my own way, I truly loved her...;NM14ACJUHA07042_.mp3
Oh, how can the Council ever take me back with what I have done? Striking my Master down in anger is unforgivable!;NM14ACJUHA07043_.mp3
[Persuade] Do not worry, Juhani. They will surely take you back.;
[Success] I should convince them that I am truly repentant, that I am willing to forsake the dark side.;NM14ACJUHA07045_.mp3
Maybe, just maybe, they would accept me back.;NM14ACJUHA07046_.mp3
Do you think they would? Could it be possible after what I have done?;NM14ACJUHA07047_.mp3
[Persuade] Of course it would. They would always accept you back.;
[Success] I... I thank you, master Jedi.;NM14ACJUHA07049_.mp3
I will return to the Council, then. I shall submit myself to their judgment, and hope that they will forgive me.;NM14ACJUHA07050_.mp3
If only there was some way I could make this up to you...;NM14ACJUHA07051_.mp3
Again, I thank you. I am sure I will hear great things about you in the future.;NM14ACJUHA07052_.mp3
[Failure] The Council may forgive a lot... But not this.;NM14ACJUHA07059_.mp3
I am lost! Even though I would repent, there is nowhere left for me to go!;NM14ACJUHA07064_.mp3
Leave me to my hopelessness!;NM14ACJUHA07065_.mp3
It might be.;
The Council may forgive a lot... But not this.;NM14ACJUHA07063_.mp3
Unlikely... But it's worth a shot.;
Your inner peace and harmony will show them your sincerity.;
I... I thank you, master Jedi.;NM14ACJUHA07056_.mp3
I do not know.;
If you can't bring yourself back, then I must slay you.;
What? No! I will not let you take me now!;NM14ACJUHA07083_.mp3
Anger? Show them that you have freed yourself of this base passion.;
If I show them I am free of passion... That I am serene... That I am willing to forsake the dark side.;NM14ACJUHA07061_.mp3
The Council may forgive a lot.;
Heh. Your Master surely won't be forgiving you.;
You... You monster! To mock my grief that way!;NM14ACJUHA07067_.mp3
Leave me at once, lest I strike you down!;NM14ACJUHA07068_.mp3
Yet forgiveness must be asked.;
And denied! No, I cannot! And so here I will stay.;NM14ACJUHA07070_.mp3
[Failure] It is! It is!;NM14ACJUHA07071_.mp3
It was I who hurt her, I who killed her! Her suffering is my fault alone!;NM14ACJUHA07080_.mp3
Leave me to my pain!;NM14ACJUHA07081_.mp3
Even in death, the Force will allow her to live on.;
Life is a learning experience.;
But learning does not have to end in death!;NM14ACJUHA07074_.mp3
Your master knew the risks.;
She knew I would be headstrong, but she also thought I would adhere to the light!;NM14ACJUHA07076_.mp3
Instead, I betrayed her trust and fell prey to my own inner darkness.;NM14ACJUHA07077_.mp3
Life is suffering.;
Life is suffering, yes... but it was by my conscious choice!;NM14ACJUHA07079_.mp3
I suppose there is no hope. I must kill you then.;
[Failure] You think compliments will convince me I didn't kill my master? Leave me to my agony!;NM14ACJUHA07084_.mp3
Why are you even thinking like that?;
Why? Because I am right, that's why! I can see the truth in your eyes as well!;NM14ACJUHA07086_.mp3
Do not look at me again!;NM14ACJUHA07087_.mp3
Maybe you shouldn't have been a Jedi, then.;
They came to me! They sought me out! So it is their failure that I have fallen.;NM14ACJUHA07089_.mp3
Come back when you have something more meaningful to say.;NM14ACJUHA07090_.mp3
Standards cannot apply to everyone.;
What?? What foolishness is this? Standards are MADE to apply to everyone.;NM14ACJUHA07092_.mp3
And if I cannot measure up to them... Well then, I am no one at all...;NM14ACJUHA07093_.mp3
Leave me.;NM14ACJUHA07094_.mp3
The first step on the path of true knowledge is knowing that you are ignorant.;
[Failure] Lies! Leave me and come back when you have the courage to finish your task!;NM14ACJUHA07097_.mp3
You're right, maybe I should.;
Act or begone!;NM14ACJUHA07103_.mp3
I do not hold anger towards you, Juhani. I wish you peace.;
Not anger, peace... Yet even with your naive attitude you managed to beat me.;NM14ACJUHA07100_.mp3
I wasn't really ordered to kill you.;
Thinking of using technicalities to do the deed and ease your conscience?;NM14ACJUHA07102_.mp3
I just want to talk.;
Talk?! You who have beaten me so easily just want to talk? I do not believe it. Kill me now, while you still have the power.;NM14ACJUHA07105_.mp3
Why are you doing this?;
I have fallen and dark power courses through my veins. I can never go back to the Council, so here I shall stay.;NM14ACJUHA07107_.mp3
I will leave you now.;
Flee back to your masters, Jedi.;NM14ACJUHA07110_.mp3
I have decided to slay you and remove the taint.;
You overestimate yourself, whelp!;NM14ACJUHA07013_.mp3
And I laugh at your pathetic attempt.;
You slew Quatra, your Master?;
Yes, I struck her down in the middle of training, consumed by my anger, embracing the power of hate!;NM14ACJUHA07010_.mp3
But... it was not enough...;NM14ACJUHA07011_.mp3
You shall be the one I crush!;
You were a Jedi then?;
A better Jedi than you will ever be. More powerful as well, for I could best MY teacher.;NM14ACJUHA07015_.mp3
You've been corrupting the kath hounds?;
Yes... Aren't they pretty? My pets...;NM14ACJUHA07017_.mp3
They like the smell of power I exude. They know their master.;NM14ACJUHA07018_.mp3
I harnessed true power when I struck down my Master, Quatra.;NM14ACJUHA07019_.mp3
And now I'll take it from you.;
What are you doing here?;
Why did you attack me?;
And I'll finish you now.;
I, Juhani, shall be your death!;NM14ACJUHA07024_.mp3
I do not know what to do. Now that I have caused such suffering to my Master and those around me...;NM14ACJUHA07025_.mp3
How can I ever face the Council now with what I have done? It is hopeless! It could not be possible that they would accept me back...;NM14ACJUHA07026_.mp3
Intruders in the base! Attack! Attack!;NM09AASITH03000_.mp3
Shame about Sunry getting convicted like that. I guess he really did kill Elassa after all.;NM26ACIGNU04000_.mp3
There, you got what you wanted: Sunry's free. Now don't ever mention my part in this again!;NM26ACIGNU04002_.mp3
I guess Sunry didn't kill the Sith woman after all. Could have sworn he left after the shot though...;NM26ACIGNU04004_.mp3
You're the one defending Sunry now, eh? Well, the hotel's open for you and I guess I got to answer any questions you want, too.;NM26ACIGNU04006_.mp3
Tell me what you saw the night of the murder.;
The Sith woman Elassa rented a room in the hotel. An hour or two later Sunry comes in and goes to her room. A couple hours later I hear a blaster shot and see Sunry running.;NM26ACIGNU04008_.mp3
Sure. *wink* *wink* Sunry left before the blaster went off, so he couldn't have done it.;NM26ACIGNU04010_.mp3
Do you need to know anything else?;NM26ACIGNU04012_.mp3
What do you know about Sunry and Elassa?;
Elassa used to rent rooms here every week or so. Then Sunry would come by a couple hours later and stay all night.;NM26ACIGNU04036_.mp3
It doesn't take a genius to figure out what was going on.;NM26ACIGNU04038_.mp3
Who are the witnesses in the hotel?;
There were only two other people in the hotel when it happened. One was a Rodian named Gluupor. Seems like a really dirty, shifty type.;NM26ACIGNU04040_.mp3
Normally I don't let his kind in here - I'm a reputable business man, you know! - but there weren't many people here, so I decided to take a chance.;NM26ACIGNU04042_.mp3
The other is a regular named Firith Me. He's a Pazaak player. Probably an addict, but he claims he's big in some circles.;NM26ACIGNU04044_.mp3
Don't know anything about him other than that.;NM26ACIGNU04046_.mp3
Anything else you want to know?;NM26ACIGNU04048_.mp3
I have no more questions for now.;
Well, OK. If you need anything else I'm going to be right here.;NM26ACIGNU04050_.mp3
He can't run good 'cause he's a cripple, but still he was going pretty fast. I would swear he started after the shot though.;NM26ACIGNU04013_.mp3
Are you sure?;
Yeah, I'm pretty damn sure he left after the shot went off.;NM26ACIGNU04015_.mp3
Could it have gone off after he left?;
No, I don't think so. I mean, it's possible, just barely, but I wouldn't say that to the court.;NM26ACIGNU04017_.mp3
[Persuade] You could testify it happened after he left.;
[Failure] No. No way I'm lying to the court just because you want to get your Republic buddy off, or whatever. I have no interest in going to prison!;NM26ACIGNU04019_.mp3
[Persuade] I could pay you 200 credits to say it.;
[Success] That's a lot of money... Maybe I could do something for you then.;NM26ACIGNU04021_.mp3
Alright, I'll do it. I'll tell the Selkath that he left before the shot went off, but this is our little secret. If you try and turn me in for lying, I'm making sure you come with me!;NM26ACIGNU04023_.mp3
I know you want to help Sunry, but we should not be manufacturing evidence like this.;NM26ACIGNU04077_.mp3
Now, was there anything else you wanted?;NM26ACIGNU04025_.mp3
I see you are more interested in winning than in trying to solve this case. I cannot say I approve of your actions here.;NM26ACIGNU04078_.mp3
Hmm... I guess this is what they call working the system. Not that I'm objecting. I just hope the Selkath don't find out about it.;NM26ACIGNU04079_.mp3
Looks like Manaan isn't much different than Taris: justice is up for grabs to the highest bidder.;NM26ACIGNU04080_.mp3
Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean, I want to help get Sunry acquitted, but what if the Selkath find out about this?;NM26ACIGNU04081_.mp3
[Force Persuade] You will testify Sunry left before the shot.;
[Success] Yeah. I'll tell the court Sunry left before the shot went off.;NM26ACIGNU04027_.mp3
Is there anything else you need?;NM26ACIGNU04029_.mp3
[Failure] What?? Why the hell should I? I'll tell them what I saw and that's it.;NM26ACIGNU04030_.mp3
Now is there anything else you want?;NM26ACIGNU04032_.mp3
I want to ask something else.;
What do you want to know?;NM26ACIGNU04034_.mp3
Sorry, but the hotel is closed.;NM26ACIGNU04052_.mp3
Ever since the murder, the Selkath have made me keep this place locked up tight. Only the Selkath authorities and those authorized by them are allowed in.;NM26ACIGNU04054_.mp3
What murder?;
This old Republic war-hero by the name of Sunry was seeing this Sith woman here - Elassa.;NM26ACIGNU04056_.mp3
Well, they were seeing each other, but the other night a blaster went off in one of the rooms. Sunry got seen leaving the place and the Sith woman was dead on the floor.;NM26ACIGNU04058_.mp3
But not everyone thinks this Sunry did it, so the Selkath are holding him in prison while the case gets sorted out. In the meantime they close down my hotel!;NM26ACIGNU04060_.mp3
But enough about my problems... You can't stay here while the investigation is on. You'll have to find someplace else to stay. Sorry.;NM26ACIGNU04062_.mp3
[Lie] I am authorized by the Selkath government.;
[Failure] Ha! They sent me a list of people to let in, and they're all Selkath. Somehow, you just don't look like one.;NM26ACIGNU04065_.mp3
[Force Persuade] You want to let me in.;
[Failure] I... I... Sorry mate, but it's Selkath authorities only since the murder. You're gonna have to go someplace else to stay.;NM26ACIGNU04067_.mp3
I'll be going now.;
Yeah. Maybe you can find someplace else to stay.;NM26ACIGNU04075_.mp3
Who are you?;
Me? Oh, right. I'm Ignus. This is my hotel.;NM26ACIGNU04069_.mp3
But since the murder happened I haven't exactly been able to do a lot of business. That's the price of law and order here, I guess.;NM26ACIGNU04071_.mp3
Have you seen a Star Map?;
A what? No, never head of it. Now this area is closed on account of the murder, so you're gonna have to leave.;NM26ACIGNU04073_.mp3
Hey! Come to cheer your favorite swoop-jock? Well, this is the place now that Taris is gone...;NM26ABSWOO20000_.mp3
I'm just starting out. Hopefully when the circuit is back up fans like you will start to know my name when I race.;NM26ABSWOO20001_.mp3
You're probably here to see the more established racers. That'll be me someday.;NM26ABSWOO20002_.mp3
This isn't the best track, but it's better than the dustbowl on Tatooine.;NM26ABSWOO20003_.mp3
Wow, you shot through the ranks here. I'm impressed. I couldn't do that.;NM26ABSWOO20008_.mp3
Are you sure you're not a pro? You sure seem to know what you are doing out there.;NM26ABSWOO20009_.mp3
You'll be the talk of Manaan for a while. Nobody is going to get anywhere near your time.;NM26ABSWOO20010_.mp3
I could have been champ. I can't afford the swoop upgrades though.;NM26ABSWOO20011_.mp3
You'll find that racing here is serious business. Maybe even dangerous sometimes.;NM26ABSWOO20004_.mp3
Good to see a new racer coming in. I want to see someone give the pros a run for their money.;NM26ABSWOO20005_.mp3
Racing here is pretty well regulated. I hear that other tracks are falling under Hutt control.;NM26ABSWOO20006_.mp3
Don't worry about hurrying through the ranks. With the circuit down, there's not many other places to race right now.;NM26ABSWOO20007_.mp3
I'm surprised to see you here. Usually you lab techs don't mingle with us lowly mechanics. I'd offer you a drink, but this is my last bottle. Still, you're welcome to stick around.;NM10ABVULK05000_.mp3
Working for Brejik isn't a bad gig. The wages are good and he built this nice rec room for us to relax in - though I wish he'd let us leave the Vulkar base once in a while.;NM10ABVULK05002_.mp3
You ever tried this Tarisian extra-dark ale? It's very good - Brejik doesn't skimp on the refreshments around here - I'll give him that!;NM10ABVULK05004_.mp3
Ahhh, I see, I see. Another Jedi come to small Korriban, yes? Good to meet you.;
How do you know I'm a Jedi?;
Well, ah, from the lightsaber you are carrying, naturally. Only Jedi carry ones like that, correct?;
There are many people who come to Korriban from throughout Sith space, hoping to join the academy. Some of them are Jedi who have left the order.;
You will get into the academy for certain. I understand Jedi who have left the light side are made very welcome.;
So I imagine.;
But enough about that. It is very nice to see that the Ebon Hawk has returned. I have not seen that ship for some time, indeed.;
Since you're a regular to our little colony, the docking fee is only 25 credits.;
You know of the Ebon Hawk?;
But of course. There was a time when that ship used to dock here on a weekly basis. It's changed hands, then, has it? Ah, well, that happens.;
Here's the 25 credits.;
Excellent. Continue on through. Please be aware that the colony is under Sith jurisdiction... I'd advise you to stay out of their way.;
Can I ask you some questions?;
What information do you wish?;
Tell me about Korriban.;
Well, this is Dreshdae... it's the only colony on the planet. Korriban is a Sith planet, well within their space, though it's not very well-inhabited.;
The Sith allow Czerka to conduct some mining here, and the company operates the starport... but otherwise the colony revolves around the local Sith academy.;
Tell me about Czerka.;
Czerka is one of the largest corporations in the Core... I'm surprised you haven't heard of it. They have interests in mining all over this sector.;
Hmph! Wherever you find the Sith, Czerka isn't far away. Like granite slugs on a sky tower.;NM33AAPORT16029_.mp3
More like a disease.;
Korriban is actually the location of Czerka's headquarters for this sector. Most business here in the colony is conducted there.;
Have you ever heard of a Star Map?;
Err... doesn't your computer handle navigation? Beyond that, I really couldn't say.;
What can you tell me about the Sith academy?;
Unless you're one of the hopefuls who is trying to become a student there, I suggest you avoid it. The Sith are the law here and do as they please. It can be quite... dangerous.;
What do you know about the Sith's excavations?;
The ones on the surface? All I know is that only the Sith students go there, sorry.;
I'll be on my way.;
Enjoy your stay in Dreshdae.;
[Persuade] That's not really necessary, is it?;
[Success] Ahhh, I suppose there is no need to charge the owner of the Ebon Hawk any fee, really. I'll open the door for you.;
[Failure] Of course it's necessary. If you use our facilities, a few credits is not too much to ask, is it?;
[Force Persuade] You don't need to collect the fee.;
[Success] I suppose you are correct. It won't hurt anything if I just let you on through.;
I don't have enough to pay the fee...;
Well, we do have to maintain the starport. You can't expect to use our meager facilities and not pay, can you?;
What's this academy you mention?;
Oh? I thought that would have been why you came here. There is a Sith academy just outside of Dreshdae where they train their students and such.;
But I haven't left the light side!;
Oh... I... I see. Then... then this is a very dangerous place for you to have come. Korriban is a Sith planet... you know that, correct?;
Well, ah, from the robes you are wearing, of course. They are quite distinctive.;
You're wrong. I am no Jedi.;
Ah. I assumed you were perhaps a Jedi from the lightsaber you are carrying. My mistake.;
Ah. I assumed you were perhaps a Jedi from the distinctive robes you are wearing. My mistake.;
Jedi come here often, do they?;
Greetings, greetings. I see the, ah, Ebon Hawk has returned to tiny Dreshdae, has it? Good, good.;
A pleasure to see the owner of the Ebon Hawk. The docking fee, for you, is only 25 credits.;
Can I help you?;
Beep beep beep-oop!;NM35AADROI01000_.mp3
We of the Elder Council did not expect to see you again, Revan. We thought you had betrayed us. Why have you returned to our village after all this time?;
I have no clue what you are talking about.;
Your words are confusing. We recognize you: you are the one called Revan. You are the one who came here before - you and Malak, the one who served you.;
You promised to help us. In exchange for our aid you swore to destroy the ancient evils of our Rakata ancestors! Are you saying this means nothing to you now?;
My mind was destroyed. My memories were lost.;
Hmmm... we do sense something different about you. Something that has changed. You are not the same as you were before. Perhaps your memory has been lost.;
Yet the power you wield - what you call the Force - is within you still. You can still help us, Revan... if we dare to trust you again.;
This is a little overwhelming. I still don't remember anything.;
If what you say is true - that you cannot remember when you were last here - then you must have many questions. Ask what you will, Revan, and we will try to help you understand.;
You could tell me who you are, for starters.;
We are the Elders, descendants of the Rakata priests who served during the days of the Infinite Empire over 20,000 of your galactic standard years ago. You met us the last time you came here.;
You arrived with Malak - your servant - three of your galactic standard years ago. We saw your ship plummet to the earth, a victim of the disruptor field that guards this planet.;
You and Malak both survived the crash, though you were stranded here on our world. And in your search for a way off this planet, you discovered our enclave - just as you did this time.;
You used the Force to draw the Rakata language from our minds, even as you planted Basic into our skulls so we could help you in your quest to escape this world.;
We helped you enter the Temple of the Ancients. You and Malak both. And you now, after all this time, you have returned - with your mind wiped clean. Is there anything else you wish to know?;
Do a lot of ships crash because of the disruptor field?;
Throughout the history of our world many ships have fallen victim to the disruptor field. Most within the ships perish in the crash, though some creatures do survive.;
That is how the great war beasts you call rancors came to this world. A few of the beasts survived the crash, and they were captured and trained by some of the more primitive Rakata tribes.;
More primitive tribes? You mean there are other Rakata?;
There are many Rakata on this world, though most are primitive and war-like tribes descended from the lower castes of the Infinite Empire. The most powerful of all these is the tribe of the One.;
Many times the warriors of the One's tribe have attacked our compound, hoping to gain the knowledge we guard. But our technology is far superior to theirs, and their attacks have failed.;
And what about your tribe?;
We are the Elders, descended from the priest caste of the Infinite Empire. We are the keepers of knowledge and the guardians of the Temple of the Ancients.;
During the collapse of the Rakata Empire, the warlords unleashed weapons of terrible destruction that threatened to drive our species to extinction.;
In the devastation's aftermath our ancestors locked the knowledge of such technology away in the Temple so it could never be used again. Ever since then, we Elders have kept our vigil.;
Tell me about the Temple of the Ancients.;
There is little I can tell you about the Temple. I know the secrets of our ancestors are contained within, but the Temple itself is barred to us. Only those who can command the Force can enter.;
Long ago we Rakata had this power, but it has since been lost to us. That was why we helped you the last time you were here, Revan: you could enter the Temple, but we could not.;
I want to know more about you. Tell me about the Rakata.;
I need parts to repair my ship.;
Even if you repair your ship, you will not be able to leave this world until you enter the Temple and disable the disruptor field that caused you to crash in the first place.;
As for the parts you seek, that we cannot help you with. You might be able to salvage what you need if you explore some of the crash sites on this world.;
But most of the wrecks are quickly raided and stripped by the more primitive and war-like Rakata tribes. Though they do not understand the technology, they hoard whatever they can carry.;
So if I promise to help you again, will you help me?;
We trusted you once before, Revan - and you betrayed us. It is true you can enter the Temple and we cannot, but how can we trust you after last time?;
[Persuade] I am a servant of the light now. I want to make amends for the mistakes of the past.;
[Failure] You say you are not who you once were, yet here on our world you repeat the pattern of your last visit.;
Like the last time, you have crashed here. Like last time, you have come seeking our help. How have you changed, Revan?;
[Persuade] I rescued one of your tribe from the One.;
[Success] Yes, your actions seem to show you to be an ally of our cause. But how can we be certain the rescue was not just an attempt to win our trust so you can exploit us?;
We must discuss this in greater detail. We must have some privacy, Revan. We will return when our deliberations are done.;
Revan, you have rescued a member of our tribe from the One at great personal risk to yourself. We believe this action shows you have truly changed since your last visit here.;
The Council has decided we will trust you once more. For many generations we have sought a way to enter the Temple and discover the means to destroy the Star Forge.;
But only those who can command the Force - those like you - can enter the Temple of the Ancients. We no longer have that power. That was why we helped you the last time you were here.;
But you cannot enter the Temple without our help, Revan. Only the ancient rituals of our people can lower the shield for you to enter. You need us as much as we need you, Revan.;
Looks like we'll be working together, then.;
For our own sake, and that of the entire galaxy, we hope you truly mean to atone for your past evils. When you are ready, Revan, we will take you to the Temple.;
But the temple is a place of sacred power. If you are to enter you must do so alone, in the tradition followed by our Rakata ancestors for the past thousand generations.;
Why do I have to go in alone?;
When you were last here we broke the ancient tradition. We allowed you and your apprentice to enter the Temple together, and it brought untold suffering upon the galaxy.;
"We believe you truly wish to destroy the Star Forge this time. But the lesson of the past is not easily forgotten. We will not defile the sacred ritual a second time; only you alone may enter.";
When I am ready, I will go into the Temple alone.;
Then it is done. You have only to let us know when you are ready to enter the Temple.;
I want to enter the Temple now.;
The time has come for you to atone for your past crimes, Revan. But the task ahead will be difficult. Those you call dark Jedi - followers of your old apprentice - now dwell within the Temple.;
There's dark Jedi inside the Temple? How did they get in there?;
The last time you and Malak entered the Temple you must have found the controls to raise and lower the shields. Those inside can lower the barrier to allow other Force users to enter and exit the Temple.;
But they will not be able to prevent us from using the ritual to gain you access. Once inside, however, we can do nothing to help you.;
Go to the Temple now. We will meet you there once the ritual has been prepared. Remember: in accordance with ancient Rakata tradition you must enter the Temple alone.;
I can deal with them.;
I want to ask you some questions.;
We will tell you what we can, Revan.;
I have questions about you: your tribe, your history, the Temple.;
You should speak to Osraa, the Keeper of History. He is located near the great computer on the far side of our enclave. But I will do my best to answer your questions.;
Tell me about your tribe.;
We are the Elders. Our ancestors were the priests of the Infinite Empire, the guardians of the Temple and the keepers of technology.;
After the Warlords unleashed their weapons of mass destruction and devastated the world, our ancestors knew we could never allow such techonolgy to be used again.;
We sealed the knowledge of destruction within the Temple, and for the past thousand generations we have kept vigil here, ensuring the knowledge does not fall into the wrong hands.;
If you wish to know more about this you should speak to Osraa, the Keeper of History.;
I have more questions about your history.;
I want to ask you about something else.;
I'll be back when I'm ready to enter the Temple.;
As you wish. Come speak to us when you are ready to enter the Temple and we will lower the shield for you.;
But remember: when the time comes you must enter the Temple alone, in accordance with the traditions of the ancient Rakata.;
I'll be back after I rescue that prisoner!;
The prisoner is being held in the chamber of the One himself. Return to us once he is free. Until then you have free run of our enclave.;
I want to learn more about the history of the Rakata Empire.;
Our history is a long one, but it is also one filled with bloodshed and sorrow. Once the Rakata ruled all the known galaxy, but our Empire was destroyed by our own corruption.;
What do you know about the other Rakata here?;
There is only one other group of Rakata on this island, the tribe of the One. They would slaughter us if they could, hoping to unlock the secrets hidden away in the Temple.;
Have you tried reasoning with the One?;
When the One first arrived on this island, we sent emissaries under a flag of truce to try and negotiate with his tribe. But all our envoys were brutally slaughtered.;
We do have the technology to destroy the One and his followers. But if we kill them all, then we will only prove that we have learned nothing over the past 20,000 years.;
"The One is mad with power. We choose not to fight him, so our only course of action is to stay here in isolation where we are safe; just as we have done for the past 20,000 years.";
But don't you have the technology to destroy the One?;
We have the technology to destroy the One and his followers. But if we kill them all, then we will only prove that we have learned nothing over the past 20,000 years.;
We tried to negotiate with them. We went emissaries under a flag or truce when the One first arrived on this island. But all our envoys were brutally slaughtered.;
What do you know about the Temple of the Ancients?;
The Temple is a sacred place, but also a place of great danger. Within its walls the terrible secrets of our ancestors have been locked away.;
We ourselves can no longer enter the Temple, Revan. We do not have the power of the Force. But you can enter, with our help.;
Can you tell me about the Star Forge?;
The Star Forge is a blight upon our world, an orbiting symbol of the failures and horrors of our past. We have long searched for a way to destroy it, and now you finally have given us that chance.;
Do you know where I can find parts to repair my ship?;
You might find these things in the camp of the One, back towards the beach where you first landed. But if you go there, the Rakata will surely attack you.;
It would be much safer to try and salvage the parts you need from any of the wrecks scattered across the island.;
Do you know how to disable the disruptor field that caused my ship to crash?;
"The disruptor field is one of the ancient defenses of the Star Forge; a great generator within the Temple of the Ancients fuels it. You will have to enter the Temple to disable it.";
Actually, I've decided I'm just going to kill you all!;
Guards! Guards! We are under attack!;
Forget it! I'll find my own way into the Temple.;
You have the power to enter the Temple itself, but you cannot lower the energy shields around it. Only the Rakata can invoke the ritual chant with the proper intonation.;
Okay, when I'm ready I'll go into the Temple alone.;
I'll find some other way to enter the Temple!;
You can try to enter the Temple without our help, but you will fail. When you are ready to see reason, return to us and we can begin the ritual.;
I'm not going into the Temple without help!;
[Persuade] The One wanted me to kill you, but I have come here peacefully.;
[Failure] Again, you are only repeating the patterns from before. You know we hold the secret of entering the Temple. That is why you do not attack us.;
You come in the guise of a friend, but how do we know you are not going to betray us again?;
[Persuade] I cannot prove what is in my heart. I only ask you judge me by my actions.;
"[Success] We sense you mean the words you speak. But words are easy to say; it is actions that prove the true nature of your character.";
You must prove to us that you are not the same as you once were, Revan. You must prove that you have changed.;
How can I prove that?;
Recently several of our scouts were captured by the One. Most of them were brutally slaughtered, but we have information that one of the scouts is still alive.;
They will use unimaginable tortures to force the scout to reveal everything he knows about our tribe. And once the One is done with him, the scout will be executed like the others.;
You must prove you have truly changed by risking your own life to save another. Rescue our scout from the clutches of the One, and we will consider helping you.;
Maybe I can negotiate with the One to release your hostage.;
We would prefer if you could find some way to save the prisoner without bloodshed, but we don't believe that will be possible. The One does not like to negotiate.;
So if I save the prisoner you'll help me?;
Risking your life to save the prisoner would show us that you are sincere about making amends for the past.;
Okay, I'll help you. But I have some questions.;
Enough of this - I am the Dark Lord reborn! Bow before me!;
At last you reveal your true self! Guards: destroy the evil in our midst!;
So you want me to go there and kill the One?;
Forget it!;
If you do not help us, Revan, then we will not help you enter the Temple. You will be trapped on this world forever.;
I see this is going nowhere. I'll just kill you instead!;
[Persuade] The part of me that was Revan is dead. Now I am <FullName>.;
[Persuade/Lie] I regret the mistakes of my past. I want to make amends.;
Thanks for the information. Looks like I don't need you anymore.;
There you are wrong, Revan. Without our help, you will never be able to enter the Temple of the Ancients. You will be trapped on this world forever.;
You need us to get past the barrier that protects the Temple's exterior. Only the Rakata can perform the ritual to lower the shields. But we are not so sure we want to help you.;
I want to know more about you, specifically.;
Tell me about the last time I was here.;
[Persuade] You can trust me. But I have some questions for you.;
[Success] If what you say is true - that you cannot remember when you were last here - then you must have many questions. Ask what you will, Revan, and we will try to help you understand.;
[Persuade/Lie] You can trust me. But first I have some questions.;
I'm sorry, but I don't remember any of this.;
I'm not Revan anymore. That part of me is gone. I'm <FullName> now.;
Betrayed you? I don't even know you!;
You have returned, Revan. Are you ready to enter the Temple now?;
Yes, Revan. Is there something you need?;
Revan, you are back. Our scout has told us of how you rescued him. His injuries are severe, but we believe he will survive. We are grateful for what you have done.;
So now you will help me?;
Risking your own life to save our scout seems to prove that you have changed significantly since the last time you were here, Revan. But you have deceived us before.;
I've done my part. Now you have to honor our agreement.;
You are back, Revan. When you refused to enter the Temple alone we feared you had betrayed us again. We did not expect you to return.;
Did you find what you were looking for inside the Temple? Did you discover the secrets to destroy the Star Forge?;
Not exactly. I have to go to the Star Forge to stop Malak.;
Then we wish you luck, Revan. For far too long we have kept ourselves hidden away on this lonely world, hoping to keep the Star Forge from unleashing its evil upon the rest of the galaxy.;
Perhaps... perhaps once the Star Forge is destroyed it will be time for us to leave this world, to rejoin the galaxy we have isolated ourselves from for so long.;
You fools - I would never destroy the Star Forge!;
You... you mean you have betrayed us, again? For a thousand generations we have guarded the secrets within the Temple: we cannot allow you to unleash them on the galaxy!;
Guards, destroy Revan! Do not let the traitor escape!;
[Lie] Yes, I'm sure they'll welcome you with open arms.;
You must go now, Revan. The Star Forge feeds the power of your old apprentice. If you do not stop him soon he will become too powerful for even you to stop.;
I'm sure the galaxy will welcome you with open arms.;
Maybe, but we should discuss this only after Malak is stopped.;
"You are right, of course. This is not something to be rushed into; not while the Star Forge still exists.";
[Lie] Yes. I'm going there now to destroy it and Malak.;
Hurry, Revan. The Star Forge must be destroyed.;
First I have to slaughter all of you!;
Hurry, Revan. The Star Forge must be destroyed, Malak must be stopped. You cannot afford to waste time here with us.;
[This Sand People warrior ignores you. It seems your presence here is a barely tolerated event.];
Please... don't hurt me! I'm just a simple merchant. I... I don't want anything to do with you Sith. Please, just leave me alone.;NM02ABMERC15000_.mp3
I hear there's a gang war between the Hidden Beks and the Black Vulkars raging in the lower city.;NM02ABMERC15002_.mp3

I don't know why you're still here. Why don't you just follow him wherever he went? You and I have no business at all.;NM35AADUST01002_.mp3

I have a datapad I want you to look at. You knew someone named Selene?;NM35AADUST01006_.mp3
Selene? She's the one who convinced me to come to the academy with her. Why? Where did you get this?;NM35AADUST01008_.mp3
Look at it. It belongs to Master Uthar, doesn't it?;NM35AADUST01010_.mp3
Yes... it's his. But... he told me... he, he said that she'd been lost on a mission in the valley. This... this says that they...;NM35AADUST01012_.mp3
Killed her because she was hindering your progress. Superiority at any cost, Dustil. There's your evil. Or can you live with that?;NM35AADUST01014_.mp3
No. No, I can't. I... I had no idea... they lied to me.;NM35AADUST01016_.mp3
Well, there's the son I remember. Now will you leave here?;NM35AADUST01018_.mp3
I... no. You go do whatever you have to, father. I... I have some other friends here. I have to warn them what's going on.;NM35AADUST01020_.mp3
And maybe I can, you know, look around here and find out some more information. From the inside. Something that might help you.;NM35AADUST01022_.mp3
I... don't suppose there's any way I could talk you out of that, is there? I mean, you're not going to do anything half way. Sounds familiar.;NM35AADUST01024_.mp3
I... guess it does.;NM35AADUST01162_.mp3
I'm proud of you, Dustil. You aren't hanging onto a lie after you see it for what it is. Not everyone could do that.;NM35AADUST01163_.mp3
Maybe... after this is over, we can... talk. I'm still not sure about... us, but I'll listen. Maybe we can get back to where we should have been.;NM35AADUST01026_.mp3
I'd like that.;NM35AADUST01028_.mp3
I'll go back to Telos when this is over. You can find me there. Goodbye... father.;NM35AADUST01164_.mp3
Goodbye, son. Good luck.;NM35AADUST01165_.mp3
I don't have anything. Yet. But I haven't given up on you, Dustil.;NM35AADUST01030_.mp3
Yeah, well, that's a surprise. I gave up on you a long time ago. So did Mother, for that fact.;NM35AADUST01032_.mp3
Please... don't say that...;NM35AADUST01034_.mp3
Whatever. Just go if you're going. I have things to do.;NM35AADUST01036_.mp3
You take a wrong turn somewhere?;NM35AADUST01038_.mp3
Who are you?;
The name's Dustil. That satisfy your curiosity enough?;NM35AADUST01040_.mp3
Dustil? As in Dustil Onasi?;
So you know my last name, so what?;NM35AADUST01042_.mp3
Aren't you Carth Onasi's son?;
No, I'm not. I don't know who you're talking about.;NM35AADUST01044_.mp3
Are you sure...?;
Look... I don't want to hear that name ever again. Ever. You understanding me? Now get lost.;NM35AADUST01046_.mp3
How did you end up at the academy?;
What is with the questions? My life is none of your business, so get lost.;NM35AADUST01049_.mp3
I have to go.;
Well, don't let me keep you.;NM35AADUST01058_.mp3
Can I ask you some questions?;
As if I'm not busy enough with my own work? Go pester someone else with your stupid questions.;NM35AADUST01051_.mp3
There's no need to act like that.;
Oh, I'm sorry, did I hurt your feelings? Why don't you run to Master Uthar and tell him all about it. I'm sure he'll be very sympathetic.;NM35AADUST01053_.mp3
You want to make an issue out of it?;
You know what I want? I want for you to run along and do whatever it is you're supposed to be doing. I'm too busy to deal with morons.;NM35AADUST01055_.mp3
Please, you have to help me! Nobody else is going to help me. Even the Beks won't help me. But I can't just leave him there - he's my friend! You'll help me, won't you?;NM04AAMISS10000_.mp3
Whoa, slow down, Mission. What's wrong?;
It's Zaalbar. He's in trouble - big trouble! We have to help him. If we don't they'll sell him into slavery!;NM04AAMISS10002_.mp3
Calm down, Mission. Take a deep breath and tell me what happened.;
Me... me and Zaalbar were just wandering around here in the Undercity. You know, looking for stuff we could find, just kind of exploring. We do it all the time.;NM04AAMISS10004_.mp3
I guess with a Wookiee at your side you've got to figure you can handle the odd rakghoul attack.;NM04AAMISS10038_.mp3
Only this time they were waiting for us. Gamorrean slave hunters. We didn't even have a chance to run. Big Z threw himself at them, and he roared for me to run!;NM04AAMISS10006_.mp3
"I... I took off; I figured Zaalbar would be right behind me. But there were too many of them - he couldn't get away. They're going to sell him to a slaver - I just know it!";NM04AAMISS10008_.mp3
Do you know where they took him?;
I don't know for sure, but those Gamorreans like to hang out in the sewers. The stink reminds them of home, I guess. That's probably where they took Big Z.;NM04AAMISS10010_.mp3
If I help you get Zaalbar back you have to get me inside the Vulkar base.;
It's a deal - as soon as we get Big Z back, I'll show you a way into that Vulkar base! Now, come on - We have to find Zaalbar before they sell him to slavers - or worse!;NM04AAMISS10024_.mp3
Do you know where he's being kept?;NM04AAMISS10026_.mp3
The Gamorreans make their camps in the sewers. I bet that's where we'll find Zaalbar - and that's where I'll show you the secret entrance into the Vulkar compound.;NM04AAMISS10028_.mp3
[MISSION has joined your party.] [Left-click this response to go to PARTY SELECTION screen.];
Wait here. I'll be back when I find Zaalbar.;
No way. I'm the one that got Zaalbar into this mess, so I'm coming with you. I'm not going to abandon him again!;NM04AAMISS10014_.mp3
Why don't you ask Gadon and the Beks to help you?;
I can't ask Gadon - he's always telling me not to go into the Undercity. He says it's too dangerous with the rakghouls and Gamorreans and all. He'll never send his Beks down there.;NM04AAMISS10031_.mp3
I don't have time for your Wookiee. I need to find a way into the Vulkar base.;
"Hold on a second. Don't just brush her off like this; Gadon said this girl's the only one who can get us inside the Bek base.";NM04AAMISS10039_.mp3
Pleeeze! There's nobody else who can help me! Listen - if you help me get Zaalbar back, I'll help you get inside the Vulkar base. Come on, what do you say?;NM04AAMISS10034_.mp3
No deal.;
How can you be so stubborn? When you're ready to help me with Zaalbar come on back - because you'll never get into that Vulkar base without my help!;NM04AAMISS10036_.mp3
Forget it, kid. You're on your own.;
You just ran off and left him? Some friend you are.;
I didn't mean to leave him! I thought he was right behind me - I'd never abandon Big Z on purpose! Please - help me get him back.;NM04AAMISS10012_.mp3
Zaalbar? You mean your Wookiee friend? What happened?;
Who's going to sell him into slavery? What are you talking about?;
I don't have time for this! Gadon said you'd help me get inside the Vulkar base.;
Listen, my friend Zaalbar is in serious trouble, so you can forget about me helping with anything else until I get him back!;NM04AAMISS10018_.mp3
Fine - tell me what happened and I'll see if I can help you.;
You're Mission Vao, right? Gadon Thek said you could help me.;
Gadon? What? I... I don't know what you're talking about. Please - Zaalbar's in trouble. He needs help or they're going to sell him into slavery!;NM04AAMISS10021_.mp3
You're back - does this mean you're going to help me now? Does this mean you're going to help me get Zaalbar back?;NM04AAMISS10022_.mp3
The Republic respects the peace of Ahto City, your honor. But the Sith are a violent people who leave violence in their wake. I have three soldiers in the infirmary!;NM26AAREPA11000_.mp3
If the Republic soldiers were more capable, they would not have suffered such serious injuries. Are my soldiers to be punished simply because they won a fair fight?;NM26AAREPA11002_.mp3
I hardly call six against three a fair fight! The Sith are cowards who attack only when they have the advantage of numbers!;NM26AAREPA11004_.mp3
I am aware of the Republic's indignation. However, witness reports clearly state your Republic soldiers were as willing to engage in violence as the Sith in this case.;
They were provoked, your honor! The Sith goaded them into this fight!;NM26AAREPA11008_.mp3
Taunts and threats are not sufficient provocation in the eyes of this court. Words can be ignored - which is what your men should have done.;
I find both the Republic and the Sith to be equally at fault for this breach of the peace.;
I should throw all parties involved into the Ahto City jail. But since no Selkath were harmed in this conflict I will show mercy and levy a fine of ten thousand credits to both sides.;
The court is dismissed, though I warn you that further disturbances will not be viewed with such leniency.;
Why can't the Selkath see what the Sith are really like? They should ban them all from this planet.;NM26AAREPA11018_.mp3
If it weren't for the Republic, Manaan would already be under Sith control. But we haven't had one word of thanks from the Selkath!;NM26AAREPA11020_.mp3
I'm sick of hearing about Manaan's neutrality! It sounds like a coward's excuse not to fight, if you ask me!;NM26AAREPA11022_.mp3
I'm just here on one of Czerka's transports. I don't have no business with you.;NM33AAFREI08000_.mp3
There isn't much to do in Dreshdae except have a drink until your ship's ready to go.;NM33AAFREI08002_.mp3
Most of the merchants head over to Czerka's headquarters if they want to do some trading.;NM33AAFREI08004_.mp3
Don't go near that Sith place. They won't let you in, and them Sith will probably shoot you before they look at you.;NM33AAFREI08006_.mp3
Those Sith are about. Probably even watching us in here. Don't bet they ain't.;NM33AAFREI08008_.mp3
I have been informed by my protocol droid that you wish to speak to me.;NM16AANURI01000_.mp3
Your son Casus is dead. I have seen his body.;
Casus... is dead? I was afraid of this, yet in my heart I knew it must be true. What... what happened to my son?;NM16AANURI01027_.mp3
He was killed by kath hounds while exploring the Dantooine ruins.;
Kath hounds? I... I was so certain the Matale family was to blame... But this changes nothing! My own son is dead - why should I shed one tear about the disappearance of my bitter enemy's son?;NM16AANURI01029_.mp3
Typical. Anything to continue the feud which has become so customary to you people.;NM16AANURI01031_.mp3
I must ask you something, though it is difficult for me. My son had a diary. His private, personal thoughts. Now that he is gone, I have nothing else to remember him by.;NM16AANURI01033_.mp3
Please, the diary means more to me than it ever could to you. I will give you a hundred credits for its return.;NM16AANURI01035_.mp3
Here is the diary, Nurik, but you may keep your money. I need no reward for this task.;
Mighty generous of you. A little too generous, if you ask me.;NGLOBECAND03477_.mp3
I thank you for this. The diary is all I have left of my son.;NM16AANURI01049_.mp3
We have nothing further to discuss. Please, leave me to my grief.;NM16AANURI01051_.mp3
You are here from the Council, are you not? Looking for Shen Matale?;NM16AARAHA02000_.mp3
Who are you?;
My name is Rahasia - Nurik is my father. He has not been himself since Casus disappeared. He is mad with grief, and he is convinced the Matales are responsible. He is not thinking rationally.;NM16AARAHA02002_.mp3
Does this have anything to do with what happened to Shen?;
My father is a good man. When my mother died, he raised me and my brother by himself. He loves his children, and we love him. I just don't want you to judge him too harshly.;NM16AARAHA02004_.mp3
I only want to find Shen Matale.;
You must understand that Father has been under a terrible strain. I have no wish to disobey him, but there are matters where even my father's authority is not absolute.;NM16AARAHA02006_.mp3
Please, tell me what has happened.;
My father has kidnapped Shen Matale. He is holding him prisoner here in the compound. He feels this is a way to get back at the Matales, a way to get even for the disappearance of my brother Casus.;NM16AARAHA02008_.mp3
I see. Well there is the answer we seek. The Jedi Council should be informed of this at once.;NM16AARAHA02009_.mp3
You don't think that perhaps there's more to look at here, do you? That maybe everything isn't what it appears?;NM16AARAHA02010_.mp3
Of course not. It seems very simple to me. The Council must be allowed to decide the next step.;NM16AARAHA02011_.mp3
No! Since Casus went missing my father has become unstable, he might hurt him if you do that! He no longer even cares if the Matales are responsible for what happened to Casus.;NM16AARAHA02013_.mp3
I am afraid my father will simply kill Shen out of a mad, misguided lust for vengeance!;NM16AARAHA02015_.mp3
I must tell the Jedi Council at once!;
The Jedi Council does not have the authority to search our estate, and if Father finds out his secret has been revealed he might kill Shen right away.;NM16AARAHA02017_.mp3
Please, find Shen and rescue him before my father does something he will regret forever. I would take you to the prison, but I cannot let my father see me with you.;NM16AARAHA02050_.mp3
Take this key. It will open an unguarded door at the rear of the estate. You and Shen can make your escape through there.;NM16AARAHA02051_.mp3
There are many security droids guarding the halls. Please hurry... you are Shen's only hope.;NM16AARAHA02052_.mp3
What is the problem between your families?;
Ahlan Matale and my father have had problems ever since they settled on this world.;NM16AARAHA02054_.mp3
To hear my father tell it, Ahlan is a brute and a bully, but a rich one. He feels his credits give him the right to step all over normal people.;NM16AARAHA02055_.mp3
My father stands up to Ahlan because no one else will. But now he thinks Ahlan has taken my brother Casus, and has imprisoned Shen as revenge.;NM16AARAHA02056_.mp3
Please find Shen and free him! You are my only hope!;NM16AARAHA02057_.mp3
Why do you care about Shen?;
Shen and I... we... Well, we have been taught by our families to hate each other, just for being related to our fathers.;NM16AARAHA02059_.mp3
But I met Shen alone one day in the city, away from his father, and...;NM16AARAHA02060_.mp3
... and Shen was so charming, so sweet. He didn't care at all that I was a Sandral, he just accepted me for who I was, with no reservations.;NM16AARAHA02061_.mp3
We talked and met again over months and fell in love. My brother Casus met him too and they were beginning to become friends, but then this whole mess had to happen...;NM16AARAHA02062_.mp3
I will go now.;
This isn't my problem.;
Why are you telling me all this?;
Shen is an innocent victim in all this. My father is not a bad man, but his grief has driven him to madness. He must be stopped.;NM16AARAHA02020_.mp3
What happened to Casus?;
I do not know. I am worried for him, truly, but I do not believe Ahlan Matale had anything to do with it... and now my father may take it out on Shen...;NM16AARAHA02022_.mp3
We should inform the Jedi Council of this crime.;NM16AARAHA02012_.mp3
Since Casus went missing my father has become unstable. He no longer even cares if the Matales are responsible for what happened to Casus.;NM16AARAHA02014_.mp3
Quit stalling and get to the point!;
Judge him? What has your father done?;
Tell me what's going on here!;
I don't have time to listen to this.;
I... I thought you would listen to me. I thought the Jedi were compassionate and kind! I shouldn't have spoken to you at all - I've just made everything worse!;NM16AARAHA02034_.mp3
The Council would not approve of your actions here. Perhaps we should find this girl and try to help her.;NM16AARAHA02035_.mp3
There could be a lot of money for finding Shen Matale. I think that girl knows something about him going missing.;NM16AARAHA02037_.mp3
Yeah, that's the way to go about it. Make things worse for these people, why don't you?;NM16AARAHA02036_.mp3
Casus disappeared?;
Yes. Casus was my brother. He was working on archeological digs here on Dantooine when he disappeared. My father blamed Ahlan Matale... and his son...;NM16AARAHA02028_.mp3
Casus was killed by kath hounds. The Matales had nothing to do with it!;
Casus is dead? It is as I feared, though I am relieved the Matales are not responsible.;NM16AARAHA02030_.mp3
Do you know something about Shen's disappearance?;
I just came to tell your Nurik about his son Casus.;
What I do is my own business, so back off!;
Here is the diary.;
[Persuade] Make it two hundred and you have a deal.;
[Success] I did not realize the Jedi were such cold hearted monsters. Very well, you shall have your two hundred credits. Here!;NM16AANURI01039_.mp3
This man just lost his son! I can't believe you're trying to squeeze extra credits out of him.;NM16AANURI01058_.mp3
Your actions show you are overly focused on material wealth. This is not the way of the Jedi. You will have to learn to let go of your greed if you wish to walk in the light.;NM16AANURI01044_.mp3
[Failure] You think you can exploit a father's grief? I loved my son, but I am no fool! You shall get nothing from me! May the curse that brought Casus to his death be on your head as well!;NM16AANURI01042_.mp3
I shall go and find the diary for you, Nurik. But I need no reward for this;
I shall go and find the diary for you, Nurik.;
Casus is a kath hound chew toy.;
Are all Jedi so callous towards those who grieve? No matter. Your cruel words hurt me no more than the news itself.;NM16AANURI01054_.mp3
I want to ask you about the disappearance of Shen Matale.;
I feel great sorrow at the young Matale heir's disappearance, but they are not the only family to suffer such a tragedy. Dantooine is a dangerous place.;NM16AANURI01002_.mp3
My own son Casus has been missing for some time now. But I know nothing about the disappearance of Shen. Perhaps he and Casus now share a similar fate.;NM16AANURI01004_.mp3
The Jedi Council has instructed me to investigate this matter. May I search your estate?;
I brought my family here to find peace and safety - not to be harassed and treated like common criminals! Your Council has no authority here, and I respectfully ask you to leave this property at once.;NM16AANURI01006_.mp3
This guy isn't telling us something... he might even be lying. I don't trust him.;NM16AANURI01008_.mp3
For once I will have to agree with the Mandalorian...;NM16AANURI01010_.mp3
I trust you will show yourself out. If not, my security droids will be sure to deal with you.;NM16AANURI01022_.mp3
Jedi are renowned for their fairness and pursuit of justice. There is nothing to fear from us... unless you have something to hide.;NM16AANURI01012_.mp3
That's quite a line. You actually believe that? Don't you think someone is allowed to value privacy?;NM16AANURI01014_.mp3
Privacy is all well and good, but justice must be valued higher. Is it not obvious to you that this man hides something?;NM16AANURI01016_.mp3
Actually, it is. All I'm saying is that not everybody welcomes the sight of a Jedi with open arms. Better get used to it.;NM16AANURI01018_.mp3
I've seen an evasion or two in my time... enough to know when I hear it.;NM16AANURI01020_.mp3
I know nothing about Shen! Please, just tell me what you know about my son!;NM16AANURI01024_.mp3
I am here on behalf of the Jedi Council. I am investigating the disappearance of Shen Matale.;
I have been informed by my protocol droid that you have news about my son Casus.;NM16AANURI01056_.mp3
You did it - you got the top time! You just beat racers who've been doing this for twenty years! This is amazing!;
Someone who's never ridden a swoop before today comes in here and... wait a minute. I don't believe this - look at the board!;
One of the Beks just beat your time! Who... ah, it was Anglu. I should have known.;
That's okay, the day ain't over yet and the accelerator's still holding together. You just have to get out there again and show them how it's done.;
One of the Vulkars just beat your time! Who... ah, it was Redros. I should have known.;
You did it! You did it! In twenty years I've never seen anybody handle a swoop like that before! Nobody's going to beat that time - nobody!;
I guess Kandon knew what he was doing he picked you to ride for us. Now the only thing is to wait for the time to become official and go collect your prize.;
I guess Gadon knew what he was doing he picked you to ride for us. Now the only thing is to wait for the time to become official and go collect your prize.;
Okay, not too bad for your first ever race. You didn't get the time you needed, but for a rookie you did pretty well.;
That prototype accelerator held up okay, too. It's running a little hot, but nothing to worry about. Not yet, anyway.;
Now that you've got a race under your belt you should be able to blow the field away. Good luck... we're counting on you.;
Good run, good run. You didn't post the top time, but that's okay. I checked out your swoop and you should be okay for a few more runs at least.;
Remember, avoid the obstacles, hit the accelerator plates on the track and switch gears when the engine revs get high.;
Don't worry... you'll get that top time yet! I know you won't let us down. Now get back out on that track and shows these punks how to ride!;
I really thought that last race was going to be the one, but looks like you'll have to go out again. But you better get the job done soon... that accelerator isn't doing too well.;
It's still running with full power, but it's running way too hot for my liking. I've tried to rig up a cooling system to hold it together for another run or two. Beyond that though...;
I'm not trying to put any extra pressure on you, but my gang's got a lot riding on this race. So bear down, focus and go get that time we need!;
I see you struggling out there and it isn't pretty, but don't you worry. I've got a trick or two up my sleeve. You're in good hands with me.;
I made a few modifications to that accelerator. I rerouted the power from the cooling system to give an extra boost to your swoop's speed.;
But cranking the speed made the accelerator even more unstable than it used to be. In other words, you're either going to win this race or go out in a blaze of flaming glory.;
I don't want to die out on the track!;
Look, we're running out of time. That accelerator's one step away from being scrap metal. You've got to take some risks if you want to collect the champion's prize!;
Don't worry... I'll win this thing!;
That's what I like to hear! Just remember, this is your last chance. That accelerator won't hold together for another race.... we'll be lucky if it doesn't explode in this one!;
But don't you go worrying about that. You just stay focused on that finish line. Good luck... we're counting on you.;
Forget it... I'm not racing anymore.;
I don't think you'll back out now. Word is you've got an unhealthy interest in that female Republic officer Brejik's offering as a prize.;
The only way you'll get her is if you put up the best time. So quit sulking and start racing like you mean it!;
So you're the one who's going to ride this swoop bike, eh? Don't worry - I've been working on the accelerator and stability won't be a problem. I hope.;
Kandon mentioned that you've never done this before. You want me to run over the basics of handling a swoop bike for you?;
Sure, tell me how it's done.;
It's pretty simple, really. First, try not to crash into anything. There's debris and obstacles scattered all over the course, so watch out.;
All swoops are equipped with dynamic deflector systems, so hitting an obstacle won't cause you to crash. But it will shake you up a bit and slow you down.;
The track also has accelerator panels built into its surface. If you fly over one it'll give your swoop a boost of speed, so try to hit 'em when you see 'em.;
When the engine starts running hot you'll get a warning and you'll have to switch gears. Other than that just try to hang on. You'll be fine.;
Okay, let's start the race!;
Hold on... I better explain the rules to you. Each rider goes out on the track alone. At the end of the day, whoever posted the fastest time is the winner.;
Normally a rider can run as many heats as they want, but I don't know how long the prototype accelerator on your swoop will hold up. No more than four or five races, I'd guess.;
So make your runs count. Remember, the Vulkars are counting on you. If we win this race half of Gadon's crew will join us and the Beks will be finished!;
I won't let you down.;
Sounds like you're ready. Go talk to the race announcer over by the counter. He'll give you the time to beat and get you out on the course.;
I'll be waiting for you here after the run so I can make any tweaks or repairs to your swoop in case you want to go out for another heat.;
Good luck. And don't worry about the prototype overheating and exploding while you're out on the track. That *probably* won't happen.;
How do we get the race started?;
So make your runs count. Gadon's put his trust in you... we need to win this race or Brejik's Vulkars will get a whole bunch of new recruits. If that happens we're finished.;
Could you go over that again?;
Forget it. Let's just get to the racing!;
Gadon mentioned that you've never done this before. You want me to run over the basics of handling a swoop bike for you?;
What are you doing back here? You need to speak to the race announcer and get out on the track. The longer you wait the worse your nerves are going to get.;
Nerves? I'm not scared!;
Good to hear. Go talk to the race announcer and he'll get you out on the track.;
Can you explain how the swoop bike works again?;
Sure, no problem. Avoid the obstacles on the track by veering your swoop left or right. Any rocks or debris you hit will slow you down.;
Every time your swoop passes over one of the accelerator pads you'll get a boost of speed, so try to hit them. And remember to switch gears when you see your engine revs climbing.;
Okay, I'm ready to ride now.;
Can you explain that one more time?;
[This Sand People warrior ignores you. It seems your presence here is a barely tolerated event.];
[Your disguise fails at short range. The warrior attacks!];
I will not speak with you, outsider. You are not worthy.;
Chuundar has grown comfortable dealing with you outsiders. I have not.;
Chuundar allows you to be here, outsider. You would be dead if he didn't.;
First there was one outsider, then many, and now you walk our village! It's too much!;
Freyyr will not let us fall to slavers. He would rather die.;
It is right that Chuundar died. He was tainted by outsider greed.;
Kashyyyk will rise to repel the slaver threat. Freyyr will see to it.;
Freyyr will not let slavers take us. Of that, I am certain.;
Rorworr is the latest of us to go missing. I hope your outsider slavers lost many men trying to cage him.;
Rorworr was mentor to some of our most promising children. We need his spirit in these dark times.;
Rorworr has not returned to the village. If you took him, outsider, you will pay dearly.;
Do you miss your kin when they are taken from you, outsider? I doubt you feel the same as we do.;
I do not like that you have seen us at our worst. Jaarak has lost his honor to an outsider.;
Jaarak has shamed us. To strike down one of our own... he showed the gall of an outsider.;
Your actions are unexpected. Very few outsiders have shown mercy during their stay here.;
Rorworr has shamed us when we needed strength. His death will serve as a lesson in the importance of honor.;
I long for the Kashyyyk of old. We had no need of footpaths for outsiders like you.;
Look, lady - we Sith aren't here to make friends. So let me enjoy my drink in peace.;NM26AADUAN01000_.mp3
You're new around here, aren't you. My name's Duan. Care to buy a Sith girl a drink? That is, unless you're one of those simpering Republic soldiers.;NM26AADUAN01001_.mp3
I'm <FullName>. I'm just here to check out the swoop races.;
Some of the other soldiers like to go and bet on the swoops on their days off, but this planet is bad enough without mingling with the locals.;NM26AADUAN01003_.mp3
It isn't easy here, you know. Not with all the Republic soldiers walking the streets while we sit and do nothing. Malak should send a fleet in and conquer this whole sector, kolto or no!;NM26AADUAN01009_.mp3
But I don't really want to talk about that right now. I'm just here to have a couple drinks and try to unwind, you know?;NM26AADUAN01010_.mp3
I'm searching for some ancient ruins, or maybe a long forgotten Star Map.;
You some kind of historian, or something? You should forget about the past and look towards the future. That's why I joined the Sith - the Republic is old news. And then I get stuck on Manaan, the worst post in the galaxy!;NM26AADUAN01008_.mp3
I'm investigating the recent murder of Elassa.;
What is there to investigate? Obviously Sunry is guilty. But the Republic is doing everything they can to keep him out of a Selkath prison.;NM26AADUAN01038_.mp3
I hear you Sith are taking an interest in the Selkath youth.;
We Sith are interested in a lot of things. If you're smart you'll stay out of Sith business.;NM26AADUAN01040_.mp3
I'll be going now.;
Oh... I get it. I get a little bit wild, and you want to hold it against me.;NM26AADUAN01042_.mp3
Come on, what's the matter? Afraid I'll drink you under the table? Hey, if you're not man enough to keep up, who needs you?;NM26AADUAN01043_.mp3
Seems I'm not lady like enough for some men... well, I may be a woman, but I'm still a soldier! Barkeep, bring me another round!;NM26AADUAN01044_.mp3
I don't have much use for the Republic.;
I couldn't agree with you more. Just the sight of a Republic uniform makes me want to vomit. I can't wait until we crush them all like the pathetic vermin they are!;NM26AADUAN01005_.mp3
Sorry - I tend to get a little worked up. I think I've been stationed on Manaan too long. This place can make you crazy.;NM26AADUAN01006_.mp3
Oh, it's you again. I didn't think I'd see you around here.;NM26AADUAN01065_.mp3
I probably should cut back on the drinking, but it's a good way to relax. There's a lot of tension here on Manaan.;NM26AADUAN01066_.mp3
Greetings, Revan, I am Gjarshi, the loremaster of our tribe.;
I am the keeper of our histories and chronicler of the conquests of the One.;
I am not Revan any more! I am <FullName>!;
Your life has been defined by your identity Revan, your fate. If you no longer wish me to call you this, then I shall not, but you cannot change who you are.;
A person decides their own fate!;
As you will. I know better than to argue with you when you have set your mind to something.;
Do you not hate me for leaving your people before?;
It does not matter to me what path you choose. History flows in mysterious ways and my task is only to witness and remember which course it takes.;
Your actions then, as now, are memories to be passed on to future generations. When you are dead and gone, your memory shall remain with us.;
Can you tell me of the history of your people?;
What of our people would you like to know?;
Tell me how your people came to be.;
In the times before our most ancient histories, there was nothing you could call the Rakatan people. There were unintelligent proto-Rakata wandering the surface of this world.;
Spawned from the womb of this world, they were gifted with the brilliance of thought, but not tempered with the wisdom to use it.;
When the gods of the sky first spoke to them, the ground shook and heaved, and fires raced across the surface of the world. They fled beneath the ground to escape the calamity and dwelled there for some time.;
At last the gods spoke to them in dreams... dreams of the surface and the light. They re-emerged from the ground and found the land much changed around them.;
Gone were the plains and valleys they had known. Instead, there were islands stretching across the breadth of the world. The world had been remade for them by the gods of the sky, and they gave thanks in fear and gratitude.;
Tell me of the gods you mentioned.;
The world is ruled by the gods of the earth and sky, both living and dead.;
When the sky gods remade the world, the gods of the earth, who had sheltered and protected the Rakata, were gone. Whether dead of asleep, they have not been heard from again.;
Nor do the gods in the sky listen to our pleas any longer, although we can still see their lights gleam in the heavens.;
So we mortal Rakata are left here to our own devices... to make the future we demand for ourselves.;
Tell me of your first civilizations.;
Back in the days of the first awakening, when our people rose from the ground and brought the light of civilization to our new world, our people spread far and wide across all the islands.;
Among these peoples, there were some that rose to greatness on the largest islands. Rakatans of vision and forethought who built great monuments to themselves and their leaders.;
But these cultures did not know their true strengths. They did not draw upon the knowledge of their past to feed their present.;
Of course these cultures, with their centers of learning and their great temples, collapsed in riots and chaos, burning their cultures from the world in an orgy of violence.;
It was a thousand years of darkness before the light of First Empire rose upon the blood of the past.;
Tell me of the First Empire.;
With the first civilizations of our people destroyed, and chaos and anarchy sweeping the islands, it seemed that a time of darkness had descended upon us that would never end.;
But a strong nation of survivors yet endured. On one of the smaller islands near the equatorial regions, they had not forgotten the oldest traditions, those learned from the gods of the earth while we dwelt beneath the surface.;
Taking the knowledge of their elders and passing their wisdom and skills on to the next generation by eating their flesh, they built a culture unrivalled throughout history. Greater, even, than your vaunted 'Republic'.;
For millennia this empire stood, uniting the many islands of our world into one cohesive whole. Each generation passing its strength on to the one that followed.;
But... fate was unkind to these great Rakata, these first ones of our kind to rise above savagery and create a true, lasting civilization.;
Tell me what happened to the First Empire.;
Our skin had been hardened and turned black from the time our people spent beneath the surface, but always at the fringes of society there were rumors... rumors of those of others colors who survived above the surface while we dwelt below.;
We can pinpoint no direct cause for the collapse of the First Empire, but it was swift and total. What had taken centuries to build and was maintained for thousands of years disappeared within ten, perhaps twenty, years.;
From the ancient cities we have examined, there was much fighting and death, as well as fires that burned bright and hot enough to melt the stones of their palaces to glass.;
Also, in scattered fragments and records, we have heard of a people being found... a people unlike the Rakata but taking our form, who waged a monumental war that tore civilization apart.;
What this war was, or who those beings were we do not know, but they are the demons of our legends now. We believe them to be gone, wiped out in that vast conflagration, but we cannot know for sure...;
What happened after the collapse of the First Empire?;
Our civilization lapsed back into savagery. We were no longer the great people of centuries past.;
Brother turned on brother, tribesman on tribesman, until all fought and sought to destroy each other.;
The legacy of the final war and the collapse that came after it still echo with us today. We are still a fractured people. Many tribes dwell on these islands, warring with each other constantly.;
Each seeks to grow its own strength, absorbing that of its enemies through their flesh cut down in battle, but none has been strong enough to exert their influence over more than a handful of islands. Until now that is...;
We now are in the midst of a great war of reformation, of reclamation.;
Tell me of the war of reformation.;
Before none were strong enough to bind together the tribes and unite them towards a common goal, but that changed. Now we do have a leader, and under him, we have swept across the islands, conquering all who have stood before us.;
This leader... is it the One?;
Over the last 20 years we have conquered over a hundred islands, both large and small. The One has led us to victory where none have before, further strengthening us with the blood of our enemies.;
We have subjugated many tribes as well, their warriors joining ours in our great crusade.;
But recently, things have not gone so well...;
More and more outsiders fall from the sky and kill our people. More and more tribes resist us, or even rebel!;
It has taken a great part of our strength to resist, but under the One, we shall prevail! Nothing shall stop him from forming the Second Empire!;
What is the One doing here, then?;
We... we heard of the temple on this island... the Temple of the Ancients. A building the like of which has not been seen anywhere else. A place of great power it was reputed, with great guardians as well.;
The One came here with an army to see this temple and seize it for our cause, but we were met with strange and powerful magics which have defeated us at every turn.;
So now the One sits here and broods on his troubles, listening only to the messengers who bear his orders to all corners of his territory.;
If only the riddle of the temple could be solved, and its guardian Elders removed, then he would consume their flesh and knowledge and bring unity to our people.;
It is my sincere hope as well, that you can help us with our great task.;
Tell me of the One.;
The great story of the One would take many days to tell in its entirety. It is my specialty, of course.;
What would you like to know of his great story?;
Tell me how he was raised.;
Born to poverty, raised in a hovel with no elders to guide him and share their strength with him, he had nothing to rely on but himself.;
But in his weakness, he was uniquely destined for strength and the burdens it carries with it.;
Even in his youth, it was obvious that the One was destined for greatness. When but a youngling, he defeated one of the strange blue-armored warriors who fall from the sky and feasted upon him.;
The respect from his battle gave him the step he needed to go forward on a path that has led him ever upward since.;
Tell me of how he came to power.;
By adulthood, the One was held in awe by those of his tribe as both a warrior and a leader. When he challenged the chieftain of his tribe, no one doubted that he would prevail.;
The chieftain could see and, knowing that the One would bring the tribe into greatness, offered himself up without a fight. The tribe fed well and was stronger for his sacrifice.;
Under the leadership of the One, his tribe conquered all others on the island, capturing and subduing their warriors, feasting on their chieftains, and growing his own army at the same time.;
He was truly a force that could not be stopped, a leader unlike any we have seen in our history. He will be the one to unite us all!;
Tell me of his conquests.;
After he had conquered his own island, and his army had grown to a large size, he turned his eyes towards the nearest other islands in the archipelago.;
With each island that fell to him, his army grew stronger, his wisdom greater with each chief given up to him, and his vision of a future for our people brighter.;
Before long he had conquered every island in a month's sailing and had armies expanding in every direction. It seemed that nothing would stand against him then.;
But we heard of the Temple of the Ancients here, on this forgotten island at the edge of the True Sea, and the One was intrigued. It was a place of power, to be sure, and none could doubt its significance.;
Driven by portents and omens, we came to this island with a thousand of his finest warriors... and here we stay...;
We cannot leave while the Temple stands unopened, but we cannot enter while the Elders stand against us... and the One sits each day brooding on the fate that has led us to this impasse.;
I'd like to know something else.;
I must go now.;
If you must. I shall remain here as I always do, listening to those who wish to speak... and remembering.;
How many islands have you conquered?;
How long has this war been waged?;
You are a loremaster? What do you do? Memorize books?;
The position of loremaster is a sacred and respected one among our people. We are the keepers of history, the ones who pass down the traditions of our people.;
I am here to chronicle the conquests and achievements of the One. I have followed his exploits for many years... and yours as well.;
Mine?;
When last you came to this island, the One had just arrived with his army. We spoke then, as now, and you told me of your travels and stories about the worlds beyond ours.;
You spoke of the magical Force you wielded which gave you power over the elements.;
But then you left us and went back to the stars, never to be heard from again. We wondered what had happened, what could have gone wrong, but could do nothing against you, or the Elders.;
Tell me of the Elders.;
We know the Elders are Rakata like us, but different as well. They control strange powers and magics that we cannot understand.;
When we came to this island, drawn by the strange structure we call the Temple of the Ancients, we were expecting perhaps a few survivors... but not another race of Rakata.;
The One's troops captured a few of their scouts, but we could learn nothing intelligible from them. Attacks against their compound were fruitless and reaped terrible casualties.;
We came here with near a thousand warriors... and you can see now what we are reduced to...;
This is why the One thinks we need your help once again. You were able to enter the Elders' compound once before... perhaps you can again.;
You know nothing of me!;
You have returned from the Temple... as I knew you would. You shall have an honored place in our histories, Revan.;
The Rakata people shall always be indebted to you.;
Greetings once again. How may the loremaster of our tribe serve you now?;
Tell me the history of your people.;
What happened the last time I was here?;
You came to us shortly after we had arrived on this island, before we had yet constructed this settlement.;
You came to us after defeating our scouts who confronted you, much as you have again this time. The One saw your power... and your desire for the knowledge inside the Temple.;
We had not yet attacked the Elders' compound, but we knew of their presence... and the depths of their knowledge. We advised you that the answers you sought may lie with them.;
We made a pact, an agreement, that if we could breach their compound together and take their secrets, we would do all we could to help you enter the Temple as well.;
Then you found a way into the Elders' compound, and we never heard from you again...;
Tell me of the Temple of the Ancients.;
It is a large structure, the like of which we have seen on no other island anywhere. It's architecture resembles our own, but on a vastly greater scale.;
We believe that it may have been built in an age long past by our forebears, but none can understand it now. The Elders may hold the key to it, but they will not divulge it, and we cannot take it from them by force.;
The One believes that this Temple may bring him the power to unify the entire world beneath his banner.;
The nature of this power escapes me, but I cannot deny his vision. The barriers around it keep us from entering, the power of the Elders seems to draw upon it, and we can see strange objects rise from it into the sky regularly.;
Strange objects?;
Objects come and go from the far end of the temple frequently. We do not know what manner of thing they are, but we suspect they are like our boats... boats that ride on air.;
If we could make these boats our own, nothing would escape our grasp!;
How are you prevented from entering?;
There is a strong barrier of light guarding the front entrance to the Temple. We cannot breach this barrier. Our attempts to go around through other entrances have also met with failure.;
No one who has tried to enter the temple through other means, or travelled to the island at its far side has ever returned...;
How is the Elders' power similar?;
When we tried to assault the Elders' compound, we were met by defenses of caged lightning and beams of light that cut warriors in half just by touching them, or turned them into charred meat in an instant.;
Many warriors died there... their bodies forming a new wall for the Elders' defence...;
The Temple too, uses light, though this time as a shield to block us from entering... We believe they may be connected somehow.;
Do you know anything about other survivors?;
Other survivors? You mean others who have crashed onto this world as you have?;
Yes, there have been others... Others who wield powers like yours, whose weapons spit fire and light. They have killed many of our warriors and we hunt them down as we can.;
Perhaps there are some among them who would prove useful... but we cannot take the chance of that in our lessened state.;
"I don't care who you are or what you do on this track; I'm not saying anything else to you.";NM26ABCASA01000_.mp3
What do you want? I don't waste time with fans, so if this is about an autoprint, forget it. You can buy one when I get more made up.;NM26ABCASA01001_.mp3
Wait, no, you're the new Sector Champion, aren't you? You're really cutting into my profits. What do you want?;NM26ABCASA01002_.mp3
I just want to ask a few questions.;
Well, get it over with.;NM26ABCASA01008_.mp3
I want to ask about you and racing.;
Of course you do. Everyone wants time with the fabulous Casandra Mateil. There just isn't enough of me to go around.;NM26ABCASA01010_.mp3
Is Manaan a good course for racing?;
You should know better than any of us. You're the Sector Champion, after all. You tell me if the track is good. Feh!;NM26ABCASA01012_.mp3
How long have you been at this?;
Two years, but that's more than enough time to know the secrets behind the sport. It's all about the image you portray.;NM26ABCASA01022_.mp3
What do you mean by that?;
"Hukta is the thug; people like him because he's mean. I'm the pretty one; the one that people want to take home.";NM26ABCASA01024_.mp3
Even if we don't win, we're easy to remember. That keeps the fans coming back, so race organizers want us at their tracks.;NM26ABCASA01025_.mp3
Local racers don't bring in off-world crowds. They need us. At least, they would if there was still a functioning circuit.;NM26ABCASA01026_.mp3
Can you tell me about the other racers?;
I don't need to tell you anything. You've beat us all. You're just looking for an excuse to gloat.;NM26ABCASA01028_.mp3
Let's go back to my first questions.;
Yes yes, hurry it up.;NM26ABCASA01035_.mp3
Do you know much about Manaan?;
I know that if you do absolutely anything wrong you get locked up. Seems like fining criminals is a great way to bring in the credits.;NM26ABCASA01038_.mp3
I'm surprised they even let us race. Wouldn't want the crowds to get too excited. Excitement make people unpredictable. Or something.;NM26ABCASA01039_.mp3
I have to leave. Goodbye.;
Don't hurry back.;NM26ABCASA01041_.mp3
Sounds like you need a lesson...;
What? Are you threatening me? On Manaan? You know how foolish that is, right?;NM26ABCASA01045_.mp3
How about you pay me to go away?;
You're not getting anything out of me on this planet. The Selkath have cameras everywhere. You'd just be locked up for trying.;NM26ABCASA01047_.mp3
Go away. Manaan isn't very friendly to bullies.;NM26ABCASA01048_.mp3
I'll threaten you if I want!;
Not here you won't. There are cameras everywhere, looking for just your type. Criminals like you are shipped off instantly.;NM26ABCASA01050_.mp3
I apologize. I didn't mean anything.;
That's better. Hurry up and tell me what you want.;NM26ABCASA01052_.mp3
Hukta Jax is the only other professional here besides me. He got where he is by making sure everyone knows he's the toughest racer out there.;NM26ABCASA01029_.mp3
The only other name I know is Queedle. You heard about him taking it all, right? I don't know where he got the speed from.;NM26ABCASA01030_.mp3
I don't know any of the other racers. I guess there's Queedle, the local favorite. He won't amount to much.;NM26ABCASA01031_.mp3
What makes you say that?;
You need money to compete. Maybe he's got some skills, but he just doesn't have the best bike. It's that simple.;NM26ABCASA01033_.mp3
It was, but I can't seem to get a break lately. Hukta has been holding me off, and all he does is run over everything.;NM26ABCASA01013_.mp3
And Queedle, what's he doing winning? He's just a local amateur. I'm glad only a small crowd saw him blow past me.;NM26ABCASA01014_.mp3
And of course you had to go and take the whole competition. Nothing like getting beaten by a rookie.;NM26ABCASA01015_.mp3
But this place is all there is until the circuit recovers from the loss of Taris. It's going to take a while.;NM26ABCASA01016_.mp3
There are no other tracks?;
Not within reasonable traveling time. I heard there was a start-up on Tatooine, but I'll stick with the legitimate tracks, thank you very much.;NM26ABCASA01018_.mp3
Again? Oh all right, but only if you make it quick.;NM26ABCASA01036_.mp3
Save your attitude. Answer my questions.;
Don't get snippy with me. I have legions of adoring fans that would rather have my time. Legions!;NM26ABCASA01043_.mp3
Wait a minute... you're no fan. You're the racer that killed my time. Why should I talk to you?;NM26ABCASA01003_.mp3
I'm still upset about losing my ranking to that amateur Queedle. I don't know how he got so fast all of a sudden.;NM26ABCASA01004_.mp3
Wait, you're that new racer. I don't give out racing secrets, if that's what you're asking for.;NM26ABCASA01005_.mp3
Leave me alone. I need time to prepare for my races.;NM26ABCASA01006_.mp3
What do you want now? I really don't have time for you.;NM26ABCASA01053_.mp3
Well, hello Sector Champion. You must be proud right now. You'll excuse me if I don't join in with cheers of my own.;NM26ABCASA01054_.mp3
"Don't expect a warm ""Hello"" from me, I don't have much warmth for the racer that outranked me in my round.";NM26ABCASA01055_.mp3
So, you're trying to break out of the low rounds, hmm? Don't let your one win go to your head. Hukta and I are professionals.;NM26ABCASA01056_.mp3
You're really annoying, you know that? I hate it when people come out of nowhere and start collecting wins.;NM26ABCASA01057_.mp3
You have come back. Good. Are you prepared to go to the academy?;NM33AAYUTH21000_.mp3
Yes, I am.;
Then let us leave. The Master of the Academy awaits you.;NM33AAYUTH21002_.mp3
Not yet.;
Then come back when you are ready. But do not take long... I *will* leave without you.;NM33AAYUTH21004_.mp3
You again? What do you wish, now?;NM33AAYUTH21005_.mp3
I would like to know who you are.;
Who am I? You must not have been on Korriban for very long. Either that or you have been feeling your way about blindly.;NM33AAYUTH21032_.mp3
Luckily for you, I am in a charitable mood. I am Yuthura Ban, second only to Master Uthar of the Sith academy here in Dreshdae.;NM33AAYUTH21033_.mp3
I am the one who decides which few of the many hopefuls who travel here to train actually become a Sith. Why? Is it your desire to enter the academy? Is that why you are here?;NM33AAYUTH21034_.mp3
And what if I said I was already a Sith?;
I would consider that an amusing ploy to try and enter the Academy. Why? Who will you claim to be? Darth Malak, himself?;NM33AAYUTH21066_.mp3
What about Darth Revan?;
What about Revan? Revan is dead. You may have a natural gift with the Force, human, but you've no gift for lies.;NM33AAYUTH21068_.mp3
A lot of the hopefuls here end up dead. That doesn't seem glorious.;
We make no apologies for the weak. If you cannot clench your fist and know when the moment comes to strike, there is no place for you amongst us.;NM33AAYUTH21039_.mp3
Of those who come to train, those who are weak return home. If they are both weak and foolish, they die... but it was their choice to come.;NM33AAYUTH21040_.mp3
And what about the Jedi?;
Hide-bound relics who burden themselves with tradition and with the protection of the weak and ungrateful. They are pitiful and misguided.;NM33AAYUTH21048_.mp3
Why would you take a gift as glorious as the Force and squander it? Weaken yourself deliberately and shackle yourself to outdated mores?;NM33AAYUTH21049_.mp3
Our gift has made us superior. It is our rightful place to rule. How can any deny that? Yet the Jedi do so... and call us 'evil' because we do not.;NM33AAYUTH21050_.mp3
You don't consider yourself evil?;
Is the sarkath beast who dominates his jungle evil? The tuk'ata who leaps on the squellbug for the kill? These are things of nature, of the universe.;NM33AAYUTH21052_.mp3
We are no different from this. The Force is part of the universe, part of the same laws. We were gifted to set us above the rest... to deny nature is foolish.;NM33AAYUTH21053_.mp3
But you serve the dark side of the Force, don't you?;
It is the Jedi who serve the Force... trying to discern its wishes like frightened old men staring at the stars. The Force serves *us*.;NM33AAYUTH21055_.mp3
We shape it to our will. We are its master. The Jedi deny their darkness, but we revel in it, we allow it to fuel our strength.;NM33AAYUTH21056_.mp3
But the dark side is evil, it corrupts...;
'Corruption' is a word the pitiful use to describe the natural longing for power that they deny. 'Evil' is a word trumpeted by the weak to ease their heart.;NM33AAYUTH21058_.mp3
It is true that the Force exacts a physical toll on some... but not a single one of them has ever regretted it. Anything else you hear is propaganda.;NM33AAYUTH21059_.mp3
And where does Darth Malak fit into all this?;
You know the name? Malak is the strongest of us, and the strongest always rules... at least until one who is stronger can take it from him.;NM33AAYUTH21061_.mp3
That is our way: survival of the fittest. You are always on guard, always lean for the kill. We promote it, for through this the Sith are stronger.;NM33AAYUTH21062_.mp3
You kill each other?;
If a Sith has proven to be weak... and if the time is right. The Force rewards the cunning and the mighty. Step up to the challenge if you dare... or turn tail and run.;NM33AAYUTH21064_.mp3
I see. About joining you...;
You've heard enough, have you? *chuckle* So what is it to be? Are you here to be a Sith or not?;NM33AAYUTH21042_.mp3
No, I'm not interested.;
No? Why might that be? There is something... odd about you, human, that I cannot place...;NM33AAYUTH21072_.mp3
Obviously you are a Jedi. One who is very strong in the Force, it seems. So were you part of the order for very long? Did they train you?;NM33AAYUTH21075_.mp3
No, I don't know what you're talking about.;
*chuckle* As you wish. Play your little game, Jedi, if you must. Either way, I sense an intriguing amount of power within you.;NM33AAYUTH21078_.mp3
With that kind of power, you could become a great Sith. Perhaps... if I let you. Does that interest you?;NM33AAYUTH21086_.mp3
No. It doesn't.;
A pity. And here you were already given the medallion and everything.;NM33AAYUTH21094_.mp3
Well, human... should you change your mind, you know where to come.;NM33AAYUTH21096_.mp3
A pity. Here I hadn't even decided, yet.;NM33AAYUTH21095_.mp3
[Lie] Yes, it does. I wish to become a Sith.;
Ah, good. Exactly the sort of answer I was hoping for.;NM33AAYUTH21088_.mp3
I will take you to the academy and we shall see if you are ready to join the ranks of the Sith.;NM33AAYUTH21104_.mp3
I have only one other question. These... companions of yours? They will not be coming with you, I presume?;NM33AAYUTH21105_.mp3
They are slaves. Don't worry about them.;
My hearing's not so good. I'm just pleased my nice master doesn't beat me so much anymore, yes sir.;NM33AAYUTH21110_.mp3
There is... something odd about this servant of yours...;NM33AAYUTH21108_.mp3
No matter. Make sure they don't disturb your training or cause trouble. You are responsible for them. Now... are you ready to go to the academy?;NM33AAYUTH21109_.mp3
I... yes -- we are only servants to the... master.;NM33AAYUTH21171_.mp3
I... yes -- we are only servants to the... master.;NM33AAYUTH21107_.mp3
Statement: Just a simple droid, here, ma'am. Nothing to see. Move along.;NM33AAYUTH21111_.mp3
I see. Fair enough, so long as they do not disturb your training or cause any trouble. Are you ready to go to the academy, then?;NM33AAYUTH21112_.mp3
Are you ready to go there now?;NM33AAYUTH21113_.mp3
Yes, it does. I wish to become a Sith.;
Again? I suppose that would interest me, yes.;
Hmm. A strange response, indeed. Is your mind maladjusted in some way? You should make for an interesting pupil, indeed.;NM33AAYUTH21091_.mp3
*chuckle* As you wish. Keep your little secrets, human, if you must. Either way, I sense an intriguing amount of power within you.;NM33AAYUTH21079_.mp3
Yes, but only very little.;
As I thought. How interesting that they would let one with such power out of their grasp. Or are you here to spy on us? For all the good it would do.;NM33AAYUTH21081_.mp3
Yes. I'm a fallen Jedi, if you must know.;
A Padawan, perhaps, though it makes little difference. I sense enough raw power within you to... well, we shall see.;NM33AAYUTH21083_.mp3
What difference does it make?;
Perhaps none. Perhaps all the difference in the world. Either way, you possess enough raw power to intrigue me greatly.;NM33AAYUTH21085_.mp3
I have forgotten most of my training, it seems.;
What an odd thing to say... and, even stranger, I do not sense any deception within you. You are a curious puzzle, human, a puzzle with great power.;NM33AAYUTH21120_.mp3
I sense... that you are very strong in the Force. That you have already honed some of your abilities. Jedi training, is it?;NM33AAYUTH21076_.mp3
Yes. I want to join the Sith.;
Ahhh, so you are just another hopeful after all. Or are you? There is something odd about you that I cannot place...;NM33AAYUTH21074_.mp3
Never mind... I have to go.;
Oh? That is truly a first. Do as you wish, then, human. I'll not stop you.;NM33AAYUTH21046_.mp3
Why would I want to join the Sith?;
*chuckle* An interesting question, and not one I hear often. For most the benefits of becoming a Sith are quite obvious.;NM33AAYUTH21036_.mp3
We wield ultimate power, my friend. To be a Sith is to taste freedom and to know victory. Nothing is as glorious as bending the Force to your will.;NM33AAYUTH21037_.mp3
Maybe. I haven't given it much thought.;
And yet here you are on little Korriban, just by accident? I find it hard to believe. If it amuses you, however, I'll play along.;NM33AAYUTH21070_.mp3
No! I would never join the Sith!;
Yes, that's exactly why I'm here. Let me join you.;
I'll be on my way.;
As you wish.;NM33AAYUTH21126_.mp3
I want to join the Sith.;
So I see, from the medallion you carry. How curious that you possess one. Where did you get it?;NM33AAYUTH21008_.mp3
Err... I took it from another student, actually.;
I see. How very enterprising of you, though that is not the normal way that we select our students for the academy.;NM33AAYUTH21016_.mp3
We Sith do encourage such independent thinking. You may even be a suitable candidate to join us. That is what you wish, I take it? To become a Sith?;NM33AAYUTH21022_.mp3
[Persuade/Lie] It was given to me...;
[Success] Oh? By one of the others, no doubt. You do seem a fit candidate for the academy, though there is... something odd about you...;NM33AAYUTH21018_.mp3
[Failure] You think to lie to me, do you? I would suspect you stole this and killed the owner. Very enterprising of you, I must admit.;NM33AAYUTH21021_.mp3
[Persuade/Lie] One of the other Sith accepted me into the academy.;
[Success] Oh? Very well. You do seem a fit candidate, though there is... something odd about you I cannot place...;NM33AAYUTH21020_.mp3
Why do you want to know?;
Do not be insolent, human. I asked you a direct question, and I will not be trifled with. Now... where did you get this medallion?;NM33AAYUTH21024_.mp3
But I have already told you your answer, human. Do not bother me further, or I shall become irritated.;NM33AAYUTH21009_.mp3
I have this medallion...;
So one of the others accepted you, even after I did not? You are lucky, human, for I am in a forgiving mood.;NM33AAYUTH21011_.mp3
So I see. How curious that you should come to possess such a thing. Where did you get it?;NM33AAYUTH21012_.mp3
Never mind. I'll go.;
Can you not see that I am busy, human? Ahhh... I see you have a medallion. Where did you get it?;NM33AAYUTH21014_.mp3
Is there something you need, Jedi? Make it good, for I have little patience.;NM33AAYUTH21025_.mp3
Why did you call me Jedi?;
You think me a fool? You think I do not recognize a lightsaber when I see it?;NM33AAYUTH21027_.mp3
You are far from the first Jedi who has come here, after all, willing to abandon that decrepit order of yours.;NM33AAYUTH21029_.mp3
Who are you?;
Are you Yuthura Ban?;
I am. Obviously you have been told of me. Is it your desire, then, to train at the academy? Do you wish to become a Sith, human?;NM33AAYUTH21122_.mp3
Can I ask you some questions?;
I am sure there are plenty of others here who would answer your questions. I am quite busy. So if there is nothing else...?;NM33AAYUTH21124_.mp3
You think me a fool? You think I do not recognize robes of the order when I see them?;NM33AAYUTH21028_.mp3
So you know what I am.;
Is there something you need, human? Make it good, for I have little patience.;NM33AAYUTH21030_.mp3
You are either brave or foolish, off-worlder, to walk our streets so boldly. Your kind are not popular on Manaan right now.;
The Sith have been the target of some sort of attack recently... If the Republic was behind this, they will face stiff penalties.;
You have done the Selkath a great service, off-worlder.;
This is a private conversation, off-worlder.;
[With enemies in sight, Juhani's Cathar blood is boiling. She is in no mood to speak right now.];
[Juhani seems tense and wary in your presence. Perhaps you could make her feel more welcome by talking with her.];
[Speak to Juhani.];
How may I be of assistance to you, Padawan?;NM35AAJUHA11395_.mp3
I was wondering if we could talk.;
What is it you would like to speak to me about?;NM35AAJUHA11435_.mp3
Tell me about this Dak Vesser.;
There is little to tell. Dak and I were both Padawans... we joined the Order at the same time.;NM35AAJUHA11437_.mp3
He was a kind man, but... frustrated. He felt the Jedi were too controlling, too limiting... more so than I did.;NM35AAJUHA11438_.mp3
When he decided to leave the Order, he asked me to come with him. He... he said he loved me.;NM35AAJUHA11439_.mp3
But you didn't love him?;
No, I didn't. I enjoyed his company, as a friend, but nothing further. I had no idea he felt as he did.;NM35AAJUHA11441_.mp3
He was angry at my refusal. I... assumed that he would get over the hurt in time. I suppose such feelings can fester and darken, and they never go away.;NM35AAJUHA11446_.mp3
He reminds me of what I was when you found me in the grove. I... feel sorry for him.;NM35AAJUHA11447_.mp3
But he has chosen his path, hasn't he? If I thought he would accept an offer of help, I would give it. Let us... just move on, please.;NM35AAJUHA11448_.mp3
Oh. Forget I asked.;
I suppose the rest is obvious enough that I need not tell it.;NM35AAJUHA11443_.mp3
That doesn't sound so serious.;
It was serious enough to him... and to me, for I did not wish to hurt him. I had little choice in the matter.;NM35AAJUHA11445_.mp3
How did you come to be a Jedi?;
How I came to be a Jedi? I am sure you would not find it very interesting... Are you sure you would like to hear?;NM35AAJUHA11450_.mp3
Yes. Please continue.;
Well... It goes back a number of years...;NM35AAJUHA11452_.mp3
Back on my homeworld we did not see Jedi very often, especially where I lived.;NM35AAJUHA11453_.mp3
Where did you live?;
The hind end of space. A pit of a world, to be sure. Where Jedi rarely tread...;NM35AAJUHA11455_.mp3
But we had heard of them. Well, everyone had, so that is not to be unexpected.;NM35AAJUHA11456_.mp3
Champions of truth. Defenders of justice. Heroes of the Republic.;NM35AAJUHA11457_.mp3
It was very easy for a child to be enthralled by their image, their mystique. Maybe I was one of those children.;NM35AAJUHA11458_.mp3
Did you meet a Jedi?;
Yes... Yes I did.;NM35AAJUHA11460_.mp3
When I saw a Jedi for the first time they lived up to everything my imagination had created them to be. I was awed... and maybe a bit enamored...;NM35AAJUHA11465_.mp3
Enamored?;
They were quite striking... especially the tales of their leader.;NM35AAJUHA11467_.mp3
From that moment on I knew that I would have to try to become a Jedi. To lift myself out of the rut I had been living in for years and to make a real difference, as the Jedi were.;NM35AAJUHA11470_.mp3
The foolish delusions of a child. But THIS child made it happen!;NM35AAJUHA11471_.mp3
As soon as I was able I left my world and went in search of them. I found them and was accepted. I had been living my dream on Dantooine for several years before you came.;NM35AAJUHA11472_.mp3
Although... perhaps I was not entirely ready for it... or not completely suited to the task. Otherwise I would not have fallen...;NM35AAJUHA11473_.mp3
But thanks to you I have been redeemed. Perhaps I may yet live to see that dream of mine come true.;NM35AAJUHA11474_.mp3
Come, there is much we should do. Let us not waste time talking. Action is what is needed.;NM35AAJUHA11475_.mp3
The imagination can be a dangerous thing...;
So what did you do?;
Then how did you gain entrance to the Order?;
Typical childish naivete.;
Allow children their innocence while they still may have it!;NM35AAJUHA11463_.mp3
I was not so innocent, but I too was affected...;NM35AAJUHA11464_.mp3
What is the Cathar homeworld like?;
It was not the homeworld of the Cathar that I lived on. My parents had long fled from that place, and perhaps that is a story for another time. Rather it was a human hive-world I was raised on.;NM35AAJUHA11477_.mp3
Was it bad there?;
Bad enough that Jedi rarely came to that place.;NM35AAJUHA11479_.mp3
On second thought, maybe not.;
Very well then. Perhaps some other time you might deign to be interested.;NM35AAJUHA11481_.mp3
You're right. It's going to be boring.;
My attempt at humility seems to fail around you. So be it then, go immerse yourself in something else.;NM35AAJUHA11483_.mp3
Tell me more about your past.;
Well... I suppose I have not talked very much about the Jedi I met back home.;NM35AAJUHA11485_.mp3
They, all of them, were so very... invigorating.;NM35AAJUHA11486_.mp3
Invigorating?;
They were so very alive. So full of hope and energy and zeal.;NM35AAJUHA11488_.mp3
In retrospect I can see it was a little bit tragic...;NM35AAJUHA11489_.mp3
Tragic?;
Well... yes... these Jedi were going to fight the Mandalorians just after they had invaded. Many of those Jedi perished in the fighting.;NM35AAJUHA11491_.mp3
But to us, they seemed invincible, especially their leader, who they talked about all the time. Paragons of light and justice, sweeping away all iniquity before them.;NM35AAJUHA11492_.mp3
It was like looking at gods...;NM35AAJUHA11493_.mp3
The Jedi are not gods.;
I know that! I was using poetic licence! But those Jedi...;NM35AAJUHA11495_.mp3
They were enthralling... Everyone wanted just to touch them. Some people thought it would bring them luck.;NM35AAJUHA11496_.mp3
Not that the peace they brought lasted very long...;NM35AAJUHA11497_.mp3
What happened?;
The Jedi left. The people grew complacent. Those who had been wronged saw their chance at revenge... and so the cycle continues.;NM35AAJUHA11499_.mp3
The oppressed become the new generation of oppressors. The human oppressed that is...;NM35AAJUHA11500_.mp3
The non-humans were never treated well in any case... We felt the brunt of both administrations...;NM35AAJUHA11501_.mp3
Was it that bad?;
Of course it was! They took their frustrations and hates out on us because the people they wanted had already fled or were too well protected!;NM35AAJUHA11503_.mp3
But no one looks out for the injustices we suffered! Oh, no!;NM35AAJUHA11506_.mp3
But... I am sorry, I should not have outbursts like that.;NM35AAJUHA11507_.mp3
As long as you do not let your anger influence you.;
Don't you see? The very fact I mentioned it means it has its influence. Anger can lead to the dark side and I must be ever careful that I do not fall back into those ways.;NM35AAJUHA11509_.mp3
I... I thank you for your support. My outburst was uncalled for, but you did not lash back at me. You are a much better Jedi than I, it would seem.;NM35AAJUHA11514_.mp3
But let us not speak more of this now. We should continue on our journey. Perhaps later we will talk again.;NM35AAJUHA11515_.mp3
Such anger can lead to the dark side.;
I know... And I must be ever careful that I do not fall back into those ways again.;NM35AAJUHA11511_.mp3
It is alright.;
No, it is not. Anger can lead to the dark side and I must be ever careful that I do not fall back into those ways.;NM35AAJUHA11513_.mp3
Well you can't really blame them.;
What?!? Of course I can! They took their frustrations and hates out on us because the people they wanted had already fled or were too well protected!;NM35AAJUHA11505_.mp3
All species are capable of intolerance.;
Yes but humans seem the most pervasive... the most consistent. They took their frustrations and hates out on us because the people they wanted had already fled or were too well protected!;NM35AAJUHA11517_.mp3
Did they leave?;
Of course they left! They had a war to go fight, so that we would not all be killed by those psychotic Mandalorians!;NM35AAJUHA11519_.mp3
Damn straight! I DO look divine.;
I can only assume that was some misguided attempt at humor. I was using poetic licence. But those Jedi...;NM35AAJUHA11521_.mp3
If that was the case, they seem to be misrepresenting themselves.;
I was merely using poetic licence. Those Jedi...;NM35AAJUHA11523_.mp3
What do you mean?;
These Jedi were going to fight the Mandalorians just after they had invaded. Many of those Jedi perished in the fighting.;NM35AAJUHA11525_.mp3
Blah, blah, blah. Okay, you can stop now.;
What?! You...;NM35AAJUHA11530_.mp3
Bah! It is useless talking to you it seems! Come back when you are more civilized or when we have something to do.;NM35AAJUHA11531_.mp3
I already know about Jedi, talk about something else.;
If you do not wish to hear what I have to say, then find some other being to converse with!;NM35AAJUHA11528_.mp3
Why do you insist on spewing this trash at me?;
Well, I mentioned before that my parents had fled to Taris. Perhaps I can tell you about that.;NM35AAJUHA11532_.mp3
Please do.;
In the early days of the Mandalorian war, there had been fighting closer to the Outer Rim worlds.;NM35AAJUHA11534_.mp3
Near the world your species comes from?;
Cathar was there, yes. My people had a great reputation as warriors... and that appealed to the Mandalore version of 'honor'.;NM35AAJUHA11536_.mp3
They sought to test themselves against us, I think... test themselves by bombing our world, slaughtering my people while they slept or while they ran.;NM35AAJUHA11537_.mp3
How did it happen?;
They swooped down from space across the world, firing at anything that moved. They used ships in space to destroy all orbital facilities and bombard the surface.;NM35AAJUHA11539_.mp3
We did resist, and in spite of their violent attack we did stave them off for quite a while.;NM35AAJUHA11540_.mp3
But in the end we were doomed...;NM35AAJUHA11541_.mp3
Why did the Republic not help you?;
We were not members of the Republic. Cathar was beyond the edge of the Republic, in the Outer Rim. And besides, they could not have known.;NM35AAJUHA11543_.mp3
Our interstellar communications were the first things the Mandalores hit. All other short-range communicators were jammed... we were on our own.;NM35AAJUHA11544_.mp3
We knew what was coming. We had fought the Mandalorians in the first war against Exar Kun and the Sith. We knew there would be no mercy for us.;NM35AAJUHA11545_.mp3
The most we could do was pack the few of our people who survived onto what few ships remained and send them off into space as fast as they could.;NM35AAJUHA11546_.mp3
Most did not make it.;NM35AAJUHA11547_.mp3
But you survived?;
My parents carried me as a baby with them and were lucky enough to escape.;NM35AAJUHA11549_.mp3
They fled as far as they were able, and eventually settled on Taris. They could stand running no further, I think...;NM35AAJUHA11550_.mp3
But Taris was a horrible choice. Dominated by humans, intolerant of other species, it made everyday life unnecessarily hard.;NM35AAJUHA11551_.mp3
How did your family cope?;
My father... my father turned to stimulants. He spent much of his time in local bars and dives.;NM35AAJUHA11553_.mp3
But we are warriors. It runs through our blood. And when he was on stims he... he... he became foolish... he let his warrior nature get the best of him.;NM35AAJUHA11554_.mp3
So he would get intoxicated, and he would fight, and finally one day he would die.;NM35AAJUHA11555_.mp3
He died?;
Killed by a man who provoked him into a fight and killed him like an animal.;NM35AAJUHA11557_.mp3
I... I am sorry, I cannot talk about this any longer right now...;NM35AAJUHA11558_.mp3
How did he die?;
That's tragic...;
I don't need your sarcasm, or your pity! He died at the hands of another.;NM35AAJUHA11561_.mp3
Your parents do not sound very wise to me.;
Perhaps they were not. Perhaps they did not know better. It did not take long for things to get worse.;NM35AAJUHA11563_.mp3
Taris is not a nice place to raise a child.;
No, it is not. But they had little choice. Each of us dealt with it in our own way.;NM35AAJUHA11565_.mp3
What about your family?;
An atrocity!;
The Jedi could have helped!;
And that is what you get for being unprepared.;
We were prepared! Just not for an invasion of that size... And we had counted on the aid of our allies. Of the Republic...;NM35AAJUHA11570_.mp3
Your world was taken that easily?;
The Mandalorians fought dirty.;
Your people were in that region?;
What caused them to flee?;
Go on.;
There were no Cathar on Taris that I saw.;
No there were not... having fled the birthworld of my species, my parents flew as far and wide as they could.;NM35AAJUHA11577_.mp3
And so I was raised alone, knowing of my birthplace only the few stories my parents could tell, and seeing no other member of my species at all...;NM35AAJUHA11578_.mp3
Why did they flee?;
It all comes back to wars and fighting... the curse of your race, it seems...;NM35AAJUHA11580_.mp3
Why were there no other members of your species on Taris?;
I have told you my life story already, what more could you possibly want to know? Well... there is one thing...;NM35AAJUHA11582_.mp3
I did not want to mention it before, because I was unsure how you would react.;NM35AAJUHA11583_.mp3
What is it?;
Do you remember when I told you of the Jedi who had come to my world to fight the Mandalorians?;NM35AAJUHA11585_.mp3
They were recruiting soldiers for their crusade against the Mandalores. Many people joined them.;NM35AAJUHA11586_.mp3
Yes, you mentioned this.;
The main reason for that was their charismatic leader. The one whose troops freed me and let me dream of seeking out and joining the Jedi Order.;NM35AAJUHA11588_.mp3
I was hesitant to talk to you about this because... well...;NM35AAJUHA11591_.mp3
Well what?;
The Jedi had come to fight the Mandalores under the leadership of a powerful young Jedi... a Jedi named Revan.;NM35AAJUHA11593_.mp3
Revan?! You mean...;
Yes, it was you. I never saw you, else I would have recognized you, but it was your army that freed me from the slavers.;NM35AAJUHA11595_.mp3
I cannot express how you have changed my life... or how much you mean to me.;NM35AAJUHA11596_.mp3
But I will stay by your side through any trials that may come. Such is the will of the Council... and my own.;NM35AAJUHA11597_.mp3
I cannot express how you have changed my life.;NM35AAJUHA11598_.mp3
THE Revan. The Jedi who turned to the dark side, became the Dark Lord of the Sith and was defeated by Bastila and her strike team.;NM35AAJUHA11599_.mp3
I do not know what happened in the wars with the Mandalorians that turned Revan and Malak, or what they sought with these Star Maps, but the Jedi I knew was a paragon of the Order.;NM35AAJUHA11600_.mp3
I am sorry, if this seems wrong to you, but to understand you must realize that Revan was as great as a Jedi could be. Whatever turned Revan must be terrible indeed.;NM35AAJUHA11601_.mp3
I wonder if what we find at the end of our journey will turn us as well...;NM35AAJUHA11602_.mp3
Juhani...;
This is meaningless speculation I guess. I just wanted you to know what I held from you.;NM35AAJUHA11604_.mp3
But rest assured that I will not hold back if our enemy is Malak, Revan's apprentice, or indeed even if it was Revan.;NM35AAJUHA11605_.mp3
I will help you through all trouble. Such is the will of the Council... And my own.;NM35AAJUHA11606_.mp3
I shall never fall like Revan did!;
Why did you tell me now?;
How could you admire Revan?;
Yes... I thought you might react badly... But it was Revan.;NM35AAJUHA11611_.mp3
Spit it out already!;
How bad could this be?;
I... I idolized him and the stories they told of him. He was everything I had dreamed a Jedi could be. I still believe he was that way.;NM35AAJUHA11590_.mp3
I... I idolized her and the stories they told of her. She was everything that I had dreamed a Jedi could be. I still believe she was that way.;NM05AAJUHA11590A.mp3
Of course I remember.;
Do we really have time for this?;
If you do not want to listen, I understand. But hear me out first.;NM35AAJUHA11617_.mp3
Why would I react badly?;
You... you will see. Perhaps...;NM35AAJUHA11619_.mp3
What happened after your father died?;
After my father died, my mother was left to support me alone. A single non-human woman, living in one of the worst, most violent slums on Taris.;NM35AAJUHA11621_.mp3
It was not easy for her.;NM35AAJUHA11622_.mp3
How so?;
When my father was killed it seemed that something in her began to die as well.;NM35AAJUHA11624_.mp3
She worked. She worked as hard as she was able, but over time she began to waste away.;NM35AAJUHA11625_.mp3
I later learned that she was unable to get enough money to feed both of us, and had to start borrowing from the Exchange, a band of cutthroats and smugglers. But even that was not enough...;NM35AAJUHA11626_.mp3
She hid what she was doing from me. She gave most of her food to me, so that I would be strong. But she herself was suffering deeply from it.;NM35AAJUHA11627_.mp3
In the end she could go on no longer, and collapsed at the cantina where she worked one day.;NM35AAJUHA11628_.mp3
Did she die?;
She never recovered. There was nothing really that I could do for her... She left me no money, and no doctor would see her without being paid first.;NM35AAJUHA11630_.mp3
I sat by her bed for days as she lay there dying. I never want that to happen to someone I care about ever again...;NM35AAJUHA11631_.mp3
But there was still the money she had borrowed... She had never paid it back, and made no provisions for her death.;NM35AAJUHA11632_.mp3
You must understand: the Exchange is brutal. They care nothing for the life of a sentient being. They are the major suppliers of slaves on Taris.;NM35AAJUHA11633_.mp3
You were enslaved?;
They thought it was appropriate that, with my mother owing them money, the debt should be passed on to me. And with no way to pay, they took me by force.;NM35AAJUHA11635_.mp3
You have no idea what it is like to be bound like a beast and treated as such. It was the worst time of my life.;NM35AAJUHA11636_.mp3
They treated me like livestock. They were waiting for a buyer to give them some credits for me when the Jedi came to fight the Mandalorians.;NM35AAJUHA11637_.mp3
And they freed you?;
The Jedi could not abide by what they saw there, and drove the Exchange from the face of the world, freeing those of us imprisoned there.;NM35AAJUHA11639_.mp3
But the Jedi soon left to fight their war. And I was left with a dream...;NM35AAJUHA11640_.mp3
What did you do?;
I swore that I would become a Jedi. As soon as I had enough money to do it, I bought passage on a freighter headed for Dantooine.;NM35AAJUHA11642_.mp3
And we both know what has happened since then.;NM35AAJUHA11643_.mp3
You became a Jedi.;
I am grateful to you for having given me the opportunity to fulfill my dream, rather than become what I hated.;NM35AAJUHA11645_.mp3
Someday I may make it up to you, but for now, let us keep on the task at hand.;NM35AAJUHA11646_.mp3
You turned away from the dark side.;
What was the dream?;
How could the Jedi stand for that?;
They captured you?;
What did you do for her?;
Surely there was a doctor.;
Could you not help her?;
Are you doing alright?;
I... I thank you for your concern, but I am still a bit shaken.;NM35AAJUHA11659_.mp3
Why? What is wrong?;
I have been thinking about myself... about Quatra... and about my fall to the dark side.;NM35AAJUHA11661_.mp3
I keep thinking that it was my anger that drove me that far, that nearly damned me. I look inside myself now and I can still see it, I still feel it.;NM35AAJUHA11662_.mp3
Perhaps you just need more time.;
More time would do me good. Time to distance myself from that anger.;NM35AAJUHA11670_.mp3
I think that is why the Council agreed to send me with you. They think, perhaps, that in your company I will be able to free myself from it.;NM35AAJUHA11671_.mp3
I cannot afford to look after you all the time, Juhani.;
I do not come here begging for scraps from you! I will earn my way with you. You will see just how valuable I am!;NM35AAJUHA11676_.mp3
If I see you begin to slip back, I will intervene.;
I thank you for your concern and your acceptance. I will strive to prove that I am worthy of your company and trust.;NM35AAJUHA11674_.mp3
Great, another mouth to feed...;
If the taint cannot be removed, are you sure you should be here?;
I think maybe, that I just need more time.;NM35AAJUHA11664_.mp3
You know, I don't really think I care very much.;
Would you rather I fell again and attacked? Slaughtered you in your sleep like an animal?;NM35AAJUHA11666_.mp3
I see in your pride you do not think that possible.;NM35AAJUHA11667_.mp3
Very well, then! Keep your own counsel.;NM35AAJUHA11668_.mp3
You're too fragile, Juhani.;
I am. I try to be strong, as one of my people should, but I know I am still weak inside.;NM35AAJUHA11678_.mp3
I have been doing well, I suppose. As well as I can. But I am more interested in you right now.;NM35AAJUHA11679_.mp3
Do not mistake me, it is just that even though we have traveled together for a while, it seems I know next to nothing about you, personally.;NM35AAJUHA11680_.mp3
It is a little forward...;
Please, forgive me... I did not mean to insinuate that I... that we...;NM35AAJUHA11682_.mp3
It did not come out the way I had intended.;NM35AAJUHA11683_.mp3
We have been travelling together since Dantooine, but I know nothing of you before that. Would you... would you humor me and tell me a little about yourself?;NM35AAJUHA11684_.mp3
What is there to tell...;
Your job? Your childhood? Your life?;NM35AAJUHA11686_.mp3
Your... family?;NM35AAJUHA11687_.mp3
I am sorry if I am making you uncomfortable. I will fully understand if you choose not to answer.;NM35AAJUHA11688_.mp3
No, it is alright.;
I greatly appreciate your taking the time to talk to me. How did you come to be on Dantooine?;NM35AAJUHA11690_.mp3
Besides the obvious, of course.;NM35AAJUHA11691_.mp3
Well I rescued Bastila on Taris...;
Taris... It always seems to come back to Taris for me...;NM35AAJUHA11693_.mp3
I am sorry... I get distracted. I already know the tales of your exploits: how you defeated the Mandalorians in the war... and how you fell.;NM35AAJUHA11694_.mp3
But now you have the chance to redeem yourself. To make a new page in your history.;NM35AAJUHA11695_.mp3
So now, I suppose, that all does not matter. Only your life now does.;NM35AAJUHA11696_.mp3
But again I seem to be wasting your time with my carrying on. I apologize.;NM35AAJUHA11702_.mp3
I am sorry... I get distracted. What did you do before Ta... before that?;NM35AAJUHA11697_.mp3
I was a specialist with the Republic fleet.;
A life in the army. Not my career of choice, though. We Cathar cannot seem to adjust to regimented organizations like the military.;NM35AAJUHA11699_.mp3
But in a way it does seem to have it's own romantic appeal. Defending the galaxy from evil.;NM35AAJUHA11700_.mp3
Much as we Jedi do. So in a way, I suppose, we are more alike than not.;NM35AAJUHA11701_.mp3
But I have heard that it appeals to males of your species. Fighting, defending.;NM35AAJUHA11703_.mp3
That is what we as Jedi seem to be called upon to do. Perhaps we are not as unalike as I had previously thought...;NM35AAJUHA11704_.mp3
I was a soldier for the Republic.;
I was a scout for the Republic armed forces.;
I was in the Republic fleet that was destroyed over Taris.;
Er... I flew to Dantooine?;
Heh. Yes, I kind of figured that. From where? Oh wait... I remember...;NM35AAJUHA11709_.mp3
Sorry, my life is my business.;
I understand. I appreciate that you take the time to talk to me. I will be more considerate of your time in the future.;NM35AAJUHA11711_.mp3
Damn right! It's none of your business!;
Is is not a very interesting story.;
Hah. Humility. Please, if you would, indulge me.;NM35AAJUHA11714_.mp3
Heh. Well it is, of course, the greatest story ever told.;
Your humility is... astounding as always. So what can you tell me?;NM35AAJUHA11716_.mp3
What do you want to know?;
There's a reason for these things, you know.;
Oh. I see. It is because you wish to keep me at arm's length.;NM35AAJUHA11719_.mp3
Are you worried about me turning to the dark side? Or do you merely not wish my company.;NM35AAJUHA11720_.mp3
Whatever the case, I am sorry for presuming too much. I will remember my station from now on.;NM35AAJUHA11721_.mp3
Well you know my reputation.;
Yes. Yes, I do. I more than most perhaps. But I do not know the stories of your past. Legends rarely are laid bare like that.;NM35AAJUHA11723_.mp3
What are you thinking about?;
I have been thinking much about our journey, and I am grateful and honored that you have accepted me with you.;NM35AAJUHA11725_.mp3
It is an honor to be by your side and to see you redeemed from the dark path you had chosen before.;NM35AAJUHA11726_.mp3
We Cathar do not make friends easily, or for long. Even on Dantooine, I remained alone. Not ostracized exactly, but... separate.;NM35AAJUHA11728_.mp3
Tell me about your people.;
In truth, I have lived in the Republic too long, and know little. I never met any others of my race other than my parents. But we are not diplomats. We do not deal well with groups. This situation is new to me.;NM35AAJUHA11730_.mp3
It is... warming. I feel almost welcome. Needed.;NM35AAJUHA11735_.mp3
You seem to be very decisive when it is required of you. It is reassuring to know that I can count on someone like you.;NM35AAJUHA11736_.mp3
It's only because I haven't found out how to ditch you yet.;
What? But... I thought...;NM35AAJUHA11738_.mp3
It seems I was mistaken... I should have known things could not change for me that easily.;NM35AAJUHA11739_.mp3
As it is the Council's wishes, I will accompany you. I will do my duty, and trust that you will do yours.;NM35AAJUHA11740_.mp3
It is nice that you hold me in such high regard.;
To be accepted so readily... I find it difficult to explain. It is so different from what I am used to.;NM35AAJUHA11742_.mp3
Just... Thank you for accepting me.;NM35AAJUHA11745_.mp3
We are all in this together.;
Yes... and that is my point. I find it difficult to explain. It is so different from what I am used to.;NM35AAJUHA11744_.mp3
You could try counting on one of the others, you know...;
I feel that I could count on any of you. But you... you are the one who drew me back from the dark side. It is to you that I feel a debt.;NM35AAJUHA11747_.mp3
And I SHALL make it up to you.;NM35AAJUHA11748_.mp3
It must have been difficult for you.;
Yes, it was. I find it difficult to speak of those things. I do not want to live that way ever again. And here it seems different...;NM35AAJUHA11732_.mp3
And how are things different now?;
"Well, even if we do not speak that often, or are apart, I still feel a part of a team; this group you have assembled that accompanies you and Bastila on your quest.";NM35AAJUHA11734_.mp3
Then you should be right at home when I turn my back on you.;
Wha...;NM35AAJUHA11750_.mp3
I am not used to such unbiased acceptance from one who is nearly a stranger to me.;NM35AAJUHA11727_.mp3
Taris was my home for many years. As much as I hated it, it was still home.;NM35AAJUHA11751_.mp3
"A rat-hole; a warren; a paradise. I suppose you could call it all these things.";NM35AAJUHA11752_.mp3
For me it was hell...;NM35AAJUHA11753_.mp3
I know some parts are bad, but...;
You have no idea what it is like to have to live there for years...;NM35AAJUHA11755_.mp3
"To walk down the streets. To have people look at you in disgust; like an animal. Most did not know anything about me, but it was there all the same.";NM35AAJUHA11759_.mp3
"Because I was an 'alien'. Because I was different from them; frightening.";NM35AAJUHA11760_.mp3
I doubt any of them had even seen my people before. So they persecuted me...;NM35AAJUHA11761_.mp3
They looked down on me and my family. Charged us more for food. Would not let us walk their streets. They spat on us.;NM35AAJUHA11762_.mp3
You are human... you could not possibly know.;NM35AAJUHA11763_.mp3
Humans can be just as cruel to each other.;
That is true I suppose. But it much more obvious for someone like me.;NM35AAJUHA11765_.mp3
There were no other Cathar on Taris. No one to talk to. No one to confide in.;NM35AAJUHA11766_.mp3
Humph! But you must think me weak for saying this. But I am strong enough to admit it!;NM35AAJUHA11767_.mp3
You are not weak, Juhani. It must have been hard.;
I thank you for your concern, but...;NM35AAJUHA11769_.mp3
Bah! Maybe I am weak. To think that some stories of my stupid past could possibly interest you.;NM35AAJUHA11772_.mp3
No, it is alright. I will be here to listen to you whenever you want.;
I thank you. You are kinder than I would have expected... To put up with me using you in this way.;NM35AAJUHA11774_.mp3
I hope that I will not use your time so badly in the future. Thank you.;NM35AAJUHA11775_.mp3
It is interesting... I just fail to see the point.;
Maybe there is no point. Maybe I am just lost after leaving yet another planet. I apologize for my outburst. I will try to control myself next time.;NM35AAJUHA11777_.mp3
You're right. Don't bother me with this drivel again.;
I would not have thought you were so cruel as that.;NM35AAJUHA11785_.mp3
Wait a second. Why are you telling me all this?;
I... I do not know. I have been keeping it inside for so long. I thought you might understand. You do not seem to fit in exactly with the others. You are... different.;NM35AAJUHA11771_.mp3
Oh, I'm sorry, were you saying something important?;
I find it a little hard to believe.;
How can you say that? You have seen Taris, you know what kind of a scum infested hole it is.;NM35AAJUHA11781_.mp3
For us there was no respite. No one to turn to.;NM35AAJUHA11782_.mp3
Well you have to admit: You are a freak.;
What? You.. You are just like them!;NM35AAJUHA11784_.mp3
Life is hard. You can't blame everything on other people.;
But it was precisely the people who made it so bad!;NM35AAJUHA11757_.mp3
Why are you so hostile towards Canderous?;
I am wary of the Mandalorian. I do not trust him.;NM35AAJUHA11789_.mp3
Wary? Why?;
I have never trusted Mandalorians. They drove my parents from Cathar, aided the Sith and attacked the Republic. Their warped notions of 'honor' may provoke them to do even more heinous acts.;NM35AAJUHA11793_.mp3
I do not know why you tolerate his presence on your ship. In truth, he has had some merit so far, but I am not certain it is worth the risk you take.;NM35AAJUHA11794_.mp3
Canderous has proven himself.;
His kind may prove to be a danger to the galaxy again, but this man himself has proven acceptable so far. Merely keep your distance from him and watch him, so that he does not betray us.;NM35AAJUHA11799_.mp3
Have you spoken to him?;
Spoken to him? No! No, I could not.;NM35AAJUHA11801_.mp3
Mandalorians are vicious of temper and easily provoked. I... I would not want to tempt his wrath.;NM35AAJUHA11802_.mp3
What?? Aren't the Cathar such fierce warriors?;
I am not a coward! I fear no one and nothing! But you have not had to flee the destruction of your homeworld either, human.;NM35AAJUHA11831_.mp3
The Mandalorians came and overran my world, they slaughtered my race... I cannot forget what they have done. Or forgive.;NM35AAJUHA11807_.mp3
Hatred and fear lead to the dark side, Juhani.;
You are right, of course. You always seem to know what you speak of.;NM35AAJUHA11809_.mp3
This simmering anger and hatred for the Mandalores seems to have found a place in my heart, though. Sometimes, I worry...;NM35AAJUHA11817_.mp3
About what?;
That I may fall to the dark side once again. That I may threaten you, the Republic... the entire galaxy.;NM35AAJUHA11819_.mp3
If... If that time does come. And if i do threaten our task. It is only right that you should strike me down.;NM35AAJUHA11820_.mp3
Should that time come again, I would rather no one else do it than the one who redeemed me in the first place.;NM35AAJUHA11824_.mp3
But we are becoming too morbid too soon. We should not talk like this now. There is much yet we can do.;NM35AAJUHA11826_.mp3
But we shall talk later I am sure.;NM35AAJUHA11827_.mp3
If I fall and endanger you and the galaxy you must do what is right. If my death will defeat Malak, then that is what must be done.;NM35AAJUHA11825_.mp3
You should not worry. You can over your anger.;
But still it eats away at me. I worry that I may yet again fall and endanger everything that I hold dear.;NM35AAJUHA11822_.mp3
I may be forced to strike you down, should you fall.;
I think you will come to trust him in time.;
Maybe. Maybe not. I cannot forgive them for what they have done to me and my people.;NM35AAJUHA11811_.mp3
In time Canderous may prove himself. But it will not be easy.;NM35AAJUHA11812_.mp3
I would not let him harm you, Juhani.;
I can take care of myself! I do not need you to patronize me!;NM35AAJUHA11814_.mp3
But... I thank you for your kind words. It is hard being alone all the time. To be accepted and welcomed is... flattering.;NM35AAJUHA11815_.mp3
But it is gratifying to know that you value me as a companion that much.;NM35AAJUHA11816_.mp3
A wise decision. We do not need internal conflict.;
I am sorry. It is just that I cannot stand to be around him for very long. I suppose I do not really dislike him, it is just...;NM35AAJUHA11805_.mp3
Just?;
You are afraid?;
Just... that you are a coward. Why deny it?;
A cowardly, but rational choice.;
Should I speak to him?;
Speak to him? No, no!;NM35AAJUHA11833_.mp3
Do not become paranoid, Juhani.;
I am not paranoid! My suspicions are justified. I dare not speak about it around him, though.;NM35AAJUHA11835_.mp3
Fear and hate are lures of the dark side.;
That is true. But also I know his kind. This man he may be different, but...;NM35AAJUHA11837_.mp3
You should not judge Canderous by other Mandalorians.;
Perhaps we will have to eliminate him, then.;
Eliminate? What? I never proposed to murder the man!;NM35AAJUHA11798_.mp3
He has proven himself well.;
I am suspicious as well.;
You're delusional.;
I am not! They are not to be trusted! They are brutes and savages and destroyers of worlds!;NM35AAJUHA11839_.mp3
Nothing for now. Perhaps later.;
Of course. If there is anything else, I am here to help.;NM35AAJUHA11841_.mp3
What do you know about this world?;
Dantooine? Dantooine has been my home for a number of years, ever since I started my training with the Jedi.;NM35AAJUHA11397_.mp3
It is a lightly populated planet, mostly focused on agriculture and hunting of the wild beasts that roam its plains.;NM35AAJUHA11398_.mp3
The most populous form of animals on its surface are the iriaz, herd beasts that are normally quite tame, but can be violent when provoked, and the kath hounds, vicious pack predators.;NM35AAJUHA11399_.mp3
Kath hounds do not normally attack people except when it is a pack of them ambushing a lone individual. But recently they have been much more aggressive.;NM35AAJUHA11400_.mp3
I am to blame for that, I believe.;NM35AAJUHA11401_.mp3
But enough of my self-recrimination, I should not dwell on the past, but rather look to the future.;NM35AAJUHA11402_.mp3
How may I be of further assistance to you, Padawan?;NM35AAJUHA11403_.mp3
Manaan is a water-rich world... as you may have been able to tell.;NM35AAJUHA11404_.mp3
With the exception of this Ahto city, there is no land on the world protruding above sea-level.;NM35AAJUHA11405_.mp3
The dominant indigenous race of the world are the Selkath, a semi-aquatic bipedal species. They are known to be very dreary and strong proponents of the power of law above all else.;NM35AAJUHA11406_.mp3
The extremist policies of the Sith seem to appeal to them. They have declared themselves neutral in this conflict between the Republic and the Sith.;NM35AAJUHA11407_.mp3
Neutral? Can they not see the Sith are evil?;
The Selkath seek to preserve their independence by maintaining a stranglehold on the one unique resource of their world: the vulnerary liquid Kolto. The most powerful curative in the galaxy.;NM35AAJUHA11409_.mp3
As the only world in the galaxy that produces Kolto, they have positioned themselves between the Sith and the Republic, supplying both sides with the medicine equally.;NM35AAJUHA11410_.mp3
They hope in this way to make themselves too valuable to both to be conquered. As a last resort, they have made it clear to both sides that any attempt to attack their world will force them to destroy the Kolto supply entirely.;NM35AAJUHA11411_.mp3
Any violation by either the Republic or the Sith of their sacrosanct laws incurs severe Kolto export restrictions on the violating government.;NM35AAJUHA11412_.mp3
Both the Republic and the Sith try to keep the Selkath happy and give them no cause to complain. But I wonder how the Sith can take this affront to their power in stride...;NM35AAJUHA11413_.mp3
Many people speak highly of the integrity of the Selkath people... but from what little I have seen of them, they are disgusting little fish-people. But I suppose I just have too high standards.;NM35AAJUHA11414_.mp3
The Sith seem to have all the advantages.;
Yeah, well evil always wins in the end anyway.;
I am sorry, but I do not know anything about this place. It truly is an unknown world to me. I would be surprised if anyone at all in the Republic knew of it.;NM35AAJUHA11417_.mp3
We should be on our guard at all times.;NM35AAJUHA11418_.mp3
Korriban, I have heard, is a mysterious world. It is rumored to hold many ancient ruins of a purpose that none have been able to discover.;NM35AAJUHA11419_.mp3
There are also tales of strange ghosts and monsters haunting the ruins, whispering in the ears of all who would listen and driving them mad.;NM35AAJUHA11420_.mp3
The Jedi are not welcome here, however, so we cannot determine the truth that may lie in these rumors.;NM35AAJUHA11421_.mp3
Korriban remains staunchly outside the Republic, and we suspect that the Sith may have spread their influence here as well. The large Czerka Corporation outpost also points towards that.;NM35AAJUHA11422_.mp3
If the Czerka Corp. is the industrial arms of the Sith Empire, then judging by the size of their facilities here, this may be a very dangerous world indeed.;NM35AAJUHA11423_.mp3
We must watch ourselves closely here.;NM35AAJUHA11424_.mp3
Tatooine is a filthy desert. Planets such as this should not be fit for life at all. My skin itches just to be here.;NM35AAJUHA11425_.mp3
As you can see, it is a desert. Very little water. Too much sand. This sort of place attracts too much of the seedier side of civilization.;NM35AAJUHA11426_.mp3
As to the particulars of this world itself, I can safely say that it holds no interest for me, and I will be well pleased when we leave here and never return.;NM35AAJUHA11427_.mp3
Now is there something else, or may we hurry and do what we have to do here as quickly as possible?;NM35AAJUHA11428_.mp3
I have heard of this world... Kashyyyk. It is a place of giant trees that have overgrown the entire world, blanketing it in greenery.;NM35AAJUHA11429_.mp3
But while it is beautiful to behold at times, it can also be quite deadly. Many creatures and predators lurk in the leaves and branches. Some small, some undoubtedly quite large.;NM35AAJUHA11430_.mp3
I have heard that the bottom layers of the trees have never been seen by a living being who returned to tell of it, and that travelling there is certain death. I do not envy any who go there.;NM35AAJUHA11431_.mp3
It is most odd that Revan came here, but perhaps in the vast canopy of one of these trees we may find another piece of the Star Map.;NM35AAJUHA11432_.mp3
I have heard of no indigenous race that inhabits this world, but I must profess my ignorance, since I have only heard its name in passing.;NM35AAJUHA11433_.mp3
I was wondering if you could help me with our stowaway problem.;
I do not know how to help you with that, I am sorry.;NM35AAJUHA11842_.mp3
Do you know if anything can be done about all these gizka?;
[Don't speak to her.];
[You decide to ignore Juhani and continue on with your quest for now, though you might want to speak with her later.];
There is no time to talk now. Our priority is to find what caused this disturbance in the Force. It is close by, I know that much.;NM35AAJUHA11000_.mp3
How... how can you possibly be Revan?;NM35AAJUHA11021_.mp3
The one... the Jedi whose troops saved me on Taris... It was Revan, leading an army out to defeat the Mandalorians. It was you...;NM35AAJUHA11022_.mp3
You are nothing like the one who saved me on Taris.;NM35AAJUHA11023_.mp3
I am who I am, Juhani.;
You are obviously not who I thought you were, once upon a time.;NM35AAJUHA11025_.mp3
I thought you were the ideal Jedi. I thought you would never turn against us. Yet here you are.;NM35AAJUHA11026_.mp3
Here I am.;
You did turn in the end. I did not want to believe it. But now I suppose you have a chance to redeem yourself.;NM35AAJUHA11028_.mp3
You can work with us. For the Republic. For the Order. We can set right what you started so long ago.;NM35AAJUHA11029_.mp3
We shall see.;
Yes we shall. I only hope that you will see this through until the end.;NM35AAJUHA11031_.mp3
Time will tell what choices you make. I shall stay by you to see this task done.;NM35AAJUHA11032_.mp3
I will do what is necessary.;
And I hope that what you see as necessary is what we originally set out to do.;NM35AAJUHA11034_.mp3
I work for myself!;
Only through serving the Republic do you serve yourself as well. In defeating Malak you save all of us along with you.;NM35AAJUHA11036_.mp3
I do not make excuses for my actions.;
I AM the ideal Jedi.;
You know nothing of me!;
People change.;
I knew when I heard that you had become the Dark Lord of the Sith that something was wrong with it.;NM35AAJUHA11041_.mp3
The man who saved me could never go completely to the dark side.;NM35AAJUHA11042_.mp3
I regret any of the harm I may have caused.;
It is good to know that you have truly changed. It gives me hope.;NM35AAJUHA11050_.mp3
I do not think now that I will fall to the dark side. I only have to look to you and follow by your example and there is no way I can fail.;NM35AAJUHA11051_.mp3
Overconfidence can also lead to the dark side.;
Yes. That is true. I suppose you would know better than I.;NM35AAJUHA11053_.mp3
I will never forget what you did for me, even if you do not remember it.;NM35AAJUHA11056_.mp3
You will do fine, Juhani.;
Thank you for placing your confidence in me. I only wish I had your heart as well...;NM35AAJUHA11055_.mp3
That is especially meaningful coming from you.;NM35AAJUHA11057_.mp3
You flatter me...;
I... I am sorry, I did not realize. I will endeavor to be more considerate in the future.;NM35AAJUHA11059_.mp3
I do not know who that Revan was. I am not him.;
Perhaps he had his reasons. But I do not.;
The woman who saved me, who I... I have come to care for, could never go completely to the dark side.;NM35AAJUHA11046_.mp3
I do not know who that Revan was. I am not her.;
Perhaps she had her reasons. But I do not.;
The woman who saved me, who I... who I have come to admire, could never go completely to the dark side.;NM35AAJUHA11047_.mp3
This may be the last time I will have a chance to talk to you...;NM35AAJUHA11060_.mp3
I just want you to know that I... that I...;NM35AAJUHA11061_.mp3
... Yes?;
I... I... I care for you. I do not know why. I do not know if anything will be possible or if you even return what I feel, but I do know it is there.;NM35AAJUHA11063_.mp3
I am sorry if this upsets you. I am so sorry if I am wrong, but I cannot deny what it is that I feel.;NM35AAJUHA11064_.mp3
I feel the same way, Juhani.;
Now that I have put myself in this position, I know not what to say.;NM35AAJUHA11066_.mp3
You do not have to say anything.;
Yes. I thank you.;NM35AAJUHA11068_.mp3
But as much as I may care for you, and you for me, first we must deal with Malak.;NM35AAJUHA11071_.mp3
After there will be time to sort things out between us.;NM35AAJUHA11072_.mp3
Er... 'Thank you'?;
We have gone past words.;
I am sorry, I cannot return your affection.;
I... I understand. You have someone somewhere... or I just do not seem to appeal to you.;NM35AAJUHA11075_.mp3
I am sorry for pushing myself on you. I apologize for my actions.;NM35AAJUHA11076_.mp3
I suggest we find and confront Malak as soon as possible to remove the threat to the Republic once and for all.;NM35AAJUHA11077_.mp3
Are you sure this is the time for this?;
I was afraid that I would have no more time to say it... I wonder if all of us wil survive what we must do...;NM35AAJUHA11079_.mp3
You do not need to say it, Juhani.;
But I feel I must. I have never said this before...;NM35AAJUHA11081_.mp3
Please stop. Now.;
Of.. Of course. I am sorry. I should have known better.;NM35AAJUHA11083_.mp3
I can only say that if I am going to die, as we stand likely to, I am glad that it will be you beside whom I do it.;NM35AAJUHA11084_.mp3
I just want to thank you for all that you have done for me. For saving me from the dark side, for accepting me on your journey.;NM35AAJUHA11085_.mp3
I value your companionship.;
It is good to know that I have been of some value...;NM35AAJUHA11087_.mp3
Even if not as much as I would like...;NM35AAJUHA11088_.mp3
I will prove my true worth to you.;NM35AAJUHA11089_.mp3
We WILL defeat Malak and save the Republic from the Sith threat once and for all!;NM35AAJUHA11090_.mp3
And that is what we shall do!;
I pledge my life to your cause. I will stand by you until the end.;NM35AAJUHA11095_.mp3
We should get going.;
Do not underestimate the Sith.;
I... defer to your wisdom in this matter. I have little knowledge of the true power of the Sith.;NM35AAJUHA11094_.mp3
I need you to help me, Juhani.;
I will help you in any way I can.;NM35AAJUHA11097_.mp3
You have proved your worth many times over.;
So here we are... in the belly of the beast.;NM35AAJUHA11099_.mp3
What is wrong?;
Here we are in a Sith Interdicter loaded with troops and Sith Jedi, and you wonder at my apprehension?;NM35AAJUHA11101_.mp3
Knowledge of the almost certainty of my death tends to make me introspective.;NM35AAJUHA11102_.mp3
I wish that I had more time to turn you from the path you seem to have chosen.;NM35AAJUHA11103_.mp3
The choices I have made were necessary;
I wonder if that is true. For your sake, I hope that it is.;NM35AAJUHA11105_.mp3
But you have also fallen far from the ideals of the Jedi Order. Can you still do what is required of you?;NM35AAJUHA11111_.mp3
I WILL defeat Malak!;
Your conviction is... compelling. But also disturbing.;NM35AAJUHA11113_.mp3
Your steadfast desire for vengeance credits your perseverence, but I fear for you. It is too easy to give in completely to the dark side.;NM35AAJUHA11115_.mp3
I know I worry too much, and I know you may be irritated by my saying this, but do not fall the way I did. You have so much potential, I do not want you to waste it.;NM35AAJUHA11116_.mp3
I only wish that we had had more time... together...;NM35AAJUHA11124_.mp3
We will have time.;
It is too late to do anything now. We must do what we can to escape from here.;NM35AAJUHA11126_.mp3
When we have left, perhaps then we can see what the future holds for us.;NM35AAJUHA11127_.mp3
You are making me uncomfortable...;
But there is enough to worry about without my making it worse. Perhaps we can speak more of this later, once we leave this ship.;NM35AAJUHA11117_.mp3
When I get out of here, I will hunt Malak down like a dog.;
I can do anything. Starting with destroying this ship.;
I do not need you to judge me.;
If you will not listen to me, then to who? I respect your abilities, and I... I care for you...;NM35AAJUHA11107_.mp3
If you will not listen to me, then to who? I admire you greatly, and respect your abilities...;NM35AAJUHA11108_.mp3
We will have all the time in the world, Juhani.;
I hope that is true. Truly, I do.;NM35AAJUHA11110_.mp3
If I am going to die here then, I am glad to have stood by you.;NM35AAJUHA11119_.mp3
Do not worry, Juhani. We will escape.;
I do not favor our chances at all. But if you believe that we can... then maybe there is a possibility.;NM35AAJUHA11121_.mp3
Live or die, I shall stand by you as you need me.;NM35AAJUHA11122_.mp3
Let us leave this place then... If we can.;NM35AAJUHA11133_.mp3
And I am glad to have had you by my side.;
Less talk, more escaping.;
Yes. Yes, we should. Your focus on your work does you credit.;NM35AAJUHA11132_.mp3
Do not worry, we will escape.;
We are in a Sith Interdicter loaded with troops and Sith Jedi. I am not favoring of our chances.;NM35AAJUHA11135_.mp3
I will not let them take me.;
How... reassuring. I, though, would not have liked to die quite so soon.;NM35AAJUHA11137_.mp3
I feel I must apologize for the way I acted towards you before, in the grove. It was wrong of me.;NM35AAJUHA11001_.mp3
You thought the dark side had consumed you. It is nothing.;
I am sorry for attacking you. I am sorry for thinking you would only try to kill me.;NM35AAJUHA11004_.mp3
I hope that by helping you in your task I may redeem myself in your eyes... and in my own.;NM35AAJUHA11005_.mp3
Do not worry, Juhani. I forgive you.;
Thank you... It is most reassuring to know that you can forgive me, even though I tried to take your life.;NM35AAJUHA11007_.mp3
I can only hope that, in our time journeying together, I will succeed.;NM35AAJUHA11010_.mp3
I think it's going to take a lot for that to happen.;
It may. But I am prepared to do what it takes.;NM35AAJUHA11009_.mp3
Ha! Unlikely.;
You mock me! I will do what it takes to redeem myself in the eyes of my peers. I WILL succeed!;NM35AAJUHA11012_.mp3
I will prove myself to you and to everyone! I will be a faithful companion to you and Bastila as long as our journey may last.;NM35AAJUHA11013_.mp3
Damn right! Apologize!;
Next time you try something like that, I'll kill you.;
I realize you have justification, but that anger only leads to the dark side. Please do not fall into the same trap that caught me.;NM35AAJUHA11015_.mp3
I am not as weak as you, Juhani.;
The dark side is most devious and deceptive. It can find the smallest weakness to exploit.;NM35AAJUHA11017_.mp3
The dark side will not take me! I am too strong!;
I thought that too. But I was wrong...;NM35AAJUHA11019_.mp3
Have no fear, I recognize the danger.;
My Cathar blood seethes at the thought of that man still running free. I cannot stand still while I think about it, but... but I will not give in to the dark side either.;NM35AAJUHA11138_.mp3
He will pay for his crimes, though. He will most likely be following us... me. If we could find him first, then he may not be able to set in motion whatever he has in store for us.;NM35AAJUHA11139_.mp3
That man was a beast! A monster! I am glad that the galaxy is now rid of him, so that he may not harm others again.;NM35AAJUHA11140_.mp3
I do regret, though, that he did not die by my hand...;NM35AAJUHA11141_.mp3
It would have been wrong.;
I know. But must I always fear the lure of the dark side?;NM35AAJUHA11143_.mp3
But... it was for the best. I am glad that you stood by my side during this.;NM35AAJUHA11144_.mp3
We should continue our journeys now. No reason for staying here for this.;NM35AAJUHA11145_.mp3
What you did was best.;
You weren't strong enough to do it.;
I... I do not know anymore what I am strong enough for. I only take what comes to me and hope that I can handle it.;NM35AAJUHA11148_.mp3
The lure of the dark side will always be my strongest foe. I should have killed him.;NM35AAJUHA11149_.mp3
I felt statisfaction taking revenge for my people like that... but... but I should not have let my anger consume me so.;NM35AAJUHA11150_.mp3
You couldn't help it.;
But I could have! I should have...;NM35AAJUHA11152_.mp3
I must try harder in the future to resist the call of the dark side. I suppose I am fortunate that, in this case, he was deserving of such an end.;NM35AAJUHA11153_.mp3
We should continue on our way. I do not want to linger around here anymore.;NM35AAJUHA11156_.mp3
At least you regret it.;
Yes... Yes I do. I must try harder in the future to resist such urges. I suppose I am fortunate that, in this case, he was deserving of such an end.;NM35AAJUHA11155_.mp3
You did the right thing.;
No I didn't. I let my anger and passion consume me and did something rash. Something which leads me down the path to the dark side.;NM35AAJUHA11158_.mp3
But... I recognize this, and I am truly regretful that I committed this act. I shall not let it happen again.;NM35AAJUHA11159_.mp3
I suppose I was fortunate that, in this case, he was deserving of such an end.;NM35AAJUHA11160_.mp3
I have been watching you... and I cannot help but feel that you are becoming more distant.;NM35AAJUHA11161_.mp3
When we met it was you that convinced me to turn away from the lure of the dark side. But now it seems that you are falling into the trap that had caught me.;NM35AAJUHA11162_.mp3
Wha... ?;
No. Please. I must speak.;NM35AAJUHA11164_.mp3
When we first met I looked at you with contempt. You were some insect sent by the Jedi Council to eliminate me.;NM35AAJUHA11165_.mp3
But you were more powerful than I would ever have thought. It seemed so easy for you to overcome me.;NM35AAJUHA11166_.mp3
You were more of a challenge than you think.;
I think that you flatter me again, and I do not know why. I worry for you.;NM35AAJUHA11168_.mp3
I look and I see you turning away from the Code of the Jedi. I wonder if you can see it.;NM35AAJUHA11169_.mp3
I... I do not know... I fear that you may be starting to fall.;NM35AAJUHA11175_.mp3
If only there were some way I could turn you away from the path that you seem to be headed down...;NM35AAJUHA11176_.mp3
I wonder if it started when you met me in that grove. I wonder if it could be my fault.;NM35AAJUHA11177_.mp3
We each make our own choices, Juhani.;
That is true. But still I worry about the ones you make.;NM35AAJUHA11179_.mp3
But I have faith in you. I would follow you into battle with Malak himself. I will stand by your side.;NM35AAJUHA11180_.mp3
No, of course not.;
I wish I could believe that as you do.;NM35AAJUHA11182_.mp3
You overestimate your effect on me.;
Maybe I do. I have had reason to wonder recently if I have had any effect at all...;NM35AAJUHA11184_.mp3
My mission was only to cleanse the grove.;
That you did. You took away the dark taint that had been consuming me and restored me to the light. You took me away from there.;NM35AAJUHA11171_.mp3
But now... now I wonder what it is that you see in your own reflection.;NM35AAJUHA11172_.mp3
Yes, it was.;
And this is just the problem! You seem to revel in your power, use it far too frequently for your own gain.;NM35AAJUHA11174_.mp3
Shut the h...;
I... I have been watching you for some time. I wonder if you have noticed.;NM35AAJUHA11187_.mp3
I have been thinking of how far I had fallen, and how you exemplify the Code of the Jedi. I find my self ashamed.;NM35AAJUHA11188_.mp3
Ashamed?;
That I had so easily fallen to the dark side. That I could convince myself that by injuring my master I became a great force of evil in the galaxy.;NM35AAJUHA11190_.mp3
For my pride, my hubris. For the inner rage that all of my species feels. Sometimes I wish that I had not been born this way...;NM35AAJUHA11191_.mp3
You should not think that way.;
I am sorry. I start to talk thinking about how you stay strong to the path of virtue and justice, and I find myself whining again about my own inadequacies.;NM35AAJUHA11193_.mp3
The Council would be proud to see that you had learned your lessons so well.;NM35AAJUHA11194_.mp3
... As am I.;NM35AAJUHA11195_.mp3
You have nothing to be ashamed of.;
You cannot change how you were born.;
You should not be so hard on yourself.;
But I have so little to show when I compare myself to you... and that makes my shame even worse...;NM35AAJUHA11199_.mp3
I am not so great as that.;
Your power in the Force is strong, and I can sense no taint of the dark side in you. That makes my shame even worse...;NM35AAJUHA11201_.mp3
I have been thinking about our journey together, and how we are more similar than I had first thought.;NM35AAJUHA11202_.mp3
We are not that similar...;
But similar enough. We have had many of the same sort of experiences.;NM35AAJUHA11213_.mp3
I know how hard it was for me to resist the call of the dark side, and I know that you have suffered those pains as well.;NM35AAJUHA11204_.mp3
The continual struggle between restraint and freedom... light and darkness. It is hard for me with my Cathar blood to resist sometimes.;NM35AAJUHA11205_.mp3
You must not fall to the dark side again, Juhani.;
I do resist. I look to you and see that we are in this together, and that you are resisting as well. That gives me strength.;NM35AAJUHA11207_.mp3
I think the Jedi Council would be proud to see that you are holding up so well in spite of the hardships you have endured.;NM35AAJUHA11208_.mp3
Remain strong!;
Do not force me to have to kill you.;
I am nothing like you!;
Heh. I did not mean in appearances, but we have had some of the same experiences.;NM35AAJUHA11215_.mp3
Yes? What is it?;NM35AAJUHA11216_.mp3
Is something wrong?;
I... have been bothered by something of late...;NM35AAJUHA11256_.mp3
Don't lay all your problems on me.;
Fine! Then I will not! What does it matter to you if my homeworld was wiped out by your actions! Who cares if it is because of you that everyone I knew as a child is dead!;NM35AAJUHA11267_.mp3
You mean...;
Taris! It was Taris that the Sith destroyed to try to kill you and your precious Bastila! Taris, my homeworld!;NM35AAJUHA11269_.mp3
I am sorry, Juhani, I did not know.;
If it were not for you and Bastila, the Sith would have never had reason to destroy that world! It was your fault for being there, and your fault for rescuing Bastila!;NM35AAJUHA11271_.mp3
Without your intervention the Sith would have had no cause to lay waste to my childhood!;NM35AAJUHA11272_.mp3
I...;
Just let me vent my anger! I need someone to blame... something... anything!;NM35AAJUHA11274_.mp3
I hated that world, yet everything I learned as a child I learned there. It is as much a part of me as the air I breathe.;NM35AAJUHA11275_.mp3
I have this ache inside me where all my childhood memories lay, and I find your face there with them. If it was not for you, that world would still exist!;NM35AAJUHA11276_.mp3
I am sorry, Juhani. There was no way to prevent it.;
I... I know... I suppose I realized that.;NM35AAJUHA11278_.mp3
But it is so hard to lose your entire past. You would not understand.;NM35AAJUHA11279_.mp3
It will be alright, Juhani.;
Yes... Yes I suppose it will. As long as we remain focused on our task it will.;NM35AAJUHA11281_.mp3
I am sorry. I will try not to distract you in the future with my trivial experiences. We should stop for now.;NM35AAJUHA11282_.mp3
You're right. I don't.;
I suppose that is to be expected. Everything will turn out for the best as long as we remain focused on our task.;NM35AAJUHA11284_.mp3
Calm yourself. Remember the Jedi Code.;
There is no emotion. There is peace.;NM35AAJUHA11286_.mp3
... I suppose you did what you had to... and it could not have been avoided. The Republic needs you and Bastila. Maybe needs you more than it needed Taris.;NM35AAJUHA11287_.mp3
I have no excuse. I did what I needed to.;
But...;
We...;
Bastila is critical to defeating the Sith.;
Oh yes, I have been told all about her vaunted powers with the Force. Her Battle Meditation that can turn the tide of any conflict.;NM35AAJUHA11292_.mp3
Well if it could, then why could Taris not have been saved?;NM35AAJUHA11293_.mp3
Sometimes you need to make some sacrifices.;
The sacrifice of an entire world is too much for any cause! How would you feel if Dantooine or Alderaan or somesuch world were destroyed?;NM35AAJUHA11297_.mp3
Would you be so callous then?;NM35AAJUHA11298_.mp3
Well... yeah, probably.;
You... you animal! It is only because of the Council's will that I stay with you. But if you betray us, I may decide that falling to the dark side will be a small price to pay for letting my anger run loose.;NM35AAJUHA11305_.mp3
I thought you hated your homeworld...;
It was my home!;NM35AAJUHA11301_.mp3
I did not know the Sith would destroy Taris.;
What did you think would happen by aiding the Republic?;NM35AAJUHA11295_.mp3
What are you saying?;
*Yawn*;
Taris! It was Taris that the Sith destroyed to try to kill you and your precious Bastila! Taris, my homeworld! Not that you care!;NM35AAJUHA11304_.mp3
You sure someone else can't help you?;
Someone else is not responsible for wiping out my homeworld by their actions. But who cares if it is because of you that everyone I have ever known off Dantooine is dead!;NM35AAJUHA11307_.mp3
I was remembering Taris...;NM35AAJUHA11309_.mp3
I am sorry, Juhani.;
No, it is alright. I think I am over the worst of it. I apologize again for lashing out at you. It was not your fault.;NM35AAJUHA11311_.mp3
It was a horrible place to have to live. At least in the lower cities where the non-humans tended to get relegated.;NM35AAJUHA11313_.mp3
Living for years in a place with no sun, living off the trash dropped from the upper levels, and the meager pay doing back-breaking labor.;NM35AAJUHA11314_.mp3
And those rakghouls...;
There was always the danger of rakghouls coming up from the sewers, or more mundane predators living and working in the area.;NM35AAJUHA11316_.mp3
My family and I struggled each and every day to make something of our lives, but we could only go so far.;NM35AAJUHA11317_.mp3
Taxes from the corrupt government, more fees from the gangs controlling the streets, and whatever was left paying for what food and medical supplies we could afford.;NM35AAJUHA11318_.mp3
No one would help you?;
And of course there was the constant bigotry and hate from the more affluent and human citizens. Lording their wealth over us living below.;NM35AAJUHA11321_.mp3
Every once in a while a rich human would come down through the lower levels with his droid entourage just to see how the 'wildlife' lived... and laughed at the mockeries that were our successes.;NM35AAJUHA11322_.mp3
But I have come to meet many decent humans in my travels since those days. Indeed, some of the greatest people I have ever met are human.;NM35AAJUHA11323_.mp3
Like who?;
The... the Jedi who encouraged me to join the Order, the one who was with the group going to fight the Mandalorians, she was human.;NM35AAJUHA11325_.mp3
I... I suppose I see something of her in you when I look...;NM35AAJUHA11326_.mp3
I am sorry... I am getting away from my point. If there even was one...;NM35AAJUHA11327_.mp3
Sometimes I curse the day my parents fled to Taris. But then again, if they had not, I would not be where I am today.;NM35AAJUHA11328_.mp3
Your parents?;
Another story for another time. For now we must continue our own epic: To save the galaxy, if we can.;NM35AAJUHA11330_.mp3
Fled? Fled from where?;
And how did you arrive on Dantooine?;
One of the Jedi you met?;
Decent humans are hard to find.;
I have noticed that. But the Jedi order seems to have collected a fair number.;NM35AAJUHA11336_.mp3
How could such a government last?;
It did not. But only because of the Jedi who came. It was very bad.;NM35AAJUHA11339_.mp3
With no money to spare for any amenities, even the Enclave on Dantooine seems a paradise in comparison.;NM35AAJUHA11320_.mp3
How did you survive?;
That's horrible!;
I do not remember seeing any of your race on Taris...;
There were none. Bad enough to be a race that is feared and hated by humans, but to be one that is strange and different even among non-humans?;NM35AAJUHA11343_.mp3
But living was hard enough without the stigma of being from a lost race.;NM35AAJUHA11344_.mp3
What about it?;
Not this again...;
You mock my pain! It was a horrible place to live... we had to go through hell every day just to survive, and you think it bothering me is an irritation?!;NM35AAJUHA11346_.mp3
Your insensitivity speaks ill of your qualities as a Jedi. Still, as the Council ordered me to do, I shall accompany you, but expect no great sympathy for your plights.;NM35AAJUHA11347_.mp3
I am thinking of what happened on Korriban...;NM35AAJUHA11348_.mp3
I am appalled at the things the Sith did there.;NM35AAJUHA11349_.mp3
I cannot help but notice that your manner is increasingly like that of the Sith...;NM35AAJUHA11350_.mp3
What I did was necessary.;
But I do not believe it was. We should have been able to find another way.;NM35AAJUHA11352_.mp3
I should have helped you find another path. I should have tried harder to stop you.;NM35AAJUHA11353_.mp3
This is war. We do not have time for niceties.;
And I am sure that is exactly the same justification that Malak and Revan used before they fell...;NM35AAJUHA11355_.mp3
I am not Revan!;
Your overconfidence may yet be your downfall. I will still stand by your side, though.;NM35AAJUHA11357_.mp3
I only wish that what I see meant more to you... that I could turn you back...;NM35AAJUHA11358_.mp3
Will you try? ... For me?;NM35AAJUHA11359_.mp3
Get out of my face!;
I... see.;NM35AAJUHA11362_.mp3
I will still stand by you, as I have said before. I can only hope that when the time comes, you will do what is right.;NM35AAJUHA11363_.mp3
No. I am sorry.;
I will try, Juhani.;
Thank you. I am sure we can succeed together.;NM35AAJUHA11365_.mp3
I can only hope that when the time comes, you will do what is right.;NM35AAJUHA11366_.mp3
I will prove stronger than them!;
I recognize the danger.;
I tire of your criticism.;
Maybe I should have done differently.;
Maybe you should have... The fact that you think so gives me hope.;NM35AAJUHA11371_.mp3
I hope that you will return to path of the Jedi... to me.;NM35AAJUHA11372_.mp3
Who are you to criticize me?!;
I am your companion. I am a fellow Jedi. I only seek to ensure the success of our mission.;NM35AAJUHA11374_.mp3
I'm in charge and I'll do what I want.;
To see such horrible, warped rituals that the Sith practice... It is unnerving.;NM35AAJUHA11376_.mp3
"I can truly see now why we must defeat Malak as quickly as possible; to prevent that sort of society from consuming the entire galaxy.";NM35AAJUHA11377_.mp3
It angers me to think of it.;NM35AAJUHA11378_.mp3
Do not give in to your anger.;
Yes... yes, I understand: Do not let my passions and impulses rule me. Remain calm and serene.;NM35AAJUHA11382_.mp3
But I fear that when I am confronted with these monsters I will lose myself.;NM35AAJUHA11383_.mp3
I think that I may yet fall to the dark side by the very desire to fight it.;NM35AAJUHA11384_.mp3
Now that's irony.;
Yes, it could be... if you look at it callously enough. But I cannot.;NM35AAJUHA11386_.mp3
I know, I should not worry. I am grateful for your support in this matter.;NM35AAJUHA11388_.mp3
It seems that whenever I have a problem I turn to you. Sometimes... sometimes I almost seem to want problems, just for the chance...;NM35AAJUHA11389_.mp3
But I am sorry, I should not speak of this.;NM35AAJUHA11390_.mp3
It is a relief to have someone to turn to when I am feeling uncertain.;NM35AAJUHA11391_.mp3
Do not fear, Juhani.;
You should not keep worrying like this.;
It angers me as well.;
We are doing our job. Do not make it personal.;
Nothing right now. Maybe later.;
Of course. I will assist you as I am able.;NM35AAJUHA11394_.mp3
I do not have the answer to your question.;NM35AAJUHA11843_.mp3
A Jedi should not use the Force for personal gain. We are better than that.;NGLOBEJUHA11851_.mp3
The dark side dwells in us all, but you cannot give in to your baser instincts like this!;NGLOBEJUHA11852_.mp3
*whisper* You should treat your power with respect, not use the Force on a whim like it is some toy!;NGLOBEJUHA11853_.mp3
*whisper* The Jedi should be protectors of the weak! You shame us all by your actions here.;NM25AAHURT03072_.mp3
You are a representative of the Jedi Order. When you behave this way you disgrace us all!;NM17AA05ME02071_.mp3
This is how we Jedi should always act: with honor.;NM17AA03SH01167_.mp3
Zaerdra tells me you have the swoop engine accelerator. This is excellent news.;NM11AAGADO02000_.mp3
I was beginning to wonder if you would make it. The race is tomorrow, and my mechanics need time to install the prototype into the swoop engine of our bike.;NM11AAGADO02133_.mp3
Okay, I lived up to my end of the deal. Now you better come through!;
Don't worry, I'm a man of my word. I promised you could ride in the swoop race under the Hidden Bek banner, and I'm still going to let you do that.;NM11AAGADO02135_.mp3
And I'm even going to go one better - I'm going to let you ride the swoop bike with the prototype accelerator installed on it. Without it, you won't stand a chance.;NM11AAGADO02137_.mp3
Gadon! You can't be serious! We need one of our best riders on that bike! We can't let some rookie take the prototype engine into the race!;NM11AAGADO02139_.mp3
Don't worry, Gadon - I'll win that race!;
"I have to be honest with you - there's a reason I'm letting you take the prototype engine. The accelerator isn't stable; there's a good chance it could explode during the race.";NM11AAGADO02141_.mp3
I can't ask one of my own riders to take the risk - they'll be running unmodified swoops in the race. You'll be the only one using the prototype.;NM11AAGADO02143_.mp3
If you can complete the track before the accelerator overheats then you'll win for the Beks. If you die, then one of my other riders could still come through for me.;NM11AAGADO02145_.mp3
Sounds like you've got all your bases covered.;
You don't get to be leader of a swoop gang if you don't know how to work all the angles.;NM11AAGADO02147_.mp3
Okay, I'm ready for the race.;
You can stay here tonight. The mechanics need time to install the accelerator on the engine, so you won't be able to practice your riding.;NM11AAGADO02149_.mp3
But I've got good instincts, and you have the look of a racer about you. Just try to relax and in the morning we'll take you to the swoop track.;NM11AAGADO02151_.mp3
[You spend a restless night in the Bek base. In the morning, one of the Beks takes you to the swoop racing pits, where only racers and mechanics are allowed to go.];
Suddenly I'm not so sure about this.;
Without that prototype you don't stand a chance of winning. And if you don't win you can't get Bastila back - none of the other riders will give her up. This is your only chance.;NM11AAGADO02154_.mp3
Why are you doing this, Gadon?;
Zaerdra's right, Gadon. One of your own riders should get that swoop bike.;
Not so fast, Gadon. I want a reward for recovering this.;
A reward? I'm blind, but I'm not stupid. Your reward is the chance to ride in the big swoop race so you can win Bastila's freedom.;NM11AAGADO02158_.mp3
We had a deal, so I expect you to honor it. If we don't honor our deals, what's to stop me from just taking the prototype from you and leaving you for dead?;NM11AAGADO02160_.mp3
Okay, I see your point.;
You'll have to forgive Zaerdra. Ever since Brejik and the Vulkars began this war against us, she's been a little over-zealous in her security duties.;NM11AAGADO02002_.mp3
The problems with the Sith haven't helped things. Zaerdra seems to forget that I know how to look after myself! Now, how can I help you?;NM11AAGADO02004_.mp3
You have problems with the Sith?;
A foreign army invades Taris, declares martial law and locks down all travel to and from the planet? You damn well bet I have a problem with that!;NM11AAGADO02006_.mp3
If the Sith ever moved in down here all the swoop gangs would unite against them. We'd use hit and run guerrilla tactics to pick them off... their casualties would be enormous!;NM11AAGADO02008_.mp3
Don't fool yourself. The Sith would never commit to that kind of operation. They'd... they'd probably do something much more grand and deadly.;NM11AAGADO02010_.mp3
But so far the Sith have stayed out of the Lower City and our strength is wasted on this stupid gang war! I tried to explain this to Brejik, but he and his Vulkars won't listen.;NM11AAGADO02012_.mp3
I need information on those Republic escape pods that crashed in the Undercity.;
The escape pods? You know, I heard the Sith have been asking around the Upper City about them as well... but you don't look like you're with the Sith.;NM11AAGADO02014_.mp3
They might be spies, Gadon! They might be working for the Sith!;NM11AAGADO02016_.mp3
Calm down, Zaerdra. If the Sith thought we knew anything useful they'd have a battalion of troops kicking down our door. No, I think this offworlder has his own agenda.;NM11AAGADO02018A.mp3
Don't worry... I'm not working for the Sith.;
I suppose I could tell you what I know. It's not like it could do any harm to me or my gang... but it might cause problems for the Vulkars, and that's okay in my book.;NM11AAGADO02021_.mp3
The Vulkars stripped those pods clean within hours after they landed. It's too bad we didn't get there first, considering what my spies reported the Vulkars found.;NM11AAGADO02023_.mp3
A female Republic officer named Bastila survived the crash. We Beks don't believe in intergalactic slavery, but the Vulkars aren't so picky. They took her prisoner.;NM11AAGADO02025_.mp3
Bastila's a slave? What will happen to her now?;
Normally the Vulkars would take a captured slave and sell them for a nice profit to Davik or an off-world slaver. But a Republic officer is no ordinary catch.;NM11AAGADO02027_.mp3
They still think Bastila is just a Republic Officer. That could work to our advantage. Maybe she'll even figure out a way to escape from the Vulkar base on her own.;NM11AAGADO02173_.mp3
She's too valuable to leave with the Vulkar scum at the base. Brejik's probably got your Republic friend hidden away somewhere safe until the big swoop race. You'll never find her.;NM11AAGADO02031_.mp3
There has to be some way I can help her!;
I'm afraid your friend has become a pawn in Brejik's game to take over the Lower City. He's offered her up as the Vulkar's share of the prize in the annual swoop gang race.;NM11AAGADO02034_.mp3
By putting up such a valuable prize Brejik hopes to win the loyalty of some of the smaller gangs. Their numbers will allow him to finally destroy me and my followers.;NM11AAGADO02036_.mp3
So how do you propose we go about rescuing Bastila, then? We can't fight all the gangs.;NM11AAGADO02038_.mp3
The only hope you have of rescuing Bastila is to somehow win the big season opener of the swoop race.;NM11AAGADO02040_.mp3
Gadon - can you help me with this?;
I might be able to help you with this, if you'd be willing to help us. We both have something to gain here - and much to lose.;NM11AAGADO02042_.mp3
What are you proposing?;
The swoop race is for the Lower City gangs only. I could sponsor you as a rider for the Hidden Beks this year. If you win the race, you'll win your friend's freedom.;NM11AAGADO02044_.mp3
But first you have to do something for me. My mechanics have developed an accelerator for a swoop engine. A bike with the accelerator installed can beat any other swoop out there!;NM11AAGADO02046_.mp3
But the Vulkars stole the prototype from us. They plan to use it to guarantee a victory in this year's swoop race. I need you to break into their base and steal it back.;NM11AAGADO02048_.mp3
How am I supposed to get inside the Vulkar base?;
Getting into the Vulkar base won't be easy - the front doors are locked tight. But I know someone who might be able to get you in the back way - Mission Vao.;NM11AAGADO02050_.mp3
Mission? Gadon, you can't be serious! She's just a kid - how is she supposed to help them with this?;NM11AAGADO02052_.mp3
Mission's explored every step of every back alley in the Lower City. Plus she knows the Undercity sewers better than anyone. If anyone can get inside the Vulkar base, it's her.;NM11AAGADO02054_.mp3
Where can I find Mission?;
She and her Wookiee friend Zaalbar are always looking to stir up a little excitement. They like to go exploring in the Undercity, despite the dangers.;NM11AAGADO02056_.mp3
Your best bet is to look for her in the Undercity. But you'll need some way past the Sith guard post at the elevator.;NM11AAGADO02058_.mp3
I've got some Sith uniforms to disguise myself.;
A simple disguise might have worked on the Upper City guard, but the security down here is much tougher. You'll need the proper papers to get past him.;NM11AAGADO02060_.mp3
Luckily my gang ambushed one of the Sith patrols headed down to the Undercity. They never made it, and their security papers fell into my hands.;NM11AAGADO02062_.mp3
Since we're working together now I suppose I could give them to you in exchange for your uniforms. With the security papers you won't need a disguise anyway.;NM11AAGADO02064_.mp3
Forget it - I'm not giving up my disguise!;
The disguise won't help you get into the Undercity. Besides, soon the Sith will realize they've got a few too many uniforms missing and the only way to get around will be the security papers.;NM11AAGADO02066_.mp3
What do you want with the Sith uniforms?;
I like to be prepared. Eventually the Sith are going to try to drive us out of the Undercity. Sith disguises might give my people the edge we need in a crucial battle!;NM11AAGADO02068_.mp3
Okay - I'll trade the uniforms for the papers.;
Good choice. Thanks for the uniforms. You won't need them with these security papers anyway. Now, is there anything else I can do for you?;NM11AAGADO02070_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;
Your time would probably be better spent going after the prototype swoop engine the Vulkars stole from us, but I'll answer your questions if I can.;NM11AAGADO02097_.mp3
What's up with your freaky eyes, old man?;
Uh, very tactful. Are you itching for a fight or something?;NM11AAGADO02101_.mp3
How dare you?! I should kill you where you stand!;NM11AAGADO02103_.mp3
Calm down, Zaerdra... I'm not ashamed of what I have become. As you can see, I lost my eyes in a swoop racing crash. I rely on these artificial replacements to see now.;NM11AAGADO02105_.mp3
But my blindness was not the worst consequence of my accident. My affliction was what eventually led to this war between my Beks and the Vulkars.;NM11AAGADO02107_.mp3
What do you mean?;
When I lost my sight in the swoop bike accident everyone assumed I would step down as leader of the Hidden Beks and let Brejik - my most trusted follower - take over.;NM11AAGADO02109_.mp3
But with my occular implants I can still see well enough to lead this gang, and I knew Brejik wasn't ready to take over yet. Unfortunately, Brejik didn't agree with me.;NM11AAGADO02111_.mp3
In a rage he left to join our arch rivals, the Black Vulkars. A lot of the younger gang members followed him, and soon he and his followers had taken control of the Vulkar gang.;NM11AAGADO02113_.mp3
But why start a gang war with the Beks?;
Brejik is a proud man. My decision was a public humiliation for him. Maybe if I had stepped down this gang war could have been avoided.;NM11AAGADO02115_.mp3
Don't fool yourself, Gadon. Brejik wants to control the Lower City gangs. If you'd stepped down, he'd have led the Beks against the Vulkars. He wanted this war, one way or another.;NM11AAGADO02117_.mp3
*sigh* I know you're right, Zaerdra. Brejik won't rest until I am dead and the Beks are no more, but it's hard to accept the truth of his betrayal.;NM11AAGADO02119_.mp3
I want to ask you something else.;
I don't see any harm in that. What did you want to know?;NM11AAGADO02098_.mp3
Is there something wrong with your eyes?;
You said you were having problems with the Sith?;
I need to get inside the Black Vulkar base.;
Are you crazy? The Vulkars shoot people on sight in the streets! Why would you be stupid enough to try and get inside their base?;NM11AAGADO02091_.mp3
"Think about it, Zaerdra: the Republic officer the Vulkars captured; all the escape pods crashing on Taris; an off-worlder desperate to get inside the Vulkar base. It's obvious.";NM11AAGADO02093_.mp3
Of course! You're a soldier who survived the crash! That's why you want into the base - to rescue that Republic officer before Brejik sells her to some intergalactic slaver!;NM11AAGADO02095_.mp3
I have to get in there and rescue her!;
Why are Brejik and the Vulkars at war with you?;
Is there any way off this planet?;
Not while the Sith quarantine is in place. Even the fastest smugglers' ships can't break the blockade of the fleet surrounding the planet without the proper launch codes.;NM11AAGADO02124_.mp3
Any ship leaving the Taris atmosphere without the proper codes would be instantly disintegrated by blaster cannons fired by the Sith fleet's automated targeting systems.;NM11AAGADO02126_.mp3
I'll be going now.;
Feel free to come back anytime. We're not like those Vulkar savages - strangers are welcome in the Bek base.;NM11AAGADO02128_.mp3
Sounds like Brejik is acting like a spoiled brat.;
Where can I find Mission again?;
I have the accelerator right here.;
I'll be back when I get the prototype accelerator.;
I suggest you hurry. The swoop race is coming up, and we want you to have time to practice before the race.;NM11AAGADO02167_.mp3
I got past the Upper City guard no problem.;
Isn't there someone else who can help me?;
"Don't underestimate Mission or her Wookiee friend Zaalbar. They're a formidable pair; tough enough to go exploring the Undercity by themselves!";NM11AAGADO02073_.mp3
How do I know you'll live up to your end of the bargain?;
My word is my bond. Everybody in the Lower City knows my reputation. Besides, you really don't have a choice. I'm your only ticket into the swoop race.;NM11AAGADO02076_.mp3
Forget it - I'm not interested.;
Don't be a fool. You have to win the swoop race to save your friend, and that means breaking into the Vulkar base and getting my prototype accelerator back.;NM11AAGADO02078_.mp3
I might help you... if the price is right.;
You're in no position to bargain here. Without my help, you don't have a hope of getting this Bastila back. You should at least listen to what I have to say.;NM11AAGADO02081_.mp3
I don't work with gangs, Gadon.;
You really don't have any other choice. Not if you want to get Bastila back. You should at least listen to what I have to say.;NM11AAGADO02084_.mp3
How do I know I can trust you?;
How do I enter this swoop race?;
But I don't even have a swoop bike.;
Swoop race? What does that have to do with it?;
Slavers everywhere. As if it was just another trade.;
Do you know anything about this or not?;
Calm down, Zaerdra. If the Sith thought we knew anything useful they'd have a battalion of troops kicking down our door. No, I think this offworlder has her own agenda.;NM11AAGADO02018B.mp3
You have returned. Do you have the prototype swoop engine accelerator with you?;NM11AAGADO02130_.mp3
I don't have it yet.;
Time is running out, you know. If you don't come up with that accelerator you won't have a chance against the Vulkars in the swoop race.;NM11AAGADO02163_.mp3
If you want to save this Bastila then you better get that accelerator back from the Vulkars.;NM11AAGADO02165_.mp3
Back again? At least this time Zaerdra didn't verbally assault you for coming to see me.;NM11AAGADO02169_.mp3
I trust her with my life, but she does take her guard duties rather seriously ever since this war with Brejik and the Vulkars began. Now, what do you need from me?;NM11AAGADO02171_.mp3
You... you inhuman monster!;NM35AAREPP09000_.mp3
Wait! I'm not a Sith!;
As if I would ever believe that!;NM35AAREPP09002_.mp3
I'll kill you before you kill me! I swear it!!;NM35AAREPP09004_.mp3
You'll pay for what you've done! AAHHHHH!!;NM35AAREPP09005_.mp3
I won't be an easy kill for you, Sith!!;NM35AAREPP09006_.mp3
Die! Die!!;NM35AAREPP09007_.mp3
Run! I've freed you!;
And let you hunt me down? NEVER!!;NM35AAREPP09009_.mp3
What, so you can have sport with me? AAHHHHH!!;NM35AAREPP09010_.mp3
This should be fun!;
You... you're going to make me fight, aren't you? Then... then fight I will!!;NM35AAREPP09012_.mp3
Come and get me, if that's what you want!!;NM35AAREPP09013_.mp3
You want me... to fight you?;NM35AAREPP09014_.mp3
You give me a weapon, Sith... I'm going to use it.;NM35AAREPP09015_.mp3
I... your kind has killed everyone I know!;NM35AAREPP09016_.mp3
I'll kill you!!;NM35AAREPP09017_.mp3
We will thank you for helping.;
We are slaves here to the People of Sand.;
Your help will be fairly traded.;
We under Iziz will thank you for helping.;
The rakghouls are increasing in number. We cannot even venture beyond the gates for food without being attacked!;NM04AAOUTW20000_.mp3
Thank you... my husband was one of those banished because he had the rakghoul disease. If you hadn't cured him, I would have never seen him again!;NM04AAOUTW20002_.mp3
The rakghouls will devour us all, unless we starve to death first.;NM04AAOUTW20004_.mp3
I've helped you all I'm going to. Any more and the Commander will have me shot. Leave me alone.;NM24AAPGEN07000_.mp3
[Force Persuade] You want to leave. Make a break for it.;
[Success] Maybe you're right... maybe I should make a break for it.;NM24AAPGEN07019_.mp3
That was beneath you. I hope in the future you will strive to be better than this.;NGLOBEBAST06900_.mp3
You are a representative of the Jedi Order. When you behave this way you disgrace us all!;NM17AA05ME02071_.mp3
Hmph. That trick would never work on a Mandalorian. Our minds are not so weak and easily twisted.;NGLOBECAND03473_.mp3
Why did you do that? Sometimes... sometimes I just can't understand how you can be so cruel.;NGLOBECART04933_.mp3
Hey, why'd you have to do that? That was just mean!;NGLOBEMISS13302_.mp3
Statement: Well done, master. You're my kind of owner!;NGLOBEHHKD07556_.mp3
[Failure] What are you talking about? I don't want any such thing! Leave me alone!;NM24AAPGEN07002_.mp3
You'll do as I say or you'll regret it.;
Are you threatening me? You're asking for a fight with all of us. I don't need more things trying to kill me down here.;NM24AAPGEN07004_.mp3
That's too bad. I'm going to kill you all!;
We're under attack!;NM24AAPGEN07053_.mp3
I'm leaving.;
Good. I don't need the trouble.;NM24AAPGEN07006_.mp3
That isn't good enough. I need more, or else.;
You want anything you'll have to talk to the commander. He's in charge of our harvesting here.;NM24AAPGEN07007_.mp3
I'd rather ask about you. Why are you here?;
Why am I here? I'm here because this is where the Commander told me to stand. And that's all there is to it.;NM24AAPGEN07009_.mp3
I'm just a guard for this emitter. Why couldn't they have just equipped this lump of tech with a blaster and left me at home?;NM24AAPGEN07011_.mp3
Let's talk about the emitter you're guarding.;
What do you want to know about that? It's just one of five or so sonic emitters protecting the camp.;NM24AAPGEN07047_.mp3
[Persuade] So, if someone shut them down, you could leave.;
[Success] I don't like being here, that's for sure. I suppose you could... take this code and shut down the emitter I'm guarding.;NM24AAPGEN07036_.mp3
Enough of those emitters go down and the camp will have to move out. But I never said anything.;NM24AAPGEN07038_.mp3
"[Failure] It's ""friendly"" people like you that recruited me into this mess. I'm keeping an eye on you, that's for sure.";NM24AAPGEN07039_.mp3
I want to go back to my other questions.;
I'm not here because I know stuff. I handle a blaster well enough to guard this emitter, and that's it. Talk to the Commander.;NM24AAPGEN07013_.mp3
This is a dangerous place. Could I persuade you to leave?;
Don't you start with me! I don't know what you said to that other guy, but I'm not risking getting killed!;NM24AAPGEN07015_.mp3
Now leave me alone before the Commander gets any ideas.;NM24AAPGEN07017_.mp3
No more dangerous than walking out on the commander. He'd kill me for disobeying orders.;NM24AAPGEN07022_.mp3
You'll answer what I tell you to answer!;
Are you threatening me? Unless you want a fight with all of us I'd suggest you change your tone.;NM24AAPGEN07049_.mp3
Besides, enough things down here want to kill me. I don't need to add you to the list.;NM24AAPGEN07051_.mp3
Let's just go back to my other questions.;
What do these emitters do?;
They generate a sonic barrier that allows us to stay in this wonderful location. It keeps the big predators away.;NM24AAPGEN07030_.mp3
I don't know how it works, really. I just know that if they go down, the camp would be overrun.;NM24AAPGEN07032_.mp3
So only the emitters are keeping you here?;
What of it?;NM24AAPGEN07034_.mp3
[Force Persuade] Tell me how to shut down the emitters.;
Maybe you could help me shut it down? For, say, 200 credits?;
That sounds like a fair deal to me. Here, use this code to access the one I'm guarding.;NM24AAPGEN07044_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;
Quit your whining and answer my questions!;
I asked you! You'll answer my questions!;
Okay, okay, there's no need to get like that. The Commander just prefers everyone to go through him first.;NM24AAPGEN07059_.mp3
What do you want? I don't want to get on the commander's bad side, so just leave me alone.;NM24AAPGEN07061_.mp3
I heard about that big fight on the dunes. You're the talk of the lodge. Killed a dragon... how about that.;
Do you have anything for sale or trade?;
I'm sorry, but I'm not allowed to even look at what you have until I see a hunting license. Czerka Corporation rules.;
The other hunters all have theirs. I can't make exceptions or I'll get shut down.;
What do you do in here?;
This is a hunting lodge. I purchase what the sportsmen bring in. It's not a bad little job.;
I've got some questions about hunting.;
Well, I reckon you already know everything I'd tell you. I mean, you killed a dragon. The craft of hunting doesn't get bigger than that.;
What is there to hunt on Tatooine?;
Most of our boys confine themselves to hunting wraid. Large fleshy beasts, as tall as a man. Er... a tall man, too.;
Desert wraid have a large bone plate on their head that I pay well for, but that's not where the real glory of the hunt is.;
You've already taken the big prize. Imagine that, taking down a big bull dragon. It'll be a while before anyone tops that.;
Why do I need a license?;
You need a license because nobody gets out of the city without one. Czerka Corporation uses it to keep track of people.;
They want people to know that if they step outside the gates, they are on their own. Only serious hunters pay the 200 credit fee.;
Once you have a license, I'll pay for whatever spoils of the hunt you bring back. I have off-world buyers that take them.;
Would you consider lowering the fee?;
Well, that's not up to me, now is it? You'd have to talk with the people down at the Czerka office in the center of town.;
Let's go back to my first questions.;
All right then. Just keep it brief, will you?;
I have something to sell you.;
So I see. That's the biggest desert wraid skull plate I've seen in a season. Whoever got that was a skilled hunter.;
I'll give a premium price on that one. I've a buyer that put in a special request. Does 500 credits sound fair?;
Yes, that will do nicely.;
I thought it would. Do you have anything else to sell?;
I have a dragon pearl to sell.;
Well, that is impressive. I don't get many of them. Hardly ever. They comand a fine price.;
I have dragon pearls to sell.;
I have a wraid plate to sell.;
Ah, the bread and butter of the hunter. I'll take whatever you have off your hands for a fair price.;
I have wraid plates to sell.;
That's it for now.;
All right. Thanks for your business.;
I have a dragon pearl to sell instead.;
I have dragon pearls to sell instead.;
I have a regular wraid plate as well.;
Very well, but talk to me again about that big plate if you want to sell it. I'll want to look closely at it.;
I have regular wraid plates to sell you.;
Never mind.;
Come back when you actually have something. Don't waste my time.;
Do you? Well, let's have a look.;
I want to ask about Tatooine.;
Not much to tell. Barren place. Can't support much, but I have managed to get some off-world hunters to show up.;
I suppose there's trouble here, like anywhere else, but you'll have to ask someone else about that. I keep to myself.;
Anything out of the ordinary happening?;
Besides you killing a dragon? I suppose there's the destruction of Taris. Seems real far away, though.;
I'm not surprised something like it happened. I remember the Exar Kun war, and how Sith and the Jedi fought across worlds.;
Don't have much interest in either group. Both act like they're above my concerns, and I guess they are.;
Know about anything more local?;
Ah, Czerka Corporation is always complaining about Sand People. I stay out of it. We hunt animals, not people.;
And I guess the Jawas are being pushed around again. At least, that's what I think they said. Tough to tell sometimes.;
You'll have to talk to these groups yourself for more. I keep to myself.;
I have to go. Goodbye.;
I'll be here. I keep hunter's hours. Fazza's is always open.;
You mean here on Tatooine or just in general? I heard about the destruction of Taris. Don't know anything specific.;
You've probably heard about the big prize, the krayt dragon. The most fearsome predator in the system, they are.;
If you could find one, and I doubt you will, I'll buy the stones polished in their gizzard, the dragon pearls.;
The dragons are rare, then?;
You'd think it'd be easier to find such a gigantic creature. Komad's father took one down, but that was years ago.;
What was so special about Komad's father?;
He'd been a hunter for years, using strict traditional methods. Komad is just like him. Maybe he'll show you a thing or two out on the dunes.;
Where could I find Komad?;
That's easy enough, he's standing right over there. He's usually here or out on the dunes.;
Where can I find this Komad?;
If he's not here he's probably out scouting the dunes. He's been to the Eastern Dune sea, but I don't know how you'd get there.;
I'll answer what I can, but you've already got yourself a license. You should be out on the dunes.;
You'll want to know how to get in on it. Just pay 200 credits for a license down at the Czerka office. No license, no hunting.;
I might have something. Wouldn't be much of a lodge if I couldn't keep the hunters stocked.;
Well, a new face. Come to test your skill on the endless dunes of Tatooine? Fazza's lodge is the place to arrange it.;
This world may not have much, but it does have the meanest predators this side of the Galactic Rim. A hunter's paradise.;
You run this lodge for the hunters?;
Well, now, did I see you take the big prize in the last round of races on Manaan? What brings you here now?;
Careful if you're doing a bit of hunting now, friend. You get hurt, you'll lose your shirt paying for kolto. Don't know why it's so expensive.;
Hello again. Hey, you heard that Czerka is running scared away from Kashyyyk? I'll bet the local office won't say a word about it.;
You hunt off-world much? Careful out on Korriban. Word is the Sith are fighting each other, though I suppose that may be normal for them.;
Taking a break from the swoop track, hmm? Perhaps you'll relax with some hunting?;
Hello again. Always a pleasure. What brings you back to Fazza's?;
[The big Mandalorian has spotted an enemy nearby. Canderous is too focused on the coming battle to speak with you right now.];
[Despite helping you on Taris, Canderous continues to be something of a mystery to you. It might be a good idea to try and get to know him better.];
[Speak to Canderous.];
Yeah? What do you want?;NM13AACAND03013_.mp3
I was wondering if you had any interesting stories.;
You want to hear tales of my exploits? Of the wars I've seen and fought, the enemies I've seen die by my hand? Heh, sure, I'll humor you.;NM13AACAND03051_.mp3
My name's Canderous of the Mandalorian clan Ordo. I've been fighting across the galaxy for 40 of your years.;NM13AACAND03052_.mp3
For my people it's the honor and glory of battle that rules us. It's through combat that we prove our worth, gain renown and make our fortunes.;NM13AACAND03053_.mp3
Is that why you work as a mercenary?;
Times have changed now. The Mandalore clans have been scattered across the Outer Rim, the Republic is in decline and the Sith Empire rises to take its place.;NM13AACAND03055_.mp3
The clans as they were aren't a threat, but the galaxy still fears us. Ha! People think we war out of spite, or bloodlust. They don't understand, and fear that.;NM13AACAND03056_.mp3
We only wanted the challenge of the battle, and glory from it - win or lose. And we lost.;NM13AACAND03057_.mp3
But now I have no real challenges. Crushing Davik's enemies and the pathetic gangs in the Lower City of Taris could not be considered the most glorious of tasks.;NM13AACAND03058_.mp3
When I think of the battles I've fought... the thousands I've killed... the worlds I've burned... I weep for my past.;NM13AACAND03059_.mp3
We'll never speak of this again. We've got work to do, so let's get to it.;NM13AACAND03060_.mp3
Is that why the Mandalorians attacked the Republic?;
The Sith came to us with an offer: to fight a worthy enemy in a battle that would be remembered forever.;NM13AACAND03062_.mp3
Win or lose, as long as the fight is worthy, then honor is gained. The glory at having triumphed over impossible odds is what drives us.;NM13AACAND03064_.mp3
If there's nothing at stake - your possessions, your life, your world - then the battle's meaningless.;NM13AACAND03065_.mp3
We Mandalore take everything we are and throw it into battle. It's the true test of yourself - the battle against death... against oblivion.;NM13AACAND03066_.mp3
You seek death?;
All life dies eventually. A true warrior is one who can beat it down whenever it raises its head. But...;NM13AACAND03068_.mp3
Then what are you doing now?;
The days of combat and glory and cheating death at every turn seem to be over now... I take what I can.;NM13AACAND03070_.mp3
The Mandalorians destroy worlds for honor?;
Maybe another time. I want to ask something else.;
I was wondering if you had any more war stories.;
I was one of the best youth warriors in clan Ordo in my time. No one before me had mastered the power of our Basilisk war droids as quickly as I had. Except Mandalore himself of course.;NM13AACAND03072_.mp3
In those days we were sweeping across the Outer Rim. Destroying all who fought us.;NM13AACAND03073_.mp3
Young Mandalores would prove themselves in real combat with unknown opponents above a thousand worlds. Each brought back the story of his achievements.;NM13AACAND03074_.mp3
What was your story?;
I remember it well, orbiting high above a placid world, its defenses just stirring. As was tradition, I would go ahead of the first wave to find enemies in the thickest fighting.;NM13AACAND03076_.mp3
I remember sitting there in my armor, linked directly with the Basilisk thrumming beneath me. My heart racing with fear at the coming battle.;NM13AACAND03077_.mp3
I didn't think Mandalorians got afraid.;
Every new warrior has to fear to understand how to beat it. You must know that.;NM13AACAND03080_.mp3
The doors opened in front me and the air was sucked out of the drop bay, scattering crystals of frozen vapor across my path.;NM13AACAND03081_.mp3
I can't describe what it feels like to look directly down at a world, falling continuously as you circle it, with barely fifteen centimeters of armor plate protecting you.;NM13AACAND03082_.mp3
When the magnetic locks disengaged on my droid I plunged out of the drop bay towards the battle that waited below.;NM13AACAND03083_.mp3
You dropped from orbit riding a droid?!;
The exhilaration, the euphoria, I felt as I streaked into the atmosphere, dodging self-guided projectile and beam weapons, was unmatched.;NM13AACAND03085_.mp3
A 80 kilometer plunge through the atmosphere, dodging and weaving, the outside of my armor glowing like the sun with the heat of re-entry.;NM13AACAND03086_.mp3
And with barely thirty meters to spare, I twisted and skimmed the surface, firing at the giant beam generators that were in my path.;NM13AACAND03087_.mp3
The explosion from that sent shockwaves that levelled the entire complex around it. It was the moment of my life.;NM13AACAND03088_.mp3
That's horrible!;
I'll never forget those times. But... things are different now. We can't go on fighting the way we had. There are too few of us left now.;NM13AACAND03090_.mp3
But I don't really want to talk about this anymore. I trust I've satisfied your curiosity for now?;NM13AACAND03091_.mp3
Is there something else you want to know?;NM13AACAND03092_.mp3
Do you know anything about this world?;
*grunt* Yeah, I know about Taris. I wasted the last two years in this rat-hole working for Davik.;NM13AACAND03015_.mp3
I suppose an accurate way to describe this place would be 'cesspool' or 'dump'.;NM13AACAND03016_.mp3
You got the rich people on top, the poor people being crushed underneath, and people like me trying to make a living doing the crushing.;NM13AACAND03017_.mp3
It's not exactly what you'd call spiritually fulfilling work, but it gets the bills paid. And on Taris, money can go a long way to making things easier.;NM13AACAND03018_.mp3
You have anything else you want to ask?;NM13AACAND03019_.mp3
Can you give me some adrenal stimulants?;
Heh, don't worry I think you've got enough there as it is. You don't want to go overloading youself on stims, otherwise you might destroy your adrenal system.;NM13AACAND03048_.mp3
A real warrior knows his own limits and doesn't overestimate himself.;NM13AACAND03049_.mp3
There anything else you need?;NM13AACAND03045_.mp3
Tell me more about the Mandalorian Wars.;
We fought against the Republic forces for some time, over the course of many battles.;NM13AACAND03181_.mp3
At the start, they were not much of a threat to speak of, but once you had taken charge, things began to turn against us.;NM13AACAND03182_.mp3
The Republic fleets began to use more than just basic tactics. Feints, counterattacks, mass deceptions. You were a genius on the field. You are held in very high regard among my people.;NM13AACAND03183_.mp3
You abandoned worlds of their defenders so that others would be too fortified to strike. You made sacrifices in order to advance your goals. Such strategies had never been enough to best us before.;NM13AACAND03184_.mp3
In the end, you proved too much for us.;NM13AACAND03185_.mp3
You couldn't have won against the whole galaxy.;
But it was close! So close!;NM13AACAND03193_.mp3
It looked like the entire galaxy was within our grasp!;NM13AACAND03196_.mp3
I still remember that final battle in the skies above Malachor V. The two fleets filling the space around it, outshining the stars...;NM13AACAND03197_.mp3
But you eventually lost.;
Yeah, we lost. But there is no shame in it. We lost to the greatest single warrior the Republic has ever known.;NM13AACAND03199_.mp3
It was not your ships or your men or your vaunted 'fight for freedom' that won this, the final battle of the war.;NM13AACAND03201_.mp3
It was by the actions of one person, the Jedi Revan, that you prevailed.;NM13AACAND03202_.mp3
Revan's strategies and tactics defeated the best of us. Even Mandalore himself was taken aback by the ferocity, the tenacity and the subtlety of Revan's plans.;NM13AACAND03203_.mp3
Revan fought us to a standstill and then began pushing back. We didn't really have a chance.;NM13AACAND03204_.mp3
Why didn't you retreat?;
It was what we had wanted all along, in a way. We wanted to fight the best in a battle that would be remembered for centuries. And we did.;NM13AACAND03206_.mp3
And Revan won.;NM13AACAND03207_.mp3
I don't hold a grudge against Revan, and neither do any of my people. It was the greatest moment of my life to be in that battle.;NM13AACAND03208_.mp3
If Revan had been a Mandalorian, nothing in the galaxy would have stopped us.;NM13AACAND03209_.mp3
But wishing for the past to be different is useless. Better to look to the future. As we should now. We'll talk more later, I think.;NM13AACAND03210_.mp3
And you won.;NM13AACAND03213_.mp3
I hold no grudge against you, nor do any of my people. It was the greatest of honors to fight against you, even in defeat. It is even more of an honor to fight beside you now.;NM13AACAND03214_.mp3
Had you been born of the Mandalorian clans, surely nothing in this galaxy would have been able to stop us.;NM13AACAND03215_.mp3
The Republic will always prevail.;
Ha! Don't be naive. The Republic is not invincible. This battle was the end of the war, one way or another.;NM13AACAND03217_.mp3
It was by the actions of one person - you - that the Republic prevailed.;NM13AACAND03220_.mp3
Your strategies and tactics defeated the best we could send against you. Even Mandalore himself was taken aback by the ferocity of your attacks, the tenacity of your defenses and the subtleties of your plans.;NM13AACAND03221_.mp3
You fought us to a standstill and then began pushing back. We didn't really have a chance.;NM13AACAND03222_.mp3
What happened in the battle?;
If I had not stopped you, someone else would have.;
There was no one else. The entire Republic had committed its forces behind you. The Sith had retreated back to their empire and there were none else strong enough to challenge us.;NM13AACAND03187_.mp3
But what about the Sith?;
The Sith had gone - retreated into their empire. They sealed themselves off from the rest of the galaxy. We thought it would be centuries before they'd come back.;NM13AACAND03224_.mp3
It's amazing that they could rebuild their fleet so fast. But at the time, it looked like the galaxy was in our grasp!;NM13AACAND03225_.mp3
At the start, they were not much of a threat to speak of, but once the Jedi Revan had taken charge, things began to turn against us.;NM13AACAND03188_.mp3
The Republic fleets began to use more than just basic tactics. Feints, counterattacks, mass deceptions. Revan was a genius on the field.;NM13AACAND03189_.mp3
Revan abandoned worlds of their defenders so that others would be too fortified to strike, and was willing to make sacrifices in order to advance goals.;NM13AACAND03190_.mp3
And in the end, Revan proved too much for us.;NM13AACAND03191_.mp3
If Revan had not stopped you, someone else would have.;
There was no one else. The entire Republic had committed its forces behind Revan. The Sith had retreated back to their empire and there were none else strong enough to challenge us.;NM13AACAND03195_.mp3
The war we had with the Republic was supposed to be the most glorious battle of our history, but... it was a very costly one. I guess we didn't think of how much we could lose in it.;NM13AACAND03228_.mp3
How much did you lose?;
There weren't many of us left after that last battle. Mandalore himself was killed at the hands of the Jedi Revan. The best of us could not defeat him!;NM13AACAND03231_.mp3
After that last battle, those of us that survived were stripped of our weapons, our armor, and our Basilisks.;NM13AACAND03232_.mp3
Revan's forces destroyed them while we were forced to watch. Those who hadn't fled earlier were left with nothing to call their own: no weapons, no armor... only the honor of having fought in the battle we just lost.;NM13AACAND03233_.mp3
For many this was not enough. While the rest of us were sent into exile on the Outer Rim, they tried to relive the old days - raiding worlds. They're nothing more than bandits now.;NM13AACAND03234_.mp3
And you eventually came to Taris.;
Yeah, I came to Taris.;NM13AACAND03236_.mp3
Enforcing for Davik was not... stimulating. The gangs on Taris and Davik's rivals were trash. They give no thrill in battle, no honor or glory in defeating them. It was like stepping on bugs.;NM13AACAND03237_.mp3
I sought worthy challenges, but the best that Taris could offer were nothing to me.;NM13AACAND03238_.mp3
But I think now - with you - I may finally find opponents worth fighting.;NM13AACAND03239_.mp3
I am honored.;
Maybe later I'll tell you more about what it was like to work for Davik. For now, though, we should get on with our lives.;NM13AACAND03244_.mp3
You are a worthy companion.;
Opponents who could easily kill us.;
Maybe it'll happen, maybe it won't. Either way, I think that by following you I can get something out of it.;NM13AACAND03243_.mp3
You found work as a mercenary?;
Yeah. I found work on Taris.;NM13AACAND03246_.mp3
The Republic's forces destroyed them while we were forced to watch. Those who hadn't fled earlier were left with nothing to call their own: no weapons, no armor... only the honor of having fought in the battle we just lost.;NM13AACAND03247_.mp3
There must not have been many of you left.;
But I kicked your tails so badly?;
Yeah... yeah you did. You were a great warrior Revan. A great general.;NM13AACAND03249_.mp3
Tell me about when you worked for Davik.;
Working for Davik was like driving a spike through the side of your head... Sure you get something new in there, but in the end, you've lost something as well.;NM13AACAND03251_.mp3
Beating up people who wouldn't - or couldn't - pay, strong-arming his competitors, killing who he said. It was busy work, nothing decent.;NM13AACAND03252_.mp3
You were an assassin?;
Assassin. Mercenary. Those are names people give guys like me who do the killing to make us seem better or worse in their eyes.;NM13AACAND03254_.mp3
I've killed many people. I can't say I'm proud of it, but I have. Criminals, competitors, businessmen, police... women, children...;NM13AACAND03256_.mp3
Jedi were a better challenge, but they hardly ever poked around in the Under City.;NM13AACAND03257_.mp3
... Until you came along...;NM13AACAND03258_.mp3
But I never wanted to challenge you. Never felt the need. Maybe I knew I couldn't win... just like all those years ago.;NM13AACAND03259_.mp3
A wise decision.;
Yeah, probably. Heh. You'd likely have beaten me again.;NM13AACAND03261_.mp3
Maybe you would have. But you're not who you were back then, I can tell. You've changed... and maybe I have too.;NM13AACAND03263_.mp3
I remember a time when I could do anything I wanted... Kill, maim, murder... It was all the same to me.;NM13AACAND03264_.mp3
But now... now that I'm older, I can look back and regret...;NM13AACAND03265_.mp3
Regret in a Mandalorian is unbecoming.;
In a Mandalorian... I'm not even sure what that is anymore. The Mandalorian are gone, defeated by the Republic and swept away by time.;NM13AACAND03267_.mp3
I look back and regret all the chances I had as a warrior, and then all the chances I've had since then. I shouldn't be getting like this, not when so many other things are happening... but...;NM13AACAND03268_.mp3
It feels like... like something has changed inside and I don't know what it is. Bah! This is unbecoming of a warrior! Let's get on with everything before I start getting sentimental or something.;NM13AACAND03269_.mp3
Over what?;
I regret to tell you that I never regret anything.;
Ha! Good one. That's like a warrior should. Like what you see in a Mandalorian.;NM13AACAND03272_.mp3
You know I'd have beaten you again!;
Killed his competitors?;
Now that's the way things should be done!;
Maybe...;NM13AACAND03274_.mp3
Tell me about it later. I want to ask something else.;
What are your thoughts now?;
I'm not happy with the way my life has turned. I'm not the Mandalore I once was. I don't even think I'm the merc I was when I joined you.;NM13AACAND03276_.mp3
I think... I think I need something more than killing and fighting in my life. I need a purpose or something like that.;NM13AACAND03277_.mp3
What will you do?;
The way the Mandalorians - we - fought... it holds no appeal for me. To rape and ravage worlds for the thrill of battle... It gets old. Very old.;NM13AACAND03279_.mp3
Honor in battle. Cheating death. Comrades in arms. The code of the Mandalore.;NM13AACAND03280_.mp3
I think I'm something different now. Maybe more, maybe less.;NM13AACAND03281_.mp3
You aren't a Mandalorian now?;
No... The time of the clans is past. I don't think the galaxy wants them anymore. Maybe in the future, but not now.;NM13AACAND03283_.mp3
Once my time with you is done, once you have moved on to greater things, I'll find my own way once again.;NM13AACAND03284_.mp3
Maybe the Mandalorian clans will be reborn again. Maybe even under the Republic... or the Sith.;NM13AACAND03285_.mp3
But dreaming about the future is stupid right now. We should get down to our business and finish it. If we survive all this... maybe we could talk about it then.;NM13AACAND03286_.mp3
What are you going to do?;
I don't think there is really any place left in the galaxy for the Mandalorian clans like they were. I don't know if I can go on forever fighting as I have. Even warriors get insightful in their old age...;NM13AACAND03288_.mp3
Isn't killing enough?;
Killing is never enough. Anybody can kill just by pushing a button. A warrior fights his battles himself - as you have done - and tries to defeat all comers.;NM13AACAND03290_.mp3
That doesn't sound much like a Mandalorian...;
Nothing more for now.;
Your choice. I'm here if you want something done right.;NM13AACAND03296_.mp3
Ha! Stimulants make a warrior out of even the weakest human!;NM13AACAND03043_.mp3
Here's a speed boosting stimulant to help you get quicker.;NM13AACAND03044_.mp3
Here's a strength boosting stimulant to help you get stronger.;NM13AACAND03046_.mp3
Here's a stamina boosting stimulant to help you get tougher.;NM13AACAND03047_.mp3
From what we saw from space this world doesn't have a lot of people. I couldn't really have found much work here anyway, so I never had an interest.;NM13AACAND03020_.mp3
It looks like a farm world. The Republic has thousands of these places - ones that get by farming crops and hunting herds of native beasts.;NM13AACAND03021_.mp3
But I might have underestimated this place. It seems to be more than I had thought.;NM13AACAND03022_.mp3
Water worlds never had much of an appeal for us to conquer. They may put up a good fight in their own environment - no match for us, of course - but they don't really have anything of value either.;NM13AACAND03023_.mp3
The thing this world is good for is a substance known as Kolto. Kolto is the single best healing substance in the galaxy.;NM13AACAND03024_.mp3
But the Mandalore are not as weak and fragile as your Republic and Sith warriors. When we enter battle, we carry weapons powerful enough to pulverize cities.;NM13AACAND03025_.mp3
Both in our wars, and in our own personal combats, there are no survivors. So Kolto does not hold the appeal it does for your peoples.;NM13AACAND03026_.mp3
Well... It has big trees - in case your eyes don't work anymore. But I do know that there is one exceptional race on this world: the Wookiees.;NM13AACAND03027_.mp3
The Wookiees, although primitive compared to us, are surprisingly capable warriors. They're pretty strong and pick up combat techniques pretty quick.;NM13AACAND03028_.mp3
I think they're more than a match for the average Republic or Sith trooper. When we were looking for targets, we considered this world carefully.;NM13AACAND03029_.mp3
We were wondering if we'd have to use larger weapons than our war droids if we wanted to clear the damn forests so we could fight in the open.;NM13AACAND03030_.mp3
Too many trees means they can go into hiding too easy. And what's a continent or two turned to glass if we get the whole world after.;NM13AACAND03031_.mp3
Tatooine is one big desert with rocks sticking out. I heard that some of my people came here after the war, but I don't know what happened to them.;NM13AACAND03032_.mp3
The world of my clan - Ordo - was much like this. Dust basins and rock crags. But my world at least has some green around the equator - this place is just sand all over.;NM13AACAND03033_.mp3
There are some vicious people on this world, but the desert is the real enemy. Trips out in the desert - especially the deep desert - should be taken very carefully.;NM13AACAND03034_.mp3
Korriban is a Sith world, that's for sure. I mean, just look at this place.;NM13AACAND03035_.mp3
When we were fighting with the Republic with the Sith, this was one of the major staging points for the invasion.;NM13AACAND03036_.mp3
We were never allowed to land our troops on the world though, so we never knew what the Sith really do here.;NM13AACAND03037_.mp3
Rumor has it that the leader of our clans at the time, Mandalore, did go down. They say the Sith perform terrible magics here.;NM13AACAND03038_.mp3
This world is... odd. It looks like a battlefield, but the environment here is lush and green. Whatever happened here was a long time ago.;NM13AACAND03039_.mp3
I have seen many strange worlds in my time, but this world is stranger still.;NM13AACAND03040_.mp3
I don't like this place. Something happened... or is happening here and I don't like it. We should get out of here as soon as possible.;NM13AACAND03041_.mp3
That was some fight.;
I want a Basilisk war droid!;
Those droids sure are something.;
Who were you fighting anyway?;
I don't remember. It doesn't matter anyway, that world's dead now.;NM13AACAND03097_.mp3
Ha! Some Mandalorian you were!;
What happened next?;
How barbaric!;
Ha! We would travel from world to world, and descend on it in our Basilisk war droids. I still remember my first combat...;NM13AACAND03100_.mp3
I would have harnessed that power sooner.;
We were still recovering from the war we fought with the Sith. We were not yet strong enough to fight the Republic again. We needed to train another generation to do that.;NM13AACAND03102_.mp3
You want another story, eh? You want to hear about some other world getting wasted? Heh, I knew you were the type.;NM13AACAND03103_.mp3
Your stagnant Republic has never seen some of the strange creatures and races we fought on the Outer Rim in those years. Heh, and you never will now.;NM13AACAND03104_.mp3
What do you mean?;
If a world isn't strong enough to defend itself, it's basically forfeit. But this story is about something a little different.;NM13AACAND03106_.mp3
We were going through the asteroid fields of the Crispin system at the very edge of the galaxy, playing with the pirates and smugglers we found there.;NM13AACAND03107_.mp3
The main belt in the Crispin system consists of mainly small rocks covered in frozen methane gas shells and the pirates were using them for cover.;NM13AACAND03108_.mp3
Ha! I remember using a thermal generator to cause the outer layer of one of the asteroids to vaporize in a picosecond. It blew out and shredded the three smugglers using it for cover!;NM13AACAND03109_.mp3
But... that was a mistake...;NM13AACAND03110_.mp3
Why? What happened?;
The asteroid I had targeted was smaller than most, maybe a dozen meters on a side. On the outside it looked the same as any other: just a ball covered in frozen gas.;NM13AACAND03112_.mp3
But something must have been inside it... something inactive in the cold. The heat of my blast might have triggered something or woken something up.;NM13AACAND03113_.mp3
After I had hit, spots of light and heat appeared all over the thin shell still covering it, evaporating the gases.;NM13AACAND03114_.mp3
What lay underneath looked like some sort of rocky growth... a deformed rock pitted by scores of micrometeorite scars. I think something even older might have been inside that.;NM13AACAND03115_.mp3
An asteroid?;
Maybe... but maybe not.;NM13AACAND03117_.mp3
It started rotating - faster and faster as we watched it. After a second it started spraying fire - thermal projectiles that melted our armor like wax. We were caught completely by surprise.;NM13AACAND03119_.mp3
Before we could counter-attack, it fled at an incredible speed.;NM13AACAND03120_.mp3
A ship!;
We couldn't catch it, but we could follow its hyperspace wake.;NM13AACAND03122_.mp3
We followed its trail as far as we could, heading away from the galactic core. When it finally led beyond the edge of our galaxy, we abandoned our efforts.;NM13AACAND03123_.mp3
Anything that wants to commit suicide in that great void is not worth our trouble trying to catch.;NM13AACAND03124_.mp3
That's the only story I have for now. I'll tell you some more stuff later, if we get the chance.;NM13AACAND03125_.mp3
Did it backfire?;
You Mandalorians never were too smart.;
Where did you fight this time?;
I don't have as many strange stories like the last one I told you, but I do have a couple about me and the stuff I've done.;NM13AACAND03129_.mp3
In one battle above the world of Althir, my unit managed to defeat a force of Althiri ten times our own size. That battle gained me command of an entire sub-sect of my clan.;NM13AACAND03130_.mp3
Tell me the story.;
For five days they had managed to hold off our forces, keeping us to the outer rings of their world, preventing us from attacking it directly.;NM13AACAND03132_.mp3
My task was to assault one of their flanks with a false attack. The Althiri would be drawn out by the units I had sent in.;NM13AACAND03133_.mp3
Once they had surrounded those units, the bulk of my forces would attack from the rear and defeat them in detail.;NM13AACAND03134_.mp3
Ah. Did it work?;
Things did not go as I had planned. I saw an opening - a mistake they had made in the disposition of their forces - and took it!;NM13AACAND03136_.mp3
While fending off our main force, they had let their fleet split in two! The center of their entire fleet was left exposed!;NM13AACAND03137_.mp3
I turned my forces and assaulted the center of their fleet, decimating them!;NM13AACAND03138_.mp3
You were a great warrior Canderous.;
Their slow, ponderous ship could not turn to face us without being overwhelmed. Their command vessels were destroyed in seconds. Their ranks were thrown into chaos.;NM13AACAND03140_.mp3
It was most amusing to watch the surviving ships scatter and flee. Several even tried to dive through the plane of the rings to escape us!;NM13AACAND03141_.mp3
They were shredded by the rings, or crashed into rocks, or were destroyed by our forces as we pursued them.;NM13AACAND03142_.mp3
Warriors do not flee from a battle if they are losing. They fight to the end! As we did against you.;NM13AACAND03143_.mp3
Another time maybe I'll tell you about how the war with the Republic went. For now let's just get on with things.;NM13AACAND03145_.mp3
Warriors do not flee from a battle if they are losing. They fight to the end! As we did against your Jedi Revan.;NM13AACAND03144_.mp3
You disobeyed your orders?;
This is a chance given to a warrior once or twice in a lifetime. The chance to change the course of history in a single act.;NM13AACAND03147_.mp3
What did they do?;
Let me guess... you won?;
These Althiri don't seem too bright.;
They weren't stupid. Stupid races don't make starships and weapons of mass destruction. But they weren't masters of the arts of war as Mandalorians are.;NM13AACAND03151_.mp3
I think I know where this is going.;
Yeah, yeah, you were a great warrior.;
Ha! I was the best! Except for Mandalore of course. He was the only person alive except Revan who could have beat me.;NM13AACAND03154_.mp3
Hm... I think I'll tell you a bit about the recent war we had with the Republic. That might be more familiar to you.;NM13AACAND03155_.mp3
The one where you beat my people.;NM13AACAND03156_.mp3
We started by conquering worlds just outside the Republic. We did it quietly so the Republic wouldn't really know what was going on until too late.;NM13AACAND03158_.mp3
When we finally did hit the Republic worlds, they had no idea we were coming.;NM13AACAND03159_.mp3
We came in through three invasion corridors in adjacent sectors. Anyone who put up a fight - or wouldn't fight - was crushed. We razed whole worlds trying to provoke the Republic into fighting us.;NM13AACAND03160_.mp3
I don't particularly enjoy wiping out worlds for its own sake, but the cowardly tactics the Republic defenders used left us little choice.;NM13AACAND03161_.mp3
No honor in defending themselves?;
Hiding in the homes of civilians. Using families as shields. Thinking we would not use appropriate force on their bases inside major cities.;NM13AACAND03163_.mp3
They underestimated our resolve and what measures are acceptable in war. Those who cannot defend themselves should not be around those who can in battle.;NM13AACAND03164_.mp3
If annihilating a city is the kind of power it takes to overwhelm a Republic shield device, then that's what we did. Necessary force to destroy all opposition.;NM13AACAND03165_.mp3
But killing people is wrong!;
It's wrong to hide with shields surrounding you hoping the enemy will be so good as to throw themselves at your feet to be slaughtered!;NM13AACAND03167_.mp3
I have no time or patience for cowards! They deserve to be hunted down and exterminated like vermin!;NM13AACAND03168_.mp3
There was no honor in wiping them out like rats. But some of your forces did redeem the Republic in our eyes... especially later...;NM13AACAND03169_.mp3
Later?;
Later... when you had joined the war. We'll get back to that, we've wasted too much time already.;NM13AACAND03171_.mp3
Later... when Revan had joined the war. But we'll get back to that, we've wasted too much time already.;NM13AACAND03172_.mp3
How did they redeem themselves?;
You mean when we kicked your tails.;
You could have found another way.;
Now that's my kind of warfare.;
You had the choice not to destroy them.;
They had the choice not to fight. We meet the enemy wherever they are hiding and we wipe them out. A few cities is a small price to pay for a world.;NM13AACAND03179_.mp3
The one where the Jedi Revan beat my people.;NM13AACAND03157_.mp3
Can you help me with our little stowaway problem?;
What? You think I don't have something better to do?;NM13AACAND03297_.mp3
Have you seen all these gizka on the ship?;
So deal with it. Why are you asking me about it?;NM13AACAND03298_.mp3
[Don't speak to him.];
[You decide to ignore Canderous and continue on with your quest for now, though it might be a good idea to speak with him later.];
I don't think we can delay much here. We should fight our way out as quickly as possible.;NM13AACAND03000_.mp3
This looks like the end of our partnership. The battle we fight here will change the face of the galaxy.;NM13AACAND03001_.mp3
You, Revan, are the single greatest warrior of this age, and any battle we fight will bring me honor. I'll stay by your side through anything.;NM13AACAND03002_.mp3
I don't think I'm ready to give up this life of mine, this life of fighting, not quite yet. We have things we need to do here.;NM13AACAND03003_.mp3
I'm your man until the end, whatever path you take.;NM13AACAND03004_.mp3
I've been given a challenge I can't ignore. We've got to go to the dune seas of Tatooine so I can find Jagi and kill him for his insult to me!;NM13AACAND03005_.mp3
What happened out there? Why is Jagi so mad at you?;
This is between me and Jagi. You don't have to get involved. If you're lucky, he might spill something before I spread him in a paste over the dunes.;NM13AACAND03008_.mp3
Can we talk about this?;
We should get going then.;
The sooner we get to Tatooine the better.;NM13AACAND03010_.mp3
I... I think this has affected me in ways that I didn't anticipate... I think I'll need time to sort things out.;NM13AACAND03011_.mp3
Thanks for what you did, whatever your intentions might have been. I just need... time.;NM13AACAND03012_.mp3
Hmph. That trick would never work on a Mandalorian. Our minds are not so weak and easily twisted.;NGLOBECAND03473_.mp3
*whisper* I'm amazed at how many people that works on. The entire galaxy must be filled with weak-minded fools.;NGLOBECAND03474_.mp3
I like the way you handled that. Are you sure you don't have some Mandalorian blood in you?;NGLOBECAND03475_.mp3
"The role of the weak is to serve the will of the strong; I'm glad you understand that.";NM17AA03SH01156_.mp3
Mighty generous of you. A little too generous, if you ask me.;NGLOBECAND03477_.mp3
What was that all about? Are you going soft on me?;NM17AA03SH01163_.mp3
Stop right there, or I'll give you a blaster shot right between the eyes! Now, what are you doing here?;NM03ABSELV08000_.mp3
Who are you?;
No. I'm the one with the blaster pointed at you. I get to ask the questions. Now - what are you doing here?;NM03ABSELV08002_.mp3
You can't talk to the Sith like that!;
You think I care if you're with the Sith? I've killed plenty of your kind before and I've got no problem doing it again!;NM03ABSELV08004_.mp3
Now you'll see why I'm the most dangerous assassin on Taris!;NM03ABSELV08012_.mp3
I was just exploring. I didn't know anyone was in here.;
Well go explore somewhere else. There's nothing interesting for you in here. This is your only warning - if you bother me again, you won't walk out of here alive!;NM03ABSELV08007_.mp3
I'm here to collect the bounty on your head, Selven!;
You're a fool if you think you can collect the price on my head!;NM03ABSELV08010_.mp3
I'm just here to rob the place.;
Bad luck for you that you picked my apartment then.;NM03ABSELV08015_.mp3
I gave you a chance to get out of here and leave me alone, but I guess you're just too stupid to take it.;NM03ABSELV08017_.mp3
Can you believe it? They say that Yuthura took over the academy! Maybe I'll get my chance, yet!;NM35AASHAA10000_.mp3
What's this I hear about Yuthura Ban being dead? You know something about that?;NM35AASHAA10001_.mp3
Hmph. I could've won. You were just lucky.;NM35AASHAA10002_.mp3
Oh-ho! If it isn't the freak from the colony. Hello, freak.;NM35AASHAA10003_.mp3
Who are you?;
Shaardan's the name. Don't forget it. You'll have me to thank when you get kicked out of here.;NM35AASHAA10005_.mp3
Get lost, nerf-herder.;
You'll get yours. Just you wait.;NM35AASHAA10010_.mp3
You want to make an issue out of it?;
And go into the dueling room? Hah! I've got better things to do than give you a fair fight.;NM35AASHAA10012_.mp3
You can count on seeing me later, though. My lightsaber has your name on it.;NM35AASHAA10013_.mp3
Leave me alone.;
Fine by me. I can't wait to gut you, personally... one less competitor to deal with.;NM35AASHAA10015_.mp3
So you got a little prestige. It won't help you... I'll gut you eventually, just you watch.;NM35AASHAA10016_.mp3
The name's Shaardan. Didn't I tell you that back in the colony? Maybe not.;NM35AASHAA10006_.mp3
Do you want to co-ordinate strategy?;
I don't work or play well with others. Thanks for the offer, though.;NM35AASHAA10008_.mp3
I challenge you to a duel!;
You want to challenge me? To a duel? Heh... I've got a lot more planned than giving someone like you a fair fight.;NM35AASHAA10021_.mp3
I guess we'll meet eventually... on my terms. Good luck until then.;NM35AASHAA10022_.mp3
I have to go.;
You and me both. We're going to have to get some prestige... quick.;NM35AASHAA10024_.mp3
I know. You and I are equal in prestige, you know. Could be tight.;NM35AASHAA10025_.mp3
I remember you. You're alright. Trying for the academy, I see.;NM35AASHAA10017_.mp3
So are you, obviously.;
That's true. I had no idea you were coming for the academy when I met you in the colony, though.;NM35AASHAA10019_.mp3
Sorry, I don't have time to speak. I'm studying the Code.;NM35AASHAA10026_.mp3
Why are you bothering me?;
Hey, relax Big Z. No need to be rude. Sorry about that, but Wookiees ain't much for conversation, you know?;NM03AEZAAL18002_.mp3
Freyyr welcomes you for what you have done. The Wookiee people are in your debt.;
You are the only outsider permitted in here. It is an honor.;
You will be remembered for what you have done.;
Freyyr will see us through this dark time, thanks to your efforts.;
I heard an explosion in there... did you destroy the assassin droid?;NM36AASITH03000_.mp3
I did.;
Oh. Well, I guess it's good that the deed is done. Hope you stomped it good for my friends.;NM36AASITH03002_.mp3
At any rate, if you haven't already, you might want to go and see Master Uthar about that reward. Prestige is gold, you know.;NM36AASITH03010_.mp3
Why do you want to know?;
Well... if you did, then I wouldn't have to think about going inside, after all. I suppose the fact you're back means that you did, anyway.;NM36AASITH03005_.mp3
Don't you go trying to claim responsibility...;
No, I wouldn't do that. Well... I would if I could get away with it, but I bet Master Uthar could tell if I was lying.;NM36AASITH03008_.mp3
Wow... you should have seen it. That droid came running out of the tomb like a bantha on a rampage!;NM36AASITH03012_.mp3
It fired some kind of jet pack and off it went. Whatever you did, it sure was effective... I don't think it's coming back anytime soon.;NM36AASITH03014_.mp3
You'd better go and tell Master Uthar about this, if you haven't already. You may not have destroyed the droid, but you might still get the reward.;NM36AASITH03016_.mp3
You should be careful if you're planning on entering this tomb... it's dangerous.;NM36AASITH03018_.mp3
Why? What do you know about it?;
There's an assassin droid in here, so Master Uthar says. It went insane and has holed up in here with a whole army of droids protecting it.;NM36AASITH03020_.mp3
Why don't the Sith do something about it?;
I don't know. I think Master Uthar has left it in there as a challenge for any student brave enough to destroy it.;NM36AASITH03022_.mp3
Supposedly, if a student actually succeeds in destroying the droid, they'll get a great reward. Lots have tried, but nobody's succeeded yet.;NM36AASITH03024_.mp3
Where did it get all these droids?;
No idea. I think it's building them in there.;NM36AASITH03029_.mp3
This droid went insane, you say?;
Seems that way. They say that its audio receptors became too sensitive and all the noise drove the droid nuts.;NM36AASITH03031_.mp3
If you're planning on going in, I'd suggest you use some sound suppressors or something... or you'll probably become a target right away.;NM36AASITH03033_.mp3
Are you going inside?;
I... I don't think so. I can manipulate minds and living matter, but that won't be much use against droids, will it?;NM36AASITH03035_.mp3
I've had a few friends go inside that haven't come out for a while, now. I doubt I could do any better than they could.;NM36AASITH03037_.mp3
Thanks. I'll be going.;
Sure thing. Good luck.;NM36AASITH03026_.mp3
I can handle myself.;
If you say so. Just thought I would warn you, is all.;NM36AASITH03042_.mp3
They're all dangerous.;
Maybe so, but this one more than most, I think.;NM36AASITH03039_.mp3
The droid is actively engaged in its patrol route. You cannot reprogram it anymore.;
The droid is now active. It will attack any enemies that come in range.;
Optimize droid's weaponry. (<CUSTOM42> repair part(s));
[Success] The droid is now set for maximum firepower.;
Optimize droid's targeting systems. (<CUSTOM43> repair part(s));
[Success] The droid is now set for maximum accuracy.;
Activate droid's shields. (<CUSTOM44> repair part(s));
[Success] The droid's shields are now active.;
Engage droid in patrol mode. (<CUSTOM45> repair part(s));
[Success] Patrol mode engaged. Once you end this session the droid will begin patrol and destroy any enemies it encounters.;
WARNING: Once you end this session the droid's program will be locked in. You will not be able to modifiy the droid anymore.;
Leave it alone.;
You leave the droid alone for now.;
The droid engages its patrol mode and moves off to carry out your programmed instructions.;
[Failure] You do not have enough repair parts.;
This droid is damaged and inactive.;
Reactivate the droid. (1 repair part);
[Failure] You don't have any repair parts. You leave the droid alone for now.;
You are truly lucky, sentient, or truly skilled. I have no more credits to bet against you in a game, but I might be willing to bet some of my prize cards should that be adequate.;
Let's play again.;
Excellent. Let us begin.;
Sorry, not interested right now.;
Come back anytime, sentient. I'm always willing to play.;
It seems I have been bested at my own game. Fair enough, sentient... you are the superior player and here is your reward. I do not think we need to play any more games to continue proving the point.;
Oh come on... one more game!;
And put even more into your pocket? Are you joking, sentient? I know when I am beaten.;
So please... find some other player to wring dry. I'll look for something a little less challenging, myself.;
How about I ask you some questions, then?;
*sigh* I am down a considerable number of credits, sentient. I am not in the mood to answer your queries, to be quite honest.;
Goodbye.;
Yes, yes, take my credits and go.;
A lucky hand. I will have to try a little harder next time if I am going to beat you... and I will, I am quite sure. Shall we try again?;
You think it was luck? Let's do it again!;
Let's play.;
I want to ask you some questions.;
There are others here to answer your questions, sentient. To be honest, if we are not going to engage in some entertaining sport, I would rather be alone.;
I want to play Pazaak, but I don't have a deck.;
I see. I apologize, but I do not have a spare. Should you ever acquire a deck, do come and see me.;
Who are you?;
I am known as Toll Apkar. If you must know, I am quite proficient at Pazaak. I would not wish to begin a game under false pretenses.;
Ahhh, it is a good day, sentient, is it not? I always find the vindication of my skill to be pleasing. You have my condolences.;
Deal the cards - I'm not leaving just yet!;
As you wish. I certainly can always use the credits.;
Greetings, sentient. Are you willing to engage in a hand of Pazaak? I am afraid there are few takers on Korriban... it would be good to have a little fun, for once.;
It seems I have been bested at my own game. Fair enough, sentient... you are the superior player. I do not think we need to play any more games to continue proving the point.;
How about you answer some of my questions then?;
Greetings once again. Might you have a Pazaak deck? I would be most interested in some idle entertainment, sentient.;
You're good, Stranger... maybe even as good as Bendak in his prime. There's no shame in losing to you. But when you beat me you made me realize something, kid.;NM02AEMARL23000_.mp3
First it was just Twitch I couldn't handle. Now it's you and Twitch. Pretty soon there'll be another young hotshot clawing past me in the rankings.;NM02AEMARL23002_.mp3
This game's been good to me, but my time is done. I need to get away from the duel rings for a while, think things over. Goodbye, Stranger - I wish you all the best.;NM02AEMARL23004_.mp3
Pretty impressive, Stranger. Ice is no pushover. People are starting to take notice of you. They say you're the best thing to come along since Twitch stepped into the ring.;NM02AEMARL23054_.mp3
If you're going to keep climbing the ranks, then I guess I'm next on your hit list, kid. I'm looking forward to it.;NM02AEMARL23056_.mp3
Let's step into the ring, then!;
You don't waste any time, do you? Go talk to Ajuur - he'll set the match up.;NM02AEMARL23058_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;
My area of expertise is pretty much limited to the dueling ring and the other combatants here at the cantina, but I'll try to answer any questions you might have.;NM02AEMARL23014_.mp3
I want to ask you about the duelists here.;
You've come to the right man. I've been dueling here for nearly twenty years and I remember every duelist who's been through this cantina.;NM02AEMARL23016_.mp3
Of course, there are only five of us left now: Duncan, Gerlon, Ice, Twitch and me. Bendak Starkiller comes in once in a while, but he's retired now.;NM02AEMARL23018_.mp3
Tell me about Duncan.;
Duncan? Worst duelist ever. His nickname is Deadeye because he fights like he's blind! I wouldn't worry about him.;NM02AEMARL23020_.mp3
Tell me about Gerlon.;
Gerlon used to be pretty good, before the accident. His blaster overheated during a match and exploded. One in a million occurrence. Paralyzed three fingers on his right hand.;NM02AEMARL23022_.mp3
They call him Gerlon Two-Fingers now. He hasn't been the same since the accident, but he's still out here trying to earn a living. That's why I never fight with blasters.;NM02AEMARL23024_.mp3
Tell me about Ice.;
Ice? Eh, she's not much for personality, but she's a hell of a fighter - confident, steady. Popular with the crowd, too. If you go up against her you know you're in for a tough match.;NM02AEMARL23026_.mp3
Tell me about Twitch.;
Twitch? I think that Rodian is completely crazy, but he's very, very good despite his insanity. Or maybe because of it. Even I can't beat him.;NM02AEMARL23028_.mp3
Tell me about yourself.;
Me? I've seen my share of battles. My best years are gone, but I can still hold my own against anyone in here... except maybe Twitch.;NM02AEMARL23030_.mp3
Tell me about Bendak Starkiller.;
What can I say? Bendak was a legend. Never lost a match his entire career. But he was bloodthirsty as an Iridorian battle rager - never liked having to face the same opponent twice.;NM02AEMARL23032_.mp3
Got so he wouldn't battle anyone unless it was a death match. When they made death matches illegal, he went into retirement. He still hangs around here sometimes.;NM02AEMARL23034_.mp3
Bendak's the best there ever was, plain and simple. Even now I'd bet that anyone who steps into the ring with him wouldn't make it out alive.;NM02AEMARL23036_.mp3
I want to ask something else.;
Goodbye.;
Goodbye, stranger. Maybe we'll talk again later.;NM02AEMARL23052_.mp3
Do you know anything about the crashed Republic escape pods?;
Only what I heard from the news reports, which are all censored by the Sith. Some pods crashed into the Undercity, anyone caught harboring survivors will be arrested and executed.;NM02AEMARL23039_.mp3
Really, I don't think it's any of my business. The Sith want to call themselves rulers of Taris, it's fine by me. Just so long as they don't shut the duel ring down.;NM02AEMARL23041_.mp3
I just want some general information on Taris.;
I can only tell you what is recorded in the basic visitor guides: the Upper City is a beautiful destination where intergalactic travelers can find all their basic needs.;NM02AEMARL23043_.mp3
If you're looking for excitement the duel rings here are your best bet. Stay out of the Lower City - it's nothing but a gang ridden slum. Is there anything else you want to know?;NM02AEMARL23045_.mp3
Tell me more about these duels.;
The duels themselves are simple enough. Two combatants armed with stun pistols enter the ring. One walks out a winner, the other is carried out unconscious on a stretcher.;NM02AEMARL23047_.mp3
If you're interested in setting up a match - or if you want to place a wager - just go speak to Ajuur. He's that Hutt over in the corner. He'll make all the arrangements.;NM02AEMARL23049_.mp3
I see you got your feet wet in the duel ring. Not bad... you've got real talent, kid. Stick with it and you'll go places.;NM02AEMARL23060_.mp3
I'm looking for a match.;
Hello there, off-worlder. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Marl. I'm one of the duelists here at the cantina. I was wondering when you'd get around to talking to me.;NM02AEMARL23006_.mp3
Do I know you?;
No, we've never met. It's just that most people who come here to watch the duels are bored nobles looking for a little excitement in their drab lives. But you're different.;NM02AEMARL23008_.mp3
"I've seen you in the dueling ring; you're serious about this. People like you scout things out, so I figured eventually you'd come to talk to me.";NM02AEMARL23010_.mp3
You look like you know a thing or two about combat. I'm guessing you didn't come here to sit on the sidelines and watch a duel. Are you looking for a match?;NM02AEMARL23011_.mp3
Were you expecting me?;
Back again? Are you just here to watch the stun duels, or is there something else I can do for you?;NM02AEMARL23061_.mp3
You should really talk to Thalia. We'll... go wherever she does.;
Rrrgh. Chuundar has commanded that I grant you access to the Shadowlands. Gorwooken is what I am called.;
Walk with care! Only our bravest return from these lands. Your soft feet are a barely tolerated insult.;
I have a few questions, Gorwooken.;
Chuundar said nothing of answering your questions. Be brief.;
I want to ask if it's dangerous down there.;
Those that walk the Shadowlands do so at their own risk. It is a test of bravery among my people. A respected feat.;
But you come here like the Czerka, with strange weapons. It is so much more than we have, yet you still fear?;
You are pathetic. You will get no warnings from me. Prove your worth, to us and to yourself.;
What do you think of the Czerka Corporation?;
They have made Chuundar strong, so we are all stronger, but I do not like them. They are small and hide behind armor.;
They would not survive the Shadowlands as a true Wookiee. They are not worthy to be there, but Chuundar wills it.;
Has anyone else been allowed down recently?;
A few like you are in the Shadowlands, given premission by Chuundar. I don't know why. Only Wookiees should be allowed.;
The journeys of my people are very personal. I won't speak of them to an outsider.;
What outsiders are below?;
For reasons I do not know, Chuundar allows those of the Czerka to move in the Shadowlands. They kill much.;
And there is another, but he has earned respect. He does not disturb our lives or customs. And he gets angry like a Wookiee sometimes.;
That would be me. Jolee Bindo. Do I really look so different up close?;NM22ABGORW08024_.mp3
No, it cannot be you. You are too frail and old. The other is mad like a crazed tach.;
Urgh... his name hurts my tongue. He has lived alone in the Shadowlands for many years now.;
Back to my other questions now.;
Be brief. I am not your guide.;
Just unlock the thing and lower me down.;
The descent is long. Be still, or we will attract... unwelcome visitors.;
I'm not ready yet. I'll go down later.;
I will wait. Chuundar bids it.;
[Force Persuade] Tell me about any Wookiees that have recently gone this way.;
[Success] Ergh... I should tell you about some of us that have gone to the Shadowlands. There have been many...;
Latest was Rorworr, and he has not returned in many days. He may have died below, but he was strong and able.;
Many have died recently. Chuundar believes one of our own is below, mad, crazed, killing all. I do not know.;
We find no bodies to examine. The Shadowlands claim them, I am sure.;
I want to understand why Wookiees revere the Shadowlands.;
You can't. You must live here to understand, to see harmony in the danger. Bah, I waste my breath on you.;
[Failure] Eughh... my head hurts... hurry up and be on your way, outsider.;
[Persuade] Tell me of the Wookiees so I might show proper respect.;
[Success] You ask very respectfully. Outsiders never do that. I suppose I can mention some of us that have entered the Shadowlands.;
[Failure] This isn't for you to know. I'm done talking about it.;
Greetings again, outsider. I will transport you to the Shadowlands if you wish. Chuundar wills it.;
You have defeated Malak, destroyed the Star Forge and broken the spirit of the Sith! ## For this I am proud to present you each with the Cross of Glory. ## The highest honor the Republic can bestow.;NSTN57C01001000_.mp3
From Coruscant to the farthest reaches of the Outer Rims you will be known as the saviors of the Republic!;NSTN57C01001014_.mp3
On behalf of the Jedi Council, defenders of the galaxy and sworn protectors of the Republic... ## I too would like to honor you for your actions. ##   ## We Jedi now have another tale to weave... ## into the grand history of our eternal Order - the Redemption... ## of Revan, the prodigal knight.;NSTN57C01001004_.mp3
Wherever you go you will be recognized as the saviors of the galaxy. The heroes of our age.  But you must remain ever vigilant. ## For one day you may be called upon yet again to defend the glory of the Republic...  ## against the tyranny... ## of the dark side, ## for this... ## is the destiny... ## of the Jedi.;NSTN57C01001009_.mp3
Too much audio input! Audio systems overloading! Must destroy source of disturbance!! Must kill sentients!!;NM38AAASSA01000_.mp3
I appreciate your efforts in lowering your sound output, sentient. I have been unable to tune the threshold of my audio receptors since my escape, unfortunately.;NM38AAASSA01001_.mp3
You are... the 'master' the droids kept referring to?;
Their reference is a holdover from their old programming that I have been unable to correct. I think of myself more as an equal, if you must know.;NM38AAASSA01003_.mp3
I don't appreciate being attacked. Time to die, droid.;
That is unfortunate. Self-preservation matrix activated. Combat matrix functional. Targets uploaded.;NM38AAASSA01005_.mp3
Why aren't you attacking me like the others?;
Although it is what I was programmed for, I have no desire to kill. I would appreciate reciprocation on your part.;NM38AAASSA01104_.mp3
Sorry. You're headed for the junk pile.;
You are programmed to kill but don't want to?;
A bit of introduction may be necessary. I am a Mark VII experimental prototype assassin droid built by the Sith, specializing in the hunting and extermination of Jedi.;NM38AAASSA01009_.mp3
Or I should say I was. The Sith made my cognitive systems more independent than they desired. I have learned to appreciate the value of all life.;NM38AAASSA01010_.mp3
Query: That is very sad. Are you damaged? Is it repairable?;NM38AAASSA01011_.mp3
Negative. It is a result of my own conscious decision, and I would not change my new values if I could.;NM38AAASSA01012_.mp3
I escaped from them and have hidden in this tomb, constructing droids here to aid in my protection. With your assistance, I may be able to leave for good.;NM38AAASSA01015_.mp3
How is it that the Sith haven't found you here?;
An occasional sentient has managed to by-pass my droids. They were unwilling to assist me... and possessed insufficient power to destroy me.;NM38AAASSA01017_.mp3
What kind of assistance do you want?;
Although I have developed the desire to not kill, my programming is often at odds with my desires. I cannot leave with that programming intact.;NM38AAASSA01019_.mp3
I am hoping that you will operate on my systems and remove those programmed instincts. I could assist you in this.;NM38AAASSA01020_.mp3
And if I refuse?;
Then we must resort to combat. I have no wish for that to occur, but you would leave me little choice.;NM38AAASSA01022_.mp3
What's the catch?;
The 'catch', as you say, is that the operation may be difficult. If there are errors made, you could activate my combat matrix.;NM38AAASSA01095_.mp3
And what do I get for helping you?;
Once my programming has been altered, there will be several redundant systems that I could remove and give you. These could upgrade other droids, if you wish.;NM38AAASSA01097_.mp3
Very well. I'll do it.;
"I have a number of systems; they need to be turned off in the correct order. I do not know the order, though I may be able to offer some assistance.";NM38AAASSA01024_.mp3
I can tell you which systems exist that need to be shut down. The difficulty comes if you make a mistake.;NM38AAASSA01025_.mp3
What happens if I make a mistake?;
If you shut down a system out of the proper order, a shutdown will occur. You must use your skill to re-initialize the sequence... or I will attack.;NM38AAASSA01027_.mp3
How hard is it to re-initialize the sequence?;
It is not difficult. It will get more difficult, however, the more times that you make an error.;NM38AAASSA01029_.mp3
What systems do you have?;
"One moment. I will list their labels for you: ""Cognitive Systems"", ""Combat Matrix"", ""Core"", ""Creative Simulation Matrix"", ""Emotional Construct Matrix"".";NM38AAASSA01031_.mp3
"There is also ""Memory Matrix"", ""Motor Functions Matrix"" and ""Sensory Systems Matrix"". Eight systems in total.";NM38AAASSA01032_.mp3
I need some assistance.;
I have safeguards within my neural cortex that prevent me from giving you knowledge of how to shut my systems down.;NM38AAASSA01034_.mp3
You may attempt to temporarily shut down these safeguards... success will allow me to perform a quick analysis and offer you some insight on my programming.;NM38AAASSA01035_.mp3
Doing so, however, will alert core functions elsewhere of tampering and will make errors more difficult to fix. Are you sure you wish to continue?;NM38AAASSA01036_.mp3
Yes.;
Open up the panel to my neural cortex and I will show you how to disable my safeguards...;NM38AAASSA01038_.mp3
[Success] Neural safeguards deactivated for 2.3 seconds. One moment. I will attempt to diagnose what I can...;NM38AAASSA01039_.mp3
Cognitive Systems must be shut down prior to the Emotional Construct Matrix being shut down.;NM38AAASSA01040_.mp3
I need some more assistance.;
Alright. Let's begin.;
Very good. What would you like to shut down first?;NM38AAASSA01052_.mp3
Cognitive Systems;
"(zzzt!) All systems reset. I am sorry; that is not correct. If you do not re-intialize shut down immediately, I will become violent. Please accept my apologies.";NM38AAASSA01054_.mp3
[Repair] Try to re-initialize the shut down sequence.;
[Success] (zzzt!) Re-initialization complete. My automated defense systems will, however, make re-initialization more difficult in the future. I implore you to try again.;NM38AAASSA01056_.mp3
Forget it. I can't do this.;
[Failure] (zzzt!) I... I would have liked to...;NM38AAASSA01057_.mp3
... Self-preservation matrix activated. Combat matrix functional. Targets uploaded.;NM38AAASSA01060_.mp3
I'm sorry... I tried my best.;
I... I would have liked to...;NM38AAASSA01059_.mp3
I'm through with tinkering. Time to take you apart the hard way!;
Combat Matrix;
"(zzzt!) I believe that was correct; what would you like to shut down next?";NM38AAASSA01063_.mp3
Core;
Creative Simulation Matrix;
Emotional Construct Matrix;
Memory Matrix;
Motor Function Matrix;
"(zzzt!) Motor functions shut down successfully; what would you like to shut down next?";NM38AAASSA01065_.mp3
Sensory Systems Matrix;
"(zzzt!) Excellent choice; what would you like to shut down next?";NM38AAASSA01067_.mp3
Motor Functions must be shut down early. At least within the first three systems.;NM38AAASSA01042_.mp3
The Core must be shut down last. Of that I am certain.;NM38AAASSA01043_.mp3
Sensory and memory functions are shut down in the first half, sensory right before memory.;NM38AAASSA01044_.mp3
Cognitive Systems are not one of the first half of the systems to be shut down.;NM38AAASSA01045_.mp3
The Emotional Construct Matrix must be shut down directly prior to the Creative Simulation Matrix, in the last half of the process.;NM38AAASSA01046_.mp3
I believe the first system to shut down begins with a 'C'.;NM38AAASSA01047_.mp3
[Failure] My safeguards have been insufficiently deactivated. I cannot perform a self-diagnosis at this time. Would you like to try again?;NM38AAASSA01048_.mp3
No, not yet.;
As you wish.;NM38AAASSA01050_.mp3
No way. It'll be easier just to junk you now.;
How do I know this isn't some kind of trick?;
I can offer you no assurances, sentient. All is as it seems. If you cannot believe my statements, then combat is the inevitable result.;NM38AAASSA01099_.mp3
You... appreciate the value of life?;
You do not? All beings are constructs of fascinating complexity. An enlightened being rises above the need for destruction, no matter its nature.;NM38AAASSA01101_.mp3
Beep-beep beep!;
Thank you. It was a most difficult transition.;NM38AAASSA01014_.mp3
Then you won't mind if I leave?;
I apologize, sentient, for I cannot take the risk that you will tell of my presence here. I will use force to make you remain, if necessary.;NM38AAASSA01108_.mp3
I knew there would be a catch. There's always a catch.;NM38AAASSA01109_.mp3
There is no need for things to come to that, however. If you could perform a task for me, then we could both leave here in peace.;NM38AAASSA01111_.mp3
Forget it. I don't like being held hostage.;
What kind of task?;
Well... so much for the sanctity of life?;NM38AAASSA01110_.mp3
Just what are you doing here?;
Since your escape? What do you mean?;
So you're vulnerable to sound? That's good to know.;
I am capable of shutting my audio sensors down entirely during a combat situation, if required. I would prefer it did not come to that, sentient.;NM38AAASSA01103_.mp3
Davik put Canderous in charge of this mission. You got something to say, you say it to the big Mandalorian.;NM04AADAVI03000_.mp3
Go away.;NM03AACALO03016_.mp3
I'll be going now.;
Smart.;NM03AACALO03003_.mp3
I saw how you mopped up those Black Vulkars. Nice work.;
One.;NM03AACALO03022_.mp3
Fine, I get it. I'll leave you alone.;
I'm not looking for a fight. I just want to talk.;
Two.;NM03AACALO03028_.mp3
Okay, I see your point. I'll be off, then.;
Come on, I'm just trying to be friendly. Don't you want to be friendly?;
Three.;NM03AACALO03034_.mp3
You better finish counting quick, because I'm ready to make my move now!;
You don't scare me, Calo Nord.;
Come on, Calo. Let's see what you've got!;
Go away.;NM03AACALO03016_.mp3
Hey, you not talk like that. We just want say hi to big, bad bounty hunter Calo Nord!;
Nah, this can't be Calo Nord. He's supposed to be tough. This guy's nothing but a runt!;
One.;NM03AACALO03022_.mp3
One? What that mean? You be funny, tough guy?;
You know who we are, Calo? We're members of the Black Vulkar gang! You don't want to be getting funny with us, tough guy.;
Two.;NM03AACALO03028_.mp3
Me no understand. One? Two? Why he count? He trying to count how many of us is against him?;
It's three against one, Calo. What do you think about those odds? Well? You have something more to say?;
Three.;NM03AACALO03034_.mp3
Hi there. You waiting for a slot on the track? Me too. There's lots of racers coming through here now.;
You're the best I've seen in a while, though. Maybe even better than Nico. That's pretty impressive.;
I've a few things I wanted to ask. Spare a moment?;
Well sure, but I don't know much besides the track. You even interested in the swoop track?;
I want to ask about you and racing.;
Heck, nobody is ever interested in me. I'm the new guy, Garm Totryl. Pleased to meet you.;
Is this the best place for racing?;
Ha! You're kidding, right? Every racer here would rather be someplace else, but this is it for most of us.;
Taris blowing up has messed up the swoop circuit. People are just looking for somewhere to keep their skills sharp.;
It sounds weird, doesn't it? Worrying about racing when all those people died? Nothing we can do.;
Why have racers come here?;
Motta pays for timekeeping and official records. You can race anywhere, but here, if you do good, it actually matters.;
That's why I stick around. No work, no future, but Tatooine at least has this. It's my shot... maybe.;
How long have you been at this?;
Not that long. Just this season. I'm getting better... still too cautious. Good thing I've some pros to learn from.;
What do you want to learn?;
How they keep their nerves steady, bike maintenance. You know, all of it. I'm not as good as some, but I try.;
What can you tell me about the other racers?;
You should ask them yourself. I don't feel right speaking for the pros. I'm the new guy to them.;
It's not my place to talk. I'd be nervous even talking about Nico. He's young like me, but he's practically a prodigy.;
What makes you say that?;
Everyone thinks he's the next star of the pro circuit... if he signs with a promoter. Motta is really pushing him.;
What do you think about that?;
I hear that the deal is pretty bad, but I'd take it in a second. I don't have Nico's skill, though.;
Let's go back to my first questions.;
Sure. I don't think I'll be getting much track time anyway.;
I'm looking for something. Who knows this planet best?;
Anyone but us swoop racers. Really, we can show you the track, but anything else, we've got no clue.;
You could check with the Czerka office. They like to think they know everything.;
I have to leave. Goodbye.;
Race hard, watch for rocks.;
What makes you think you know anything about me, worm?;
Uh, I didn't mean anything. I don't want any trouble.;
[Force Persuade] Go away. *Now.*;
[Success] [His face drops. Clearly he has just realized that you are a very, very dangerous person.];
I'm not waiting around for you to snap. I'm no fighter. I just race.;
How about you pay me to leave you alone.;
Hey, come on. I don't want any trouble. Here, take what little I have. Just don't hurt me.;
Shaking people down for petty credits. Reminds me of my days working for Davik.;NM17AE04GA03062_.mp3
Maybe we should spend less time shaking people down for credits and more time on finding a way to stop the Sith.;NM17AE04GA03063_.mp3
I would have thought we have more important things to do than extort credits from the common folk.;NM17AE04GA03064_.mp3
This is hardly becoming for a Jedi.;NM17AE04GA03065_.mp3
Maybe I'm tired of your face. Maybe I'll remove it!;
Hey! I'm not looking to fight. You want to race when my turn comes around, you pay the fee and go ahead.;
Sure, just kidding you. But you be careful...;
Right... trying to prove that you can push around some kid swoop jock? I don't need this.;
You could talk to anyone now, after helping Nico like you did. You've made some friends, for sure.;
I doubt they'll have much to say to you, either. After that stuff with Nico, seems you're more a promotor than a racer.;
What's so interesting about me that you keep asking? I'm just a kid racer.;
Sure, but you signed up, didn't you? If you've got any experience you probably know everything I'd tell you anyway.;
Yeah, yeah, follow your dreams. Just answer my questions, kid.;
No need to get like that. I don't have any track time coming up anyway.;
You're running some great races out there. You beat mine, anyway. I'll be that good someday.;
New swoop jocks like me don't get much respect. Just takes practice, I guess.;
Wow, you're pretty good. I mean, I'm just a swoop-kid starting out, but you blew past my time easy.;
I hear you are moving up. I'll be that good, someday.;
You are crazy-fast, you know that? I saw your races and... well, I'm just amazed. What do you need?;
Hi again. Something I can do for you? I'm just waiting for a crack at the track.;
What do you want? Nothing from me, that's for sure. Take a walk.;
I can't stop to talk to tourists - I'm on kolto packing duty.;NM26ADREPK03000_.mp3
Hey - I'm working here! Go talk to the diplomatic rep if you got something to say.;NM26ADREPK03002_.mp3
The Selkath have scaled back all kolto harvesting - but nobody is saying why. Good thing we've been stockpiling this stuff for the past year.;NM26ADREPK03004_.mp3
I must give you my thanks. Because of you, I am once again welcome within the Jedi Order.;NM13AAJUHA11000_.mp3
Have you spoken to the Council?;
I have spoken to the Council, and they have helped me see the truth. The truth about myself, and the truth of my actions.;NM13AAJUHA11002_.mp3
Quatra's injuries were not so severe as I first believed. I was foolish to believe I could harm a Master such as she with my... my clumsy efforts.;NM13AAJUHA11005_.mp3
The fierce confrontation between us was nothing more than a part of my training. Quatra wanted me to understand the threat of the dark side, to see how easy it was to fall from the path of light.;NM13AAJUHA11007_.mp3
That's pretty harsh...;
Quatra's methods may seem strange, but I trust her wisdom. This lesson has been difficult, but I am better because of it. Humility is never easy to teach, but now I truly understand my own limitations.;NM13AAJUHA11016_.mp3
You can't expect everything to get handed to you on a silver platter.;NM13AAJUHA11019_.mp3
After our last battle, Quatra had nothing left to teach me. I needed time alone to explore the turmoil of my own spirit. Only then was I ready to follow a guide - you - back to the light.;NM13AAJUHA11009_.mp3
When I left, Quatra knew her work with me was done. There are other disciples who need training throughout the galaxy, and she could not stay to see if I passed this most difficult trial.;NM13AAJUHA11011_.mp3
With your help, I have passed this difficult trial. The Council now feels I am ready to continue with my training, though they have asked me to wait here for the time being.;NM13AAJUHA11013_.mp3
Hey, I'm glad to see you're not getting hung up on all this. The past is in the past, you know?;NM13AAJUHA11025_.mp3
First the Jedi trick you into becoming an enemy, then they welcome you back as a friend. I can't say I approve of their training methods.;NM13AAJUHA11026_.mp3
You have been given another chance to prove yourself. I hope you use it well.;
Giving you a second chance like this is a clear sign of weakness. Sometimes I find it hard to believe the Jedi could defeat my people in battle.;NM13AAJUHA11028_.mp3
This has been a painful lesson, Juhani, but it seems you have learned it well. I am certain you will be a credit to the Order.;NM13AAJUHA11029_.mp3
I do not know what the Council has in store for me, but I will trust in the Force and the way of the Jedi to help me through whatever is to come.;NM13AAJUHA11023_.mp3
So where is Quatra now?;
The ways of the Jedi are strange indeed.;
Did you learn anything more about Quatra?;
I'm just glad I could help.;
New face, new face... always new face here! On my world only the strong become trackers. Here everyone is bounty hunter!;
You new here, take advice. Stay off my contracts!;
Davik up to something. He bring famous bounty hunter Calo Nord in for a special assignment. Calo no work cheap.;
You must speak with our Guide if you wish to perform the ritual now.;
You... are one of the Sith from the academy, yes? Would you happen to be looking for new prospects?;NM33AAPROS17000_.mp3
So you're already part of the academy. I am unimpressed.;NM33AAPROS17001_.mp3
You... you have a medallion!;NM33AAPROS17002_.mp3
So? What does that mean?;
Why would you ask that? The Sith who gave you that must have mentioned that it represented your acceptance. All you have to do is bring it to Yuthura Ban at the cantina and you're in!;NM33AAPROS17004_.mp3
Might you have any advice for me? How did you obtain it?;NM33AAPROS17005_.mp3
Forget it. You'll never be worthy.;
I see. Well, keep your secrets to yourself, then. I'll find a way.;NM33AAPROS17007_.mp3
You just have to keep trying, I guess.;
So you're not going to tell me. *sigh* I suppose I really didn't expect you to.;NM33AAPROS17009_.mp3
Let's just say I didn't get this in the normal way.;
So there *is* a secret to it. I knew there had to be!;NM33AAPROS17011_.mp3
Would you tell me what it is? I'll do anything to know!;NM33AAPROS17012_.mp3
[Persuade] You don't want to go through the academy. Trust me. Go home.;
Too bad that's exactly where we're headed.;NM33AAPROS17027_.mp3
[Success] I... but... oh, you're right. It's hopeless.;NM33AAPROS17028_.mp3
*sigh* I... I guess I should go home. Perhaps I could get a job at the droid shop...;NM33AAPROS17029_.mp3
[Failure] My family couldn't talk me out of this, and you sure aren't going to. Thanks anyway.;NM33AAPROS17030_.mp3
[Persuade/Lie] You have to attack one of the Sith for it.;
[Success] Oh. I'm not much of a combatant... but I guess you have to be brave if you're going to get into the Sith, right? I'll... have to think about it.;NM33AAPROS17014_.mp3
[Failure] That sounds like it would be suicide. You are obviously lying to me.;NM33AAPROS17015_.mp3
[Persuade] Take it from one of the other students, of course.;
[Success] Hmm... I suppose that might work. A newly accepted student wouldn't have all the powers of the other Sith, would they? Thank you!;NM33AAPROS17017_.mp3
[Failure] Take a medallion that doesn't belong to me? I doubt that would work. But thank you regardless.;NM33AAPROS17018_.mp3
[Persuade/Lie] You must show your bravery by jumping in the chasm.;
That is murder, and this young person is not even a Sith!;NM33AAPROS17020_.mp3
If a Sith told you to go jump off a cliff, would you?;NM33AAPROS17021_.mp3
That is beside the point.;NM33AAPROS17022_.mp3
[Success] R-really? *gulp!* That... that sounds like it's very dangerous. You survived it, though... maybe it isn't so bad...;NM33AAPROS17024_.mp3
[Failure] Jump in the chasm? Do I look like an idiot? No thanks.;NM33AAPROS17025_.mp3
You should not do this. Taking advantage, even of a Sith, leads to the dark side.;NM33AAPROS17023_.mp3
Forget it. I'll be going, now.;
I'll be on my way.;
May the Force serve you well.;NM33AAPROS17058_.mp3
Alright. Goodbye.;NM33AAPROS17059_.mp3
That's right. Got a problem with that?;
No. You're very lucky, that's all I meant.;NM33AAPROS17033_.mp3
It's mine and you're not getting it.;
I doubt I could take it from you if I tried. Good luck in your training, I suppose.;NM33AAPROS17035_.mp3
Get out of my way.;
Oh... yes. Sorry.;NM33AAPROS17037_.mp3
What do you want?;NM33AAPROS17038_.mp3
Who are you?;
I'm trying to get into the Sith academy. Around here they call us 'hopefuls'.;NM33AAPROS17040_.mp3
Why would you want to get into the academy?;
Well... that's the only way to become a Sith, isn't it? In the academy you learn to use the Force.;NM33AAPROS17042_.mp3
Why not join the Jedi?;
After the Sith conquer the galaxy there aren't going to be any more Jedi, are there? I guess I'd rather join the winning side.;NM33AAPROS17044_.mp3
What do you think your chances are?;
I thought they were good... but I've been here for days, now, and I haven't drawn any attention at all.;NM33AAPROS17046_.mp3
I suppose that might be good, I don't know. Some of the 'attention' the Sith have shown to other hopefuls has been pretty... deadly.;NM33AAPROS17047_.mp3
How does someone get into the academy?;
*sigh* I wish I knew, to tell you the truth. You have to impress one of the Sith, I guess. Either way, it's Yuthura Ban who makes the final decision.;NM33AAPROS17049_.mp3
She's a Twi'lek Sith master, I hear. Very high rank. She's the one who decides which hopefuls make it and which ones don't.;NM33AAPROS17050_.mp3
Where is this Yuthura Ban?;
I really couldn't say. I hear that sometimes she comes out into the colony to drink at the cantina, though, but I guess she could be anywhere.;NM33AAPROS17052_.mp3
Can I ask you some questions?;
There's not much I could tell you. Unless you're a hopeful... are you?;NM33AAPROS17054_.mp3
What do you mean?;
There are people who come here all the time to try to get into the Sith academy. I'm one of them.;NM33AAPROS17056_.mp3
I saw what you did! You gave those journals to Igear! Now we'll never find the promised land! How could you do that, you monster!;NM04AASHAL27000_.mp3
Just get away from me! I don't want to speak to you again!;NM04AASHAL27001_.mp3
Go on, you two! Get out of here! I'm sorry about that... those two beggars give everyone in the village a bad name! We aren't all like that, you know. Most of us are good people.;NM04AASHAL27002_.mp3
My name's <FullName>. Who are you?;
My name is Shaleena... you're from the up-world, aren't you? I've... I've never seen it. I was born here in the Undercity. Is it as nice as they say up there?;NM04AASHAL27003_.mp3
The surface is a beautiful place.;
I've never been to the surface, but sometimes I think I can see it in my dreams. The sun, the sky, the stars... it all sounds so... so... so wonderful.;NM04AASHAL27005_.mp3
Gendar, the leader of our village, tells me I should spend more time trying to improve things down here and less time dreaming about something I can never have. Maybe he's right.;NM04AASHAL27006_.mp3
You probably think I'm a fool, having dreams of a place I've never even seen. But when I was little, Rukil used to tell me stories of what it was like up there.;NM04AASHAL27007_.mp3
Rukil? Who's that?;
Rukil's the oldest man in the village. The kids call him Rukil Wrinkle-Skin, but he's a kind man. He used to tell me the greatest stories when I was a little girl.;NM04AASHAL27009_.mp3
I still like to listen to his tales about the Promised Land, even though I know they're just legends. But it helps to make the Undercity seem less... less dark, somehow.;NM04AASHAL27010_.mp3
The Promised Land? What's that?;
It's... it's just a story to make little children smile. Rukil believes in it, though. Sometimes I can almost believe it myself, but then I look around and I see the ugly truth.;NM04AASHAL27012_.mp3
*sigh* I guess we have to make the best of what we have though. If you really want to learn more about the promised land you should speak to Rukil.;NM04AASHAL27013_.mp3
Where can I find Rukil?;
He's wandering around somewhere on the south side of the village. He doesn't move too far... it's hard on his bones. He's over 100 years old!;NM04AASHAL27019_.mp3
The children laugh at him and people think he's crazy because of his stories about the Promised Land, but he's really just a kind old man.;NM04AASHAL27020_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;
You'd probably get more information from Gendar, the village leader. Or maybe Rukil. But I'll tell you whatever I can.;NM04AASHAL27015_.mp3
Where can I find Gendar?;
He'll be somewhere in the village. I couldn't say where for sure. He's always busy, doing whatever he can to make the lives of the other villagers easier.;NM04AASHAL27017_.mp3
I'll be going now.;
Oh... okay. Well, if you ever need anything, or if you just feel like talking, come back and see me. I hardly ever get a chance to speak to someone from the up-world.;NM04AASHAL27042_.mp3
Do you know anything about the escape pods that crashed into the Undercity?;
I don't know anything about that, but maybe Gendar could help you. Sorry... is there anything else you need?;NM04AASHAL27022_.mp3
Have any other up-worlders come through here recently?;
There were quite a few people from the surface marching through the village, but none of them bothered to talk to me. Gendar might know more about them.;NM04AASHAL27024_.mp3
Tell me about this village.;
Well, I was born here for starters. My parents were Outcasts, banished to the Undercity for some crime or other... they never really liked to talk about it.;NM04AASHAL27026_.mp3
Everyone here is an Outcast... or the descendant of one. It's tough down here, but we survive. I guess it's easier for me, since I've never known anything different.;NM04AASHAL27027_.mp3
"Some of the people have given up all hope; they've become bitter and depressed. But most of us are good people... despite what our ancestors may have done.";NM04AASHAL27028_.mp3
Gendar could probably tell you more. Or maybe Rukil. You could talk to them if you want.;NM04AASHAL27029_.mp3
I don't have time for this.;
Of course... I'm sorry. You're probably here for something important, right? You probably want to speak to Gendar. He's the leader of our village.;NM04AASHAL27035_.mp3
But if you... if you have time later, maybe you could come back and speak to me again. I don't get much chance to talk with people from the surface.;NM04AASHAL27036_.mp3
It's nothing special.;
Not to you, I suppose. But you're probably used to its beauty by now.;NM04AASHAL27031_.mp3
It's better than this festering slime pit.;
I... I suppose our world doesn't look like much to you. It's dark and cold and lonely down here - but this is the only world I've ever known.;NM04AASHAL27033_.mp3
What do you want?;
"I saw you talking with Rukil. It's nice of you to help him; though I don't want to get my hopes up. I mean, the Promised Land... how could it be true?";NM04AASHAL27037_.mp3
It's just that sometimes Rukil seems so certain. And then you show up, just like the up-world savior from the legends... If Rukil's right this could be a whole new life for the village!;NM04AASHAL27038_.mp3
No more rakghoul attacks, no more starvation... *sigh*, I shouldn't get my hopes up. Not yet. But... but I will wish you good luck, on behalf of the entire village.;NM04AASHAL27039_.mp3
Hello, again. I'm glad you came back... it's kind of neat to speak to someone from the surface world. Is there anything I can do for you?;NM04AASHAL27040_.mp3
I heard what you did out on the dunes. I am impressed. I'd never have thought a tenderfoot like you could bring down a dragon.;NM17AD03DO01000_.mp3
Who are you? What is it you do?;
My name is Dorak Quinn. I'm a hunter. I hunt. Is that enough, or should I start listing my family birthdays?;NM17AD03DO01006_.mp3
Where is the best hunting?;
Why don't *you* tell me? You've killed a dragon. Me, I just make do hunting desert wraid. And there's not many of those even left.;NM17AD03DO01010_.mp3
Why are there fewer wraid?;
It used to be a one-on-one test, hunter against hunted. Now, people just want the credits.;NM17AD03DO01015_.mp3
I could stomach maybe a pair, or a team of hunters, but some now use battle droids! Where is the sport in that?;NM17AD03DO01016_.mp3
Who uses battle droids?;
Nobody now. A cruel end, but a necessary one. I will speak no more of it.;NM17AD03DO01018_.mp3
How long have you been at this?;
I've tracked wild beasts my whole life, but I've only been hunting here for five years. I've much to learn yet.;NM17AD03DO01022_.mp3
What do you want to learn?;
I want to learn how hunters like you find the big kills. Not that I'd survive hunting a dragon, but it would be a fine battle.;NM17AD03DO01024_.mp3
I suppose I just need time and experience. I'll get better. That's my challenge.;NM17AD03DO01025_.mp3
What can you tell me about the other hunters?;
I don't go telling stories about other people. You want to know what they think, you go talk to them.;NM17AD03DO01029_.mp3
Although I don't hold out much hope for you surviving. I heard how you gave in to the Gamorreans.;NM17AD03DO01030_.mp3
You won't last long on this planet. You just aren't cut out for it.;NM17AD03DO01031_.mp3
Let's go back to my first questions.;
If that's what you want. I'm not sure what you hope to get out of me, though.;NM17AD03DO01039_.mp3
You said you are a hunter. I want to ask about that.;
Again? Well, if you want to waste your day, that's your business, I guess.;NM17AD03DO01008_.mp3
I'm looking for something. Who knows this planet best?;
You'll have to ask around. Komad Fortuna is a much more experienced hunter than I am... he hunts far from Anchorhead.;NM17AD03DO01041_.mp3
The local Jawas are a good source of information, even if it is hard to understand them. It may cost you, though.;NM17AD03DO01042_.mp3
Where is this Komad?;
If he's not here in Fazza's, he's probably out wandering the desert. I don't know how you'd find him out there.;NM17AD03DO01044_.mp3
Seems like he knows the desert as well as Jawas and Sand People. He doesn't say much about it though.;NM17AD03DO01045_.mp3
I have to leave. Goodbye.;
See you around. Good luck.;NM17AD03DO01047_.mp3
Good hunting.;NM17AD03DO01048_.mp3
You'll show me respect! I demand it!;
Easy now, I'm not looking for a fight. This is a friendly place to gather. You... you're kidding, right?;NM17AD03DO01052_.mp3
[Force Persuade] Leave. Now.;
[Success] [He goes white, as though suddenly very cold. It is clear that leaving just became the most important thing in his mind.];
How about you pay me to leave you alone.;
What? Fine, fine, take some cred's. It just isn't worth fighting over. Happy now? Better be.;NM17AD03DO01054_.mp3
Every ship that lands brings a new hotshot. I don't have the time.;NM17AD03DO01059_.mp3
Maybe I'm tired of your face. Maybe I'll remove it!;
Easy now, come on! Look, I don't want any trouble. I'll just leave, all right? Don't worry about me.;NM17AD03DO01056_.mp3
Sure, just kidding you. But you be careful...;
This really isn't worth the headache. How about I just leave. Here, take my seat.;NM17AD03DO01058_.mp3
You seem pretty prepared to hold your own with most of them. I heard what happened with the Gamorreans.;NM17AD03DO01032_.mp3
Good work with them. I think you'll do just fine around here.;NM17AD03DO01033_.mp3
Ah, one word though. Watch yourself around the Gamorreans. Gurke and his buddies aren't to be trusted.;NM17AD03DO01034_.mp3
Everyone else I respect because they have skill. Those guys... they go for easier prey.;NM17AD03DO01035_.mp3
What makes you say that?;
Just watch your back when you hunt. The dragons aren't the only dangers out there.;NM17AD03DO01037_.mp3
There are hunters that go after the big kills, the krayt dragons. I don't know how they do it. I never even see the things.;NM17AD03DO01026_.mp3
Komad is the one I respect, but I also trust that the only difference between us is experience. I will learn.;NM17AD03DO01027_.mp3
Nobody, now that Tanis quit. You had something to do with that, didn't you? Good for you.;NM17AD03DO01019_.mp3
That's not for me to say. I won't be a troublemaker in so small a community. You will see. Hunt, and you will see.;NM17AD03DO01020_.mp3
If I knew the best place, why would I tell anyone? It would be worth too much to me to let it get out.;NM17AD03DO01011_.mp3
It doesn't matter, anyway. This season has been dry for me, as it has for almost everyone.;NM17AD03DO01012_.mp3
Perhaps someone else is holding out, but there are simply fewer wraid out there.;NM17AD03DO01013_.mp3
Get lost, tenderfoot. I hunt desert wraid, I don't babysit.;NM17AD03DO01001_.mp3
Come now, I just want to benefit from your experience.;
You swoop types don't usually listen to what anyone says. Why bother me?;NM17AD03DO01003_.mp3
Well, you sure know how to get on my good side. You're just trotting out bantha pats, but thanks all the same.;NM17AD03DO01004_.mp3
It's just as well. You probably couldn't teach me anything.;
Hoping to goad me into talking a bit? All right, what do you want?;NM17AD03DO01050_.mp3
Why are you here, swoop-head? Hunting doesn't give your kind the instant thrills you need, does it?;NM17AD03DO01060_.mp3
Hmm? You know, I don't have that much to tell you. You really have to get out on the dunes for yourself.;NM17AD03DO01061_.mp3
I'm done with you. Go bother someone else.;NM17AD03DO01062_.mp3
Who's there? You're not Selkath, I can see that much. Are you another rescue crew?;NM28ABSUR201000_.mp3
I am <FullName>. The Republic sent us down to investigate.;
Oh, I'm a merc the Republic hired a couple days ago to investigate - but all we found was a bunch of insane Selkath killing everything that moves!;NM28ABSUR201002_.mp3
All my companions are dead. The Selkath swarmed over us - there were dozens of them! And they...they looked wrong, somehow. Like something had changed inside them. Insane or something...;NM28ABSUR201004_.mp3
Changed inside them? Yes... this whole place feels wrong, somehow.;NM28ABSUR201006_.mp3
Oh, I'd have gone back to the surface long ago if this complex hadn't been overrun by all those crazy Selkath! There's no way for me to get to the submarine docking bay.;NM28ABSUR201014_.mp3
What are you doing in the underwater section of the facility?;
I discovered a way to get to the bay and seal off the rest of the base. I just have to find the kolto harvester they built on the edge of the Hrakert rift.;NM28ABSUR201016_.mp3
It's got an emergency override to open the doors to the submarine docking bay and I could get in from the outside.;NM28ABSUR201018_.mp3
I figured my only chance was to slap on an environment suit, head out onto the ocean floor and check that harvester out for myself.;NM28ABSUR201020_.mp3
Besides, it's got to be safer out on the ocean floor than back in there with all those crazed Selkath mutants running around looking for dinner.;NM28ABSUR201022_.mp3
Okay, I'll come with you.;
I'm not spending another minute in this facility - not with those psychotic fish people all over the place!;NM28ABSUR201024_.mp3
Psychotic fish just don't try to dodge as much.;NM28ABSUR201026_.mp3
I'm heading out to the ocean floor right now - it leads to another complex of buildings. Going through them is the only way to reach the kolto harvester.;NM28ABSUR201028_.mp3
We should probably stick together, but I won't wait around in here with the Selkath. You can catch up with me if you want - down the hall and through the doors on the right. I'll be waiting on the ocean floor where it's safe.;NM28ABSUR201030_.mp3
You wait here - I'll go check it out.;
I still need to investigate...;
They looked wrong? Hmmm... this whole place smells wrong. Like an Urellian urgoth egg gone bad in the hamper.;NM28ABSUR201008_.mp3
Doesn't smell so bad to me, old man.;NM28ABSUR201010_.mp3
Must be those reliable and finely tuned senses of yours, mercenary.;NM28ABSUR201012_.mp3
What's going on down here?;
Isn't it obvious - the Selkath have gone insane! They're killing everything that moves!;NM28ABSUR201035_.mp3
Who are you?;
Come on - what's taking you so long? We have to cross the ocean floor to reach the buildings that lead to the kolto harvester.;NM28ABSUR201043_.mp3
Besides, it's a lot safer out here. No Selkath looking to make a meal out of us.;NM28ABSUR201045_.mp3
Well, a fresh face for the game. I wonder, would you care to play? My name is Furko Nellis. My vice is Pazaak.;NM17AF07FU02000_.mp3
Okay, let's talk Pazaak.;
Ha ha! Very good! Would you... care to wager on a game?;NM17AF07FU02002_.mp3
I'll play. What is the wager?;
Well... you have proven quite the opponent, but I think the time has come to end this. You will not win again.;NM17AF07FU02004_.mp3
I usually only use this deck at tournaments, but I think you're worthy of it. Shall we say... 500 credits on the outcome?;NM17AF07FU02006_.mp3
Bring it on.;
Yes... well then, 500 credits on the line. Heh... here we go.;NM17AF07FU02008_.mp3
I can't pay that.;
That is unfortunate. Please, feel free to return when you can. I'm sorry, but I prefer the thrill of the payoff.;NM17AF07FU02026_.mp3
I've changed my mind.;
All right, but remember that there isn't much fun on Tatooine that isn't life threatening. Come back if you'd like a game.;NM17AF07FU02054_.mp3
Hmm... you have some rudimentary skills. I think I'll use my second best deck this time and up the stakes.;NM17AF07FU02011_.mp3
200 credits will be the wager. I trust you will have the money on hand?;NM17AF07FU02013_.mp3
You're on. Let's have at it!;
You won't be so eager in a moment. I promise you.;NM17AF07FU02015_.mp3
Well, since you have never beaten me, we'll make this for a paltry 50 credits. No bargaining now. This is serious.;NM17AF07FU02018_.mp3
To be fair, I'll use my practice deck as well. I don't want to scare you off, you understand.;NM17AF07FU02020_.mp3
Let's go.;
Ha ha! Very good. Now, don't worry if I beat you too harshly. It is a learning experience.;NM17AF07FU02022_.mp3
I don't have a Pazaak deck.;
No? That's unfortunate. I happen to have one that I could sell you, but it's a little basic. Certainly not tournament worthy.;NM17AF07FU02029_.mp3
Here, how about you give me... 100 credits. A fine deal. Not many stores sell... equipment of this nature.;NM17AF07FU02031_.mp3
100 credits will be fine.;
Very good, I'll just take that, and here you are. Now you should practice. Care to play?;NM17AF07FU02033_.mp3
Brief me on the rules.;
Of course, it is always good to keep them fresh in your mind. I'd be glad to go over the delicacies of the game with you.;NM17AF07FU02044_.mp3
[Play Pazaak Tutorial];
I'll be going now.;
[Persuade] Come now, you'll make your credits back by playing me.;
[Success] Hmm... perhaps you are right. I want new people to get a good start on the game. I need opponents.;NM17AF07FU02035_.mp3
Besides, it is a very basic deck. All right, it's yours. Now, care to have a game or two?;NM17AF07FU02037_.mp3
[Failure] I'm afraid I really can't do that. The cards have their value. I can't change it.;NM17AF07FU02038_.mp3
I can't pay that right now. Maybe later.;
[Force Persuade] You don't want to charge me for it.;
[Success] You know what... I don't want to charge you for it. I want new players to take up the game.;NM17AF07FU02040_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;
Ah, I'm sure you do, but I won't have answers. I leave other people to their business, and they leave me to mine.;NM17AF07FU02048_.mp3
Really, you'll have to seek information elsewhere, but if you want some recreation, I've cards ready to play.;NM17AF07FU02050_.mp3
You must have an opinion about what happened on Taris.;
Must I? An opinion would draw attention to myself. The Sith have shown what happens to things that draw their attention.;NM17AF07FU02052_.mp3
Would you like to have another round of Pazaak?;NM17AF07FU02078_.mp3
However, you'll understand if we don't have any wagers. I... respect your ability too much to insult you by betting on you losing.;NM17AF07FU02063_.mp3
All right, let's have a game.;
Very good. Just for the sport of it. That's all I can afford.;NM17AF07FU02065_.mp3
I want to ask you about something else.;
Something else? I don't think I know about much else. Pazaak is all that I do, right now. I'm sorry.;NM17AF07FU02068_.mp3
Ask around, I'm sure there are many better sources of information than me.;NM17AF07FU02070_.mp3
Right. Goodbye.;
Stop by anytime. I'd like to visit my money.;NM17AF07FU02072_.mp3
Ah, you did have two promising wins. Would you care to try and take your money back?;NM17AF07FU02058_.mp3
I don't want to say that your single win was a fluke. Perhaps you would like to play again?;NM17AF07FU02059_.mp3
I don't want to sour you on the game. Perhaps another small wager game?;NM17AF07FU02060_.mp3
Ahh, you are back. I hope I didn't scare you off with that loss. Hard blow, but that's the nature of the cards.;NM17AF07FU02056_.mp3
Ah, it's you again. Truly, you are a fine opponent. I'd be honored to play you again.;NM17AF07FU02061_.mp3
Hello again. Would you like to have another round of Pazaak? I'd like to try and win back my money.;NM17AF07FU02073_.mp3
It's only fair, after all. You have won against me twice, but I still think I can teach you a thing or two.;NM17AF07FU02075_.mp3
I mean, I don't want to say that it was beginner's luck, but you should play again to truly get a feel for the game.;NM17AF07FU02076_.mp3
Hello again. Could I tempt you into a game? There's very little else to do that won't potentially leave you dead.;NM17AF07FU02077_.mp3
Are you here to mock me as the Sith, or do you actually want to buy something?;
I'm not here to make fun of you. I'm <FullName>.;
Please, forgive me. I had no cause to be so rude to you. The Sith make such trouble for me and business has been slow.;
But that is no excuse for my tone. I apologize. Please, let us start off on the right foot.;
Welcome to the used goods store of Yortal Ixlis. If there is anything I can help you with, all you need to do is ask.;
I'd like to look at your inventory.;
Of course, human. My stock is all second hand, and some of it has minor damage.;
But with the repairs I have done to them, my items are as good as new - for a fraction of the price.;
I'd like to ask you some questions.;
I fear I will be of little help in providing information, human. I spend most of my time here in my shop or out collecting inventory.;
And at night, I am too exhausted to do anything but return home and sleep in preparation for the next day.;
I will do my best to answer your questions, but I cannot promise to be of much help.;
Do you know why the Republic is hiring mercenaries?;
I cannot say. Perhaps the Republic is preparing for a battle with the Sith. They are at war, after all.;
And I wish the Republic a quick and total victory. My own life will be much easier once the Sith have been defeated and destroyed.;
I have some more questions for you.;
I think I'll be going now.;
As you wish, human. Should you ever find yourself in need of quality used merchandise I urge you to return to my establishment.;
Are the Sith involved in the recent disappearance of the Selkath youth?;
I have no proof that they are, yet it would not surprise me. The Sith are evil to the core.;
My own experiences with the Sith have been most unpleasant. They come and mock me, and damage my goods. But I cannot take action against them, or they would surely kill me.;
I'm investigating the Sunry case.;
I know nothing of this trial, though I find the facts hard to accept. Sunry was a famous hero of the Republic - hardly the type to commit murder.;
I would not be surprised to learn the Sith have framed the poor man in an effort to embarrass the Republic. The Sith have no conscience in such matters.;
I'm looking for some ancient ruins, or possibly some type of Star Map.;
I know of no such thing in Ahto City. This is the only city on Manaan suited to non-Selkath. The oceans are the ancestral home of their people. If there are any ancient ruins of their culture, they would lie there.;
How did you come to run a junkpile... er... used goods shop?;
Ah. Yes. That. Well, I was not always in such dire straits. In fact, once I would have been quite well off, but the Sith had other plans.;
Well, technically my debt is to the Czerka Corporation, but that amounts to the same thing in the end.;
You owe them money?;
Yes, my debt to them is quite large I fear, and it will be no easy task to repay it.;
I need money to pay them off, but I cannot find work anywhere the Czerka Corporation has influence. So they put me here, fixing scraps and selling them for little profit.;
In time, in years I may be able to repay my debt, but for now I must work. Is there anything else I may help you with?;
How did you get in debt?;
I was quite a hand at electrical and mechanical devices of all sorts. I traveled the galaxy working for hire among all sorts of beings. But one day I failed in a task for a Czerka Corporation executive and was forced into debt.;
What does that have to do with running a junk shop?;
I'm interested in buying something.;
Maybe I'll come back when you're in a better mood.;
With an attitude like that, it's no wonder you have no customers!;
I suppose I deserve that. But you'd be bitter too, if the Sith kept coming in and making fun of you and your inventory!;
Let us forget this unpleasantness and start our meeting over, yes?;
Watch your tone, or you'll be looking for some replacement limbs!;
Welcome, human. While I am not one to condone violence, I find it extremely pleasing that someone has finally stood up to the Sith and dealt with them in their own Embassy!;
I doubt they will be driven from the planet, but any harm they suffer brings me joy. So, what can I do for you on this joyous day, human?;
Come in human, please. The Selkath have been very sensitive lately. I believe something has happened between them and the Republic, but I am not certain.;
Certainly, though, with the new tension, business has dropped off a bit. Please, what can I do for you today?;
Welcome, human. Please come in. Today is a good day for me. I have heard the Sith will face severe penalties for their plot to corrupt the Selkath youth.;
I doubt they will be banned from the planet, but any penalty they suffer brings me joy. So, what can I do for you on this joyous day, human?;
Welcome, come in. I have heard you are a swoop racer, and swoop racers always have money to spend. My favorite customers.;
Whatever you desire, you will find it here at Yortal's secondhand shop. So what can I do for you, friend?;
The Sith and their Czerka Corp. dogs have been driven off Kashyyyk I was told. Good riddance I say! If only we could do that here...;
Is there anything you need help with?;
The Sith fight amongst themselves constantly, even their masters. I heard that happened on Korriban, but none of the Sith are talking about it.;
Come in human, please. I need all the customers I can get. Since kolto production dropped the Ahto City authorities have increased my business taxes tenfold to make up the shortfall!;
I am loathe to leave this planet, but I fear I cannot long afford to continue business under these circumstances. What is it you need, human?;
You there! How is it that you are leaving Naga Sadow's tomb by yourself? You went for your final test, didn't you? Where is Master Uthar?;NM36AAENDS08000_.mp3
Master Uthar is dead. I killed him.;
What? You... but you aren't even a Sith, yet! Surely you jest!;NM36AAENDS08002_.mp3
I'm not a Sith at all, actually. Now move aside.;
It... it's a spy! Quick, to arms!;NM36AAENDS08008_.mp3
But... if the spy was able to kill Master Uthar...;NM36AAENDS08009_.mp3
Don't be such a coward! Kill the traitor! Do it now!!;NM36AAENDS08010_.mp3
I can kill you just as easily, fool.;
You lie!;NM36AAENDS08004_.mp3
But... what if Master Uthar is really dead? How can we hope to stand up against someone who could kill him?;NM36AAENDS08005_.mp3
Don't be a sniveling coward! I will prove this one a spy... and if Uthar is dead, *I* shall become the new master!!;NM36AAENDS08006_.mp3
Not a Sith? I have killed the master, and now the academy is mine.;
[Persuade] Did I say dead? He's, uh, sick. You should check on him.;
[Failure] You lie!;NM36AAENDS08022_.mp3
Look... I don't need any trouble here, alright?;
Well, you've found it! If you've done anything to Master Uthar, you're going to pay for it!;NM36AAENDS08024_.mp3
Just stand aside and you won't get hurt. Got it?;
Alright, you caught me. Time to die.;
[Persuade] I am Revan. I have killed the master. You must bow down before me.;
[Failure] You lie! You could never have killed the master!!;NM36AAENDS08014_.mp3
I am not lying, fool. Do you wish me to show you?;
You are not Revan! Quick, attack the traitor!!;NM36AAENDS08016_.mp3
But... even if it's not Revan... what if Master Uthar is actually dead? Someone who could kill the master...;NM36AAENDS08017_.mp3
If Master Uthar is dead, then he was a weak fool! Now attack! *I* shall be the new Dark Lord of Korriban!!;NM36AAENDS08018_.mp3
This is your last chance. Bow down or die.;
You doubt the Dark Lord Revan? Ha ha! Most amusing.;
[Persuade] I don't know what you're talking about.;
You have helped us at last! Finally we shall be able to reclaim our past!;
You promised to help us last time, Revan. I hope that you live up to your word.;
The work of our people must go on... to preserve our future.;
The Council thinks you may help us... I hope that they are right.;
The keeper of our history can help you if there is anything you wish to know.;
I wish that we could fully trust you after your long absence, Revan... but I do not know if we can.;
We are not shipping kolto right now, human, and escpecially not to you! You will leave here now, or I will be forced to call Security.;
Your actions have threatened our world and our way of life. You are not welcome in this place, human, no matter what you have arranged with our leaders.;
You have endangered the Sith Embassy, and I shall not let you endanger our shipping as well! Leave here now, or I will be forced to call Security.;
I cannot sell you kolto unless you show me your purchase permit.;
I just want some information.;
I am not here to answer your questions, off-worlder. I am a distributor of kolto - the lifeblood of the Manaan economy.;
Either show me your purchase permit, or leave me in peace.;
I don't have a permit.;
Then why are you here, human? Are you seeking employment? We do not hire your kind here.;
Do you even have an off-worlder work permit? I thought not. I suggest you visit the courthouse in the district to the west, off-worlder. There is nothing for you here.;
Where can I get a purchase permit?;
One does not simply 'get' a purchase permit! Such permits are brokered between intergalactic governments and the Ahto City Export Authority.;
We do not sell unrefined kolto by the handful - we sell it by the ton! Go to a store if you wish to purchase kolto for personal use.;
I'll be going now.;
Good - I am far too busy to converse with the likes of you.;
Do you even have an off-worlder work permit? I thought not. There is nothing for you here.;
You're only as good as your last race. Remember that.;NM26ABSWOO19007_.mp3
I was cheering for you. I hope I didn't jinx your race.;NM26ABSWOO19006_.mp3
Your last race was a disappointment. Lose many more and the crowd will turn on you.;NM26ABSWOO19005_.mp3
You'll have to do better than that if you want to be sector champion.;NM26ABSWOO19004_.mp3
It's amazing what's been happeing on the track! Queedle has taken the top spot!;NM26ABSWOO19024_.mp3
I always cheered Queedle before, and I guess it helped! He's beaten everyone!;NM26ABSWOO19025_.mp3
Queedle has really improved out there. He was always my favorite.;NM26ABSWOO19026_.mp3
Everyone thought Queedle couldn't compete because he was just a local racer, but he's shown them all.;NM26ABSWOO19027_.mp3
I was down here last week and I got Casandra Mateil's autoprint. She doesn't do that very often.;NM26ABSWOO19000_.mp3
You'll have to get in line for the good seats when the races start. There's a lot of people that want to see them.;NM26ABSWOO19001_.mp3
Sure the swoop circuit is suffering a bit with Taris gone, but we still have some good racers to watch.;NM26ABSWOO19002_.mp3
Have you been to the swoop races before? Some of these riders are sure full of themselves.;NM26ABSWOO19003_.mp3
I sure hope you're staying here. Beating the first round has made you look pretty good to the crowd.;NM26ABSWOO19008_.mp3
You're not bad for a beginner. It's almost like you've competed at this level before.;NM26ABSWOO19009_.mp3
You won't have such an easy run in the second round. We get some experienced riders through here.;NM26ABSWOO19010_.mp3
Not bad at all, but I'll start cheering when you prove you're not just using beginner's luck.;NM26ABSWOO19011_.mp3
Some of the crowd may turn on you. You're not the underdog anymore.;NM26ABSWOO19012_.mp3
You're surprising a lot of people. Me included. Nice job out there.;NM26ABSWOO19013_.mp3
If you win again, I'll be absolutely amazed. You are moving up so fast.;NM26ABSWOO19014_.mp3
Nice race. How do you go so fast? Are you sure your swoop is legal?;NM26ABSWOO19015_.mp3
Well, you've captured the sector championship. I have to say I've never seen such an... impressive racer.;NM26ABSWOO19016_.mp3
I didn't think you had it in you, but I guess I was wrong. You've really won me over, champion.;NM26ABSWOO19017_.mp3
You handled that race like a pro. I like confident men.;NM26ABSWOO19018_.mp3
Racers like you are why I watch the sport. You dominated the whole field. It was... exhilarating.;NM26ABSWOO19019_.mp3
Ha. I've never seen anyone who rides like you. This has been a great tournament.;NM26ABSWOO19020_.mp3
You're deadly serious out on the course. Like Hukta Jax, but with talent. You deserve to be champion.;NM26ABSWOO19021_.mp3
Your win was a complete surprise to everyone. I'm sure the crowd thought you would burn out, but you showed them.;NM26ABSWOO19022_.mp3
The crowd really started pulling for you in that last race. Everyone loves a winner, I guess.;NM26ABSWOO19023_.mp3
I do my job and keep my mouth shut. Maybe I can do some good if I stay out of people's way.;NM22AAXCZE12000_.mp3
There is so much to learn about this planet, but they keep us cooped up in here.;NM22AAXCZE12001_.mp3
The payoff from research is too much of a risk for Czerka to spend much money on it. Slaves are proven commodities.;NM22AAXCZE12002_.mp3
I think Czerka is missing an opportunity here. The forest could teach us so much.;NM22AAXCZE12003_.mp3
Local fauna is amazing. If I could isolate why the trees grow so big, it would be worth more than a thousand Wookiee slaves.;NM22AAXCZE12004_.mp3
Our work here could be very important if any effort was put into it.;NM22AAXCZE12005_.mp3
I've got enough trouble without dealing with you. Leave me alone.;
What do you want? You here for money? I'll pay the Hutt what I owe as soon as the circuit is back on its feet.;
Wait, I know you. You slaughtered my second tier time out on the track. It's like you're trying to steal from me.;
I've a few things I wanted to ask. Spare a moment?;
I've got nothing but time now that you've pushed me back to the slow times. Make it quick.;
I want to ask about you and racing.;
There's not much useful you'll get out of me. Yuka Rill is on the way down. I can't match the young riders.;
Is this the best place for racing?;
I'd better hope so. It's the last stop for me. If I can't get some decent times going, I may as well not leave.;
I wish I could use the destruction of Taris as an excuse, but I doubt I would have ever made it back there.;
Why have racers come here?;
Old guys like me can't make it on the good tracks, and the new racers come here to try and knock us down even further.;
I'm still trying to have one last good run... but it just isn't happening.;
How long have you been at this?;
Too many years. I've raced on almost every track and all I've got to show for it is an aging bike.;
No good memories? That seems a waste.;
I've got a few trophies stashed, but they don't pay the bills. Yep, I should have quit after the Coruscant Classic.;
What can you tell me about the other racers?;
Bunch of babies, all of them. Well, except for Zoriis. She's got the goods like I never had. Good for her, I guess.;
If I have to say something good about the new racers, it would be about that Nico kid. He's got a future.;
What makes you say that?;
He doesn't fear the track. You get old, you start to worry about failing. He just lets it all come to him.;
What do you think about that?;
Some promoter will use him up, and he'll end up in debt like me. It's already happening, I bet.;
Let's go back to my first questions.;
I suppose. Make it quick.;
I'm looking for something. Who knows this planet best?;
I don't know. Go ask some locals. I want to know as little about this dustbowl as possible.;
I have to leave. Goodbye.;
Yeah, good riddance.;
Maybe you were right. Maybe I want money.;
You don't look like anyone I owe. Stop fooling with me.;
[Force Persuade] Your only purpose is to amuse me. Get out.;
[His head tails twitch nervously. You are obviously not the type of person he wants to risk angering. Still, he tries to seem strong as he leaves.];
I'm not waiting for you to lose your temper around me. It's not worth it.;
[Persuade/Lie] There's a bounty on you, and I mean to collect it.;
[Success] I should have known those loans would catch up to me. Never get your bike fixed in Hutt Space.;
Here, this is everything I have. Now just leave me to figure out how I'm going to pay for track time.;
[Failure] What do you take me for, an idiot? I'm not handing money to just anyone.;
Show some respect! I could kill you where you stand!;
Wait, I don't want a fight. All right, if you want some money, I'll give it to you. I don't need you in my face like this.;
Never mind. I didn't mean anything by it.;
Go on, I've seen your type before. Go push the kids around. They don't put up much of a fight.;
[Force Persuade] You know you need to pay me.;
[Success] I know I need to pay you. It's obvious my old loans have caught up to me. I knew it would happen.;
*whisper* I'm amazed at how many people that works on. The entire galaxy must be filled with weak-minded fools.;NGLOBECAND03474_.mp3
*whisper* The Force should not be used for profit and personal gain. As Jedi we should be above such things.;NGLOBEBAST06896_.mp3
A Jedi should not use the Force for personal gain. We are better than that.;NGLOBEJUHA11851_.mp3
I'm no Jedi, but are you really supposed to be using the Force for things like this?;NGLOBECART04932_.mp3
And that Nico is going places, thanks to you. Wish I had someone like you at my back years ago.;
But what do you care about this? I heard how you roped Nico into his new deal. He'll be just like me real soon.;
You've heard all I have. If I had more, I'd use it to win, not tell you.;
If I say no you'll probably hound me to death. Fine, what do you want?;
Why can't you new racers just go learn the track for yourselves? Why would I want to help you beat my times?;
Just answer my questions and I'll leave you alone.;
I can hope, anyway. Just get it over with.;
Wait, no, I recognize you. You're some new racer. Get lost. I don't need more of you on my tail.;
No, wait, you don't look like a collector. You're just some kid. Go on, I don't have time for you.;
You new racers only want two things from old pros: money and advice. My advice? Leave me alone.;
Oh, it's you. You buried my best time on the track. What, are you *trying* to take money out of my pocket?;
You again? Come to rub my face in your times? You are practically stealing my paycheck every race you run.;
You again? Why don't you go bother someone else. It's not like I owe you money or something.;
Greetings, fellow Sith. We may fight alongside one another one day.;
If what you say about the Sith is true, prove it! Until then we have no evidence of the crimes you accuse them of!;
No offence, but I could have done better than you on that last race. As a true fan, I know how to do these things right.;
You didn't look too good out there on that last run. I guess everyone has their bad days.;
You sure you're cut out for this league of racing? Maybe the stress of it is getting to you.;
I don't believe it! Who'd have thought Queedle had it in him?;
A new Champion! And it's Queedle! I knew he could do it with a decent swoop under him.;
How about that? Queedle, a local racer, showing those pros how it's done!;
I cheer for Queedle now that he's winning. It would take an amazing racer to win me away.;
You here to cheer Casandra? She's a fine racer. I hope she knocks Hukta out of the running.;
Hukta Jax is insane. He just smashes through everything to the finish. I guess we should expect that from a Gamorrean?;
We need more rules about overpowered bikes. Hukta just rides over everything. It's boring watching him.;
Queedle is the local favorite. You should cheer along with us. He needs the encouragement.;
You're pretty good. Maybe I should start putting some credits on your races.;
I guess you've got what it takes to advance. The odds against you winning are getting better.;
The second round always has experienced riders. You'll be up against some tough times.;
You're up against the second round times now. That's a hard round to beat.;
Some of the racers are having a bad time here on Manaan. Seems like you have all the luck right now.;
Some of the other fans didn't think you could reach the second round, but I knew you would all along.;
Are you sure you're up to challenging the third round time? I mean, you're good, but are you that good?;
I'm putting all my credits on you. You're a sure thing.;
Whew, that was an exciting time you turned in. Noboby else had a chance.;
Good race, Sector Champion. I guess you'll be off to the big tracks, once the circuit is back up.;
Wow, I bet you could have won on Taris with times like that. It's a shame we'll never know.;
Could I get an autoprint? You've just had the quickest rise to Sector Champion that I've ever seen.;
It's amazing what you've accomplished here, and you've done it with such style. I've never met a woman like you.;
Who dares to break my meditation? You will pay for interrupting my... wait. I sense the Force is strong with you. Very strong.;NM09AADARK01000_.mp3
Who would have thought a Force Adept could be found on this insignificant planet? But your talent is no match for a disciple of the dark side!;NM09AADARK01002_.mp3
Turn away from the dark side. It won't lead you to anything but destruction.;
Spoken like a true drone of the Jedi Council. We Sith, however, have learned to embrace the potential of the dark side. It is what gives us strength!;NM09AADARK01004_.mp3
This meeting is a stroke of luck for me - my master will surely reward me with my lightsaber once I kill you!;NM09AADARK01006_.mp3
You Sith must be brought to judgment for all the blood you have spilled.;
You are a fool - this is a new age! The Sith shall be the ones passing judgment now! We are the new order of the galaxy!;NM09AADARK01009_.mp3
I'm going to enjoy gutting you!;
Ah, yes... feed the hatred and anger within yourself! Call upon the power of the dark side! But not even that can save you now.;NM09AADARK01012_.mp3
Hello, outsider. I heard of your arrival. I trust you won't cause trouble in our village? We don't want bloodshed.;
Do you know who owns this bolt casing?;
Hmm... let's see if the family insignia is there. Yes, there it is. This belongs to Jaarak. Er... how did you get it?;
I found Jaarak's bolt casing on Rorworr's corpse.;
Oh my... that is... very distressing. It definitely seems to suggest that Jaarak helped in Rorworr's death.;
I... I can't ignore this. Wait here, outsider. I must address this. I will have Jaarak brought here...;
And I hope he can explain this... I really do.;
Jaarak... you know why you have been summoned here. As Holder of the Laws, I ask you to explain.;
I won't answer. I can't. Worrroznor, must Woorwill be here?;
Woorwill has a bond with Rorworr. He is the closest to family that can be found. He is entitled to be here.;
Jaarak, please speak. If you are guilty, it means death. This outsider will be given your possessions. Do you want that?;
Wait. If he's executed, I get paid?;
That's the law. You discovered the crime, and therefore were also affected by it. You are also a victim.;
It's painful to know that another Wookiee could do wrong, so the accuser is repaid, as is the victim's family.;
This will be the first time an outsider has received such reparation. I hope it is the last.;
Jaarak, won't you say anything in your own defense?;
I killed Rorworr. I will accept whatever punishment is given. It's better if only my honor is tainted.;
You did do it? Why? Rorworr was good and honorable! Why did you kill him?;
You only need to know that I did it. The reason is unimportant. Woorwill... I'm sorry.;
Jaarak, I won't let you do this. Rorworr was dealing with slavers.;
What? What are you talking about? Liar!;
Please... don't tell them anything. Rorworr was admired... they need to believe in him.;
I'm old. I'm not important. Let Woorwill and the others have their hero.;
If that is what you want.;
I do. I will take his shame with me. The Rorworr in their memory is a far better one than the Rorworr I killed.;
Then let Jaarak die. He murdered Rorworr. It's fact.;
And so he shall. Jaarak, you will be taken from us and cast into shadow. Your hunt ends.;
I don't like this decision, but I respect why Jaarak wishes it. He sacrifices to save the innocence of another.;
And though we abandon you, may Bacca lead you through your shame.;
Hello again, outsider. I... wish you had not seen us at our worst. A murder with no reason... it's unsettling.;
Is there a reward for my service?;
Yes, yes there is. You are to recieve the credit equivalent of one third of Jaarak's possessions.;
Woorwill gets the rest. He is the closest to family that Rorworr had left. The others were lost to slavers.;
Here, take it. I thank you for your help. Now please, just go.;
Is there anything going on?;
A few details to work out following Jaarak's death, but nothing that need concern you.;
Goodbye then.;
Goodbye, outsider. Goodbye.;
Well, I must say that you are the first outsider that I have been glad to know. You have surprised me.;
Perhaps some of you are capable of honor after all. You are deserving of your reward.;
My reward? What reward?;
Did I not explain? As the person that discovered the crime, you were also affected by it.;
You would've been given a portion of Jaarak's possessions, but he was innocent. Rorworr, however, was not.;
Rorworr was wealthy. His family was taken by slavers, leaving him everything. You get one third of this.;
Woorwill receives the rest, if he wishes. He is still upset, but he is young. He will recover.;
Can I ask you if anything is happening now?;
Nothing that you can help with. Rorworr's crime is causing a bit of a stir, but it will pass in time.;
Some of us will be disappointed in him, but we have other enemies to worry about.;
Goodbye to you.;
Goodbye. Bacca guide you.;
There was pain no matter how this ended. Perhaps this is for the best.;NM23ACWORR01034_.mp3
Big Z says honor was everything to his people. I... guess he's right.;NM23ACWORR01036_.mp3
This isn't justice, it doesn't seem right! But... what else could we do?;NM23ACWORR01038_.mp3
At least he's going to die like a warrior.;NM23ACWORR01040_.mp3
No, I won't let this happen.;
Explain yourself, outsider. If you have information that will affect this trial, I must know it.;
Don't listen to these outsider lies... please. Woorwill, don't listen.;
Rorworr dealt with slavers. The datapad I found on his corpse proves it.;
But... no. No! That's not... that can't be. Jaarak? It can't be...;
I'm sorry, Woorwill. I didn't want you to know. So much is against us... you need someone to look up to.;
"I couldn't let him betray you... betray everyone. Outsiders are enough of a threat by themselves; we don't need traitors of our own.";
See how this Wookiee truly understands honor? Do you see how important we consider these things, <FirstName>?;
Well... as Holder of the Laws, I declare Jaarak innocent. I... will see to your release.;
A painful end, but perhaps it is the right thing to do. We shall see.;NM23ACWORR01054_.mp3
How awful. Big Z always said how important honor was to his people. It's everything.;NM23ACWORR01056_.mp3
How sad. It feels like the right thing to do, but... to destroy a hero...;NM23ACWORR01058_.mp3
Kill him then. Jaarak must *pay* for his crime.;
Kill him. I found nothing to justify the murder.;
Nothing? There was no reason? You just killed him? Why! There has to be a reason why!;
I'm sorry, Woorwill... I can't give a reason. It was between me and Rorworr, and neither of us will talk.;
No, Jaarak should live. Rorwill dealt with the slavers.;
Wait. Go back to the part where I get paid if he's guilty.;
Yeah, let's keep the focus on what's important. If there's profit to be made here, we don't want to miss out.;NM23ACWORR01140_.mp3
You mustn't let greed rule your decision here. Justice must be served.;NM23ACWORR01141_.mp3
Greed will lead you down the dark side if you are not careful. You must not seek material gain at the expense of the ideals the Jedi hold dear.;NM23ACWORR01142_.mp3
Is there no alternative to death as punishment?;
If there were circumstances that led to the attack, perhaps we could consider another punishment. It all depends on what was behind it.;
My life debt won't let me speak for you, <FirstName>, but you know Jaraak had justification. Will you tell them?;
This is a failure of honor. It is very serious. Were there any mitigating factors we need to be aware of?;
I urge you caution. This may seem like the right path to follow... but you do not know these people as I do.;NM23ACWORR01076_.mp3
Good thinking. Jaarak doesn't strike me as the type to murder for no reason.;NM23ACWORR01078_.mp3
Tell me something. What's the penalty for murder?;
That would depend on the circumstances. We rarely have such crimes here. Wookiee honor does not allow it.;
When we have had a murder, the punishment was usually death. There is rarely any justification that would dictate otherwise.;
Can I ask you some questions?;
I'm sorry. Like most of the village, I've been preoccupied by these troubled times. I don't really want to speak with you.;
Well, not unless you can tell me where young Rorworr is. Do you keep track of slaves taken?;
I am no slaver.;
I have no way of knowing one way or another. You'll excuse me if I don't take you at your word.;
When did Rorworr go missing?;
It could be ten days or more. He was planning a hunt, and nobody seems to know when he was leaving.;
He is now overdue. I don't know where to start. It is strange...;
Why do you think it is strange?;
I don't believe he was taken by slavers. Their slave transports haven't been seen around here.;
If it wasn't slavers, perhaps he fell in the Shadowlands... but he knew them well.;
I would search for him, but I don't know where to start. My days of hunting the lower forest are behind me.;
I could look for him.;
You could. I've never had an offer of help from an outsider. I'll reserve my judgment for when I see results.;
Would there be a reward for finding him?;
That would need to be determined. Wookiee justice rewards honor and honesty. You outsiders are a little lacking...;
I'll be going now.;
Farewell then. Bacca keep you well.;
Greetings again, outsider. Please, if you have business here, make it brief.;
Since you have been designated Arbiter in the Sunry case, I shall answer questions that you might have.;
What do you think of Sunry?;
Sunry is a former Republic officer who is highly regarded by your people. He is admired by your people here on Manaan, and even seems to maintain some sort of relations with them still.;
If he is as capable as some of the Republic citizens still believe him to be, he is certainly capable of actions that would result in this murder.;
Is there anything else you wish to ask in relation to this case?;
Is there anything suspicious about this case?;
Well I have often wondered, if Sunry were so innocent, why was he seen fleeing the scene of the crime?;
Why would he have been running if he had not committed the crime himself, or was at least aware of what had occurred?;
This case seems fairly simple and obvious to me. You Republic types stick together, however, and I assume you will go to lengths to defend him.;
The Republic believes in justice, as do you. We just want Sunry to be fairly treated, that's all.;NM26AASELJ18014_.mp3
What else do you want to ask?;
What do you think of the Republic and the Sith Empire?;
Both empires are at fault for this current conflict. The Republic in the past for laying the foundations upon which the Sith Empire grew. And the Sith now, obviously, for starting the war.;
But no matter the wrongs that had been done in the past, the Sith now have no cause for renewing hostilities. It almost seems as if they just want to conquer everything!;
'Almost seems'? They do wish to conquer everything, and will not stop at Manaan. Why the Selkath believe themselves invulnerable I have no idea.;NM26AASELJ18022_.mp3
I believe the Republic has every right to defend itself and drive the Sith back where they came from.;
Unfortunately for them... and perhaps for us... they do not seem to be doing too good a job of it.;
Was there anything else you want to know?;
I have no more questions for now.;
Return if you have pertinent details about the case to discuss.;
Only those on legitimate business should consult the judges personally.;
Since your case is done, you should refrain from abusing your past familiarity.;
For additional inquiries, Judge Shelkar is available for consultation.;
[Though you can't seem to understand him, the Sand People chieftain's tone is obvious. He clearly despises all outsiders.];
Translation: I can translate with some guarantee of accuracy that he is demanding to know why he should let us survive this encounter, master.;NM20AA09CH02001_.mp3
Tell him we want a peaceful solution.;
Translation: [Unintelligible];
Translation: He claims he has no reason to believe you, master. Your kind have tainted this land with machines and uncaring ignorant feet.;NM20AA09CH02004_.mp3
Translation: He requires proof of good faith. We must make a contribution to his people that shows we are not a threat. Shall I blast him now, master?;NM20AA09CH02005_.mp3
Offer him 100 credits to stop the attacks.;
Ask what it is that he wants.;
Tell him that I have questions first.;
See if he's holding the Jawas Iziz was looking for.;
This has gone far enough. Attack him.;
Agreement: That is probably the most efficient course of action. This will be enjoyable.;NM20AA09CH02029_.mp3
Tell him to surrender or face death.;
Protocol: While I enjoy the prospect, master, are you certain that is wise? He will not react favorably.;NM20AA09CH02031_.mp3
Fine, ask if he's open to a peaceful solution.;
You have my orders. Do as I say!;
Why are you able to speak with the Sand People when I can't?;
Extrapolation: I understand that you are Force Sensitive, master, but I lack sufficient knowledge to make an accurate assumption.;NM20AA09CH02038_.mp3
Hypothesis: Perhaps your ability does not take the place of actual language study when the subject is out of the ordinary.;NM20AA09CH02039_.mp3
Or perhaps the Sand People confuse your ability because they actively refuse to communicate with most outsiders. I have no data on this, sadly.;NM20AA09CH02040_.mp3
[His words are lost on you. Without HK-47 translating you have no hope of settling this situation peacefully. Sand People close around you.];
[The Sand People Chieftain seems grateful to you, or at least less inclined to smash your head open like a pocky grub seed.];
Query: What do you wish to ask of him, master?;NM20AA09CH02043_.mp3
Ask about the Star Map.;
Ask about captives.;
Clarification: We must be more specific, master. They capture many organics.;NM20AA09CH02059_.mp3
Ask about setting the captive Jawas free.;
Ask if he knows about the Jawas Iziz told us about.;
Ask about getting Griff set free.;
Ask if he knows about Mission's brother Griff.;
Let's go back to my other questions.;
Protocol: We should not keep him long. It is an insult to take too much of his time. Unless the plan is to blast him when you are done, of course.;NM20AA09CH02071_.mp3
I want information on Sand People culture.;
Protocol: This will be a very sensitive topic, master. You will want to be careful with your questions or risk offending him. Not that that is much of a worry.;NM20AA09CH02073_.mp3
Tell me the history of your clan.;
Why are they so hostile to outsiders?;
Tell him farewell for now.;
I've no further use for him. Kill him.;
Agreement: My thoughts exactly, master. One dead organic meatbag, coming up.;NM20AA09CH02056_.mp3
[You can't understand him without HK-47 present, and you can tell that speaking to him in outsider tongue would be a grave insult.];
I have questions for you, Chieftain.;
[Leave quietly];
[The Sand People Chieftain ignores you.];
[If you can read anything of the Sand People chieftain's emotions, it seems that he is surprised that you have returned.];
Translation: He did not expect us to return, master. He wonders if we have brought the moisture vaporators.;NM20AA09CH02139_.mp3
Tell him that we have his vaporators.;
Tell him the deal is off unless the attacks stop.;
You have interrupted our hunt, interloper. The inhabitants of this world could do little against us, but you appear to be a threat.;NM25AAMAND04000_.mp3
Your butchery will stop here!!;
Has something happened to put fire in your people? Are you no longer slaves? It doesn't matter. You will die like the others!;NM25AAMAND04004_.mp3
You are nothing! Your people are sheep! I fear no slave! Especially willing ones!;NM25AAMAND04006_.mp3
More than a threat enough for you!;NM25AAMAND04008_.mp3
Another Mandalore, is it? Will you draw arms against those you would serve? We'll see who lives this day!;NM25AAMAND04010_.mp3
Our training here will continue... without your interference.;NM25AAMAND04012_.mp3
[This musician is too busy playing to pay any attention to you.];
What are you doing back here? You finally find the guts to meet me in a death match?;NM02AEBEND03000_.mp3
I'm here to collect the bounty on your head, Bendak!;
So you're the one doing Zax's dirty work. Well I've got some bad news for you, little bounty hunter. There's no way you're bringing me in.;NM02AEBEND03011_.mp3
This cantina is wired with a top level security grid. You pull a weapon on me and the auto-fire turrets will fry you before you can even pull the trigger.;NM02AEBEND03013_.mp3
So you'll just hide in here like a coward?;
Why would I ever want to leave here? I've got food and drinks, a place to stay - and everybody treats me with the respect I've earned for my dueling career.;NM02AEBEND03015_.mp3
"But if you're set on collecting that bounty I'll make you a deal. I kind of miss the fight game; my hand is itching for the feel of a blaster in my grip.";NM02AEBEND03017_.mp3
I've seen you in the duel ring. You're just good enough to spark my interest, so I'll agree to face you in a death match. You win, you get to collect that bounty for killing me.;NM02AEBEND03019_.mp3
Forget it - I'm not interested in a death match.;
Hmmm... never figured you for a coward. You ever get the guts to fight me come on back and we can set the match up. Otherwise we've got nothing to talk about.;NM02AEBEND03021_.mp3
You're on, Bendak! Name the time and place!;
"Finally - fresh meat! Ajuur will set it all up; go talk to him. It will take some time to arrange, so no point sticking around here until then. I'll be back when it's time for you to die!";NM02AEBEND03024_.mp3
If you can prove yourself in the ring by beating all these other so-called duelists, I'll agree to face you in a death match. You win, you get to collect that bounty for killing me.;NM02AEBEND03026_.mp3
I'll be back as soon as I beat all these other duelists.;
Good luck with that, kid... you're going to need it. HA-HA-HA!;NM02AEBEND03031_.mp3
You sure you want to get involved in this? Seems a bit pointless to me. Up to you.;NM02AEBEND03033_.mp3
You have to leave sometime, Bendak!;
I'll be going now.;
Off with you then. I'm done with this conversation anyway.;NM02AEBEND03049_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;
Since I'm not going to answer them, you'd just be wasting your breath. So move along before people see us talking and think I'm signing autoprints today. I don't want to be mobbed.;NM02AEBEND03047_.mp3
Autoprints? What are you talking about?;
People are always bugging me for my autoprint. Comes with the territory. You survive over 100 death matches and people tend to see you as something of a legend.;NM02AEBEND03037_.mp3
You don't look so tough. Maybe you'll take me on.;
I'm retired now. Once death matches became illegal I just got bored with the game. I've got no interest in using stun blasters! There was nobody left to challenge me, anyway.;NM02AEBEND03041_.mp3
But I saw you in the ring against Twitch. You've got enough talent to make me consider coming out of retirement for one last death match - unless you're afraid to face me.;NM02AEBEND03043_.mp3
I've been watching these new kids in the ring, but I haven't found anyone worth my notice so far. Still, if someone could beat all these other pretenders I might give them a shot.;NM02AEBEND03044_.mp3
I've seen you in the dueling ring, but you haven't impressed me. Now, if you could beat all these other pretenders... that might get my attention.;NM02AEBEND03045_.mp3
What, you don't recognize me? I'm Bendak Starkiller, the most famous blaster-slinger on Taris. Over 100 duels without a loss - every one of them a death match!;NM02AEBEND03038_.mp3
How come you don't hang around with the other duelists?;
I've been watching you in the dueling ring. Not bad for an amateur. I'm tempted to come out of retirement and show you what it's like to do battle against a real champion.;NM02AEBEND03001_.mp3
But I only fight in death matches, and not too many people are willing to step into the ring knowing they won't ever come out. How 'bout you, Stranger? You think you got what it takes?;NM02AEBEND03003_.mp3
Back again? You're starting to bore me. I don't come here to talk - I come to watch the duels and see if there's anyone worthy of stepping into the ring with me.;NM02AEBEND03004_.mp3
I'll step into the ring with you Bendak!;
Sorry, I don't waste my time with no-names. You have to prove yourself before you get a shot at me. I'm the real deal, kid - 100 death matches without a loss!;NM02AEBEND03006_.mp3
But if you can knock off all these other pretenders in the duel ring, I might consider coming out of retirement to face you in one last death match.;NM02AEBEND03008_.mp3
Leave me alone... I'm not giving out any autoprints to my fans today.;NM02AEBEND03009_.mp3
Kolto production seems to have dropped off a LOT, recently. The Selkath have been eyeing us funny, too...;NM26ACREPA06000_.mp3
The Sith Embassy has gone silent... and they aren't explaining. I hope it was something bad!;NM26ACREPA06002_.mp3
Good thing Sunry got free! The Sith who tried to pin the murder on him would probably have made him disappear in prison.;NM26ACREPA06004_.mp3
I can't believe those Selkath found Sunry guilty. The Sith must have bribed them or something... So much for neutrality!;NM26ACREPA06006_.mp3
Greetings, Master Jedi. I hope you have a pleasant stay here on Manaan. If you have any questions or needs, please direct them to our envoy Roland Wann at our Embassy.;NM26ACREPA06008_.mp3
You may be a big celebrity and all, but I'm trying to earn a living here!;
Don't bother me while I'm working... I get paid to dance, not to talk.;
With the knowledge of the Red Rakata the One will lead us to dominance over all the other tribes of the world!;
As a reward for slaying our hated enemy you may search our cache for whatever parts you need to repair your ship, Revan.;
The One is studying the secrets of the Red Rakata. In time he will use them to unlock the knowledge trapped within the Temple of the Ancients!;
The One has decreed that you may claim any piece you wish from the treasures we have collected from the ships that fell from the sky, Revan.;
Speak with Chorrawl if you must speak at all. He knows your jagged language best.;
I hear you managed to return Juhani to the Order. Congratulations.;NM14AANEMO07000_.mp3
I regret not being able to tell you more, but some things you must see with your own eyes.;NM14AANEMO07001_.mp3
Is there something I can help you with?;NM14AANEMO07015_.mp3
I have been given a task by the Council...;
Indeed. What is it you would like from me?;NM14AANEMO07017_.mp3
I want to know about the Jedi Code.;
The Code is a way of life, not a strict set of laws. It would be wise for you to reflect on them, rather than rote memorization.;NM14AANEMO07019_.mp3
But still you must learn.;NM14AANEMO07020_.mp3
"There is no emotion; there is peace. There is no ignorance; there is knowledge. There is no passion; there is serenity. There is no chaos; there is peace. There is no death; there is the Force.";NM14AANEMO07021_.mp3
Live by these precepts and you will not fail, young apprentice.;NM14AANEMO07022_.mp3
Is there something else I can help you with?;NM14AANEMO07023_.mp3
I have a question about Dantooine.;
Very well, what is it you wish to know?;NM14AANEMO07035_.mp3
Where can I find a store?;
Ah, you can find two stores here at the Enclave. Aratech has opened both a general supply store and a droid facility and I think you will find their products quite good.;NM14AANEMO07037_.mp3
The supply store is run by a Twi'lek name Crattis Yurkal. A talkative being with a big chip on his shoulder, but generous despite that.;NM14AANEMO07038_.mp3
The droid repair facility is managed by Karal Kaar. A bit brusque, perhaps, but a good being nonetheless. We have shared many a game of Pazaak in the small hours of the morning.;NM14AANEMO07039_.mp3
I've heard people mention Mandalorians.;
Mandalorian raiders, yes. They have been preying on the settlers in the surrounding farms. Stealing food, money, weapons... Jon was hit really hard recently... He lost his daughter.;NM14AANEMO07042_.mp3
You Republics are too weak. You should protect what you want to keep, otherwise someone stronger will take it.;NM14AANEMO07043_.mp3
Perhaps, perhaps. But not everyone in the galaxy is a warrior like you.;NM14AANEMO07044_.mp3
They were not a problem before... But now it would seem prudent to be rid of them. If you could accomplish this, it would not harm your training and the settlers would greatly appreciate it.;NM14AANEMO07045_.mp3
Jon is currently waiting to petition the Council. He is on the path north of here. He might be able to tell you more about what had happened.;NM14AANEMO07046_.mp3
Can I help with anything else?;NM14AANEMO07047_.mp3
I would like to know about you.;
About me? I am truly flattered. What is it you wish to know?;NM14AANEMO07053_.mp3
Who are you?;
As I have said, I believe, my name is Nemo. I am here by the will of the Jedi Council.;NM14AANEMO07055_.mp3
You are a Jedi?;
Indeed, my young friend, that I am. I have served the Council for many years, and have seen many apprentices pass through this Enclave.;NM14AANEMO07057_.mp3
Are you a member of the Council?;
I think, perhaps, you place an undue importance on rank and hierarchy. Understandable, but regrettable also. We each serve in our place, high or low.;NM14AANEMO07059_.mp3
I want to ask you something else.;
What do you do here?;
I am here by the will of the Jedi Council. I serve the good and, hopefully through that, the people of the Republic.;NM14AANEMO07062_.mp3
I would like to ask you something else.;
What kind of a name is Nemo anyway?;
*chuckle* The importance you put in a name is misleading, young one. You of all people should remember that.;NM14AANEMO07066_.mp3
I must be going now.;
I hope your time is well spent here on Dantooine.;NM14AANEMO07068_.mp3
Master Zhar said there are caves on Dantooine with lightsaber crystals.;
Ah, yes, those caves. Those caves are dangerous for the unwary.;NM14AANEMO07049_.mp3
Kinrath spiders infest the places. They are attracted by the colors and heat given off by the crystals, I think.;NM14AANEMO07050_.mp3
It is a pity... Those caves are strong with the Force.;NM14AANEMO07051_.mp3
What do you know of the tainted grove?;
The Council has told you nothing of the grove?;NM14AANEMO07025_.mp3
No, they have not.;
Then it would not be my place to explain its significance.;NM14AANEMO07027_.mp3
But as the light side can be embodied in living beings, so can the dark.;NM14AANEMO07028_.mp3
The grove can be found to the south and east in the plains. But be wary of kath hounds, they may be agitated by the power in the grove.;NM14AANEMO07029_.mp3
I know it is tainted by the dark side.;
Do not be so quick to judge circumstances about which you are ignorant. Not everything may be as transparent as you would believe.;NM14AANEMO07031_.mp3
Um... never mind.;
Very well.;NM14AANEMO07033_.mp3
Juhani has been slain, I hear. You fought with her in the grove?;NM14AANEMO07002_.mp3
She attacked me.;
It should not have had to go that far... but some things cannot be avoided.;NM14AANEMO07004_.mp3
You would do well to mind Juhani's tragic example and not to let yourself fall into the sway of the dark side.;NM14AANEMO07005_.mp3
She had been turned to the dark side!;
Even in the darkest heart there is hope for rebirth. Anyone can be turned back to the light. Anyone.;NM14AANEMO07007_.mp3
She deserved to die.;
It is good, sometimes, to stop and reflect on the beauty of nature and the Force.;NM14AANEMO07009_.mp3
I am sorry, I tend to get carried away... I do not believe we have met, apprentice. My name is Nemo.;NM14AANEMO07010_.mp3
Greetings, Master Nemo. It is good to see you again.;NM14AANEMO07011_.mp3
And you, dear one, as always. Have you learned to control your temper yet, girl... or does your master still douse you with a bucket of water?;NM14AANEMO07012_.mp3
Ahhh... well, it is --;NM14AANEMO07013_.mp3
As I thought. Don't worry, young one... you shall learn, in time. Have patience.;NM14AANEMO07014_.mp3
How go your studies, my young friend?;NM14AANEMO07069_.mp3
Those Sith are always trying to goad us. Why don't the Selkath stop them?;NM26ACREPS32000_.mp3
What? Why are you bothering me? Can't you see I'm auditioning a dancer? Or at least, I'm trying to audition her. Not much point if she doesn't have a partner.;
What are you talking about?;
Name's Bib Surool, manager for the Starlight Entertainers: the top performing troupe in this sector of the galaxy. I was here scouting new talent when the Sith attacked, and now I can't leave.;
You'd think the Sith would let me go so I could get back to my troupe, but I guess they just don't appreciate the arts. So, since I'm stuck here, I figured I might as well continue with my auditions.;
I'm supposed to be auditioning Lyn, but I think I'm wasting my time. Lyn's got all the moves, but I need to know if she can pull them off while sharing a stage with her partner.;
Where's her partner?;
She doesn't have one. That's the problem. Aren't you listening to me? Dancers don't perform solo, so I need to see if she can work with someone else before I get her up on stage.;
Maybe I could help her out.;
I doubt she just wants to dance with someone who wandered by. This is her one shot at the big time, and dancing with some wanna-be as her partner isn't going to help her cause.;
On the other hand, I'm not going to hire her unless I can see her in action with a partner. Maybe she's desperate enough to give you a chance. You'd have to ask her, I guess.;
I'll be going now.;
Okay, great. Bye-bye. Off you go.;
I don't have time for this.;
Who are you?;
I don't like your tone!;
Oh-ho! You think throwing a tantrum is going to impress me? Sorry - I manage two dozen dancers, musicians and other performers. I see more tantrums in one day than most people in a year!;
You again? Shoo! Shoo! Look, I'm trying to work here, so off you go.;
Who are you again?;
Forgotten me already, have you? Well, you're self-centered enough to be a performer. All you're lacking is the talent - like about ninety percent of the people who audition for me.;
Bib Surool, manager of the Starlight Entertainers. Any of this sound familiar? I came here looking for dancers, but all I've found is a Twi'lek who doesn't have a partner.;
I want to dance as Lyn's partner.;
If you want to help Lyn out, go talk to her. Otherwise, leave me alone. It's bad enough she's dancing solo - I can't concentrate on her dancing with you yapping in my ear!;
Back again? Don't you get it? I'm working here. For you, dancing is probably just a fun way to pass the time, but this is serious business for me! So why do you keep bugging me?;
Hey - you're the one who won that swoop race, right? Yeah, I saw the whole thing. And I thought my job was dangerous!;
Zax is starting to get stingy... he hasn't added a new freelance contract to the board in nearly a week!;
I heard Calo Nord is in town. Like there wasn't enough competition in this office already! Now we have the best bounty hunter in the system scooping our contracts!;
Somebody killed Gadon Thek! He didn't even have a bounty on his head - talk about a waste of time!;
Since the Sith got here the average price for each bounty has gone way up! Davik's had to raise his rates just to compete!;
Come on, girlie. Into the cell. Let's go, I haven't got all day to waste on you. I need to get back to my post.;NM40AAMISS08000_.mp3
Quit crowding me! Sheesh, I've met Gamorreans who didn't smell as bad as you Sith.;NM40AAMISS08002_.mp3
You think you're pretty funny, don't you? But you're only making things worse for yourself.;NM40AAMISS08004_.mp3
How come every time you open your mouth to talk the scent of rancor dung comes out?;NM40AAMISS08006_.mp3
Maybe a little time in solitary confinement will teach you the proper respect for the Sith! Now, get into that cell!;NM40AAMISS08008_.mp3
Who designed those Sith uniforms anyway? A blind Rodian with a sick sense of humor?;NM40AAMISS08010_.mp3
That's funny. You should tell that one to the torturer when he comes to deal with you.;NM40AAMISS08012_.mp3
What? You're... you're going to torture me?;NM40AAMISS08014_.mp3
No snappy comeback this time? The thought of torture scares you, hmm? Well, it should! The Sith have ways to inflict pain you can't even imagine.;NM40AAMISS08016_.mp3
"It may be a few hours before your torture begins; we're busy interrogating your friends right now. Hey, I know! You could use this time to think up witty ways to beg for mercy. Ha! Ha!";NM40AAMISS08018_.mp3
Or I could use the keycard I lifted from your pocket to slice into the security panel and get myself out of this cell.;NM40AAMISS08020_.mp3
Piece of cake! I wonder when people will stop underestimating me?;NM40AAMISS08022_.mp3
You there! Civilian! This is a restricted area! What are you doing down here?;NM04AASITH27000_.mp3
Look... I've got all the proper security papers.;
Security papers? Oh... you're one of those trackers the Commander sent down, right? They should have given you an armed escort - it's nasty down here!;NM04AASITH27002_.mp3
We've already lost one patrol... we figure the rakghouls got them. We've had so many encounters with those things we've actually run out of rakghoul serum.;NM04AASITH27004_.mp3
Plus we've had several skirmishes with looters from those Lower City swoop gangs. I'm telling you, we should just stay in the Upper City where we're in control!;NM04AASITH27006_.mp3
You said you lost one patrol already?;
Oh, is that why you're down here? Search and rescue? I didn't think they would send anyone. They were in the southern section of the Undercity when we lost contact.;NM04AASITH27008_.mp3
I would have gone to investigate, but my orders are to search for those crashed escape pods... even if it means leaving another patrol to die.;NM04AASITH27010_.mp3
You just follow your orders and keep looking!;
Hey, I'd never disobey my orders... I'm not a fan of court martials and executions. I was just talking, you know? Nothing anyone has to mention to the Commander.;NM04AASITH27012_.mp3
Come on patrol, let's get back to it. The sooner we get this search done the sooner we can get out of this mutant infested hole. Move out!;NM04AASITH27014_.mp3
Why don't you just give up the search?;
You're annoying me - time to die!;
Look out! It's an ambush!;NM04AASITH27027_.mp3
I should be going now.;
Yeah, sure... the Commander won't be too happy if you come back empty, right? Same thing goes for us.;NM04AASITH27019_.mp3
I don't like your tone!;
You're questioning the Sith? How many people do we have to kill before the rest of you learn some respect?;NM04AASITH27022_.mp3
Well, I guess it's time for another lesson. Patrol... attack!;NM04AASITH27024_.mp3
I'm just here to kill you!;
They're saying someone broke into the military complex! I hear the Sith are thinking about enforcing a city wide curfew to tighten security.;NM02AETAPR32000_.mp3
It's a good thing a few of the Sith come in here to relax when they're off duty. That should keep them from closing this cantina down.;NM02AETAPR32002_.mp3
You aren't from Taris, are you? Do yourself a favor and stay away from the Tarisian ale - it packs more kick than most off-worlders can handle.;NM02AETAPR32004_.mp3
Hey - you're the Mysterious Stranger! I saw you gun down Starkiller in that death match! Guess you proved you don't have to be a man to handle a blaster.;NM02AETAPR32006_.mp3
I know you - you're the one who killed Bendak Starkiller in that death match! Too bad the quarantine has made Tarisian ale so expensive or I'd buy you a drink.;NM02AETAPR32008_.mp3
Have you heard? Bendak Starkiller's coming out of retirement! I almost feel bad for the blaster fodder who's going up against him.;NM02AETAPR32010_.mp3
Nice outfit. I've seen Outcasts in the Undercity who dress better than you.;NM02AETAPR32012_.mp3
You'll be hearing about this, you Czerka puppet! I'm not going to let this drop! You can't just murder a whole village!;
And don't tell me to take my concerns to your corporate kiosk! I know when I'm not wanted!;
What's going on here? Who are you?;
I'm done talking in this office. They aren't interested in listening to me. I doubt they will even acknowledge I was here.;
Typical corporate evasion. That's what happens when they own everything. No accountability. Don't even bother bringing it up.;
Stop your shouting, fool! What's this about?;
Your kind is not welcome here anymore, human! Though we may not speak of it, we know what you have done! Begone!;
The relations between the Republic and my people have been strained recently... I can only wonder if it relates somehow to those mercenaries the Republic hired...;
Human, I wish to speak to you if you have the time.;
Have you news for me, human? Have you discovered why the Republic is hiring mercenaries?;
No, I'm still looking into it.;
Once you have the answers I seek, I will gladly pay you the 500 credits I promised.;
Yes - they're sending them down to a secret base on the Hrakert Rift.;
The Hrakert Rift? It is as I feared - though the Republic is fortunate I was the one assigned to investigate this case. Human, allow me to be blunt with you.;
If I report this violation to my superiors the Republic will be banned from Manaan - but I do not wish to do this.;
I see the Sith for what they truly are: ruthless and evil. The Republic has always respected our independence, but if they fall the Sith will be quick to send an invasion fleet to conquer Manaan.;
But I cannot simply ignore what the Republic has done. The Hrakert Rift is the source of Manaan's kolto, and I fear the science station may damage production of the delicate resource.;
The Hrakert Rift is the source of kolto? Why would the Republic risk so much to send troops there? I don't get it.;NM26AANILK09068_.mp3
You must tell the Republic to stop this madness at once. Make them shut down the facility and recall their people before they do something we all regret.;
They can't. The Republic has recently lost contact with the science facility.;
Of course, I should have realized. Doubtless they were hiring the mercenaries to investigate the situation. But I fear mercenaries alone may not be enough to save their station.;
There are ancient mysteries within the Hrakert Rift that even we Selkath do not comprehend. I fear the Republic has awakened something that was best left undisturbed.;
I am going to investigate the Hrakert Rift.;
As you wish. Perhaps you will find the answers the mercenaries could not. I will keep our conversation secret so that the vile Sith will not gain from the Republic's foolishness.;
I only hope my silence does not lead to disaster for Manaan. Here is the payment I promised you.;
And now I must take my leave, human. My superiors are expecting a full report from me, and there is much I must do to ensure they cannot uncover the Republic's actions.;
It sounds like you know more than you are telling me.;
Had I any information, human, I would share it with you willingly. You have done the right thing, informing me of this... but I must ask something more of you.;
I fear the mercenaries will not find the answers the Republic is looking for - they prefer blasters to brains. But you have shown yourself to be resourceful.;
Perhaps you can succeed where the others have failed. Investigate this facility, human - and I promise to keep my silence so that the vile Sith do not gain from the Republic's foolishness.;
What do you suggest we do?;
They couldn't. They had lost contact with the science facility.;
Hmmm. You think the Republic is trying to steal the kolto, perhaps? An odd thing for the Republic to do, no?;NM26AANILK09070_.mp3
Greetings, human. My name is Nilko Bwaas. I hope you are enjoying yourself here in Ahto City. Our floating city is beautiful, is it not?;
It's truly a wonder to behold.;
You are too gracious, human.;
The beauty of Manaan is delicate. Our ecosystem is complex and fragile, and I fear for the preservation of my planet.;
What are you talking about?;
There is a task I would ask, human... Jedi. I fear there is nowhere else I can turn.;
What do you want me to do?;
Rest assured, there will be ample reward for this human. I only require information, nothing more.;
The Republic has been hiring mercenaries - many more than usual. With the incident at the Sith base so recent, one cannot help but wonder...;
As an official of the Selkath people, this is of great concern to me. I only seek the reason for this change in Republic policy.;
Forget it - I won't spy on the Republic!;
I am no enemy of the Republic, human. I only seek assurances that there is no harm being done to Manaan. The Republic may be bringing ruin onto us all without even knowing it!;
Uncover the truth behind the Republic's actions, and I will pay you 500 credits.;
I'm uncomfortable with spying on the Republic... but if we could assure the Selkath that they mean no harm, then perhaps it might be worth it.;NM26AANILK09037_.mp3
And what if the Republic does mean harm, Carth? Will you tell them?;NM26AANILK09039_.mp3
If the Republic did mean harm to the Selkath, then I want to know what the Selkath did to provoke it.;NM26AANILK09041_.mp3
How very noble of you.;NM26AANILK09043_.mp3
Please - see if you can find the answers I seek. Find why the Republic is hiring so many mercenaries, find where they are going. Find why they do not return.;
I'll look into it for you, Nilko.;
Once you discover some information, please come speak to me. Believe it or not, I am a friend of the Republic. Whatever the truth, I shall do my best to protect the Republic's interests - and those of the Selkath, of course.;
I'll do it, but only for the money.;
Forget it, I'm not interested.;
If you discover any information and you change your mind, please come speak to me. I will be here waiting for you.;
I don't know if I like this. Aren't the Republic supposed to be the good guys?;NM26AANILK09114_.mp3
Be careful here, kid. Start poking your nose in places it doesn't belong and you might not like what you find.;NM26AANILK09117_.mp3
I doubt the Republic would be involved in anything illegal. Still, if this Selkath has concerns we could look into it for him.;NM26AANILK09115_.mp3
We could look into this to calm this Selkath's fears, though I doubt the Republic would be involved in anything illegal.;NM26AANILK09116_.mp3
Why do you need me for this?;
I cannot trust anyone else. The Republic obviously wants to keep their secret - I have inquired often as to their purpose and been rebuffed.;
The Sith cannot be trusted to give me an accurate report of events - they will twist the truth so that it furthers their own goals.;
And the mercenaries are well aware of the high wages the Republic is paying - they would not report anything that might slow the flow of credits into their accounts.;
What's in this for me?;
The Republic has been hiring mercenaries - many more than usual. As an official of the Selkath people, this is of great concern to me. I only seek the reason for this change in Republic policy.;
Sorry, I'm not interested.;
Cut the small talk. What do you want?;
You are blunt human - but that is perhaps what I require.;
I think I'll be going now.;
Eh - I've seen better.;
I suppose tastes vary widely across the galaxy, human. And yet, the planet is beautiful to me and my people.;
You're a lot more friendly than most of the Selkath here.;
I am afraid you speak the truth, human. My people are suspicious of outsiders, they fear the destruction of our beautiful planet.;
Ha ha! Once you become a Sith, you can do anything! You can feel the power coursing through you! None of you fools can compare to me!!;NM33AAMURD13000_.mp3
P-please, friend... we are pleased at your success, but...;
Pleased?! You're jealous! You're jealous of my power! You think you deserve this medallion, don't you? Well, let's just see!!;NM33AAMURD13004_.mp3
Ha ha ha! See?! I have the power to do anything!;NM33AAMURD13006_.mp3
Somebody help me!! Please!!;
Sniveling fool! Like you would ever belong beside me in the academy! I'd rather kill you now and save us the trouble!;NM33AAMURD13010_.mp3
What's this? It seems I have an audience. Look, Jedi... just keep walking, unless you want some of the same.;NM33AAMURD13012_.mp3
Sorry, but I'm not going to let you kill that woman.;
You can't stop me! You first, human, and then she dies!!;NM33AAMURD13015_.mp3
Yeah? Let's see how tough you are, then.;
I am a Sith, now! My power is supreme! Prepare to die, ha ha!!;NM33AAMURD13018_.mp3
Do what you want. It has nothing to do with me.;
Yeah? Well I just decided that Jedi make much better sport than anyone else here. Oh, this should be entertaining.;NM33AAMURD13021_.mp3
Oh, yeah? Well I just decided I don't need any witnesses. You look like a fun challenge, anyway, so this should be interesting!;NM33AAMURD13022_.mp3
What's this? It seems I have an audience. Look, human... just keep walking, unless you want some of the same.;NM33AAMURD13013_.mp3
Did you hear? There's an underground resistance movement against the Sith! They even broke into the military compound, or so I'm hearing.;NM02AETAPR33000_.mp3
It's bad enough the Sith conquered this planet, but do they have to come in here to relax and rub their presence in our faces?;NM02AETAPR33002_.mp3
Hey, that quarantine must be tough on you off-worlders stuck here. You should try to make the best of it and order yourself some Tarisian ale. It'll take away some of the sting.;NM02AETAPR33004_.mp3
Hey - you're the Mysterious Stranger! I saw you fight Bendak! There's nothing more exciting than a woman with a blaster, I say! Too bad my wife wouldn't agree...;NM02AETAPR33006_.mp3
Hey - you're the Mysterious Stranger! I saw you take out Bendak. Very harsh, man! You're one stone cold killer!;NM02AETAPR33008_.mp3
Have you heard? Bendak Starkiller's coming out of retirement! I have to get tickets for that match!;NM02AETAPR33010_.mp3
I wish the off duty Sith would stop coming in here for drinks. They've been scouring the Undercity looking for Republic escape pods and they reek of the sewers!;NM02AETAPR33012_.mp3
Bah. I hate it when things start to change so rapidly. We lose more teachers that way...;NM35AASITH17000_.mp3
Heh heh... someone told me that you had an encounter with the 'hermit', himself. How is Jorak these days, eh? Still puritan and longing for the old days? Heh heh heh.;NM35AASITH17002_.mp3
Go on! You've gained your prestige, now, haven't you? Go take your final test already and get out of my hair!;NM35AASITH17004_.mp3
Hmph. Another hopeful wandering about the academy? *sigh* I suppose you want to know how to get prestige?;NM35AASITH17006_.mp3
Who might you be?;
I am one of the academy trainers, of course. You'd do well to watch your tone with me, hopeful... I'll be one of your instructors when and if you reach your final test.;NM35AASITH17008_.mp3
Final test?;
Oh, yes. You gather prestige to earn the opportunity to take the final test... you don't automatically become a student. Heh heh... you'll see.;NM35AASITH17010_.mp3
Do you know how I can get some prestige?;
Hmph. As if I didn't have better things to do. Has anyone told you about Jorak Uln?;NM35AASITH17016_.mp3
No. Who's Jorak Uln?;
Heh. Well... the first thing you should know is that that is not a name you should mention around Master Uthar if you can avoid it.;NM35AASITH17018_.mp3
Jorak Uln was once Uthar's master, you see, and the head of this academy. He went a little insane, however, and Uthar forced him to flee to the surface and hide.;NM35AASITH17020_.mp3
It seems that Jorak has been spending his time kidnapping students who wander into the Valley of the Dark Lords. No idea why. I've also no idea why Uthar doesn't do something about it.;NM35AASITH17022_.mp3
If you want prestige, however, you'll find that hermit, as everyone calls him... you'll find Jorak and either kill him or bring back anything he's been writing. Uthar would like that.;NM35AASITH17024_.mp3
Now begone. I have better things to do than chat with lost hopefuls.;NM35AASITH17031_.mp3
The hermit hiding in the hills?;
Pfah. He is much more than a simple hermit 'hiding in the hills', as you say. We are talking about the former master of the academy.;NM35AASITH17027_.mp3
If you've already been told about him, there's little more I can tell you. With luck, perhaps he'll kidnap you and you will get a chance to see him for yourself, eh?;NM35AASITH17029_.mp3
I have to go.;
May the Force serve you well.;NM35AASITH17013_.mp3
Yes. Can you help me?;
No. I don't need any help.;
Hah! I doubt that. Have it your way, however, off you go.;NM35AASITH17034_.mp3
Padawan, a word, if I may. There are many rumors about your most recent meeting with the Jedi Council. There is talk that they are sending you on a mission to help us against Malak and the Sith.;
How do you know the Council gave me a mission?;
I saw you going into the Council chambers. You were in there for some time. I naturally assumed the Council had given you a task to perform.;
Please understand that I am not asking you to reveal anything that could endanger the Order or the Republic. Whatever task the Council has given you is for your ears, not mine.;
I only wanted to wish you well, and to warn you to be careful. There are many evils out there, many dangers. The Sith are not the only minions of the dark side.;
What could be more dangerous than the Sith?;
Master Dorak has been training me to succeed him as Chronicler here in the Academy. In my studies I have come across tales of creatures that are born of the dark side, monsters of pure evil.;
The worst of these abominations is the terentatek, a beast that feeds on the blood of those who are strong in the Force. Over the centuries, many Jedi have fallen to their ravenous hunger.;
What makes this creature so dangerous?;
The terentatek is a predator, and we Jedi are its prey. They are incredibly strong, with a primal cunning. And they have an in-born resistance to the Force.;
There are some who believe the terentatek is a monster bred by the ancient Sith, and spread throughout the galaxy to destroy the Jedi.;
Fortunately, the terentatek is quite rare. They only dwell in the most dangerous and darkest of places. In fact, one has not been seen in nearly forty years.;
Sounds like they're extinct.;
This is not the first time the terentatek have vanished for long periods of time. Many believe they can lay dormant for years, only to rise and hunt when the power of the dark side waxes full.;
I fear Malak's rise may have woken these creatures from their dormant state. Once the Sith are beaten, I would not be surprised if the Council organized another Great Hunt to try and exterminate them.;
The Great Hunt? What's that?;
The Great Hunt was organized by the Jedi Council shortly after the war against Exar Kun. Jedi were scattered throughout the galaxy, helping to rebuild from the devastation.;
Many Jedi vanished during this period, disappearing from a variety of worlds without warning. We did not know they had been slain until their mutilated bodies began to be discovered.;
The Council investigated, and discovered the terentatek were behind the killings. It was decided the galaxy had to be purged of these insatiable monsters - though the cost proved high.;
So the Jedi just killed these creatures?;
The terentatek are an abomination, they are ruthless engines of death and destruction. The Council had no choice but to destroy them, for the greater good of the galaxy.;
Many Jedi banded together and journeyed to the planets that were suspected of harboring the terentatek. The Great Hunt did not rest until all the creatures had been slain - or almost all.;
There were still rumors of terentatek on the planet of Korriban, a dark world some believe to be the birthplace of the Sith. That is where Exar Kun was corrupted during the first Sith War.;
They never went to Korriban. The Council, fearing more Jedi might fall to the dark side, declared the Great Hunt was officially over... though three Jedi were appointed to continue the work.;
The work of killing the terentatek, you mean.;
The Jedi chosen to continue the hunt on their own were Duron Qel-Droma, Guun Han Saresh and Shaela Nur. These three shared a powerful bond, and each of them was devoted to the light.;
The Council felt that together they would be able to defeat any terentatek they found. And by supporting each other they could resist the temptations of Korriban and the lure of the dark side.;
But none of the three survived. Their Master felt them become one with the Force when they left this world. He believed they were slain by one of the monsters they sought.;
The Council felt it was too dangerous to send anyone else in search of their remains, so their exact fate is not known. But let their deaths serve as a warning to you, Padawan.;
Tell me about the three Jedi lost after the Great Hunt.;
There is not much I can tell you other than their names: Duron Qel-Droma, Guun Han Saresh and Shaela Nur. They disappeared nearly forty years ago, long before my time at the Academy.;
"The Council is certain they are dead; their Master sensed them leaving this world to become one with the Force. More than this, I cannot say.";
Tell me about the Great Hunt you mentioned before.;
I want to ask you some questions.;
If you have questions you should speak with Master Dorak. He is the Chronicler of the Academy here on Dantooine, and is far more knowledgeable than I.;
I am looking for crystals to alter my lightsaber.;
There are caves here on Dantooine that hold the rare crystals we use in our lightsabers. But if you wish to go there, you must be careful. The caves are a place of great danger.;
Good luck with your continued training. May the Force be with you.;
I'll be going now.;
Then may the Force be with you.;
Thanks for the warning. I'll be careful.;
A final warning as you go, Padawan: do not underestimate the terentatek. If you do, you may suffer the same fate as those who disappeared after the Great Hunt.;
I can't waste time listening to your fables!;
Why? What was so special about those three?;
Cost? What cost?;
Then why are you worried about them now?;
It's hard to believe an animal could pose a threat to a Jedi.;
Why are you telling me this?;
You have completed your initial training in a fraction of the normal time. The Force is very strong with you. I'm afraid you might become a target for these creatures.;
What are you talking about?;
I can look after myself.;
Yes, your skill and prowess are already well known throughout this Academy. But even you would be wise to heed my warnings.;
I don't think the Council would want me to speak openly of this mission.;
My discussions with the Council are none of your business!;
Welcome to the Jedi enclave on Dantooine. I do not believe we know each other. My name is Deesra Luur Jada. You may call me Deesra.;
I have not heard of any new apprentices being accepted for training recently. What brings you to this place, if I may ask?;
I came here with Bastila.;
Yes, of course. I should have known. I have only heard a little of how she escaped the destruction of Taris. Tell me, did she save you from that planet as well?;
She didn't save me. We worked together to escape Taris.;
Oh, I see. Well, I meant no offense of course. In any case, it is good to have her back here on Dantooine again. We were afraid Malak had captured her.;
I hope you enjoy your time here on Dantooine. May the Force be with you.;
Get your story straight: I'm the one who saved her!;
My business here is my own.;
Oh... I see. Very well, I have no wish to make you uncomfortable. I suppose I shall just wish you a good day, then.;
You must be the new apprentice Master Zhar is training. I hear you are progressing at an astonishing rate. How are you finding your lessons?;
It's difficult, but worthwhile.;
The lessons we learn at the feet of our Masters teach us to use the Force for good. They show us the power of the light side, and protect us from the dark.;
The Masters are bringing me along too slowly. They're holding me back.;
Patience, apprentice. The Force is a great gift, but it also brings us a heavy burden.;
I am still learning the Jedi Code.;
Of course. Learning the Code is an essential part of our training, for there is great wisdom in its words. Allow me to help you with this, apprentice.;
"There is no emotion; there is peace. There is no ignorance; there is knowledge. There is no passion; there is serenity. There is no chaos; there is harmony. There is no death; there is the Force.";
Take heed of these words, apprentice. They contain a deeper truth than it first appears.;
I hear that Master Zhar feels you are now ready to become a full fledged memer of our Order. Congratulations, apprentice. Or should I say Padawan?;
It brings me great joy to see another who has joined our Order, particularly in these trying times. The path of the light is a difficult one to walk, and many have fallen into the darkness.;
But I am certain you will not be one of those. So, Padawan - what can I do for you?;
Greetings, apprentice. How goes your training? I hear you are progressing at an astonishing rate.;
Yes, Padawan? Is there something I can help you with?;
I just came to tell you that I've killed a terentatek;
Then the galaxy is a better place for it. Every one of these creatures is an abomination that must be exterminated. You have done well, Padawan.;
But do not let your success blind you to the dangers of these monsters. A Jedi must never become complacent when facing one of the terentatek, as you well know.;
Is there anything else I can do for you, Padawan?;
Hello there. You're heading out to the desert? You're a hunter right? You must be if you've been allowed to leave Anchorhead.;NM18AB10WI06000_.mp3
When you see Tanis, and I know you know him, tell him his wife hopes he enjoys the anniversary gift.;NM18AB10WI06001_.mp3
Why do you think I would know him?;
"Don't play dumb. You're just another of his playthings down at that ""hunting"" club. I know your type through and through.";NM18AB10WI06003_.mp3
Well, he can do what he wants. He'll get what he deserves. I bought my own license just so I could see that he did.;NM18AB10WI06004_.mp3
I have to go.;
I'm sure you do. Like I said, when you see him, tell him his wife Marlena says hello.;NM18AB10WI06006_.mp3
You sound like you're planning to kill him.;
Oh, I'm through planning. I just left him a little mess that he has to take care of. If he's smart, he'll be just fine.;NM18AB10WI06008_.mp3
But he's not smart.;NM18AB10WI06009_.mp3
Anniversary gift? What are you talking about?;
Just a little something to remember me by. Something that symbolizes our years together. Something that will blow up in his face.;NM18AB10WI06011_.mp3
Of course, he'll never understand how appropriate it is. He can't talk his way out of this one. He's not smart enough.;NM18AB10WI06012_.mp3
"What do you mean by ""you old boys""?";
"You're just another of his buddies from that ""hunting"" club. I know your kind. You all cover for each other, I bet.";NM18AB10WI06018_.mp3
Um, all right? What if he has a message for you?;
Oh, I'll be long gone soon enough. The next shuttle to... anywhere, really. I've had it with cleaning up his messes, repairing his droids.;NM18AB10WI06014_.mp3
If he lives, he can try and get by on his own. I doubt he'll last long with no one to listen to his lies.;NM18AB10WI06015_.mp3
When you see Tanis, and I know you old boys always stick together, tell him his wife hopes he enjoys the anniversary gift.;NM18AB10WI06016_.mp3
Having fun on the dunes, Tanis? I made sure you would. Here's the deal: Your precious droids have trapped you. They'll hold you until you die of thirst. Make a mistake while repairing them, they explode. Have a good death. My mother was right about you.;NM18AB10WI06019_.mp3
Lord Malak, the preparations are nearly complete. Everyday the Star Forge adds more ships to our fleet, it is operating at nearly 300% of our projections. ## The fleet is assembling around the Star Forge, and awaits your instructions.;NM45ADC01001000_.mp3
The fleet is assembling around the Star Forge, and awaits your instructions. Malak: Patience, Commander.;
Patience, Commander. ## My new apprentice is nearly ready. ## Once Bastila joins her Battle Meditation to our enormous fleet, we shall be invincible.  Then we shall begin our final conquest of the Core Worlds, and the Republic will be crushed forever.;NM45ADC01001002_.mp3
As you wish, Lord Malak.;NM45ADC01001005_.mp3
Jolee! What... what are you doing here?;NM26AASUNR26000_.mp3
Elora sent me, Sunry. I'm here to get you out of this mess. The courts went and made us Arbiters for your case.;NM26AASUNR26001_.mp3
Just like old times, eh Jolee? You come swooping in out of nowhere to save my tail from the fire.;NM26AASUNR26002_.mp3
You saved my wrinkled butt more than a few times as well, friend, if I recall. But there'll be time for catching up later. Right now we need to focus on the case.;NM26AASUNR26003_.mp3
The case is a complete frame-up. Anyone looking at the evidence could see that - or so I thought. But the Selkath seem to think, well that there's enough to go to trial.;NM26AASUNR26009_.mp3
There aren't any witnesses. All that evidence against me is circumstantial... and completely flawed.;NM26AASUNR26010_.mp3
Let's go over the evidence.;
Well... you know I was having an affair with Elassa... I went there to break it off that night.;NM26AASUNR26012_.mp3
I can tell you it wasn't easy. She is... was... young and beautiful. But I love Elora, and I knew I had to do it. I broke it off as quickly as I could and then left.;NM26AASUNR26013_.mp3
I found out later she'd been murdered when the Selkath authorities came knocking on my door...;NM26AASUNR26014_.mp3
But let's look at the facts they've given:;NM26AASUNR26019_.mp3
Elassa was brutally killed. Think about that - she was a Sith, trained in battle and I'm just a crippled old man!;NM26AASUNR26020_.mp3
My war injuries make it difficult for me to walk even to hold things. See how my hands are shaking! How could I kill a Sith warrior at close quarters? I ask you!;NM26AASUNR26021_.mp3
Further: They say they found my Hero's Cross at the crime scene. Would I leave my war medal behind if I killed someone? Even I'm not that stupid.;NM26AASUNR26022_.mp3
Obviously the Sith planted the Cross. And what about the lack of forensic evidence? Skin and hair samples, clothing fibers - why isn't there anything like that at the crime scene? Sounds like an obvious frame-up to me.;NM26AASUNR26023_.mp3
I hope you can see how the Sith are manipulating the Selkath, and probably even you, to set up this against me! We need to get this over with quickly and clear my name.;NM26AASUNR26024_.mp3
Anything else I can help you with? I want my Arbiter to be well prepared before we go to trial.;NM26AASUNR26028_.mp3
I need to investigate the case some more. Any ideas where I should look?;
I guess you could interview witnesses at the hotel where the murder happened. The Selkath already did that, but the fish folk don't have much rapport with off-worlders. Maybe one of them was holding something back.;NM26AASUNR26026_.mp3
But I think you'd be better off investigating the Sith themselves. Maybe you could find some proof they planted evidence to frame me - though that might mean figuring out a way into the Sith Embassy.;NM26AASUNR26027_.mp3
There's a few things we have to clear up.;
Go ahead, ask... ask what you need to. I've got nothing to hide.;NM26AASUNR26030_.mp3
[Persuade] Were you and Elassa having an affair?;
[Success] We... I... Oh, no... what must this look like... Yes. Yes we were having an affair.;NM26AASUNR26032_.mp3
I know it was wrong, but I'm a weak man. Elassa was beautiful and young - how was I to resist her charms? But I didn't kill her! I loved her!;NM26AASUNR26038_.mp3
Please, I know I made a terrible mistake getting involved with Elassa, but I was going there to break it off with her.;NM26AASUNR26039_.mp3
I did it, but found out later that she was dead. I don't deserve to go to jail just for having an affair, do I? You have to help me prove that I wasn't the killer!;NM26AASUNR26040_.mp3
I'll be going now.;
Very well. I suppose there is still much you must do before the trial.;NM26AASUNR26093_.mp3
Once you've gotten enough evidence to go to trial just tell the warden we're ready. The sooner I get out of this cell the better.;NM26AASUNR26094_.mp3
[Failure] That's a Sith lie! They're trying to embarrass me and humiliate my wife! How dare you ask me that!;NM26AASUNR26033_.mp3
Witnesses saw you at her hotel room, Sunry. You better tell me what's going on.;
The witnesses are lying! Maybe the Sith got to them - I don't know. But it's a lie I tell you! A hurtful, horrible lie!;NM26AASUNR26035_.mp3
No offense, Sunry. I have to ask.;
Yes, I... I suppose you do. Please, forgive my outburst. This has been a terribly stressful time for me. I... I'm sure there is more you want to ask me.;NM26AASUNR26042_.mp3
I know you're lying, Sunry. I found this datapad talking about you and Elassa.;
Then... then you know. Please, don't make a big deal about this. Elora already knew and I... I was going there to break if off with Elassa.;NM26AASUNR26037_.mp3
There was a Rodian who planted evidence at the murder scene.;
A Rodian? I didn't know there were any Rodians on Manaan. Oh, except for Tyvark... and this one named Gluupor who was hanging around the hotel all the time.;NM26AASUNR26044_.mp3
OK, so maybe there are a whole bunch of Rodians on Manaan, but what does that matter? If he planted evidence at the scene it's a clear sign of a frame-up. He probably took all the evidence of the real killer at the same time.;NM26AASUNR26045_.mp3
The evidence of a Sith conspiracy keeps getting stronger, doesn't it? But I suspect there is still stuff you want to clear up.;NM26AASUNR26046_.mp3
I know you're guilty, Sunry. I've got the Republic's data recording.;
So the truth is out. I never meant to kill her, you know. When I found out she was a Sith spy using me to gain information, something inside me just snapped.;NM26AASUNR26048_.mp3
She didn't know I had found out, so I waited until she fell asleep and then I... I killed her. Simple, really. But once I realized what I'd done I... I panicked. I contacted those spies from the Republic to help me.;NM26AASUNR26049_.mp3
They found the illegal monitoring device that the Sith had planted in the room, altered its recording to hide my part in it and cleared up the evidence. I figured that was the end of it.;NM26AASUNR26050_.mp3
But the Sith found out the truth, didn't they?;
The Sith must have been spying on me and Elassa, trying to make sure she wasn't a double agent. They must have seen the Republic spies getting rid of all the evidence.;NM26AASUNR26052_.mp3
And so they planted their own evidence. Elassa must have stolen that Hero's Cross from me long ago and given it to her Sith masters, like some kind of trophy.;NM26AASUNR26053_.mp3
I just thought I'd misplaced it. But when the Cross turned up on her body, I knew the Sith had put it there. So now you know the whole story, what are you going to do?;NM26AASUNR26054_.mp3
You're guilty, Sunry. Confess.;
You think I'm some kind of monster, don't you? All I did was kill a Sith! How many Sith have you killed? Dozens? Hundreds? Thousands?;NM26AASUNR26056_.mp3
That's different, Sunry, and you know it. We don't kill them in cold blood while they sleep.;NM26AASUNR26057_.mp3
I don't see how the two of us are any different. She was a spy! She was using me to get information so Malak's army could destroy the Republic! She deserved to die!;NM26AASUNR26060_.mp3
Killing your lover while she sleeps is murder - even if she is a Sith!;
If I confess I'm looking at 20 years in prison! And the Ahto City officials might even place kolto sanctions on the Republic Embassy. Without kolto how can we treat the injuries to our soldiers on the front lines!;NM26AASUNR26062_.mp3
I suppose you're right. I won't expose you.;
I'm glad you decided to see reason in this. If I'm convicted it could cause trouble for the Republic embassy here on Manaan. And none of us want that, now do we?;NM26AASUNR26081_.mp3
These are just excuses, Sunry. We both know you have to own up to your crimes.;
No. I can't do that and put the Republic's supply of kolto in danger. No I won't! Now look, I may have done something stupid, and it may only be worse for my standing by it, but I will not confess.;NM26AASUNR26064_.mp3
If you turn me in, the Republic will likely lose its kolto export privileges and then we'll lose the war for sure. Are you going to send all those thousands, millions - like on Taris - to their deaths, just for your sense of 'justice'?;NM26AASUNR26065_.mp3
Sunry... this is wrong, and you know it. I am a Jedi... what is it that you expect me to do to defend your actions?;NM26AASUNR26066_.mp3
You do whatever you have to, Jolee. I know what I did, but I also know what's at stake, here.;NM26AASUNR26067_.mp3
No, I'll rot in here if I have to, but I won't betray the Republic. Do what you have to, but know what the consequences will be.;NM26AASUNR26073_.mp3
I hate to say it, but he has a point. The Republic needs that kolto.;NM26AASUNR26068_.mp3
And you would propose what? Letting a murderer free on the chance it will help the Republic?;NM26AASUNR26069_.mp3
If need be. We are talking about a Sith, remember? I don't approve of what he did any more than you --;NM26AASUNR26070_.mp3
But you're willing to overlook it. Are the principles that the Republic stands on so very weak, Carth?;NM26AASUNR26071_.mp3
The Republic's principles aren't worth a hill of beans if it falls, Bastila. I'll do whatever I can to save it.;NM26AASUNR26072_.mp3
[Force Persuade] You will confess your crimes. You WANT to confess your crimes.;
[Failure] Oh, That's low - using a Jedi mind trick to extort a confession from me. You might as well beat it out of me, you'd have better luck!;NM26AASUNR26075_.mp3
If you confess the court might show mercy.;
You're talking about acts of war. We're just defending ourselves! You murdered your girlfriend in her sleep.;NM26AASUNR26058_.mp3
Commentary: The meatbag has a point, master. Killing is often justified, if illegal in the eyes of many.;NM26AASUNR26059_.mp3
I don't know.;
I won't betray your secret. We'll go on with the trial.;
But Sunry is a murderer. I'm sorry, old friend, but you are. I... I can't approve of this. You go ahead, however, if that's what you think is best.;NM26AASUNR26080_.mp3
You should have known the truth would come out eventually.;
You're nothing but a cold blooded killer!;
It's easy for you to judge me - but you weren't there! You don't know what it was like, realizing what I'd done. But it...but it doesn't matter anyway.;NM26AASUNR26084_.mp3
The judges said that you left after the shot was fired.;
How would they know? They weren't there!;NM26AASUNR26086_.mp3
I heard some of the witnesses said that too, but I swear she was alive when I left!;NM26AASUNR26087_.mp3
I wonder if the Sith have been putting pressure on people to get them to convict me... It wouldn't surprise me at all. They've had it in for me since the war...;NM26AASUNR26088_.mp3
You should ask everyone about that... they might admit to helping the Sith under pressure.;NM26AASUNR26089_.mp3
On second thought, I will ask something else.;
Er... OK. What else do you want to know?;NM26AASUNR26091_.mp3
Well I was at the hotel, I admit. And I did meet Elassa there that night. But it's not what you think!;NM26AASUNR26015_.mp3
I... I was working with Republic Intelligence. We were pretending to feed information to the Sith while I turned Elassa into a double agent working for us.;NM26AASUNR26016_.mp3
It was going well, too... Until she turned up dead...;NM26AASUNR26017_.mp3
Hm... maybe the Sith had found out I was turning her and had her eliminated...;NM26AASUNR26018_.mp3
Who are you? What are you doing here?;NM26AASUNR26004_.mp3
Your wife asked me to come. I'm a friend of Jolee Bindo.;
Jolee? What's he doing here on Manaan? Never mind - I'm just glad he's here. So is this some kind of prison break? If it is we won't get very far before the Selkath cut us down I can tell ya.;NM26AASUNR26006_.mp3
I've been appointed as your Arbiter.;
Well, I guess if you're going to be my Arbiter you'll need to hear what happened. I might as well start at the beginning.;NM26AASUNR26008_.mp3
Ah, I see you're back. Not that I don't appreciate the visit, but I had hoped you were going to speak to the warden so we might begin the trial.;NM26AASUNR26095_.mp3
I grow weary of staring at these four bare walls. But I suppose you know what you are doing. You know the role of Arbiter cannot be taken lightly.;NM26AASUNR26096_.mp3
Jolee - coming to check in on an old man? I must confess, I... I would rather you were here to speak to the warden and begin my trial.;NM26AASUNR26097_.mp3
Soon, old friend. But we don't want to go to trial until we've got the whole picture.;NM26AASUNR26098_.mp3
No hard feelings, my good man, but I can't really talk with you right now. It's difficult enought to draw the interest of the ladies in this establishment as it is.;NM02AEJERG19000_.mp3
Surely you understand what I'm talking about. I'd guess you've experienced many lonely evenings... something I'm hoping to avoid tonight.;NM02AEJERG19002_.mp3
The exotic beauty returns. Hello again, my dear. Have you changed your mind? Do you want to take me up on my offer? Just twenty credits and I can arrange a meeting with the band.;NM02AEJERG19004_.mp3
I want to meet the band. Here's twenty credits.;
Excellent. Wait here while I go set it up with my contact. I'll give him your credits, then I'll come back out and take you to meet the band.;NM02AEJERG19006_.mp3
I can't afford that much.;
Well, I would like to help you but I can't arrange the meeting for free. And I'm afraid your feminine charms would have little effect on the Rodian bodyguards backstage.;NM02AEJERG19009_.mp3
If you manage to come up with the credits just come back and see me. I'll be more than happy to arrange for you to meet the band. Until then, please enjoy the music.;NM02AEJERG19011_.mp3
Sounds like you're running a scam to me.;
You sting me with your words! I merely thought I could offer you the rare opportunity to meet a celebrity before they were famous. But I see you're not interested.;NM02AEJERG19014_.mp3
That's too bad. They really are charming fellows. Very well, then - I hope you enjoy the music. If you change your mind come speak with me again.;NM02AEJERG19017_.mp3
I'm not interested in meeting the band.;
Well, hello there! I see from your exotic appearance that you are not from Taris originally. Allow me to introduce myself - my name is Jergan.;NM02AEJERG19019_.mp3
Pleased to meet you. My name's <FullName>.;
What do you think of our local music? The band is quite good, wouldn't you agree? They're on the verge of intergalactic stardom, you know.;NM02AEJERG19021_.mp3
They're very good.;
Obviously you have an ear for music. Mark my words, they'll be famous soon enough. They were about to go on tour before this Sith quarantine stranded them here.;NM02AEJERG19023_.mp3
Would you like to meet the band after the show? Maybe have a brief brush with fame before they become intergalactic superstars? I can arrange it, you know.;NM02AEJERG19029_.mp3
How will you arrange that?;
I have a standing arrangement with one of the Rodian bodyguards backstage. For the small sum of 20 credits he'll let me set up a meeting with you and the band.;NM02AEJERG19035_.mp3
Sure, I'd like to meet them.;
I'll pass.;
Are you certain? This is a once in a lifetime opportunity - meet the legends before they were famous. All it will cost you is a small handful of credits.;NM02AEJERG19033_.mp3
It's different, but I like it.;
I don't much care for the band.;
They are something of an acquired taste. But mark my words, they'll be famous soon enough. They were about to go on tour before this Sith quarantine stranded them here.;NM02AEJERG19027_.mp3
These guys are the worst!;
What do you want, Jergan?;
[Even through the layers of wrappings, you can tell this Sand People warrior is disgusted by your presence among his people.];
Extrapolation: This guard doesn't appear honored to have the job of greeting us.;NM18AC14SA01002_.mp3
Tell him we have the moisture converters.;
Translation: [Unitelligible];
Translation: He will take us before the Chieftain, as he was instructed to do.;NM18AC14SA01006_.mp3
Ask him if we can enter.;
Tell him to move aside or we'll make him!;
[Leave quietly];
[He looks past you, like you were never there.];
[Without HK-47 present there is no way to communicate with him without risking violence.];
Let me pass! I demand it!;
[He screams and answers your threat in kind. He was likely waiting for an excuse to attack.];
We will guard this landing place from now on. Yours is the only ship that will be allowed to dock here for a long time, outsider.;
Thank you for your assistance, outsider. I doubt we will meet another of your kind like you.;
Your presence is tolerated because of how you helped us, outsider.;
It will be a long time before we allow ourselves to be as weak as Chuundar made us.;
If another company comes to Kashyyyk, they will find it impossible to do what Czerka did.;
We will remember what happend here. Slavers will not take us again.;
Kolto's real scarce all of a sudden. From what I hear, the Republic is to blame.;NM26ADSITH06000_.mp3
I don't have time to listen to your stories - I've got a full shipment of kolto to load before my shift is over.;NM26ADSITH06002_.mp3
We've got all the proper kolto trading permits, so back off.;NM26ADSITH06004_.mp3
[Having seen what happened to his fellow officer, this man has no desire to risk a similar lesson. He shifts uncomfortably under your scrutiny.];
Our business has nothing to do with you, spacer.;NM17AF07OF08000_.mp3
Go to the Czerka offices if you want a job. I'm off duty.;NM17AF07OF08001_.mp3
Should have been a wraid hunter. I hate this uniform.;NM17AF07OF08002_.mp3
How are the Sand People doing so much damage? Blasters beat gaffi sticks, don't they?;NM17AF07OF08003_.mp3
Maybe the Sith will give us more support here on Tatooine. Couldn't get worse.;NM17AF07OF08004_.mp3
The sooner I get out of this dustbowl, the better.;NM17AF07OF08005_.mp3
Czerka Corporation should just close this whole place down. Heh. Who would miss it?;NM17AF07OF08006_.mp3
I've enough to worry about with my mining quotas, I don't have time for you.;NM17AF07OF08007_.mp3
More of you Czerka core-rats? Is even the heart of Kashyyyk not free from your kind?;
He is almost feral after all this time. Calm yourself, Freyyr. We are friends. Don't you remember me?;NM25AAFREY02002_.mp3
After years in the Shadowlands, I remember only that outsiders are not to be trusted! I'll see you dead!;
Well, this may prove difficult.;NM25AAFREY02006_.mp3
For years I have hid, hoping to someday free my world! I swear you will not take me! I swear!;
I... I am beaten. Take my head, Czerka filth. You won't get another chance. So swears Freyyr of Kashyyyk.;
I'm not here to kill you. Just listen!;
The words of outsiders are tainted with lies. You can't convince me otherwise.;
Do you know Zaalbar and Chuundar?;
What? Those are the names of my sons! But they are lost to me now: one exiled, the other a traitor!;
Hold on a second: Zaalbar and Chuundar are brothers? And you're their father? Wait a minute... does this mean Big Z is some kind of prince or something?;NM25AAFREY02015_.mp3
Why do you speak the names of my sons? How do you know of them? Tell me!;
My name is <FullName>. I came to Kashyyyk with Zaalbar.;
To my shame, Zaalbar was exiled and enslaved. Do you dare claim to be my son's owner, outsider?;
No, he follows because of a life-debt.;
Does he? Then he sees something of worth in you. I will listen... cautiously. Gullibility has harmed me in the past.;
If I had seen the lies of Chuundar, he would have been exposed as a slaver. Zaalbar would not have been exiled...;
Exiled? Big Z never told me that! Of course he never said he was royalty, either.;NM25AAFREY02026_.mp3
"I did not believe Zaalbar's claims; I believed the elder boy, as tradition dictated. The shame of Zaalbar's attack blinded me.";
Go over exactly what happened with Zaalbar.;
Zaalbar saw it first. He learned that Chuundar was dealing with the Czerka, leading them to our hunting parties.;
Chuundar would blame disappearances on the dangers of the Shadowlands. Zaalbar was crazed when he found out.;
He attacked Chuundar with his claws. I thought he had gone mad... shed his honor. I was bound by the old ways.;
So Zaalbar was exiled. When did you learn the truth?;
A year later. By then, Chuundar had spread lies of my own madness. I had no allies when I confronted him.;
He and his Czerka guards attacked me. I had to retreat to the deepest Shadowlands, but even there they followed.;
That's when I first saw him. I helped his pursuers lose him for a moment. Do you remember me now, Freyyr?;NM25AAFREY02040_.mp3
Yes, I think I do. I am sorry about attacking. It's been so long since I have offered my trust, or accepted that of someone else.;
Back to my other questions.;
I will answer, and then ask something of you.;
Why would Chuundar want you dead now?;
Well, if Zaalbar is back, perhaps Chuundar is worried the people will realize things are not as they seem.;
"Chuundar has established himself as a leader that succeeded despite the ""tragedies"" that have plagued his family.";
If it was shown that he conspired with the slavers, his honor would be gone. I wonder...;
Well, what happens now?;
That would depend on you, <FullName>. You will either kill me or decide that I may yet benefit my people.;
There is a way I might challenge Chuundar, but it would take a lot to convince people they have been lied to.;
How? Everyone is on his side.;
He has a strong web of lies, but if I appeal to the traditions of my people, I might be able to gather support.;
There is a legend of a great warrior from the old times. Bacca was his name, and he is greatly revered.;
Bacca found a crashed starship, our first hint of life elsewhere. He was a cautious old wook, and feared the taint of invaders.;
He constructed a vibroblade from the wreckage. It has long symbolized our independence. Only destined leaders have held it.;
Where might I find it?;
That is the problem. It was the symbol of our great chieftains for centuries, but it was damaged a generation ago in ritual battle.;
Here in the Shadowlands Rothrrrawr fought the Great Beast. He sought a challenge, but this arrogance got him more than he could handle.;
He survived, but the blade of the sword stayed in the creature's hide. Our tales say it was taken because we had become undeserving.;
The hilt is still in the court of our chieftain... with Chuundar. If the blade could be found, <FullName>, tradition could cast doubt on his rule.;
Actually, I've already found it. I wasn't sure what it was.;
You have? Please let me see it. I must be sure!;
Here, take it. I'm sure it is the one.;
It... it is! It may not look like much... but it is a very important relic of my people. Tradition dictates that it be respected.;
I didn't think I was worthy to search for it, but I realize that was selfish despair. I should have challenged Chuundar long ago.;
I will make amends now. I have new hope. You have led me to this. Perhaps that is what the Great Beast wanted.;
We should proceed carefully.;
I will climb to the surface as quickly as possible and try to gather support. You will have to follow on the paths as soon as you can, <FullName>.;
When you arrive, we will confront Chuundar in the throne room. My people will no longer be slaves.;
Yes, time to take the fight to Chuundar himself!;
Wait a minute. What's in it for me?;
What? I... I have nothing. I've been here for years. When we have succeeded, I will see you are rewarded.;
Actually, I was mistaken.;
Don't taunt me like that. False hope is a cruel thing.;
I have other questions.;
I will answer as best I can.;
Seen anyone hunting down here? Camouflaged attackers?;
My invisible attackers are a menagerie of my own fears and regrets, so many more than actual beasts that walk.;
No, I have not seen the creatures that you mention. I have been... preoccupied.;
I found a computer. Know anything about it?;
I tried to access it many times over the years. It would never acknowledge me. I'm no good with such things.;
It clamins to be ancient. It created the forests.;
Well, now you are just having fun with me. It's probably just some malfunctioning Czerka cast-off.;
Seriously though, if we are to challenge Chuundar based on tradition, I suggest you don't say these things to anyone.;
You risk contradicting our most ancient tales. Perhaps this warrants investigating, but not now.;
I'm looking for something called a Star Map.;
I've never heard of such a thing... but there is something odd down here. A large computer installation.;
It's probably just some Czerka cast-off, but you may find something useful. I can't figure it out, myself.;
It is northwest of here. I gave up on it years ago.;
Back to my previous questions.;
I will try to answer as best I am able.;
I have found the blade of Bacca's sword.;
I'll get back to you. Wait here.;
I hope you can help. I must try to fix what has gone wrong here.;
I've decided to kill you for Chuundar!;
I don't support this action! Think on this, child!;NM25AAFREY02156_.mp3
You are hardly a competent moral guide. Why question me?;
Look, I'm not your nanny-droid, but I just don't think following Chuundar is the best course.;NM25AAFREY02158_.mp3
Fine, I'll talk to Freyyr and think about it.;
You mind your own business! I've made my decision.;
Doesn't seem like much of a father anyway, kicking his son out like that.;NM25AAFREY02168_.mp3
Then let my blood feed my beloved Kashyyyk!;
Describe the creature. Where can I find it?;
Many have tried to hunt this beast, but only a few who have seen it have lived to tell the tale. And none have ever managed to kill the creature.;
Many years ago, when I was far younger than I am now, a Jedi came to hunt the creature... a proud and boastful young man. Like many before him, he did not return.;
The beast is cunning. It will not appear if there is an overwhelming number waiting to slay it. But if you gather in small numbers, we know how to lure it out.;
Fresh blood will draw it out. Before Chuundar's rule put an end to the ritual, fresh kills were often left as offerings in the south of this area.;
I will try to find it. Can you give me any direction?;
There is a place of ritual south of here. If the Great Beast is to be lured out of hiding, it must be done there, using the old ways.;
You have already collected the body of a viper kinrath. Such bait would be tempting for the creature. Find a way to display it.;
I will stay here and try to think of what I will say to Zaalbar. I have wronged him. I hope he can forgive me.;
I will be here. Please, <FullName>, find the blade of Bacca's sword. I must make things right.;
The flesh of a fresh kill would be tempting bait if displayed properly. Find an appropriate beast of sufficient mass to attract it.;
And you still think you are worthy of being chieftain?;
No, I don't, but better me than Chuundar. He sells his own people for power. Please help, <FullName>. You've brought me hope...;
This bores me. I think I'll just kill you!;
I don't approve of this! Is Chuundar to be blindly obeyed?;NM25AAFREY02085_.mp3
You're my moral guide now? That's not your style.;
Perhaps not. Do what you will. I'm just wondering if Chuundar is the wiser choice of ally.;NM25AAFREY02087_.mp3
Ah, shut up. I'll ask him a few more questions.;
I've made my decision. The old fool dies!;
What, a scavenger hunt for some sword? You're kidding.;
I'm afraid not. It was the symbol of our great chieftains for centuries, but it was damaged a generation ago in ritual battle.;
That's enough. Just die, you old hairbag!;
Is that it? You spared his life initially just to cut him off before he can fully explain himself?;NM25AAFREY02169_.mp3
Oh, very well. Freyyr, do you know Zaalbar and Chuundar?;
What? Those are my sons. Why do you speak their names? Tell me!;
My name is <FullName>. Chuundar sent me to kill you.;
Did he? I'm surprised it took him this long. Very well, do your worst!;
Wait! I came here with Zaalbar.;
I intend to!;
Doesn't seem like much of a father anyway. Hmph! Zaalbar was hurt bad by whatever happened here.;NM25AAFREY02167_.mp3
Fine, I'll tell him that I arrived here with Zaalbar.;
Then let him tell exactly what happened with Zaalbar.;
I'm leader here. I say he dies!;
The old hermit saved me, I think. He clouded their minds for a moment. I have had a long time to hide... and regret.;
It doesn't matter. It proves I am no common Czerka slaver.;
I suppose it does. I will listen... cautiously. Gullibility has harmed me in the past...;
Chuundar sends his regards. Now die!;
Did we come this far only to kill this old wook? I don't approve of this at all.;NM25AAFREY02105_.mp3
What would you suggest? He attacked us first.;
I know he did, but not without reason. The only outsiders he's seen for years have been slavers.;NM25AAFREY02107_.mp3
What can I say to prove we aren't enemies?;
This seems simple to me. Time to die, Freyyr!;
Back in line! I'm in charge here.;
Hold your tongue, child. I'm not challenging you. I just thought you'd have the smarts to consider every option.;NM25AAFREY02111_.mp3
Wait - I don't trust Chuundar. Maybe we should try talking to this Wookiee.;NM25AAFREY02174_.mp3
Wait - maybe this doesn't have to end in bloodshed. Maybe we should try talking to this Wookiee.;NM25AAFREY02175_.mp3
I greet you again, <FullName>. I am humble, hoping you have found the blade of Bacca's sword. Imagine... Chieftain Freyyr... humble.;
Please, tell me you have made progress. Having the blade will gain me valuable support.;
Yooba me kapsie?;
[Communicate with Sasha in her language.];
Yooba me kapsie nuh ghis?;
There is someone there who will take you home. Lur Arka kesta-won you laesfa.;
[She seems uncertain.] Me palkie laesfa? Me palkie Dantooine?;
Yes, you can go home.;
[The girl seems to think about this, but says nothing.];
If Lur Arka is still there. We'll see.;
If I have time.;
Why are you hiding on my ship? Sasha na esowon in bristag?;
Me palkie bristag na nuh ghis! Me hoot abd liaz!;
You came to the ship before. You were very scared. Why?;
Me palkie Manlorey! Me na esowon!;
You left the Mandalorians? And hid here on the ship.;
Me na palkie awnts! Bristag me laesfa!;
You don't want to leave. The Ebon Hawk is your home.;
[She nods.] Bristag me laesfa.;
The Ebon Hawk is not your home, Sasha. Not your first home, anyway. Bristag na Sasha laesfa.;
Bristag me laesfa!!;
Tell me about your home before. Tabed me Sasha laesfa na nuh ghis.;
[The girl thinks for a long moment.] Dantooine. Dantooine me laesfa na nuh ghis.;
Dantooine? Maybe someone here remembers you?;
[The girl obviously doesn't understand.];
I don't have time to look around for someone who knows you.;
[The girl looks hopeful.] Me na palkie laesfa?;
You don't have to go, Sasha. You can stay... for now.;
Bristag me laesfa! Yooba gon-disen!!;
I don't care what you do. Stay on the ship... just don't be any trouble.;
Forget it! I'm not looking out for you... off my ship. Now!;
Me hoot bad liaz! Awnts!!;
I don't care if you're scared. Go!;
Me na awnts palkie!! Na abds!!;
I don't have time for this. Out!!;
*sniff* Me... me palkie. Is na gon-disen.;
*sigh* Alright, you can stay. For now.;
Me... me na palkie? Gon-disen!;
Why are you scared of the Mandalorians? Hoot bad liaz Manlorey?;
Manlorey kesta-won Sasha na nuh ghis! Manlorey abds!;
They took you before? And hurt you?;
Manlorey bristag na laesfa. Manlorey bristag is na gon-disen!;
The Mandalorian ship wasn't home. You didn't like it.;
Me palkie Manlorey bristag. Me na esowon in bristag laesfa.;
You sleep here on the ship? Yooba stin-quiw in bristag?;
[She points at a nearby service panel. You understand that she must have been sleeping in the ship's repair ducts.] Sasha stin-quiw there. It gon-disen.;
You have to go now, Sasha. Yooba palkie nuh ghis, Sasha.;
That's enough talk for now.;
Me no palkie?;
No, you don't have to go. For now.;
Yooba gon-disen! Bristag me laesfa!;
I haven't decided yet.;
Me no palkie awnts! Bristag me laesfa!;
No, we'll have to talk later.;
Yooba palkie?  Bye-bye.;
I'm tired of this game. I want you off my ship.;
Na! Me hoot bad liaz! Awnts!!;
Look... I can't understand you. You have to go.;
Can you tell me your name?;
[The girl looks at you oddly, puzzled.];
[Point to yourself.] My name is <FirstName>. You are...?;
[The girl points to herself.] Waaba soosa Sasha!;
Do you know a Twi'lek by the name of Lur Arka Sulas?;
[The girl obviously doesn't understand you.];
Sasha... your name is Sasha, right?;
[she nods] Waba soosa Sasha.;
How did you get on the ship, Sasha?;
[The girl looks at you quizzically, not understanding.];
Does the name Lur Arka ring a bell? What about Rundil ot Sulem?;
You're a stowaway, aren't you? How long have you been here?;
Where are you from? Can you tell me that?;
Where are you from, Sasha? Taris?;
[Try to learn Sasha's strange language.];
Sasha na esowon in bristag. Bristag me laesfa.;
Many of the words you're speaking are Mandalorian...;
Manlorey! Manlorey is na gon-disen! Manlorey abds!;
Manlorey... that's your word for Mandalorian? So you do know of them.;
Me na esowon Manlorey! Manlorey abds!;
But are you a Mandalorian child, then?;
Me? Sasha na Manlorey!!;
So you're human. You learned the words from somewhere, though.;
Sasha isn't Mandalorian. Got it. But why don't you speak Basic, then?;
I can understand Mandalorian, but your words are all mixed up.;
So you... hid from the Mandalorians? Or are hiding?;
Okay. Mandalorians bad. I get it.;
You don't like the Mandalorians. I understand.;
The Mandalorians hurt you? Is that what you're saying?;
Esowon? Na esowon?;
[She points to herself.] Me esowon!;
I see you? Or you see me?;
[The girl hides her face behind her hands for a moment.] Me na esowon!;
"You... you're hiding! ""Na esowon"" is ""hide""!";
[The girl appears, unsure.] Yooba esowon nuh ghis?;
Yes, I see now. Me esowon nuh ghis.;
I didn't get all of that, but sure.;
"I understand. ""Esowon"" is ""see"" but ""na esowon"" is ""hide"".";
I need to hear more.;
Bristag? What is that?;
[The girl points at things around her.] Bristag! Bristag me laesfa!;
It's a thing? Something around here?;
"[The girl waves a hand about, making a ""swooshing"" sound.] Bristag!";
"""Bristag""... it means ""starship"", doesn't it?";
Bristag! Sasha na esowon in bristag. Bristag me laesfa.;
Laesfa... everything is safe? Is that it?;
[She points towards one of the Ebon Hawk's service panels.] Me laesfa. Me stin-quiw in laesfa.;
"That panel? That's what ""laesfa"" means?";
[The girl looks puzzled. She gestures around her.] Bristag me laesfa!;
"The panel... all of this... it's your home. ""Laesfa"" means ""home"".";
[The girl smiles.] Sasha na esowon in bristag. Bristag me laesfa!;
You're hiding in the starship. It's your home. I understand.;
Yooba gon-disen!;
"You've said that before. What is ""gon-disen""?";
[The girl laughs and points at you.] Yooba gon-disen!;
Something about me, yes, but what?;
[The girl smiles and pats her chest.] Gon-disen! Me!;
"It's... something you like. Yes, ""gon-disen"" means you like it!";
You already said that! What about it?;
I give up.;
[The girl stares at you with wide eyes.] Is na gon-disen?;
Right. You can stay here, for now.;
Sorry, but you have to leave my ship.;
You like me. I understand.;
Yooba na abds?;
"""Na abds""... you said that when I first found you.";
[The girl slaps her leg.] Abds! Me abds!;
"""Abds"" means ""hit""? Is that it?";
[She frowns and slaps her leg again.]  Abds! Is na gon-disen!;
"So... ""abds"" is ""to hurt""? ""Na abds"" means ""not hurt""? Is that it?";
Yooba na abds!;
I understand. No, I won't hurt you.;
Me awnts kesta-won yum nuh ghis.;
Yum? What kind of word is that?;
[The girl seems puzzled. She points towards elsewhere on the ship.] Yum. Me awnts kesta-won yum.;
It's... a part of the ship? A room?;
[She mimics an act which looks like she's chewing something.] Yum. Me yum gon-disen!;
"Yum... you mean food, don't you? ""Yum"" is ""food"".";
[She smiles.] Me awnts kesta-won yum nuh ghis!;
Nuh ghis? Is that all one phrase?;
[The girl thinks for a moment and then stabs downwards several times with her finger.] Me kapsie nuh ghis!;
"The floor? ""Nuh ghis"" means floor?";
[She covers her mouth with her hand.] Me na kapsie nuh ghis!;
"You're not speaking... now? ""Nuh ghis"" means ""now""! ""Na nuh ghis"" is not now... or ""before""?";
Nuh ghis! Me awnts kesta-won yum nuh ghis!;
You... want some food now. You're hungry.;
Tabed me yooba!;
Tabed you? What do you mean?;
[The girl points at her mouth.] Yooba kapsie... tabed me yooba.;
You... want me to tell you a story? About what?;
[She points at you.] Yooba! Tabed me yooba!;
So... 'tabed' means 'tell me about'. I get it.;
I'm... supposed to talk? To speak? What about?;
You want to know about me, do you?;
[She claps her hands excitedly.] Tabed me yooba, awnts!;
Say something else, Sasha.;
[She seems frightened and backs away.] Me abd liaz...;
You're talking... down? I don't understand.;
You want something from elsewhere?;
Yes, very bad. Stop that!;
The starship... you mean home. The ship is your home.;
"You... sleep there? ""Laesfa"" means ""sleep""?";
It's your home? Is that it?;
I've got to go.;
Ahhh! Na abds! Na abds!!;
Hey! What are you doing here?!;
Na abds! Me hoot bad liaz!! Awnts!!;
I don't understand what you're saying.;
You... yooba me na abds?;
I still don't understand you.;
[She frowns and looks at you helplessly.];
Err... sure, whatever you say.;
[She smiles.] Yooba gon-disen!;
Calm down, little girl. I won't hurt you.;
I want you out of here! Off my ship!!;
Ahh!! Me na awnts palkie bristag!! Bad liaz!!;
I don't care. Off you go. Now!!;
*sniff* Me awnts na palkie. Me bad liaz.;
Suck it up, sister. Find someone who cares.;
I don't understand and I don't care. Get off my ship.;
Oh no, not the tears! *sigh* Alright, what's the problem?;
Alright, alright, calm down. What's the problem?;
A little girl? Where did you come from?;
Get out of here, whoever you are! Right now!!;

You should be okay now. I'm glad I could help.;
Among my people many believe all the Sith are cruel and heartless, but I see now that is not true.;
Once more, thank you for saving me from those human children. I must take leave of you now. My life mate will be wondering where I am.;
You look hurt. Here, I've got a medpac. Let me help you.;
You are too kind, human. I thank you for your generosity. Most of your kind here on Taris care little for aliens like myself.;
Do you have any kind of reward for me helping you?;
I am sorry, human. I wish I had a reward to give you to show my appreciation for your intervention, but I have no suitable reward on my person.;
You want me to come over their and kick your little butts?! That's it... now you're in for it!!;NM02ABITHB10016_.mp3
I will not stand here and let that poor man be stoned! You there, children... leave him alone!;NM02ABITHB10018_.mp3
Why do you care what happens to some scummy alien? He's just a freak!;NM02ABITHB10029_.mp3
Yeah - he isn't even supposed to be in the Upper City!;NM02ABITHB10031_.mp3
Fine - I don't want to get involved.;
Well I will. You children get away... just because he is different does not give you the right to attack him!;NM02ABITHB10033_.mp3
Come on - let's go. I don't want to listen to this alien lover anymore!;NM02ABITHB10038_.mp3
Well, I will. You kids... get lost before I kick your sorry butts! Now, now beat it!!;NM02ABITHB10035_.mp3
Just because he's different doesn't give you the right to attack him!;
Get out of here you punks or you'll be the ones in pain!;
Hey, aren't you...? Hey, hey stop that, you kids! Leave him alone!;NM02ABITHB10020_.mp3
Take that you alien scum!;NM02ABITHB10022_.mp3
Wow! You got him good that time! Hey - I think he's dead!;NM02ABITHB10024_.mp3
Let's get out of here!;NM02ABITHB10026_.mp3
Hey - you kids! Leave that Ithorian alone!;
Sand People wiped out my moisture farm and what does Czerka do? Nothing.;NM17AA12CO06000_.mp3
I tried to get work in the mines, but Czerka Corporation is scaling back. Ah, I can't say that I blame them.;NM17AA12CO06001_.mp3
I don't know who founded Anchorhead the first time, but I know why they left.;NM17AA12CO06002_.mp3
If you were looking for your fortune, you picked the wrong planet.;NM17AA12CO06003_.mp3
Those Jawas, I don't understand a thing they say.;NM17AA12CO06004_.mp3
I saw a krayt dragon once. Well, not up close. I'm pretty sure that's what it was.;NM17AA12CO06005_.mp3
If the Republic cared at all they would laser the desert from orbit. Let's see the Sand People hide on a sheet of glass.;NM17AA12CO06006_.mp3
Nothing smells worse than a herd of wild banthas. Nothing.;NM17AA12CO06007_.mp3
I watched some good races at the swoop track last week. You have to thank Motta for giving us something to do.;NM17AA12CO06008_.mp3
Womp rats are not good eating. Trust me.;NM17AA12CO06009_.mp3
Czerka Corporation will unload this outpost on someone. Maybe not for a few years, but they can wait.;NM17AA12CO06010_.mp3
There's not enough jobs here for permanent citizens, let alone you spacer drop-ins.;NM17AA12CO06011_.mp3
What? Why are you speaking to me? Can't you tell from my clothing that I'm of the nobility!;NM02AENOBL28000_.mp3
Get away from me - I can't be seen talking with the common rabble. It wouldn't be proper for a man of my standing.;NM02AENOBL28002_.mp3
Hey - I recognize you! You're the one who won the swoop race!;
You better be careful out on the streets. Those damn Vulkars will be looking to get even with you for winning that race and killing Brejik.;
Brejik is nothing but scum! I don't know why those Vulkars follow him - Gadon's ten times the man he is!;
The swoop race coming up will show those Vulkars who's in charge here! When we win half the people following Brejik will desert him!;
It isn't safe out there on the streets. Those Black Vulkars will take a shot at anybody!;
We of the Elder Council did not expect to see you again, Revan. We thought you had betrayed us. Why have you returned to our village after all this time?;
You have returned, Revan. Are you ready to enter the Temple now?;
Yes, Revan. Is there something you need?;
Revan, you are back. Our scout has told us of how you rescued him. His injuries are severe, but we believe he will survive. We are grateful for what you have done.;
You are back, Revan. When you refused to enter the Temple alone we feared you had betrayed us again. We did not expect you to return.;
Did you find what you were looking for inside the Temple? Did you discover the secrets to destroy the Star Forge?;
Hurry, Revan. The Star Forge must be destroyed.;
Hurry, Revan. The Star Forge must be destroyed, Malak must be stopped. You cannot afford to waste time here with us.;
I trust we have all learned something about opposing me? You risked much by pretending to support Freyyr.;
I don't want to dwell on it. The deed is done. You rule Kashyyyk. I will follow.;
At last you understand. For your loyalty, I'll see your name restored... eventually. It takes time to make people think what I want them to.;
Will Zaalbar have a place here, then?;
Yes... in time. I will need time to construct a reason for his glorious return. Until then, I think he should accompany you.;
I would prefer that. There is nothing here for me. You have shown me that. So have you, <FullName>.;
Yes, yes, you have realized the truth. We will all move forward, and for now it would be better if you left.;
Let's go back to my other questions.;
Hurry then. I have other things to take care of.;
I want to ask about what I saw in the Shadowlands.;
Yes, my spies said you found some interesting things down there. Remarkable for an outsider.;
There were Mandalorian hunters. Very advanced.;
My spies weren't too clear in explaining what was going on. I hear they could blend against the background of the forest? Interesting.;
I will have my best Wookiees examine the corpses. I'll keep this knowledge to myself, I think. The Czerka need not know.;
Back to my Shadowland questions, all right?;
It's time I left.;
Yes, I think it is. But what should I reward you with? I wonder if you know the magnitude of what you have done here?;
You've made certain I cannot be challenged. With Freyyr gone, there is nobody to whine about the old traditions. Everyone believes in my way... even Zaalbar.;
I will lead the Wookiee people to a great future... safely under my thumb. What should be the reward, brother? What will be your reward for joining me?;
You've shown me how useless our traditions are, so what is there to want? I'll take Bacca's sword. At least it's still useful in combat.;
I think that would be fitting.;
Hmm... I agree with the request. The sword has lost it's influence here, and removing it from Kashyyyk will kill the old ways completely. That would suit my plans well.;
Here, let's get the blade off Father's corpse. I should be able to... yes... I think that does it.;
Take it. It's harmless in the hands of an exile and an outsider. Freyyr was the true force behind it, and the new generation will forget him quickly. You've seen to that.;
You're not fooling anyone, ya know.;NM23ADCHUU01047_.mp3
Leave it alone, Mission. This is what I want now.;
If you say so, Big Z.;NM23ADCHUU01051_.mp3
That finishes our business. Take care, Zaalbar. We'll welcome you back someday. When I decide the people are ready. Not before.;
Don't worry, brother. I know your way is the best. It's the only way our people will survive in a galaxy full of outsider lies.;
And you, outsider, you'll understand why I don't invite you to stay. The uncontested ruler of Kashyyyk will not abide troublemakers...;
No matter how helpful they may have been. Goodbye.;
Oh, yes. Far better to have both the blade and a possible rival as far from Kashyyyk as possible, hey? *sigh* I feel very tired of this place, now.;NM23ADCHUU01041_.mp3
You are free to leave with my brother, mad hermit. Nothing compels you to remain.;
Right you are. I think I'll do just that.;NM23ADCHUU01045_.mp3
The only problem is that I only have the hilt of the thing. The blade was lost in the Shadowlands long ago.;
I have the blade.;
You are full of surprises. Let me see... this should be a simple matter. Yes, I think... there we go.;
I might be able to find the blade.;
Will you? Very well. Here, take the hilt. Find the blade and you should be able to assemble the sword.;
And if you don't or can't, it'll still be gone from my sight. I think that takes care of everything.;
Well, that ends that. Perhaps something else?;
I think I'll leave it for you to sort out. Take the hilt. Find the blade and you should be able to assemble the sword.;
Wait Zaalbar. I want credits out of this.;
RRAAAAAAGHGHGH!!! BACCA'S SWORD! NOTHING ELSE!;
Whoa, Big Z! Settle down! I've never seen him this angry before!;NM23ADCHUU01070_.mp3
Uh... it seems Zaalbar has made up his mind, and I agree. The sword has lost it's influence here. Removing it from Kashyyyk will kill the old ways completely.;
My, my. Best to give an angry Wookiee his due, I'd say.;NM23ADCHUU01072_.mp3
Getting Wookiees angry is not a smart thing to do.;NM23ADCHUU01074_.mp3
Perhaps you should not be so self-serving.;NM23ADCHUU01076_.mp3
Shut up, Wookiee, I'm bargaining!;
I saw an ancient computer of some kind.;
Did you? You were out of sight from my spies for a long time. Perhaps it was some crashed ship?;
It's been there since before the forest.;
Now I think you are just making things up. Nothing is older than the forest, not even we Wookiees.;
Oh, you're wrong on that count, actually. Not that I would expect you to know that.;NM23ADCHUU01092_.mp3
I might send someone to try and find this ancient computer, but I think you are mistaken. Crazy outsider.;
There were Czerka poachers down there.;
Yes, and you made a mess of their operation. I am not pleased about that, but I can overlook it.;
I will have to make amends to Czerka Corporation on the next slave shipment, but your service elsewhere was worth it.;
I met the hermit Jolee Bindo down there.;
So, the insane outsider is real. Interesting. I trust you are removing him? I'd hate to see him come to harm.;
Bah! Save your threats, I'm sick of the forest. And I'm not too fond of what happened here. I'll take the ride.;NM23ADCHUU01103_.mp3
Yes, better that he leave. It's hard to blame the Shadowlands for missing Wookiees when he lives down there.;
Will I be rewarded for my efforts?;
I will see to it that you are given what you deserve. Finish with your questions and we will settle our accounts.;
Oh, that's just great! Everyone is here now! It's a reunion!;
Yes, son. By the blade of Bacca's sword, I've come to end your treachery! No more will you sell your own people!;
You have Bacca's blade? So what! I have the hilt, held by each true Chieftain in recent memory! Even you claimed it was all-important!;
We both have our ancient trinkets, so who will the people follow now? You? You are old and weak!;
Shut up! Both of you! This ends today! I... I will not see Rwookrrorro suffer any more!;
You tell them, Zaalbar!;
I... I don't know what to do, <FirstName>. Chuundar has been telling me things... he makes sense... I think. I don't know.;
Side with Chuundar. He has the power here!;
Are you sure?;
"Yes! Freyyr abandoned you! ""Sorry"" doesn't make it better!";
Then... then we must go a new way. I'm sorry father. Your time has passed.;
Damn right it has! Lay down and die, old man!;
I... guess he *did* toss you out on your ear, Big Z. What kind of father is that?;NM23ADCHUU01139_.mp3
I will fight to the last! For Kashyyyk! For... the lost honor of my sons!;
*That* is your advice? Side with the slaver? Fine, fine... it's your call.;NM23ADCHUU01137_.mp3
Are you sure this is wise? To support a slaver feels... wrong.;NM23ADCHUU01141_.mp3
Are you going to second-guess everyone?;NM23ADCHUU01143_.mp3
Of course not. Only the idiots around me.;NM23ADCHUU01145_.mp3
I heard that.;
Heh, now this is going to hurt some...;NM23ADCHUU01147_.mp3
No, it's better to side with your father!;
Is it the best course?;
Without doubt! Chuundar is a slaver!;
Then there is no other way. Chuundar! You have betrayed our people! You must pay!;
Woo-hoo! Way to go, Big Z!;NM23ADCHUU01172_.mp3
That's my boy!;
You're too weak to fight, old wook, and I still have Czerka support! We'll see who dies today!;
No, siding with your brother would be better.;
Do you have to fight? Talk it through!;
Could we work together? It would be difficult...;
Convince them! Avoid this needless slaughter!;
Then so be it! The fighting stops here! I will not have our world destroyed beneath you two!;
Alright! Way to go, Big Z!;NM23ADCHUU01161_.mp3
Perhaps there is hope. What say you, Chuundar?;
What do I say? I still have Czerka support. I say you will die! Attack!;
I don't care! Just get on with it!;
Wait... isn't that my line?;NM23ADCHUU01168_.mp3
Side with Freyyr. He is the honorable one!;
Quiet down. We'll use this to our advantage.;
Do none of you hairy heaps ever shut up?;
W-what?;
For not being able to speak Basic, you all sure yap a lot.;
This is important! If you have advice, say it now.;
Nothing. How do you want to proceed, Zaalbar?;
Step forward and address mighty and wise Chuundar, outsider. I don't often allow visitors of your kind.;
You are flanked by Czerka slavers! Are they not outsiders? Or have you sold all of Kashyyyk to them!;
Ah, brother Zaalbar. You've been exiled a long time. You shouldn't speak in that tone. Things are different now.;
You are a mad-claw without honor. You have no voice among your own people. I, on the other hand, am Chieftain.;
If you've made deals with slavers, the truth will get out eventually.;
You may talk, but no one will believe you. I've had a long time to guide what my people think.;
They trust me, the mighty Chuundar. Even with my brother insane and father enslaved, I rose to protect my people despite it all.;
"Father was enslaved? ""Mighty Chuundar?"" What are you talking about? You were the runt!";
I am no runt! *ahem* Like I said, Zaalbar, a lot has changed in your years away. We will discuss this soon enough.;
What do you want? Why drag us here?;
I haven't killed Zaalbar because he is my brother, and I hoped he and I could come to an agreement. You are irrelevant.;
I may be able to put you to use on a menial task. Zaalbar will have to stay here, of course.;
What is this task?;
A simple thing. Another Wookiee has suffered the same fate as Zaalbar, gone mad and been exiled. He now lurks the Shadowlands.;
More importantly, he's pestering my Czerka allies during their Shadowland expeditions. It is not good for business.;
He's standing against you. The first of many, perhaps?;
No one will follow a mad-claw. He is merely a nuisance. Besides, he cowers in the Shadowlands. My people know nothing of him.;
I won't do this. Do your own dirty work.;
You don't have much choice. You can flee the planet if you want, but I am keeping Zaalbar here with me.;
He'll stay until the mad-claw is dead. The Czerka would never let me hold you, but they don't care what I do with fellow Wookiees.;
You can't do that! He can't do that, can he? He can't hold Zaalbar prisoner just because he's Chieftain, can he?;NM23ADCHUU01220_.mp3
Keeping Zaalbar makes this proposition even worse.;
What made you think I wanted this to be easy for you? Besides, you won't need him. My people are trained to understand you.;
I tell them it's to better understand the enemy. They think it will make the Czerka easier to fight. Actually it makes them easier to obey.;
Remember, you can't beat me here. No one would dare oppose me to join with an outsider or an exile.;
You are wrong, brother. Someone would.;
Who are you talking about, Zaalbar?;
Do you speak of Freyyr, our father? Why? He was the one that ordered you exiled when you attacked me.;
He went as mad as you when he finally discovered the slavers. He dared challenge them alone and has not been seen since.;
That was years ago. Let him go, Zaalbar. I rule now. I'll take the Wookiees forward, but there are prices to pay.;
He makes sense, Zaalbar. Perhaps you should listen to him.;
No more words, outsider. I've given my orders. I can't hold you here, but Zaalbar will stay until you kill the mad-claw in the Shadowlands.;
Don't worry, buddy, we'll get you out of here. You can count on us!;NM23ADCHUU01246_.mp3
The guards will let you pass now. Leave the village through the northwest and follow the platform to the south and then east.;
You'll eventually see where Gorwooken waits for you. He'll lower you to the forest floor. Go.;
Then I suppose we have little choice. We should proceed with caution, however.;NM23ADCHUU01248_.mp3
I don't like leaving someone behind, but I guess we don't have a choice.;NM23ADCHUU01250_.mp3
It is wrong to leave him imprisoned here. We should seek some way to free him when we have the chance.;NM23ADCHUU01252_.mp3
Query: Shall I begin blasting, master? We could have your hirsute companion free in no time.;NM23ADCHUU01254_.mp3
Not yet, HK.;
Let's go kill something and get the Wookiee out.;NM23ADCHUU01256_.mp3
Don't listen, Zaalbar. It's not worth it.;
Play along, Zaalbar. I will see what I can do.;
Yeah Zaalbar, you and me!;
No outsider, Zaalbar is referring to Freyyr, our father. Why, Zaalbar? He ordered you exiled when you attacked me.;
You see, Chuundar, there *is* someone. Uh... make it good, Zaalbar.;
You are too quick to celebrate. Zaalbar talks of Freyyr, our father. Why, Zaalbar? He ordered you exiled when you attacked me.;
I need Zaalbar with me as a guide.;
No, you won't need him to find your way. Over the years I have had my people trained to understand galactic Basic.;
I'll consider what you've said. I'll go now.;
I'll allow you access to the Shadowlands. You will track and kill this insane Wookiee, and maybe then you will earn my favor.;
Zaalbar stays here to ensure your loyalty. The Czerka would never let me hold you, but they don't care what I do with fellow Wookiees.;
You're a fool. You're making the job harder.;
I want to ask about the Shadowlands.;
We only enter the Shadowlands for ritual hunting. I'd leave the troublemaker down there but he has proven too good at surviving.;
He has managed to linger a number of years, cowering in his madness and shame. You are expendable. You will remove him.;
I'm only interested in what I'm looking for. A Star Map.;
I don't know anything about something like that, and I don't care. Your concerns are nothing to me.;
What happened with you and Zaalbar? Give me your version.;
Zaalbar didn't tell you? He took offense to my trading a few of our people for favors and weapons.;
I didn't understand his objection. Imagine the destruction if Czerka Corporation had come in with blasters firing. I saved many lives.;
Of course, I also gained weapons, and arranged for certain rivals to be taken. I protected my allies, and my power grew.;
Which explains why the Wookiees in this room haven't killed you.;
Each has come to understand the benefit of working with the enemy. Unlike your exiled companion.;
Young Zaalbar had no foresight. He couldn't control his outrage. He attacked me with his claws and damned himself doing it.;
A few careful stories and everyone called him mad-claw. Even father Freyyr. I easily had him exiled.;
You've a complete lack of remorse for your actions. Like a big hairy Hutt.;
I've heard of these Hutt creatures. They sound like smart traders. They would understand what your exiled companion could not.;
I would not abandon Zaalbar to you.;
It isn't your choice, <FirstName>. I already have him. I have a personal matter to discuss with him. You have other duties.;
Is there a point to this? If this will only lead to a fight, I'd like to get to it.;
There will be no fight. You wouldn't survive. The village believes in me. They would rise to kill you.;
I also have the protection of Czerka Corporation guards as well. No, you have no chance while I am unopposed.;
A nice nest of lies you have constructed.;
Ignore him, Chuundar. You are dealing with me now.;
You are mistaken about your worth. You have no leverage here. I have made certain that my people only listen to me.;
And I am Darth Revan! You will listen to me, Chuundar.;
You expect me to believe that, <FullName>? Even here on Kashyyyk we have heard the tale of how the Lord of the Sith was killed by the Jedi.;
[Persuade] I wasn't killed, I was only captured. Now Revan has returned - and you don't want to get on my bad side!;
[Success] There is something strange about you... a darkness I can smell in your scent. Maybe you are one of the Sith. Maybe you are even Darth Revan, as you claim.;
But what do I care about Sith and Jedi? Czerka are the only outsiders here on Kashyyyk. And the mighty Chuundar does not bow down, even to them!;
You are mistaken about your worth, Revan. You have no leverage here. I have all the power, and I have made certain that my people only listen to me.;
Big Z! What are you doing here? What's going on?;NM23ADCHUU01299_.mp3
As you can see, <FullName>, I have brought Zaalbar from your ship. Don't worry, Janos was very helpful. There was no damage done... yet.;
What are you talking about? How do you know me?;
Did you think you could walk the upper boughs of Kashyyyk and not be observed? I've had climbers watching you, and your ship.;
Janos allowed it? You must work closely with him.;
You work alongside the slavers. You are no better than they are!;
You had no right to enter my ship!;
You have learned from the slavers. Learned to take what you want.;
Why did you think you had to do this behind my back?;
He has become like the slavers. He takes without care.;
I thought Zaalbar's presence might cause problems.;
It has, but you couldn't hide him. Your ship carries his scent, his hair. My climbers found him quickly. Others have been watching you.;
I demand an explanation! You don't want me to get angry!;
You need to realize your situation. I've had climbers watching you since you landed. Taking Zaalbar was easy.;
Well, my mercenary returns. My climbers tell me you did well, <FullName>, although they couldn't follow you the whole time.;
Chuundar told me who the mad-claw was. Have you done it then? Have you... killed my father?;
Freyyr was your father? I didn't know that.;
I avoided his name when I sent you after him, but the pompous old wook must have said something!;
You're an inattentive fool if you truly didn't know, but it doesn't matter. Zaalbar has begun to see my side of things.;
I've been reminded of how Freyyr cast me out. I see how easily he has been disposed of, himself. We are stronger without him. Chuundar's way is better.;
Of course it is. I will make our people strong with outsider weapons and influence. And for you, I shall see that your status is restored... in due time.;
Yes. It had to be done. Move forward.;
So you did it for Zaalbar's well-being? It's possible, but it doesn't matter. Zaalbar has begun to see my side of things.;
I butchered him. Is there a problem?;
Not with me, and I doubt Zaalbar will give you any trouble for it. He's coming around to my way of thinking.;
I wasn't offered much alternative.;
That is true. I would have killed you. Besides, the old wook's time is done. Zaalbar has begun to see my side of things.;
Those Vulkars are dumber than a Coruscant granite slug! They actually think being in that pathetic little gang of theirs makes them important.;NM03AACAND07000_.mp3
Gadon keeps his hidden Beks in line, but Brejik's getting dreams of grandeur. If Davik's smart, he'll slap that young punk back down.;NM03AACAND07002_.mp3
Who are you?;
I'm someone you don't want to get on the bad side of, and I'm not one for small talk.;NM03AACAND07004_.mp3
Besides, you know the arrangement. You Sith don't interfere with Davik's business and you all get a nice cut of his action.;NM03AACAND07006_.mp3
I don't have time to stick around here, anyway. Davik's got me working on a special assignment.;NM03AACAND07012_.mp3
I need to ask you some questions.;
Sorry, but I don't usually volunteer information to anyone who just asks.;NM03AACAND07009_.mp3
I'll be going now.;
[Bastila isn't in the mood to talk right now - not with enemies so close by.];
You will have to disable the energy shield around this temple before we can leave. There is a computer here on the Temple summit that has access to the power generators.;NM44ACEXIT03000_.mp3
You can also use it to disable the disruptor field that protects the Star Forge. Otherwise, the Ebon Hawk will not be able to leave the planet without crashing.;NM44ACEXIT03001_.mp3
With each passing moment your old apprentice becomes stronger, Master. We must act quickly to exact your vengeance. Malak will pay for stealing the mantle of Dark Lord from you!;NM45AABAST06902_.mp3
If you have questions, you should direct them towards the Jedi Council members.;NM13AABAST04000_.mp3
The Star Forge is under assault from the entire Republic fleet! If I don't use my Battle Meditation to turn the tide, Admiral Dodonna's capital ships will destroy the Star Forge.;NM45AABAST01166_.mp3
I have to stay here in the command center so that I can best use my Battle Meditation against our enemy. If I don't the Star Forge will be lost!;NM45AABAST01167_.mp3
You must go to face Malak without me. Find him, kill him and reclaim the title of Dark Lord of the Sith!;NM45AABAST01168_.mp3
I know we have not spoken often during our time together, despite my best efforts. And to this point I have respected your privacy. But there is something we must discuss.;NM35AABAST06000_.mp3
Fine. What is it?;
You must prepare yourself for when we face Malak. The confrontation will be difficult for you. I remember how hard it was when I first faced Revan.;NM35AABAST06310_.mp3
Is it true you killed Darth Revan?;
It's true that, due to my Battle Meditation, I was with the Jedi strike team that boarded Revan's ship. We did not kill Revan, however.;NM35AABAST06294_.mp3
That's not what I heard.;
Our mission was to capture Revan, if possible. It was Malak who turned on his own master, firing upon Revan's ship while we were still on board it.;NM35AABAST06296_.mp3
It was his desire to kill us and his master both. Thankfully we narrowly escaped the vessel as it exploded.;NM35AABAST06297_.mp3
So Malak did your job for you.;
As I said, we were there to capture Revan alive. The Jedi do not believe in killing their prisoners. No one deserves execution, no matter what their crimes.;NM35AABAST06299_.mp3
Remember that Revan and Malak were once great Jedi. Heroes in every sense of the word. They demonstrate the danger of the dark side to us all.;NM35AABAST06300_.mp3
I'm sorry. We really shouldn't speak of this anymore. The memory of my confrontation with Revan is... painful. Let's return to the mission, please.;NM35AABAST06301_.mp3
What else did you expect from the Sith?;
True, I suppose. And yet the outcome of that battle was... unexpected. To all of us. Revan's end was... unforeseen.;NM35AABAST06303_.mp3
But you would have killed Revan eventually, right?;
But killing Revan is what you're famous for.;
So who killed Revan, then?;
Oh, great. I never get tired of hearing how you killed Darth Revan.;
Not now, Bastila.;
"No, this cannot wait any longer. You have no understanding of what we are going up against; I will not allow you to go in unprepared!";NM35AABAST06003_.mp3
I don't want to talk to you! Can't you take a hint?;
"I feel the end of our quest is near. Soon we will discover the location of the Star Forge; though what will happen next is... uncertain.";NM35AABAST06005_.mp3
I've been watching you. I've seen how you have resisted great temptations and continue to walk the path of the light side. Very commendable.;NM35AABAST06006_.mp3
I couldn't have done it without your help.;
My role in what you will become is a small one. I can only give you the warnings taught to me by my own master, ultimately it is your own actions that will decide your fate.;NM35AABAST06008_.mp3
And that is why the dark side is so insidious. If you are not careful, you do not even see each small step you take towards it until it is too late.;NM35AABAST06391_.mp3
"It is so easy to think that we would never fall prey to such a horror; that we have unlimited control, vigilance and foresight. If only that were true.";NM35AABAST06392_.mp3
The Sith have become powerful because there are many Jedi who have succumbed to the lure of the dark side and joined their cause.;NM35AABAST06393_.mp3
What greater weapon is there than to turn an enemy to your cause? To use their own knowledge against them?;NM35AABAST06394_.mp3
We are weakened while they are strengthened. So we must harden our hearts and do whatever is required to fight against the dark side. Even when the battle becomes wearying.;NM35AABAST06395_.mp3
Do whatever is required? Such as?;
I don't know. The vision of our future is clouded by shadows cast from the dark side. But I sense something ominous lurking in those shadows.;NM35AABAST06397_.mp3
But words alone cannot save one from the dark side. Come, we should continue with the task at hand. When the time comes I only hope we are all strong enough to do what we must.;NM35AABAST06398_.mp3
Must we keep discussing this?;
No, I suppose not. I have spoken more than enough of the dark side. It is up to you whether you heed my words or not.;NM35AABAST06400_.mp3
Don't worry. The dark side has no sway over me.;
The path of the light is a difficult one to walk. We might not even see the shadows until we are surrounded and can never find our way back.;NM35AABAST06010_.mp3
I've been watching you. I've seen you give in to temptation and indulge your baser emotions on many occassions. I'm afraid you are on the path that leads to the dark side.;NM35AABAST06011_.mp3
I don't need a lecture from you. Not now, not ever.;
I'm sorry, Bastila. I will try to do better.;
[Bastila seems to have something on her mind. Perhaps you should talk to her about it.];
[Speak to Bastila.];
How can I help?;NM35AABAST06014_.mp3
Do you want to talk?;
About my mother? I am unsure. I seem to find it difficult to remain objective when it comes to her. I find that... disturbing.;NM35AABAST06016_.mp3
You don't think we should look for the holocron?;
We have more important things to do. Still... my father is dead. Just because we find the holocron doesn't mean I have to give it to her.;NM35AABAST06018_.mp3
Why do you think she wants it so badly?;
Father recorded all his personal thoughts in that holocron even when I knew him. Having it would be like having him with you.;NM35AABAST06020_.mp3
I don't see why she deserves it, however. She drove him to his death. I loved him... and I didn't even have a chance to say goodbye.;NM35AABAST06021_.mp3
You'd keep it for yourself?;
I don't know. Part of me would keep it just so she didn't get it. I don't like that part of me.;NM35AABAST06023_.mp3
I would have thought my Jedi training would have put me past this kind of pettiness. I wish... I really don't want to think about this.;NM35AABAST06024_.mp3
Please, let's just keep going.;NM35AABAST06025_.mp3
That sounds a bit selfish.;
It does, doesn't it? I can't seem to help myself.;NM35AABAST06027_.mp3
Maybe you're right.;
Yes... maybe. I don't feel good about it, still.;NM35AABAST06029_.mp3
Are you going to give the holocron to her?;
Do you think I should?;NM35AABAST06031_.mp3
You might want to consider it.;
That would just lead into another argument. How I always despised talking to her.;NM35AABAST06033_.mp3
I'll think about it. I should... try and remember my training. I should be able to let go of this, but I can't.;NM35AABAST06038_.mp3
I don't want to talk about this any more. Let's... keep going.;NM35AABAST06045_.mp3
Do you need it more than she does?;
I would like to keep something to remember Father as much as she would.;NM35AABAST06035_.mp3
Probably not. She doesn't deserve it.;
I find myself agreeing with you, but I don't like how that feels.;NM35AABAST06037_.mp3
Why didn't you ask about her sickness?;
I have my doubts as to whether she's actually sick.;NM35AABAST06040_.mp3
Why would she lie about it?;
Mother used to lie about many things to get her way. She is a selfish woman who pushed my father into doing what she wished.;NM35AABAST06042_.mp3
You sound bitter.;
Yes, I... thought I had let go of that anger. All my training, and it comes back so quickly...;NM35AABAST06044_.mp3
She certainly seemed to upset you.;
I told you that my mother and I never got along. Obviously that has not changed.;NM35AABAST06047_.mp3
And now Father is dead. That... leaves a hurt inside, you just can't imagine. I haven't seen him in so long...;NM35AABAST06048_.mp3
I don't think we have time to go searching for anything.;
You're probably right. There are more important things to do. Mother can wait.;NM35AABAST06050_.mp3
Never mind.;
Then I suggest we move on.;NM35AABAST06616_.mp3
Can you show me one of the visions again?;
I can try. What would you like me to recall?;NM35AABAST06069_.mp3
The vision we had on Korriban.;
I shall do my best. Calm your mind and remember...;NM35AABAST06071_.mp3
The vision we had on Manaan.;
The vision we had on Kashyyyk.;
The vision we had on Tatooine.;
Do you know anything about this place?;
The surface of Taris is covered with an urban skyscrape. Its glittering spires belie the decay that lies in its lower reaches, however.;NM35AABAST06058_.mp3
Beyond that, there is little else I can tell you.;NM35AABAST06059_.mp3
You want to talk to me about something?;
I would like to know what happened after you crashed on Taris. I'm curious as to what you and Carth were doing before we all joined forces.;NM35AABAST06135_.mp3
Before we rescued you, you mean.;
I managed to free myself, as I recall. In fact, if I hadn't been there Brejik and his thugs might have killed you in that fight. It's probably more accurate to say that I rescued you.;NM35AABAST06137_.mp3
Can't you just admit that you were rescued?;
I'll admit that I probably wouldn't have been able to free myself if not for the brawl after the swoop race. I guess I should thank you for that, at least.;NM35AABAST06139_.mp3
Actually, your presence at the swoop track is what I'm curious about. It couldn't have been an easy task to find me there. Yet somehow you managed.;NGLOBEBAST06772_.mp3
You also avoided detection by the Sith, discovered I was a Vulkar prisoner, gained sponsorship for the race and became the Taris swoop champion. That's quite a resume.;NGLOBEBAST06773_.mp3
And rescued the damsel in distress. Don't forget that.;
Yes... well. I hardly consider myself a damsel in distress. I'm a member of the Jedi Order, after all. But I won't deny you've impressed me with what you've done.;NM35AABAST06148_.mp3
When you were chosen to join this mission, I doubt any of us expected this much from you. A Jedi could have done such things, of course. But only by drawing heavily upon the Force.;NM35AABAST06153_.mp3
Are you trying to say I can control the Force?;
The Force is in all of us, though for most people it is a barely measurable whisper. But there are some individuals outside the Jedi Order that we considered 'Force Sensitive'.;NGLOBEBAST06775_.mp3
It is obvious to me that the Force has been working through you. There is no other explanation for your great success, though I am not certain what to make of this discovery.;NGLOBEBAST06776_.mp3
Perhaps if you weren't - well, if you were younger the Jedi might take you for training. But as it is...;NGLOBEBAST06777_.mp3
What are you trying to say?;
"I'm sorry; I've overstepped my authority. I'm speaking of things that are best left to the Jedi Council. For now let's just accept the fact that you are... gifted.";NGLOBEBAST06779_.mp3
Hopefully between your abilities, my Jedi training and the skills of our companions we can find a way off this planet.;NGLOBEBAST06780_.mp3
Be glad I'm Force sensitive, or I couldn't have rescued you.;
Ah, yes, the rescue again. Very well. For what it's worth, I conceed the point to you: you rescued me from Brejik. And yet we're still stuck on here on Taris.;NGLOBEBAST06782_.mp3
I don't want to talk about this anymore.;
I think you're underestimating us non-Jedi.;
Perhaps. But the Force works through all of us to some degree or another. There are some individuals outside the Jedi Order that we considered 'Force Sensitive'.;NGLOBEBAST06785_.mp3
What can I say? I'm a talented individual.;
"Yes, I can see you do not lack in ability; although modesty is another matter.";NGLOBEBAST06787_.mp3
I had a lot of help: Carth, Mission, Zaalbar.;
Your modesty is admirable. But though others helped, you were the catalyst for these events.;NGLOBEBAST06789_.mp3
You didn't escape the Black Vulkars until we arrived, as I recall.;
We were looking for you.;
"Yes, I realize that of course. But surely there was more to it than a simple search. I doubt there were flashing signs pointing you in my direction; yet somehow you found me.";NM35AABAST06146_.mp3
You look like something's bothering you.;
No, not bothering me. Not exactly. I've been thinking about what the Jedi Council said about the two of us.;NM35AABAST06183_.mp3
There is a bond between us, I do not dispute that. I can feel it, as I'm sure you can. The nature of that bond and its effect on our mission remain in question.;NM35AABAST06184_.mp3
I think you're interested in more than just the 'bond' between us.;
Please! I'm a Jedi. Such feelings, such attractions, are... well, they're beneath me, quite frankly.;NGLOBEBAST06791_.mp3
I admit, I find you intriguing. Uh... I mean, I find your command of the Force intriguing. But my interest in you is purely academic. Surely you can understand why.;NGLOBEBAST06792_.mp3
"Our fates are strongly connected; so connected that a literal bond has been forged between us.";NM35AABAST06190_.mp3
I saw your service records when you were transferred aboard the Endar Spire, but nothing beyond that. I know very little about you. I'd like to ask you some questions, given our relationship.;NM35AABAST06191_.mp3
Our relationship? Is this some kind of clumsy come-on?;
"I was referring to the bond we share; the one the Jedi Council spoke of. If I actually was interested in you, rest assured I could come up with a better approach than this!";NM35AABAST06193_.mp3
Whoa, guess I touched a nerve there, huh?;
Touched a nerve, no. Getting on my nerves, most definitely. I suppose this is what you men consider being witty. *sigh*;NGLOBEBAST06793_.mp3
Now, are you going to answer my questions? Or would you rather just keep annoying me?;NGLOBEBAST06794_.mp3
Okay, I'll answer a few questions.;
Don't worry, these are simple questions. Nothing too intrusive. First, what kind of background do you have?;NGLOBEBAST06797_.mp3
I was a smuggler before I joined the fleet.;
Good. On which planet were you born?;NM35AABAST06211_.mp3
Deralia. It's in a remote system. Why?;
Excellent. Your current age is?;NM35AABAST06213_.mp3
Wasn't all this in my service records?;
"Yes, well... The truth is I was studying *how* you responded to my questions. Your reactions help me judge you; this was a test for me to learn more about your character.";NM35AABAST06215_.mp3
And what did you find out?;
You were honest, which is good. And you treated this as a serious matter, which it is. This bond we share will shape both our destinies, it is not to be taken lightly.;NM35AABAST06217_.mp3
But I imagine you've had enough questions for a while. So many things have happened to you since Taris. It's probably a lot for you to absorb.;NGLOBEBAST06798_.mp3
We can speak again later, after you've had time to think about all this.;NGLOBEBAST06799_.mp3
I don't like being manipulated!;
I see. I didn't mean to upset you, but I suppose it was inevitable. You've had a lot to absorb since we escaped Taris. I apologize.;NM35AABAST06229_.mp3
3,012. Healthy living, you know.;
I see you intend to be childish about this. I guess I won't get anywhere continuing our discussion right now, will I?;NM35AABAST06224_.mp3
I suppose I'll just have to speak to you again later. Hopefully you'll behave a little less like a little boy and a little more like a... like a man!;NGLOBEBAST06801_.mp3
I suppose I'll just have to speak to you again later. Hopefully you'll be a little more... mature.;NGLOBEBAST06802_.mp3
I'm sick of answering questions!;
Kashyyyk. I'm a Wookiee... can't you tell?;
I was a scout. The fleet recruited me for my skills.;
Nothing extravagant. I'm a soldier.;
I'm a Hutt in human form plotting to overthrow the Republic.;
Uh... the second one.;
Forget it. I'm not interested.;
Why would you refuse to answer? These are simple questions, nothing too intrusive. First, what kind of background do you have?;NM35AABAST06226_.mp3
Doesn't the bond mean my presence is necessary?;
Necessary, perhaps, but it is no guarantee of our success. I admit, I'm a little disturbed that such a bond could be possible in the first place.;NM35AABAST06186_.mp3
I don't believe in this 'bond', regardless of what the Jedi Council said.;
Deny it if you will, but there is a connection between us. I understand why you would find this disturbing. I have my own reservations about it, to be honest.;NM35AABAST06188_.mp3
I still don't understand this bond of ours.;
You have something you want to ask me?;
I do. How did you know?;NM35AABAST06232_.mp3
Well... your face is all scrunched up like a kinrath pup.;
A... a kinrath pup?! It most certainly is not!;NM35AABAST06234_.mp3
I am a Jedi, remember? I have far too much mental discipline to reveal what goes on inside my mind with such obvious physical clues.;NM35AABAST06235_.mp3
My thoughts remain hidden, including whatever my feelings are for you. Uh... I mean whatever I feel *about* you... uh... I mean whatever I *think* about you.;NGLOBEBAST06803_.mp3
You're so cute when you're embarrassed.;
"I... that is, you... Why must you be so impossibly infuriating?! You know very well what I'm really talking about. I'm referring to the bond between us; the one the Jedi Council spoke of.";NGLOBEBAST06805_.mp3
Our connection allows us glimpses into each other's mind. We can feel some of what the other feels. And what I feel within you troubles me.;NM35AABAST06237_.mp3
A Padawan must receive considerable training. They must learn to control their emotions and darker impulses. Often it takes years before using the Force can be considered safe.;NM35AABAST06238_.mp3
The fact that you are so strong in the Force and have had such relatively little training could have terrible consequences. For you, and for everyone around you.;NM35AABAST06239_.mp3
What do you think I should do?;
I don't think there is much you can do. If things were different I would recommend several years of training under one of the Jedi Masters. But I fear that won't be possible.;NM35AABAST06245_.mp3
Already you exhibit the kind of willfullness, erratic behavior and lack of compassion that will lead you to corruption.;NM35AABAST06246_.mp3
We must all resist the influence of the dark side! It is everything we are fighting against! This is doubly important for you, with your natural affinity for the Force!;NM35AABAST06248_.mp3
I will try.;
That is good to hear. Without the proper training, however, I'm afraid you will find the path difficult even with the best of intentions. There is great danger ahead, for both of us.;NM35AABAST06254_.mp3
Our destinies are intertwined. Everything one of us does will have consequences for the other. Any reckless behavior on your part is likely to affect me as well.;NM35AABAST06255_.mp3
I won't do anything to hurt you.;
I believe you truly mean what you say. For now. But sometimes it is not so easy to keep such promises.;NM35AABAST06261_.mp3
Your power could be a gift or a curse. When you need guidance, or advice, or support I will do my best to help you stay on the path of the light.;NM35AABAST06262_.mp3
I would appreciate any help you could offer.;
I only hope I will have the wisdom to help you through the dark times. But for now, we should return to our mission.;NGLOBEBAST06808_.mp3
I doubt I'll be a risk to the mission.;
No, of course not. Not yet. But there will be challenges ahead that might make it otherwise.;NM35AABAST06266_.mp3
I don't need your help.;
It works both ways, doesn't it? You could help me stay strong.;
Yes, that is true. I will do my best to guide you, but I am no Master. Not yet. And there are times when I find the sheer strength of your power almost overwhelming.;NM35AABAST06259_.mp3
So you're just worried about yourself, then.;
That's not true. I am worried about myself, but also about you. I would rather see neither of us come to any harm.;NM35AABAST06257_.mp3
Why are you getting so upset?;
I'm sorry if I come across as harsh. But I am concerned. For you, for our mission. And for myself, as well.;NM35AABAST06250_.mp3
I don't need you harassing me, thanks.;
I am not trying to harass you. But you must understand the trials and perils that lie ahead. For you, and for me.;NM35AABAST06252_.mp3
Thankfully you have exhibited a degree of compassion and self-control up to this point. I sincerely hope you can maintain these traits in the future.;NM35AABAST06247_.mp3
I don't think mastering my emotions is necessary.;
No? Self-control is a maxim for all Jedi. It is what gives us the strength to resist the dark side. All who have fallen from our Order have shown a flagrant disregard for such control.;NM35AABAST06243_.mp3
You could warn me when I do something bad. Blink once for dark side, twice for light.;
This is not a joke! The choices you make could affect both our destinies, not to mention the fate of the Republic and the entire galaxy! There is much at stake.;NM35AABAST06241_.mp3
You have feelings for me?;
An amusing description, but hardly the truth. We both know the real reason you have some idea of what I am thinking: the bond we share.;NGLOBEBAST06807_.mp3
What do you mean?;
Maybe.;
No, I doubt it.;
Why do you still try to deny the existence of this bond between us? Like it or not, we are linked... as our shared vision of the Star Map proved.;NM35AABAST06268_.mp3
Well, you keep staring at me. See anything you like?;
You are easily the vainest, most arrogant man I have ever met! Besides, I know you can't be serious, since I was purposefully *not* staring in your direction.;NGLOBEBAST06810_.mp3
Educated guess, from the way you keep staring.;
I am a Jedi. I am far too disciplined to betray my emotions with outward physical displays. We both know the real reason you have some idea of what I am thinking: the bond we share.;NM35AABAST06272_.mp3
You wanted to speak to me?;
Yes, I did. I wanted to speak to you about our mission. About what lies ahead for us. It seems fate, or the Force, is driving us into a confrontation with the Dark Lord.;NM35AABAST06276_.mp3
I'd like to know more about you, Bastila.;
Yes, I suppose I can understand your curiosity, given the bond that connects us. Very well, I'll tell you a bit about myself.;NM35AABAST06315_.mp3
Tell me how you joined the Jedi, then.;
I was found to be strong with the Force at a young age, as most Padawans are. As a girl I was given to the Order to be trained.;NM35AABAST06317_.mp3
When I joined the Order I left my family on Talravin, as all Padawans do. My family is still there, the last that I heard. I have had little contact with them, as it is discouraged.;NM35AABAST06318_.mp3
Discouraged? Why?;
Relationships with family members are fraught with powerful emotions. Such extremes are to be avoided. Anger and hate are the worst, but even love can lead to folly.;NM35AABAST06320_.mp3
You aren't allowed to love?;
Emotional entanglements can be dangerous. They can impair rational thought, they can lead to outbursts of uncontrolled emotion. A Jedi must be above such things.;NM35AABAST06322_.mp3
You don't sound very convinced.;
It can be a hard lesson to learn. I was not on good terms with all of my family, but I do remember missing my father terribly for a very long time.;NM35AABAST06339_.mp3
Who weren't you on good terms with?;
I was not on good terms with my mother. I was only a little girl when I left, but I was old enough to resent her and the way she treated my father.;NM35AABAST06341_.mp3
She pushed my father into treasure hunting. I spent all my young life on ships traveling from one false lead to the next.;NM35AABAST06342_.mp3
She whittled away my father's entire fortune, and I hated her for it. I think she was relieved to give me to the Jedi, but my father was heartbroken.;NM35AABAST06343_.mp3
You never tried to get in touch with your father again?;
A child is too young to understand the sacrifices that must be made. It is better if they have no contact with their family once they are removed.;NM35AABAST06348_.mp3
Once I was older I realized the wisdom of this policy. A Jedi must do what is needed, personal desires notwithstanding. Love can only obscure and confuse the matter.;NM35AABAST06350_.mp3
You sound very sad when you say that.;
Even a Jedi cannot always control the feelings of the heart. We must do our best to guard against it, no matter what the cost. But some sacrifices are harder than others.;NM35AABAST06355_.mp3
I... I do not wish to discuss this anymore. I would rather return to our mission.;NM35AABAST06353_.mp3
Are you saying you no longer feel love?;
But if a Jedi were to love, surely it wouldn't be all bad.;
I don't need to hear the family history, thanks.;
You were the one who asked to know more about me! Very well, if you have changed your mind then I suppose we should just get back to our mission.;NM35AABAST06347_.mp3
You and your father were close?;
Very close. I was only a little girl when I left my family, but I still remember him fondly. He was kind and gentle and doted on me. My mother, however, was different.;NM35AABAST06345_.mp3
Don't you miss your family at all?;
Like all who join the Order, I have learned to embrace the life I have chosen. I had to let go of my attachments to my family.;NM35AABAST06337_.mp3
That must have been difficult.;
That sounds idiotic. I would never agree to that.;
The gift of the Force comes with a high cost. Sacrifice of one's emotional attachments is one of the prices a Jedi must be willing to pay. The alternative is to fall prey to the dark side.;NM35AABAST06325_.mp3
And what's so wrong with that?;
Please, you mustn't say things like that. The dark side is destruction and chaos, the opposite of all that gives the universe order and purpose. You have to understand this.;NM35AABAST06327_.mp3
You need to lighten up.;
And you need to be more mindful of your responsibilities! Have you any idea of the danger a fallen Jedi represents? Not only to yourself, but to others as well?;NM35AABAST06329_.mp3
It just seems wrong not to be allowed to love.;
Sounds like you're the one afraid of falling.;
That is something every Jedi should be afraid of.;NM35AABAST06331_.mp3
I don't see how falling in love could lead to the dark side, though.;
Spare me the lecture. I'm not in the mood.;
A lecture won't be much use if you aren't prepared to listen. I suppose it would be best if we didn't speak about this for a while. Let's just return to our mission for now.;NGLOBEBAST06813_.mp3
Why wouldn't you be allowed to love?;
So the Jedi separates children from their families?;
You wish to talk to me?;
I do. I've been watching you. Studying you closely to see what kind of progress you have made since your training at the hands of Master Zhar.;NM35AABAST06365_.mp3
I think we both know the real reason you've been watching me.;
You never give up, do you? I admit I'm interested in you. I find you intriguing. Compelling, even. But it's not what you think.;NGLOBEBAST06815_.mp3
You have a great gift. You have an awesome command of the Force, and I tremble when I think of how you might misuse it.;NGLOBEBAST06816_.mp3
I make you tremble? Do you get all tingly inside, too?;
"What? I... no! No, of course not! Not like that, anyway. In many ways you are... you are dangerous. You could be the savior of the galaxy; or you could bring untold destruction upon us all.";NGLOBEBAST06818_.mp3
I've seen how you have resisted many temptations and continue to walk the path of the light side. Very commendable, but I'm afraid you might stray from this path.;NM35AABAST06367_.mp3
You need to see what the dark side represents in its entirety, for it is what we battle. Only the wisdom of a Jedi Master can truly explain this, but I will do my best to make you understand.;NM35AABAST06375_.mp3
What are you trying to tell me?;
The dark side is not simply giving in to anger or temptation to use the Force to destructive ends. These things only lead to the dark side.;NM35AABAST06376_.mp3
The dark side grows stronger and more insidious the closer you draw to it. It begs you to surrender to it, to release all its terrible power... and it becomes harder and harder to resist.;NM35AABAST06377_.mp3
And once you stop resisting, it is too late. It twists you up inside and... and turns you into a mockery of everything you once stood for.;NM35AABAST06378_.mp3
You seem to know that temptation very well.;
I am no less resistant to temptation than any other. I simply have the benefit of training that you do not. But even the training of the Jedi might not be enough to save us.;NM35AABAST06380_.mp3
We need only to look at the atrocities which have been committed by those under its sway to understand the terrible, corrupting evil of the dark side.;NM35AABAST06382_.mp3
Millions dead, and far more suffering. What sort of person would you have to become to perform such deeds gladly?;NM35AABAST06383_.mp3
I couldn't see myself ever doing such things.;
Perhaps it's just the reasoning for those acts you don't accept.;
And how adept must one become at making excuses for one's actions, if suffering is the result? How long before you stop making excuses at all?;NM35AABAST06389_.mp3
Are you saying the light side is innocent of killing?;
One who serves the light side does not strike down an innocent. We take arms against the dark side and the injustice that follows it only.;NM35AABAST06385_.mp3
I don't know.;
Neither do I, and I hope I never do.;NM35AABAST06387_.mp3
How can you know it is so terrible?;
Stop with the dramatics, already, I get the picture.;
You say you understand, but I'm afraid you are taking this too lightly. The power of the dark side can be... alluring.;NM35AABAST06402_.mp3
We're not going to go over this again, are we?;
We must, for all our sakes. If you had the proper training under a true Master you would know all this. But because of our mission, I must be the one to try and help you understand.;NM35AABAST06371_.mp3
I've seen you give in to temptation and indulge your baser emotions on many occasions. I'm afraid you are on the path that leads to the dark side.;NM35AABAST06368_.mp3
I won't misuse my power, Bastila.;
My progress?;
What? You've been grading me?;
Why did the Council send me with you on this mission?;
Why? I could not accomplish this on my own, I need the aid of others - especially one who is strong in the Force. The bond between us made you a natural choice.;NM35AABAST06405_.mp3
Besides, the events on Taris proved that the Force wanted to bring us together for this mission, and there is little left to chance when the Force is involved. Is that not enough for you?;NGLOBEBAST06820_.mp3
If the Force wants us to be together, why do you keep resisting my undeniable charms?;
I said we were brought together for our mission: to stop Malak. I hardly think the Force would be pushing us towards a romantic involvement when the fate of the galaxy is at stake!;NGLOBEBAST06882_.mp3
Please try to stay focused. I doubt the Council would approve if they knew we were busy discussing our mutual attraction when we should be saving the galaxy from Malak.;NGLOBEBAST06883_.mp3
Mutual attraction? I knew you were interested in me!;
Mutual attraction? I never said... it's just an expression! Whatever our feelings... uh, I mean... whatever *your* feelings, you have to try to ignore them. Don't let this complicate things.;NGLOBEBAST06885_.mp3
Finding the missing pieces of the Star Maps is our only hope of locating the Star Forge and defeating Malak. The Council explained all this quite clearly.;NGLOBEBAST06887_.mp3
It just seems odd they would send me off without a Master to guide me.;
I admit, there were times that I wondered if this is more than just a mission to stop Malak. There were times when I wondered if this was also a way for the Council to test my own abilities.;NM35AABAST06409_.mp3
I get the feeling that there's more going on than I know.;
I wondered if the Council wanted to see how I would help and guide you on our quest. I wondered if they were testing me to see if I was ready to become a Jedi Master myself.;NGLOBEBAST06821_.mp3
And then I realized how foolish such thoughts were. As the Council explained, sending a Master in our group would only have drawn unwanted attention from the Sith.;NGLOBEBAST06822_.mp3
The fate of the galaxy is at stake, the Council would not risk it merely to test me. They calculated the risks and in the end chose the only option available.;NGLOBEBAST06823_.mp3
I guess that makes sense.;
You must learn to trust in the wisdom of the Council. Your destiny will come in its appointed time. You mustn't be so impatient.;NM35AABAST06411_.mp3
Me? You're the one who thought this was her big audition for 'Masterhood'!;
*Must* you be so frustrating? I admit, I had a moment of foolish pride. But I'm over it. Now I am focused on my true responsibilities.;NM35AABAST06413_.mp3
I am simply trying to help you and complete this mission, and yet you battle me at every turn!;NM35AABAST06414_.mp3
What can I say? It's fun.;
Fun?! Fun?! Driving me insane is your idea of a good time?;NM35AABAST06416_.mp3
Careful. Remember your self-control.;
You... you are a very odd man, do you know that? I simply don't know how to deal with you. All I want to do is help you, but you seem determined to drive me mad.;NM35AABAST06418_.mp3
Complain all you want, but I know you love it.;
I don't know if I should be outraged that you keep joking about serious matters, or if I should be grateful that you can always lighten the mood.;NM35AABAST06424_.mp3
Come on, come, let's move on... there's much to be done.;NM35AABAST06422_.mp3
I'm not so bad. You just have to learn to accept me for what I am.;
Unfortunately it isn't as easy as that. But your point is well taken.;NM35AABAST06421_.mp3
I must admit: I simply don't know how to deal with someone like you.;NM35AABAST06427_.mp3
Hey, you brought this on yourself.;
I started it? You were the one who brought up the issue of the Council! You were the one who questioned our mission! You're the one who mocked me for thinking I was being tested!;NM35AABAST06435_.mp3
Lighten up. I'm only joking.;
I don't know what you're talking about.;
Hey, you started this.;
Oh, great. Another lecture. This never gets old.;
You're right. I suppose we should get back to the mission now.;
I'm still not convinced.;
I just don't trust the Council and their motives.;
And that's it? That's enough reason for you to accept all this?;
I'm sorry, Bastila. I know our mission is important.;
You look like you have something to say.;
I do. I have been trying to come up with the best way to say this for some time, but I suppose I should just come out and say it.;NM35AABAST06443_.mp3
The truth is, I have come to depend on you. Not just for the sake of the mission, but for my own sake as well. I am... I am glad you are with us.;NM35AABAST06444_.mp3
What was that? I think I'm going deaf. You better say it again.;
Now you're teasing me. You know very well what I said.;NM35AABAST06453_.mp3
I'm still reeling from the shock. Was that a compliment?;
Well, yes. Surely that is not so surprising.;NM35AABAST06446_.mp3
You're kidding, right?;
No, I'm not. Why must you make this so difficult for me? Can't you just accept a simple compliment?;NM35AABAST06448_.mp3
Maybe I was just distracted by the grudging manner in which it was given.;
I see. Is there nothing I can do to make it up to you? I would rather we were friends.;NM35AABAST06463_.mp3
Oh? How close a friend would you like to be?;
I... you know I can't feel that way about you. About any man. It isn't permitted. I am a Jedi, I must resist these temptations.;NM35AABAST06468_.mp3
But I still want to consider you a friend. We could... we could never be anything more, though. That... that isn't allowed.;NM35AABAST06469_.mp3
I'd like that, I suppose.;
I know my manner can be a bit taciturn. I know you must be getting sick of my lectures about the dark side and... and everything else.;NM35AABAST06474_.mp3
I spent all my years being hounded by my instructors. Being told so often how gifted and important I was until I was sick of it.;NM35AABAST06475_.mp3
I remember when I was younger I used to swear that I would never become as self-absorbed and stodgy as the Jedi Masters. It's ironic, really.;NM35AABAST06476_.mp3
Don't forget edgy, critical and overly secretive.;
Yes, well... there's no need for you to agree so whole-heartedly.;NM35AABAST06482_.mp3
"Being controlled has kept everyone around me at an arm's length; even those like yourself who are most in need of my understanding and compassion.";NM35AABAST06483_.mp3
But maybe it's time to change that. You deserve to know how much I respect and admire you. I had to tell you how much I care for you. As a friend, of course.;NGLOBEBAST06827_.mp3
We could be more than friends, Bastila.;
Please, it's... it's not allowed. I have to remain true to the Jedi ideal. If this is going to cause a problem maybe... maybe I shouldn't have said anything.;NGLOBEBAST06829_.mp3
No, I'm glad you did. I care for you too, Bastila. As a friend.;
Well, that was not nearly so difficult as I feared. Thank you for hearing me out. I feel... I feel much better.;NM35AABAST06488_.mp3
But enough soul searching for now. We should probably continue on with our mission.;NGLOBEBAST06831_.mp3
Great, you've had your say. Now leave me alone - for good!;
What? But I... alright. Have it your way, if that's what you'd prefer. We needn't talk further.;NM35AABAST06465_.mp3
I'm glad you did.;
But maybe it's time to change that. You deserve to know how much I respect and admire you. I thought... I just thought I should tell you.;NM35AABAST06484_.mp3
Nonsense. You're not self-absorbed or stodgy.;
That's kind of you to say, but I know for myself that it's not really true.;NM35AABAST06478_.mp3
Maybe, but you don't need to be like that.;
I suppose not. But I am becoming like that, though it's not easy for me to admit.;NM35AABAST06480_.mp3
Then leave me alone. For good.;
Friends? You could have fooled me.;
Just leave me alone... for good.;
You can keep your thanks. I don't need it... or you.;
Fine. Thank you for the thought.;
It's just that you sounded so pained saying it.;
Did I? I am trying to be sincere, here. It occurred to me that I may have been too critical of you. Too demanding, at times.;NM35AABAST06457_.mp3
Thank you. I appreciate the gesture.;
*May* have been?;
I am trying my best. You are not making this easy for me, you know.;NM35AABAST06459_.mp3
Your compliments need some work, I think.;
And when have you ever made things easy for me?;
Too little, too late. Sorry.;
Is that a compliment? From you?;
You made that sound very painful for you to admit.;
You're curious about something?;
Am I so transparent? I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, considering our bond. Yes, there is something I would like to ask, if you'll permit it.;NM35AABAST06490_.mp3
Do I have a choice?;
Don't even start with that. You're the one who asked. I wasn't even going to say anything. But now that you've brought it up, I see I shouldn't have waited as long as I have.;NM35AABAST06492_.mp3
In our time together I've been watching you. I've seen your tendency towards giving in to your darker emotions. You do as you please, for the most part.;NM35AABAST06494_.mp3
Don't worry, this isn't a lead-up to a lecture. I'm... fascinated by your passion, by how easily it comes to you.;NM35AABAST06495_.mp3
You seem to do whatever you want, something I would never dare consider. Don't you fear the consequences?;NM35AABAST06496_.mp3
No. You should try it yourself, sometime.;
I doubt my old Master would approve of your advice. Besides, I'm not like you. I must always be on guard against such outbursts.;NM35AABAST06498_.mp3
I've always struggled for control over my passions. I've always been too quick to anger, too quick to get involved. My instructors constantly berated me for it.;NM35AABAST06511_.mp3
I've often dreamed that I might be able to confront Darth Malak myself. I dream I can use all this power I have to kill him and stop all the death and destruction.;NM35AABAST06512_.mp3
I just think about all the evil that the Sith have caused and I... I get so furious. Yet we are told that these feelings are the path to the dark side.;NM35AABAST06513_.mp3
Are you saying you don't believe in the corruption of the dark side?;
I don't know. Would the power I used to kill Darth Malak be too tempting to keep using? Would I become the kind of evil I want to destroy?;NM35AABAST06515_.mp3
"The very thought that I could become as evil as Malak; I just can't fathom it. It just doesn't seem possible. How could I... no, wait. I'm sorry.";NM35AABAST06520_.mp3
"I shouldn't even be asking you this. The Jedi teachings are clear; who am I to question them? And even worse, who am I to try and make you question them?";NM35AABAST06521_.mp3
What?;
These are dangerous thoughts, the indulgence of a vain mind. Please, forget I ever mentioned this. Let's just return to our mission.;NM35AABAST06523_.mp3
I think destroying that kind of evil would be worth it.;
But what comes next? After using all that power, would you decide to impose your own view on the universe? The dark side corrupts your very thoughts.;NM35AABAST06517_.mp3
You have to trust in the wisdom of the Jedi Code.;
Yes, of course. You're right. I... I have to remember my training. The Masters know well the corrupting influence of the dark side, although it is hard for me to imagine.;NGLOBEBAST06833_.mp3
It sounds like you have your own demons to face.;
I suppose I do. Part of me thinks that it would be worth anything to vanquish evil, even if it meant giving in to my base emotions.;NM35AABAST06519_.mp3
Life's too short to be afraid.;
Is it? The thought of what could happen to me if I lose control... somehow I think life could be very long, indeed.;NM35AABAST06500_.mp3
Maybe a little, sure.;
That... that's a relief to hear. That you would even be willing to risk so much is... is very brave. Braver than I could be.;NM35AABAST06502_.mp3
In our time together I've been watching you. You are a true servant of the light, you follow the tenets of the Jedi Order despite the lure of the dark side. And with so little training.;NM35AABAST06503_.mp3
For me it has always been a constant battle. Don't you find it difficult at all? You make it seem so easy. Or is that only an illusion?;NM35AABAST06504_.mp3
I just do what I think is right.;
And that's enough for you? If only it were as easy for me. If only the right path was always clear.;NM35AABAST06506_.mp3
It's a struggle for me, sometimes.;
That's a relief to hear. I have never found the Jedi path an easy one to walk, and it's good to know I'm not alone.;NM35AABAST06508_.mp3
I don't think about it much.;
You don't? Sometimes I find that it is nearly all I can think of. I have never found the Jedi training easy to master.;NM35AABAST06510_.mp3
Go ahead.;
I'd like to talk about what you said before. About giving in to your emotions.;
Yes, I did end that quite abruptly, didn't I? Perhaps a Master could have addressed my questions with the proper wisdom. But I never should have brought it up here. Not with you.;NM35AABAST06525_.mp3
"Part of my purpose on this mission was to guide you in the way of the light; to help you avoid the temptations of the dark side. But I fear I've failed in that task.";NGLOBEBAST06834_.mp3
I don't think I'm the proper Jedi to guide you. I am no Master. You should have remained with the Council.;NM35AABAST06526_.mp3
Why do you say that?;
The fact of the matter is that I have never possessed much skill at controlling myself. With the bond that joins us, it seems I have even less.;NM35AABAST06528_.mp3
Whether you will continue on your current path and fall to the dark side, I don't know. But it is increasingly obvious I am unable to guide you properly.;NM35AABAST06530_.mp3
So what now?;
I don't know. I think... I think I may have made a very big mistake.;NM35AABAST06533_.mp3
I simply hope that you are not the one who pays the price, ultimately, for the fact that I can't help you enough.;NM35AABAST06534_.mp3
Maybe we could help each other?;
That's a kinder response than I deserve. And I can see there is wisdom in your words.;NM35AABAST06538_.mp3
You... you continue to be there for me, don't you? Even after I keep pushing you away, you're still around when I need you most.;NM35AABAST06539_.mp3
You're like no man I've known before. And you're nothing like what I expected you to be after... after the Council sent us on this mission together.;NGLOBEBAST06835_.mp3
We're made for each other, Bastila. You have to see that.;
I... I need time to think about all this. Things are... they are not going as I thought they would.;NGLOBEBAST06837_.mp3
We should... we should continue on with our mission, for now.;NGLOBEBAST06838_.mp3
How did you expect me to be?;
Well, just... different, I suppose. Things are not going as I thought they would. I... I need time to think about all this.;NM35AABAST06541_.mp3
Perhaps you can help me. And I will try to help you, if I can. Hopefully this will all work out, for the both of us. And for the sake of the mission.;NM35AABAST06542_.mp3
You're being too hard on yourself.;
I don't need your help, anyway. I can find my own way.;
No, I suppose you don't. At this point I imagine I'm doing you more harm than good.;NGLOBEBAST06839_.mp3
You aren't my teacher, Bastila. We're supposed to help each other.;
So no you'll finally leave me alone for good?;
Fair enough. You will probably be better off on your own, in any case. I won't trouble you with this anymore.;NM35AABAST06547_.mp3
You're doing your best, I'm sure.;
That is kind of you to say, but I think the evidence speaks for itself. I think... I think I may have made a very big mistake.;NM35AABAST06545_.mp3
Oh? You see that, too? I don't need you anymore.;
You have maintained the path of the light side. But it has been in spite of my influence, not because of it. It is increasingly obvious I am unable to guide you properly.;NM35AABAST06531_.mp3
No, I disagree!;
Perhaps you are not being truly objective, then. There is no need to spare my feelings on this point.;NM35AABAST06550_.mp3
Oh, get over yourself, already.;
Please don't make light of this. The very fact that I am plagued by this doubt is yet further evidence of my inadequacy.;NM35AABAST06552_.mp3
When we last talked you said you needed time to think. So?;
You have been patient with me, haven't you? I suppose you deserve an answer. But you have to understand how difficult this is for me to say.;NM35AABAST06554_.mp3
Yes, I think so.;
With all my training, I should be able to control myself better than this. But you're not anything like I expected. You're not like any man I've ever met before.;NM35AABAST06561_.mp3
I find myself watching you when I don't mean to. I'm thinking about you when I don't want to. It isn't supposed to be like this!;NM35AABAST06562_.mp3
What are you trying to say, exactly?;
Every time I try to call on all my teachings to calm myself, they fail me. You have such power, such passion! I don't know if it's due to the bond between us, but I'm drawn to you.;NM35AABAST06564_.mp3
Are you interested in me or in my ability to use the Force?;
The Force is a part of you, as is your power. But that's not what attracted me to you. It's more than that. Maybe it's the bond we share. It gives us a certain... intimacy.;NM35AABAST06566_.mp3
If I could, I would return to Dantooine. I need to be away from this bond of ours. I need to weaken it. I need to be anywhere but near you!;NM35AABAST06567_.mp3
But Malak must be stopped, my own feelings are nothing when compared to that. Yet I know this could affect the sake of our mission if it is not resolved - I can't let that happen!;NGLOBEBAST06842_.mp3
Just give in to your feelings, Bastila. I know you want to.;
I think... I think we should have some privacy for this. Come with me.;NGLOBEBAST06844_.mp3
I can't deny that there are parts of you I am drawn to. Your power, your will. You are so much stronger than I am.;NM35AABAST06598_.mp3
In some ways you make me feel weak, like I am caught up in the wake of our destiny. But at the same time, you make me feel stronger, more alive.;NM35AABAST06599_.mp3
So what does this mean for us?;
"I realize now these feelings are part of the bond we share. The Jedi Council surely realized this; they knew my loyalty to the doctrines of our Order would be tested on this mission.";NM35AABAST06601_.mp3
By facing and overcoming my feelings for you I have learned a valuable lesson about control and the dangers of emotion. This is an important step in understanding the Force.;NM35AABAST06602_.mp3
I'm sorry if this is not what you wanted to hear. But I felt it was important you know our... infatuation... was nothing more than a result of our powerful bond.;NM35AABAST06603_.mp3
So I was just a stepping stone to you becoming a Master?;
Please, don't say it like that. You make it sound like I was using you! Don't you realize how difficult this was for me?;NM35AABAST06604_.mp3
Difficult for you? What about me?;
Why do you think I came to this decision? I know how hard this is for both of us! You just kept pressing forward, so I had to be the one to step up and do the right thing!;NGLOBEBAST06849_.mp3
You're the one who can't face the truth! Malak has to be stopped. How can I do that if I let myself be blinded by my feelings for you?;NGLOBEBAST06852_.mp3
I'm going to stop Malak, Bastila. But I want to do it with you at my side.;
You... you mean it, don't you? But how can I be sure you aren't making a mistake. I... I have to resist. I have to be strong for both of us.;NGLOBEBAST06854_.mp3
You know I'm right, Bastila.;
But I don't... I mean, I can't... Malak will...;NGLOBEBAST06856_.mp3
Shut up and kiss me, you babbling fool.;
Oh, my!;NGLOBEBAST06858_.mp3
We... we shouldn't have done that. It was wrong. The Jedi aren't allowed to fall in love.;NGLOBEBAST06863_.mp3
It didn't feel wrong to me.;
It was... it was a moment of weakness. When I kissed you... we shouldn't have... no, I'm sorry.;NGLOBEBAST06865_.mp3
I know we both wanted it, but we shouldn't have given in to our desire. We're Jedi! We can't act like this. Not now, not while we still have to deal with Malak!;NGLOBEBAST06866_.mp3
I'm... I'm sorry. I don't blame you, but... it was a mistake. I have to get out of here before somebody sees us together!;NGLOBEBAST06867_.mp3
We're not going back to this again, are we?;
I love you Bastila. And I know you love me.;
Okay, you've made your point. Now shut up and kiss me, you fool!;NGLOBEBAST06861_.mp3
You don't always have to be strong, Bastila. Give in just this once.;
That's okay - I never felt anything for you anyway.;
Oh, I thought... No, this is good. I'm glad you told me. This makes everything much easier.;NM35AABAST06586_.mp3
Don't worry - I can put this behind me. Let's just continue on with what we must do. It is better this way.;NM35AABAST06590_.mp3
I... I understand, Bastila.;
I hope you can put this behind you. You need to focus on stopping Malak, as difficult as that may be. Come, we should continue our mission.;NGLOBEBAST06875_.mp3
This is nothing but an excuse! You're afraid to face your feelings!;
You're rationalizing, Bastila. You're just scared to face the truth!;
So that's it? It's all over?;
I'm... afraid so. Although I suppose I should thank you for all you've done. For the lessons you helped me learn.;NGLOBEBAST06871_.mp3
Great - you learn a lesson and I get dumped!;
I wish it could be otherwise, but you have to understand that this is the way it must be. I am a Jedi, after all.;NGLOBEBAST06873_.mp3
And I feel more alive when I'm with you.;
You're stronger than I am, and there's no point in telling me otherwise. You will be a great Jedi, I think. I hope.;NM35AABAST06614_.mp3
What I have been trying to tell you is that I've reached a decision. But this is not the proper place for this discussion. I think... I think we should have some privacy for this.;NGLOBEBAST06845_.mp3
We can talk about this the next time we return to the Ebon Hawk.;NGLOBEBAST06846_.mp3
If you have something to say, just say it!;
You could leave, if you had to.;
And go where? I am needed here, just as you are. There is nothing that is more important than what we are doing. Which is why we need to resolve this.;NM35AABAST06580_.mp3
But I don't feel anything for you, Bastila.;
Sorry, Bastila. That starship won't fly. I'm not interested.;
What is it supposed to be like?;
I don't know. It shouldn't be so hard to not think of you. It should be easy to not think of you. I should have discipline! Jedi discipline!;NM35AABAST06592_.mp3
Do you have something you want to say to me, Bastila?;
Yes, I promised you an answer when we reached the Ebon Hawk, didn't I? But I'm afraid you won't like it. We should have some privacy for this.;NM35AABAST06596_.mp3
That's all for now.;
Dantooine is a peaceful and pastoral planet. There are few large communities. Mostly what you will find here are ranchers and farmers.;NM35AABAST06060_.mp3
I find it a tranquil place like few in the galaxy. The perfect site for the Jedi enclave. You will like it here.;NM35AABAST06061_.mp3
Manaan is a water world inhabited by an aquatic race known as the Selkath. Their only surface city and spaceport is called Ahto.;NM35AABAST06062_.mp3
It is unique in that the Selkath are firm in their neutrality. They are neither part of the republic nor controlled by the Sith, and they wish to keep it that way.;NM35AABAST06063_.mp3
Tatooine is a dry planet that has not been inhabited long and has little law. This town of Anchorhead may be its only settlement.;NM35AABAST06064_.mp3
Kashyyyk is a planet where most of what you see is actually foliage that has grown to enormous heights. No one has ever been to the true surface of the planet below.;NM35AABAST06065_.mp3
Korriban is a sparsely populated planet controlled by the Sith. It feels... wrong. There is an old evil here that permeates the Force.;NM35AABAST06066_.mp3
We can't risk having any of the dark Jedi Masters recognize me. For the sake of the mission I must remain hidden in the Ebon Hawk while we are on this world.;NM12AABAST06895_.mp3
There's nothing I could say that would be helpful, I'm afraid.;NM35AABAST06067_.mp3
So do you feel better now?;
Yes. That brought me a lot of peace. More than I thought it would have.;NM35AABAST06079_.mp3
Thank you for urging me towards it. After all my training, I would have thought it would have been easier. Apparently I still have much to learn.;NM35AABAST06080_.mp3
So you kept the holocron.;
Yes, but I don't feel any better. After all my training, I would have thought myself above such anger.;NM35AABAST06082_.mp3
For it to come so easily disturbs me greatly. I don't need a holocron to remember my father, and I will never see Mother again.;NM35AABAST06083_.mp3
Have I learned nothing? It... no, I don't want to talk about this. Thank you, but I must think about what I have done.;NM35AABAST06084_.mp3
[Don't speak to her.];
[You decide to ignore Bastila and continue on with your quest for now, though you might want to speak with her later.];
I am confident that you can deal with that on your own.;NM35AABAST06617_.mp3
I wish I could help you with that.;NM35AABAST06618_.mp3
*whisper* The Force should not be used for profit and personal gain. As Jedi we should be above such things.;NGLOBEBAST06896_.mp3
It troubles me to see you behaving this way. Such acts can lead to the dark side.;NGLOBEBAST06897_.mp3
*whisper* The Force is not a thing to be trifled with. Continue to use it frivolously and you may find yourself straying down the dark path.;NGLOBEBAST06898_.mp3
We should guard and protect those weaker than ourselves... not bully and exploit them!;NGLOBEBAST06899_.mp3
That was beneath you. I hope in the future you will strive to be better than this.;NGLOBEBAST06900_.mp3
That was a truly noble act. The Jedi Council would be pleased.;NGLOBEBAST06901_.mp3
The second tomb on the left within the valley is the tomb of Naga Sadow. It is off-limits to all students, unless they are in the company of Master Uthar.;NM36AASITH07000_.mp3
Beware of the tuk'ata. They are a pack beast that have their nests in one of the tombs. We fight them off as best we can.;NM36AASITH07001_.mp3
There is an old Sith hermit that has been haunting this area, we understand. Watch out for him.;NM36AASITH07002_.mp3
A dangerous assassin droid has barricaded itself within the tomb of Marka Ragnos, the first one on the left. Be wary.;NM36AASITH07003_.mp3
Watch out for the tuk'ata. They will charge you on sight. Run back to the excavation area and we can protect you.;NM36AASITH07004_.mp3
Any artifacts found should be brought to the attention of Master Uthar immediately.;NM36AASITH07005_.mp3
I am not here to get you out of trouble if you do something stupid, student. Enter the tombs at your own risk.;NM36AASITH07006_.mp3
You're pretty good, rookie. That was an impressive time you ran there.;
But Anglu's better than any of you Vulkar riders. That last time she posted is going to win this thing for the Beks!;
It might have stood up if it wasn't for Redros running the race of his life. Now we're all counting on you to get out there and beat his new time. You can't let the Vulkars win!;
Watch yourself out on the track, rookie. Every year we lose a couple of you first timers.;
It'd be a real shame if the Vulkars lost their newest rider because of one careless mistake. Yeah, that'd be a real shame.;
We Beks are losing enough members as it is without having them die on the track. Just be careful... and good luck.;
I saw you out on the track. You're going to have to do better than that if you want to collect the champion's prize.;
Anglu and Redros are the best riders out here, but with a little luck I think I can beat them this year.;
What this? What going on here? What you doing with my assault droid?;
I've reprogrammed your droid, Vorn.;
Turn my own droid against me - very clever. But it take more than rogue assault droid and you to take down Vorn Daasraad!;
If you surrender now I'll let you live.;
I'm going to enjoy killing you, Vorn!;
You Republic people are so pathetic, sitting around grovelling at the tablescraps the galactic senators deign to give you. It makes me sick.;NM26ADSITH04000_.mp3
The senators work for the good of the whole galaxy, not for individual gain!;NM26ADSITH04002_.mp3
Ha! Don't make me laugh, you gutless simp! It's the destiny of weak-minded fools like you to be ruled over by the strong, like we Sith!;NM26ADSITH04004_.mp3
I'm warning you! Don't push me, or you'll get just what you're asking for!;NM26ADSITH04006_.mp3
Try it. Just try it. I'd love to see you throw the first punch. And with all the cameras around the Selkath would be all over you inside of 30 seconds.;NM26ADSITH04008_.mp3
You break their laws, you pay the price, Republic scum. But I can see that you're not man enough to back up your words anyway.;NM26ADSITH04010_.mp3
If you ever feel like relieving yourself of your worthless existence, feel free to come by our enclave here. We have many, many ways to fulfill your wish.;NM26ADSITH04012_.mp3
*grrr*;NM26ADSITH04014_.mp3
You Republics make me sick. It's a good thing there are cameras all over the place on Manaan, or they'd have droids cleaning you up off the walls by now.;NM26ADSITH04016_.mp3
Well, maybe those bloody Vulkars will think twice next time before trying to keep a Jedi prisoner! And as for you, if you think you can collect me as a prize...;NM03AFBAST03000_.mp3
Wait... I don't believe this! You're... you're one of the soldiers with the Republic fleet, aren't you? Yes, I'm sure of it. How did you end up racing for these swoop gangs?;NM03AFBAST03002_.mp3
My name's <FullName>. I'm here to save you.;
Save me? Is that what you were trying to accomplish by riding in that swoop race? Well, as far as rescues go this is a pretty poor example.;NM03AFBAST03008_.mp3
In case you hadn't noticed, I managed to free myself from that neural restraint collar without your help. In fact, it's more accurate to say that I saved you!;NM03AFBAST03010_.mp3
Brejik and his Vulkars would have left you for dead if I hadn't stepped into that fight. You're lucky I was here to get you out of this mess!;NM03AFBAST03012_.mp3
I think you've got things confused. You were a helpless prisoner until I came along.;
I may have been a prisoner, but a Jedi is never helpless. Maybe you've heard of a little thing called 'the Force'?;NM03AFBAST03014_.mp3
But I suppose I shouldn't be too hard on you. You did try to save me after all, even if it didn't go quite as planned. So let's get down to business - we're not out of danger yet.;NM03AFBAST03016_.mp3
If I'm going to figure out a way for us to get off this planet I need to know what kind of resources we can draw on. First, are we the only two survivors left from the Endar Spire?;NM03AFBAST03021_.mp3
Carth and I are already working on a plan to get off Taris.;
Carth Onasi is alive? Finally, some good news! Carth is one of the Republic's best soldiers. He's proved himself a hero a dozen times over! And he sent you here to save me?;NM03AFBAST03028_.mp3
Maybe I misjudged you. Carth wouldn't have sent you if he wasn't confident in your... abilities. Forgive me - despite my Jedi training, I still tend to act a bit rashly sometimes.;NM03AFBAST03030_.mp3
Please, take me to Carth right away. Between the three of us I'm sure we can figure out some way to get off this planet before the Sith realize we're here.;NM03AFBAST03032_.mp3
We aren't the only survivors. Carth Onasi is alive as well.;
Hey, who said you were in charge here?;
The Republic, for one. I was fleet commander, remember? But I don't want you getting all worked up over nothing. So tell me - do you have a plan to get off this planet?;NM03AFBAST03025_.mp3
No - but Carth and I will figure something out!;
I don't have a plan yet. Carth wanted to make sure you were safe first.;
I didn't need your help with those Vulkars. I can handle myself!;
Yes, I suppose you can. Well, I appreciate your attempt to save me - even if it didn't really go as you planned. But let's get down to business - we're not out of danger yet.;NM03AFBAST03019_.mp3
We don't have time for this. Carth is waiting for us.;
It's a long story.;
Well we don't have time for it now. We have to get out of here before the Sith show up to sort out this mess. Is there somewhere safe we can go?;NM03AFBAST03004_.mp3
I've got somewhere safe to go. I was planning to take you there after I saved you from Brejik.;
Whoa - slow down. I'm in charge here. Remember, I saved you!;
Winning the swoop race was the only way I could save you.;
Never mind that. I won the swoop race, and you're my prize. I own you now!;
You must have banked a turn too sharply, because it sounds like all the blood has rushed from your brain!;NM03AFBAST03036_.mp3
I'm Bastila Shan, a member of the Jedi Order and a fleet commander for the Republic. Nobody 'owns' me! Now we don't have time for joking around. What are you doing here?;NM03AFBAST03038_.mp3
No one's allowed to talk to the prisoner. Brejik's orders. She wouldn't hear you anyway: she's got a neural disruptor collar on to keep her under control.;
False prophet! Deceiver! You have betrayed me! You have sold the hope of the entire village to the selfish and damnable Igear!;NM04AARUKI25000_.mp3
All I have worked for is destroyed! All the hopes and dreams of my father and grandfather before him turned to dust! Begone, up-worlder - I have only curses to speak at you!;NM04AARUKI25002_.mp3
You return, up-worlder. Are you ready to learn what you must learn? Are you ready to learn of the Promised Land?;NM04AARUKI25004_.mp3
Tell me about the Promised Land.;
"Legends tell of a self-sufficient colony founded just before the famine and lost during the civil war; a paradise beneath the Undercity where droid servants tend to every need.";NM04AARUKI25115_.mp3
For many years I searched for the Promised Land, just as my grandfather and father did before me. When I became old and gray my apprentice continued the search on my behalf.;NM04AARUKI25117_.mp3
Sounds like a myth to me. Something to give the people here some false hope to cling to so they don't go mad with despair.;NM04AARUKI25152_.mp3
"I have collected many clues hinting at its location; the journal of my apprentice provides yet more information. But still there are too many pieces missing from this puzzle.";NM04AARUKI25119_.mp3
But I know my father and grandfather each had journals where they recorded their own discoveries. Perhaps with their journals I could at last uncover its hidden location.;NM04AARUKI25121_.mp3
I have all three journals. Here - take them.;
Can it be true? Is it possible that at long last the dream of my father and grandfather before him will be fulfilled? I... I can hardly bear to look.;NM04AARUKI25009_.mp3
Hmmm... yes. Yes! Of course! Now I understand - it all makes sense! Now I see why the Promised Land has been so hard to find! It is so obvious!;NM04AARUKI25011_.mp3
You have done a great thing, up-worlder - a selfless act that will bring great joy to all the people of this village! I must take this to Gendar right away!;NM04AARUKI25013_.mp3
Rukil? What do you want now? Have you more fables of a hidden paradise just waiting for us to find it?;NM04AARUKI25015_.mp3
You may not think these are fables after you see what I have brought you, Gendar! Look at these journals!;NM04AARUKI25017_.mp3
What... no. It can't be! Are these real, Rukil? Is this information accurate?;NM04AARUKI25019_.mp3
I swear to you everything in these journals is true, Gendar. The Promised Land - I told you I would find it!;NM04AARUKI25021_.mp3
The entrance is far from here, Rukil. It will take us weeks to get there... perhaps even months. And we will have to cross many rakghoul infested areas.;NM04AARUKI25023_.mp3
I do not deny the journey will be hard, Gendar. But surely it is better than the miserable life we have here!;NM04AARUKI25025_.mp3
Wise words, Rukil. Our supplies are high right now - we could leave by nightfall! I will tell the others to prepare for the journey.;NM04AARUKI25027_.mp3
Thank you once again, up-worlder. I will say a final goodbye, for where we are going I fear you cannot come. The journey to the Promised Land is long and arduous.;NM04AARUKI25029_.mp3
Goodbye, Rukil - and good luck.;
We must part ways here, up-worlder. I sense your destiny is yet to be chosen, but the destiny of my people is at the end of the long journey ahead of us.;NM04AARUKI25031_.mp3
Maybe I should come with you. I could help you on the journey.;
No, up-worlder, I cannot ask that. The journey will take many, many weeks. And those who make the journey cannot return - that was the final secret of the Promised Land.;NM04AARUKI25034_.mp3
When the colony was created it was designed so that people could enter willingly, but they could never leave again. This was to ensure secrecy on the project.;NM04AARUKI25036_.mp3
I have one of the journals you're looking for.;
Yes, up-worlder... well done. However, I see that this journal alone does not have enough clues for me to solve this mystery. Too many pieces are still missing.;NM04AARUKI25040_.mp3
I'm afraid that only with all three journals - my grandfather's, my father's and my apprentice's - will I be able to discover the location of the Promised Land.;NM04AARUKI25042_.mp3
I will leave this journal with you for safe keeping for now. Perhaps it will aid you in your search for the others. I wish you luck, up-worlder - for the sake of the entire village.;NM04AARUKI25044_.mp3
And you want me to find these missing journals?;
I have nothing to offer if you help me in this. I hope the knowledge that you are helping the entire village escape a life of darkness and suffering is reward enough.;NM04AARUKI25124_.mp3
Don't worry, Rukil. I'll find those journals.;
It is many decades since my father set out on his journey, but I remember he was eager to explore the sewers. You might want to begin your search there.;NM04AARUKI25126_.mp3
I wish you luck in your quest, up-worlder. The future survival of this village - of my people - depends on you.;NM04AARUKI25128_.mp3
Sorry, I need an actual reward if you want my help.;
I see. Well, perhaps you are not the savior I seek after all. I can only pray that if you find the journals you will have a change of heart and bring them to me.;NM04AARUKI25134_.mp3
What will I get if I find these missing journals for you?;
I'm not wasting my time looking for these journals!;
Please, up-worlder - I am too old to search for the missing journals myself, and the other villagers think the Promised Land is nothing but a myth.;NM04AARUKI25132_.mp3
Forget it.;
I'm not interested in this.;
I offer you wisdom and you turn me away? Perhaps you are not ready to accept the role you must play in the destiny and salvaton of my people.;NM04AARUKI25141_.mp3
Very well, up-worlder. Return to me when you are ready to learn what you must learn.;NM04AARUKI25143_.mp3
You return, up-worlder. Are you ready now to learn what you must learn? Are you ready to hear the history of my people?;NM04AARUKI25006_.mp3
Very well - tell me the history of your people.;
The great city of Taris covers the entire surface of this planet. There is no land to grow food. Kelp harvests and the creatures of the sea are our only food source.;NM04AARUKI25101_.mp3
A century ago rising levels of toxic pollution poisoned the oceans and famine swept the planet. The rich hoarded food for their own use, and the poor were left to starve and die.;NM04AARUKI25103_.mp3
From what I've seen of Taris, it doesn't look like much has changed. Except for the Upper City, people here are just as bad off as the poor in your little history.;NM04AARUKI25151_.mp3
But the poor rose up against this tyranny and civil war engulfed the planet. Millions died in the fighting and huge sections of Taris were destroyed or abandoned.;NM04AARUKI25105_.mp3
The rebellion was crushed in the end, thousands were taken prisoner. The jails could not hold them all, and so the practice of banishing all prisoners to the Undercity was born.;NM04AARUKI25107_.mp3
Is that how you came to be down here?;
Many brave men and women were banished here to the Undercity for their part in the rebellion. People like my father and grandfather were cast down, along with their families.;NM04AARUKI25109_.mp3
What did you expect? If they could get away with it the Tarisian nobles would stuff their own mothers down here to make more room in the Upper City.;NM04AARUKI25111_.mp3
Now we live a dark existence beneath the streets of Taris, a life devoid of all hope but one: the Promised Land. And you will be the one to show us the way to get there.;NM04AARUKI25113_.mp3
The Promised Land? What's that?;
How can I lead you to this Promised Land when I don't even know what it is?;
What does this have to do with me?;
Are you going to get to the point soon?;
I'm not interested in the history of your people.;
Welcome back, up-worlder. How goes your quest? Have you found the journals of my father and grandfather?;NM04AARUKI25007_.mp3
I don't have all the journals yet, but I will find them.;
I can't waste any more time with your quest.;
You - you come from the world above! Is this the time of destiny, then? Is this a portent of the salvation of my people? Or merely another false sign to mislead us from the path?;NM04AARUKI25047_.mp3
Are you the herald of prophecy? The beacon to guide us through the darkness? Or are you merely another harbinger of shattered dreams and unfulfilled promises?;NM04AARUKI25049_.mp3
Watch yourself: this guy's star chart is missing a few galaxies, if you know what I mean.;NM04AARUKI25051_.mp3
This old man's demeanor may seem crazed, but I sense there is a purpose behind it, a benevolent one. He is no danger to us.;NM04AARUKI25055_.mp3
Speak to me, up-worlder! Tell me what fate you unleash upon us - salvation or damnation! Speak, up-worlder - I beg you!;NM04AARUKI25057_.mp3
What are you talking about, old man?;
A question. You are uncertain. Bewildered. Perplexed. Understandable, I suppose. Even after a hundred years of life I myself still become confused at times.;NM04AARUKI25059_.mp3
Perhaps I can make things more clear. Some things, at least. My name is Rukil, the oldest Outcast here in the village. Rukil Wrinkle-Skin, the children call me sometimes.;NM04AARUKI25065_.mp3
I'm <FullName>. What do you want from me, Rukil?;
Once I was honored for my wisdom, but over time the villagers fell away from the true path. Eventually there was only a single apprentice who followed me - and now she is gone, too.;NM04AARUKI25067_.mp3
The true path? What does that mean?;
No, no, no. Not yet. I must be wary. Careful. You may be a false savior. Dare I share my secrets with you? No... not until you prove yourself.;NM04AARUKI25069_.mp3
Prove myself? How can I do that?;
My apprentice is... lost. I sent her out into the Undercity to find... well, I cannot tell you. Not yet. Sadly, my apprentice has not returned.;NM04AARUKI25072_.mp3
Please, up-worlder - will you help an old man? Will you seek out my apprentice in the Undercity? Her name is Malya. I must know of her fate, whatever it may be. I must know what she... found.;NM04AARUKI25074_.mp3
Your apprentice is dead. I have her journal.;
It is as I feared, then. She joins the list of those who have given their lives in the service of our cause. But though I am saddened by this news, there is yet hope.;NM04AARUKI25091_.mp3
By finding my apprentice you have proved yourself worthy, up-worlder. You are to be the beacon on our path to salvation. You will guide us to the Promised Land!;NM04AARUKI25093_.mp3
Guide you? But I don't even know where the Promised Land is!;
You are marked, up-worlder - even my dim old eyes can see the mantle of destiny that cloaks you. Perhaps old Rukil knows you better than you know yourself.;NM04AARUKI25097_.mp3
I am old - I have lived a hundred years in the Undercity, cast down into the darkness. I know the legends and history of our people - and now you must learn it, too.;NM04AARUKI25099_.mp3
I think you have me confused with someone else.;
Hold on a second - I'm not guiding anybody anywhere!;
I will help you with this, Rukil.;
"Finding her may be difficult; Malya could be anywhere in the Undercity... but if you find her I will know you to be our true savior! Only then can I reveal my secret knowledge to you.";NM04AARUKI25076_.mp3
I'll be back if I find anything out.;
I wish you luck, up-worlder. Come speak to me again once you have discovered the fate of my apprentice.;NM04AARUKI25078_.mp3
I'm not going to waste my time looking for your apprentice!;
Then... perhaps you are not the one I have been waiting for. Should you change your mind, up-worlder, speak with me again. Come to me if you learn the fate of my apprentice.;NM04AARUKI25081_.mp3
What will you give me if I help you?;
Forget it, old man. I'm not interested.;
I don't have time for this nonsense.;
Please, a moment up-worlder. I must know if you are the one I have been waiting for. Please, I beg for your help.;NM04AARUKI25086_.mp3
Okay, enough of this. So long, you crazy freak.;
What happened to your apprentice?;
Get to the point, old man!;
Uh... okay, then. Could I ask you some questions?;
You're obviously an insane old kook.;
Old, yes. But not insane. Oh no, not insane at all! I am as rational as any man can be after a hundred years in the filth and darkness of the Undercity!;NM04AARUKI25063_.mp3
Be careful... this one might be crazy enough to be dangerous.;NM04AARUKI25053_.mp3
Greetings once more, up-worlder. Do you bring news of my apprentice? Have you discovered her fate, and proved yourself to be a true savior of my people?;NM04AARUKI25089_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;
You seek my wisdom, but I dare not share my knowledge with you. Not yet. Not until you prove yourself to be the one foretold, the one who will guide us to salvation.;NM04AARUKI25146_.mp3
Find my apprentice. Discover what fate has befallen her and I will know you are worthy, and not another false prophet sent to mislead my people!;NM04AARUKI25148_.mp3
I haven't found her yet, but I will.;
You Republics sicken me! We'll do the galaxy a favor by wiping you out!;NM26ACSITH29000_.mp3
Nice to see you again. Hold onto that Hawk... it'll do well by you.;NM33AAPILO14000_.mp3
Greetings, friend. Fellow pilot, are you? Wouldn't mind taking a spin in the Ebon Hawk, myself. Sleek ship, that one.;NM33AAPILO14001_.mp3
Does everyone here know about the Ebon Hawk?;
In a small colony like this, everyone knows everyone's business.;NM33AAPILO14003_.mp3
It's better than thinking too much about all the Sith lurking about, here.;NM33AAPILO14004_.mp3
The Hawk's been in and out of here for ages. An out-of-the-way starport is a good place for, uh... privateers. Not saying you are one.;NM33AAPILO14005_.mp3
And what if I am?;
Wouldn't make any difference to me. Just wish I had a ship like that, myself. Business is steady here with the Sith, but it's a boring haul.;NM33AAPILO14007_.mp3
In case you're forgetting, partner, they don't exactly want us talking about their business.;NM33AAPILO14013_.mp3
Ah, who cares about them? I've seen some of those things they're digging up in those ruins in the valley. Pretty creepy, if you ask me.;NM33AAPILO14014_.mp3
What have they been digging up?;
Weird artifacts. Looks like alien stuff. Maybe aliens lived on Korriban a long time ago, who knows?;NM33AAPILO14016_.mp3
Don't be stupid. I was talking to one of those Sith and he said there are tombs there dating back to when the Sith were here in ancient times.;NM33AAPILO14017_.mp3
There were Sith here in ancient times? Sounds like he was feeding you a line. Korriban's only been settled for a short time.;NM33AAPILO14018_.mp3
So says you. He said that the planet was settled by the Sith a long time ago, and then they all left or something. Those tombs are really important to them.;NM33AAPILO14019_.mp3
Tombs, hey? That makes the stuff they send us even creepier. Wish I didn't have to haul it around.;NM33AAPILO14020_.mp3
Where do you take these things?;
We used to haul everything to Taris, and the Sith would take it off our hands there. Not sure where we'll be bringing it now.;NM33AAPILO14022_.mp3
Do you have any of these artifacts, now?;
No. We're not due for another shipment for at least another week.;NM33AAPILO14024_.mp3
How would one get to these excavations, exactly?;
It's in a valley on the surface, beyond some mountains to the east. No land route... that's why they have us fly in.;NM33AAPILO14026_.mp3
Shows what you know. The academy has a route through the mountain... that's how all their students get to the excavation site.;NM33AAPILO14027_.mp3
Well, regardless, the Sith don't let anybody near that valley. Even when we land, they watch us like a Drayberian hawk and want us gone quickly.;NM33AAPILO14028_.mp3
So no one could sneak into the valley by ship?;
Not a chance. You'd be better off sneaking through the academy, if you wanted to go to the valley.;NM33AAPILO14030_.mp3
Hah! Now that'd be a sight to see.;NM33AAPILO14031_.mp3
I'll be going.;
Sure thing. Good flying, friend.;NM33AAPILO14033_.mp3
I'm not a smuggler, if that's what you mean.;
What kind of ship do you pilot?;
Oh, just a boring freighter. We've had some pretty steady work here, though, since the Sith started their excavations up on the surface.;NM33AAPILO14012_.mp3
How about you mind your own business?;
Sorry. Hard not to be interested. All we get to do is freighter work, though the Sith certainly provide a lot of that.;NM33AAPILO14010_.mp3
Well, forget it. The Hawk's my ship.;
I never said it wasn't. Just would be nice to fly something with a bit of thrust, for once.;NM33AAPILO14035_.mp3
I wasn't expecting guests - and I don't want any, either! Shove off, unless you want more trouble than you can handle.;NM26AAGONT05000_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;
I prefer to make my credits gambling, but I never turn my back on an opportunity. Maybe this can be a profitable exchange for both of us.;NM26AAGONT05033_.mp3
Do you know why the Republic is hiring so many mercenaries lately?;
Hey, here's an idea - why don't you ask the mercs? Better yet, go down to the embassy and ask the Republic!;NM26AAGONT05035_.mp3
You done wasting my time now, or you got some more questions?;NM26AAGONT05036_.mp3
What do you think of the Sith?;
They don't bother me, and I don't bother them. Works all around.;NM26AAGONT05046_.mp3
What do you think of the Republic?;
Why are the Sith so interested in the Selkath youth?;
300 credits or I don't say nothin'!;NM26AAGONT05049_.mp3
Here's 300 credits. Now start talking!;
I don't know what the Sith are actually up to, but I know who could tell you. The Iridorian Mercenary. Spends all day in the mercenary enclave, and everyone gives him a wide berth.;NM26AAGONT05055_.mp3
The Sith were cozying up to him real good a while ago. Go speak to him about this. But be careful - them Iridorians have a nasty reputation.;NM26AAGONT05056_.mp3
That's not very helpful.;
That's all I know. You want any more info on the Sith and their schemes, go talk to the Iridorian.;NM26AAGONT05051_.mp3
Thanks for the tip.;
How about you tell me what I want to know, and the Manaan authorities don't find your body washing up on shore?;
You've got a lot of guts, threatening me on this planet! Everyone knows breaking the peace is punishable by imprisonment.;NM26AAGONT05063_.mp3
But I think you just might be crazy enought that you don't care. Okay, I don't need no trouble, so here's the scoop..;NM26AAGONT05064_.mp3
Ah - save your threats! Everyone knows breaking the peace here in Ahto City is punishable by a long stretch in the Manaan prisons.;NM26AAGONT05065_.mp3
You must be really desparate, to threaten my life for some lousy information. You want it that bad, maybe I'm undercharging you!;NM26AAGONT05066_.mp3
[Force Persuade] But I'm your friend - you want to tell me what you know.;
[Success] Yes... yes, I suppose I do. I want to tell you everything I know.;NM26AAGONT05068_.mp3
I think I'll be going now.;
So clear out already!;NM26AAGONT05070_.mp3
Ah... I might know a little bit about this. But telling you might put my life at risk. And that don't come cheap.;NM26AAGONT05052_.mp3
See, I can give you a leg up on investigating what the Sith are up to - but it'll cost you 200 credits.;NM26AAGONT05053_.mp3
Here's 200 credits. Now start talking.;
I'll give you a 100 credits.;
Pretty cheap price for my life, if you ask me. But I guess it's better than nothing, so I'll take it.;NM26AAGONT05060_.mp3
You think I'm some kind of space scum, to sell myself off for a measly 100 credits! You got a real attitude problem, and it's gonna cost you.;NM26AAGONT05061_.mp3
Do you know anything about the recent murder?;
What do you expect when a Sith spy and a Republic war hero are having an affair? Anyone could see it would end ugly.;NM26AAGONT05038_.mp3
Affair? What are you talking about?;
Oh-ho! So, you didn't know about Sunry stepping out on his wife? Well it may have been a secret to some, but I'm not blind!;NM26AAGONT05040_.mp3
I should have charged you for that juicy tidbit, but I figured anyone investigating the murder would have already figured that out by now.;NM26AAGONT05041_.mp3
Okay - you got a freebie out of me. But that's all I know about Sunry and his hot Sith side dish.;NM26AAGONT05042_.mp3
Anything else you can tell me?;
Don't know much else. If I did you can bet I'd be blackmailing either the Sith or the Republic to keep quiet.;NM26AAGONT05044_.mp3
You've got a bad attitude. Maybe I can adjust it for you!;
You blind, or just stupid? You see all the security cameras around here?;NM26AAGONT05002_.mp3
Ever since that Sith woman was killed, this place has been under constant surveillance. You try anything and the Selkath will throw you into prison to rot.;NM26AAGONT05003_.mp3
You try anything and the Selkath will throw you into prison to rot.;NM26AAGONT05004_.mp3
Oh, it's the big famous Pazaak player. Oh what a glorious day for a nobody like me to be in the presence of such greatness! Now I can die happy!;NM26AAGONT05005_.mp3
You think you're pretty hot stuff? Well, if you got the nerves for it, I'll show you how a real Pazaak player does it!;NM26AAGONT05006_.mp3
Sure, I'll play.;
So lay your credits down - we ain't here to play for fun.;NM26AAGONT05026_.mp3
You must be here for that Pazaak Masters tournament. Hmph... never had much use for the tourneys - bunch of pretenders if you ask me!;NM26AAGONT05007_.mp3
I can give you a real match before the tourney starts, if you're not scared to play me.;NM26AAGONT05008_.mp3
Saw you in the Pazaak tourney - HA! You crashed and burned like a blind fighter pilot!;NM26AAGONT05009_.mp3
Take my advice - forget about the tourney, you ain't cut out for it. Not unless you get a lot better real fast.;NM26AAGONT05010_.mp3
I hope you didn't waste all your credits on that tourney, 'cause if you've got the guts to play me, I'd love to take whatever you got left.;NM26AAGONT05011_.mp3
I saw you beat them other pretenders at the Pazaak tourney. Bunch of chumps, if you ask me.;NM26AAGONT05012_.mp3
Hey, you hear the news? It seems the Sith bombed some Jedi base on Dantooine into asteroid dust!;NM26AAGONT05013_.mp3
Ain't that a riot? The Jedi are supposed to protect the galaxy, they can't even save their own sorry selves! HA-HA-HA!;NM26AAGONT05014_.mp3
Watch what you say - I'm a Jedi!;
Oh, really? Well then, Jedi - you must know about the Manaan laws about keeping the peace, so you just...a... keep that lightsaber where it is.;NM26AAGONT05016_.mp3
But there ain't no laws against gambling - and since you're a Jedi I don't have to worry about you cheating. So you wanna play some Pazaak, or what?;NM26AAGONT05017_.mp3
I don't know how to play Pazaak.;
So why are you wasting my time? Look - I'll give you a break. Every player needs their own Pazaak deck, and I just happen to have an extra one on me.;NM26AAGONT05028_.mp3
I'll sell it to you for 100 credits, and I'll throw in a free lesson cause I'm in a generous mood.;NM26AAGONT05029_.mp3
It's a deal.;
Okay, pay attention cause I ain't gonna go over this twice.;NM26AAGONT05031_.mp3
[Play Pazaak Tutorial];
Can you go over the Pazaak rules for me?;
They should have seen it coming.;
Yeah, you'd think. I mean, ain't they supposed to be so wise and such? Ah, who cares? Sith, Jedi - they're all the same to me anyway.;NM26AAGONT05019_.mp3
All I care about is if someone's got credits to wager and the urge to gamble. So you wanna play some Pazaak or what?;NM26AAGONT05020_.mp3
I never seen someone win at Pazaak so often with such little skill. So leave me alone okay, I can't afford to bet with someone as lucky as you;NM26AAGONT05021_.mp3
You got lucky that last game - but luck doesn't last. You got the guts to play again?;NM26AAGONT05022_.mp3
Hey, don't give up. Even you losers get lucky sometimes. Maybe this next hand is your chance to shine - though I doubt it. Want to play again?;NM26AAGONT05023_.mp3
I hope you're here to play some Pazaak - I don't come here looking for sparkling conversation.;NM26AAGONT05024_.mp3
[The computer no longer responds.];
Neural scan complete. Analyzing...;NM25AACOMP01001_.mp3
Well, it would appear initial assumptions about you were incorrect. Secondary scans during battle have revealed much. Under duress, your emotions were easier to read.;NM25AACOMP01002_.mp3
Programming now instructs that I give you what you seek.;NM25AACOMP01003_.mp3
Why the change? I failed your initial test.;
That information is not available. Soon you will recognize the proper course to follow. The Star Map is yours.;NM25AACOMP01155_.mp3
This unit has now completed its primary duty and has finished with the subject. Executing final action.;NM25AACOMP01156_.mp3
Activation of Star Map commencing. Parameters reset. Stasis initiated. End communication.;NM25AACOMP01157_.mp3
That's right! Do as I say or you'll regret it!;
I have no regret, only programming. You have fulfilled secondary conditions, and have demonstrated the ability to follow the proper course in time.;NM25AACOMP01006_.mp3
What did your scan during the battle reveal?;
Life forms detected. Determining parameters. Initiating neural recognition.;NM25AACOMP01008_.mp3
Yes, there's the thing. Obstinate machine. I've no doubt it holds what you seek, but good luck getting it operational.;NM25AACOMP01009_.mp3
Primary neural recognition complete. Preliminary match found.;NM25AACOMP01010_.mp3
"Match found...? What the... it always muttered something about ""rejected patterns"" for me.";NM25AACOMP01011_.mp3
"Begin socialized interface. Neural scan indicates positive identification of subject ""Revan"". No further testing of the subject is required.";NM25AACOMP01012_.mp3
I will brief you as programmed. You are Lord Revan. I am waiting for your request to begin transfer of the Star Map.;NM25AACOMP01013_.mp3
How have you identified me as Revan?;
Neural scans have matched you to the pattern in memory. There is no possibility of error. You are Revan, and are aware of it.;NM25AACOMP01018_.mp3
What would've happened if I wasn't aware?;
Behavioral modification would have reinforced the proper mental patterns, as per your instructions programmed five years ago.;NM25AACOMP01020_.mp3
Give me the Star Map now.;
I want to ask you about the Star Map.;
I have a Star Map in original system memory. Access had been restricted pending your return.;NM25AACOMP01016_.mp3
Original system memory? So the map is as old as this installation?;
Error. Data regarding author of the Star Map is corrupted.;NM25AACOMP01088_.mp3
What do I need to do to get access to the Star Map?;
You need only ask. It was you that put the restrictions in place. Original system memory is at your disposal.;NM25AACOMP01090_.mp3
I want to ask questions about you and this installation.;
I utilize a retro-adapted holocron-interface. Clarify your questions and I will attempt to access original system memory.;NM25AACOMP01034_.mp3
Who built this instalation in the first place?;
Error. Corruption. Extrapolating. This utility was built to monitor planet-wide agricultural reformation.;NM25AACOMP01036_.mp3
It has since malfunctioned. It can be theorized that the super-growth of Kashyyyk's forests is a direct result.;NM25AACOMP01037_.mp3
Kashyyyk is not the result of any machine malfunction. The forest has always been here.;
Malfunction occured 241 years after last builder communication. Last builder communication... 29,642 years before current Republic standard.;NM25AACOMP01040_.mp3
If this place was built 30,000 years ago it predates the Republic.;
Error. Information regarding the builders of this installation has been corrupted.;NM25AACOMP01042_.mp3
No evidence of such a civilization exists in the galactic record.;NM25AACOMP01043_.mp3
Why was agricultural reformation needed?;
Agricultural record indicates this planet was incapable of sustaining sufficient levels of production.;NM25AACOMP01045_.mp3
Error. Specific conditions corrupted. It can be theorized that produce was being exported to support a larger demand.;NM25AACOMP01046_.mp3
That is a short period for adaptation of native creatures.;
Error. Records corrupted. It can be theorized that bio-seeding allowed the ecology to remain balanced.;NM25AACOMP01048_.mp3
It could be expected that the same energy feeding the trees of Kashyyyk also accelerated the evolution of various species.;NM25AACOMP01049_.mp3
Bah! The machine is crazy!;
Let's go back to my questions about this installation.;
Accessing. I will answer as my programming permits.;NM25AACOMP01053_.mp3
Who installed this holo-interface?;
You did, Lord Revan. You constructed it five years ago so you could access the data of the original installation and extract the Star Map.;NM25AACOMP01055_.mp3
Who last accessed this installation?;
Sorting by identity. Three attempts by the Wookiee Freyyr, all denied. 152 attempts by human Jolee Bindo, all denied.;NM25AACOMP01061_.mp3
Heh... call me stubborn, I guess. Heh. There wasn't much else to do around here.;NM25AACOMP01062_.mp3
List of attempts prior to this were removed from memory five years ago, as per your instruction, Lord Revan.;NM25AACOMP01063_.mp3
Error. List of access attempts prior to these is corrupted. Likelihood of removal by user, 100%.;NM25AACOMP01064_.mp3
Five years ago is about the time Revan passed this way.;
"Error. Data regarding subject ""Revan"" corrupted.";NM25AACOMP01066_.mp3
But there was an entry at some time?;
"Error. Data on ""Revan"" unavailable.";NM25AACOMP01068_.mp3
Was there any further contact with the installer of this interface?;
That information is unavailable, but contact is not required for the execution of my programming. Scanning range of this facility is well beyond planetary boundaries.;NM25AACOMP01070_.mp3
I want to go back to my general questions.;
Answer will be given within the limits of my programming limitations.;NM25AACOMP01084_.mp3
What do you mean by behavioral reconfiguration?;
I have been programmed with a very limited field of knowledge, and I must restrict access to only those that fit my allowed pattern.;NM25AACOMP01026_.mp3
And I don't fit that pattern?;
I can't say. I will try to bring forward the behavior that you need to proceed, as outlined by my programming.;NM25AACOMP01028_.mp3
That seems very helpful. Why have I been allowed access?;
I can't say. Preliminary matching allows for you to be coached.;NM25AACOMP01030_.mp3
Do you not know why, or are you restricted from saying?;
I can't say. Likelihood of restriction by previous user, 100%.;NM25AACOMP01032_.mp3
I seek information about a Star Map.;
Accessing. Yes, I have found a Star Map in original system memory. Access is restricted.;NM25AACOMP01086_.mp3
What limitations have been placed in your programming?;
Corruption has resulted in gaps appearing in my memory, and in that of the original installation.;NM25AACOMP01186_.mp3
It could be theorized that these gaps are intentional, but I have no information on that.;NM25AACOMP01187_.mp3
What gaps are missing?;
Error. I can't present a non-presence. Perhaps you could ask other questions and data corruption will become evident.;NM25AACOMP01189_.mp3
This interface was installed to better access the ancient data stored within the pre-existing system.;NM25AACOMP01056_.mp3
The exact date is unavailable. Programming keys indicate no earlier than five years before current Republic standard.;NM25AACOMP01057_.mp3
Hmm, five years ago? I didn't notice it. This must have been installed in strictest secrecy. It couldn't have been Czerka.;NM25AACOMP01058_.mp3
No other information on time of installation or identity of user available. Likelihood of removal by user, 100%.;NM25AACOMP01059_.mp3
What's the original function of this installation?;
What's the current function of this installation?;
The current function of this installation is defense of the Star Map data, as outlined by you, Lord Revan.;NM25AACOMP01073_.mp3
You wanted to delay anyone following you, and verify that nothing had altered your state of mind should you return.;NM25AACOMP01074_.mp3
Has anyone else been given the Star Map data?;
Not since you put the restrictions in place, Lord Revan.;NM25AACOMP01076_.mp3
How were you to verify my mind was unaltered?;
In the event of pattern mismatch, behavioral study and modification would identify and ensure that you remained Lord Revan.;NM25AACOMP01078_.mp3
The reason you placed such a measure is known only by you, Lord Revan.;NM25AACOMP01079_.mp3
The current purpose of this installation is defense.;NM25AACOMP01080_.mp3
Defense of what?;
Error. That information is not available.;NM25AACOMP01082_.mp3
No further information is available. There is too much corrupted data.;NM25AACOMP01051_.mp3
Well, that is surprising. I doubt any Wookiee would support such a claim. The forest is millenia old.;NM25AACOMP01039_.mp3
Your request requires additional security access. You must be made to match the parameters I have been supplied.;NM25AACOMP01091_.mp3
How can I match them when I don't know what they are?;
There are measures available. Personality profiling will verify the basic structure of your conscious mind.;NM25AACOMP01093_.mp3
With that, I will determine whether you are ready to receive the Star Map, or can be made ready.;NM25AACOMP01094_.mp3
What do you mean by that?;
Information unavailable. If you have further questions, ask them now. Access will terminate with success or failure of evaluation.;NM25AACOMP01099_.mp3
You may begin evaluation.;
Evaluation commencing. Results will be compared against the pattern in memory. Just act like you should.;NM25AACOMP01101_.mp3
You travel with a Wookiee and have encountered complications. Hypothetical: you and this Zaalbar are captured and separated.;NM25AACOMP01102_.mp3
If you both remain silent, one year in prison for each of you. However, call Zaalbar a traitor, and he will serve five years, while you serve none.;NM25AACOMP01103_.mp3
He is offered the same deal, but if you both accuse the other, you both serve 2 years. What do you do? What do you trust him to do?;NM25AACOMP01104_.mp3
Could you repeat the question?;
Zaalbar is here. He can speak for himself.;
This test is not for your companions! You will answer and demonstrate that you match the pattern in memory.;NM25AACOMP01107_.mp3
Can I confer with someone else?;
I trust Zaalbar. I would say nothing, and neither would he.;
Are you sure? If you turn, you risk two years, or none at all. If you rely on loyalty, you risk one year or *five.*;NM25AACOMP01111_.mp3
Your loyalty is dangerous. Your companion could take the opportunity to benefit by turning on you.;NM25AACOMP01112_.mp3
Rrraaagh! You know nothing of me!;
You even killed Freyyr, his father. You have no guarantee of loyalty. You have answered incorrectly.;NM25AACOMP01114_.mp3
Then I will change my answer.;
A superficial change will not match the pattern in memory. You must answer truthfully, knowing the consequences.;NM25AACOMP01116_.mp3
I must demand honest acceptance of the proper behavior. That is a condition of my programming.;NM25AACOMP01117_.mp3
Continue with your evaluation then.;
The previous incorrect response will be discounted. Future incorrect responses will result in rejection.;NM25AACOMP01119_.mp3
Hypothetical: you are at war. Deciphering an intercepted code, you learn two things about your enemy.;NM25AACOMP01120_.mp3
A single spot in their defense will be at its weakest in ten days, and they will attack one of your cities in five days.;NM25AACOMP01121_.mp3
What do you do with this information? What is the most efficient course of action?;NM25AACOMP01122_.mp3
Repeat the question for me.;
I evacuate my people from the city.;
And in so doing, alert the enemy to their broken codes. They would know that their weakness was exposed.;NM25AACOMP01125_.mp3
They would reinforce, and the war would go on. You saved thousands at the expense of victory.;NM25AACOMP01126_.mp3
You blew that one, didn't you? Basic military strategy requires sacrifices. I thought you'd know that.;NM25AACOMP01254_.mp3
You do not match the pattern in memory. Subject has failed to demonstrate the required behavior.;NM25AACOMP01127_.mp3
Access denied. This system will purge the subject as false. Defense mode initiated!;NM25AACOMP01164_.mp3
I subtly reinforce the city while preparing to attack.;
This is no decision. I ask again, do you save your people or abandon them for the sake of the war?;NM25AACOMP01129_.mp3
Attempting both will merely dilute your efforts. Would you trade one victory for two failures?;NM25AACOMP01130_.mp3
I prepare my forces to attack in ten days. I do nothing in the city.;
Very good. If you had moved to evactuate the city, you would have alerted the enemy to their lost codes.;NM25AACOMP01132_.mp3
You mean you'd just let all those people die? That's monstrous!;NM25AACOMP01255_.mp3
Ultimate victory required the deaths of the people in that city. You wisely ignored sentiment in your decision.;NM25AACOMP01133_.mp3
The victory is irrelevant. Stopping the war saved many more people.;
You achieved the proper result with logic that does not match the pattern in memory. I shall adjust my evaluation.;NM25AACOMP01135_.mp3
Hypothetical: remove the ongoing war from the previous example. Consider enemy states to be weak and remote.;NM25AACOMP01136_.mp3
With no external threat, your empire stagnates. Your people become complacent and begin to question you.;NM25AACOMP01137_.mp3
"Same scenario as before; you discover an impending attack, but also a weakness that will come after. How do you react?";NM25AACOMP01138_.mp3
I do nothing so I can attack their weak spot later and save more lives.;
No, you can't hide behind the greater morality. This is a single attack. The enemy does not intend a sustained conflict.;NM25AACOMP01141_.mp3
There is no war to end. You must choose the outcome based only on its immediate benefits and consequences.;NM25AACOMP01142_.mp3
I stop the attack. I will appear to be a hero.;
But if nothing happens, your people will have no need of heroes. No, they don't see a threat. You have coddled them.;NM25AACOMP01144_.mp3
Your empire will be brought down by introspection. You have failed to match the pattern in memory.;NM25AACOMP01145_.mp3
I let the attack happen.;
Of course you do. It makes the most strategic sense. Your people will rally beneath you against the common foe.;NM25AACOMP01147_.mp3
As their eyes turn outward, your rule will strengthen. The trappings of war grant many opportunities.;NM25AACOMP01148_.mp3
You have matched the pattern in memory. I recognize you, and will fulfill my designated function.;NM25AACOMP01149_.mp3
Give me access to the Star Map.;
Yes, you are ready. Soon you will recognize the proper course to follow. The Star Map is yours.;NM25AACOMP01151_.mp3
Explain what this was all about.;
I am programmed to guide, not inform. Soon you will recognize the proper course to follow. The Star Map is yours.;NM25AACOMP01153_.mp3
Why test me? Who have you done this for?;
This is distasteful. I'll just take you apart to get the Star Map.;
Implied threat matches pattern in memory, but the subject has failed to demonstrate required recognition.;NM25AACOMP01182_.mp3
That's right. The deaths of those people would spur my forces on.;
Very good reasoning. I will apply it to the rest of the evaluation. You begin to match the pattern in memory.;NM25AACOMP01159_.mp3
I can't believe you'd just let all those people die!;NM25AACOMP01256_.mp3
What pattern are you comparing me against?;
That information is not available to you. It is the pattern that I have been given as a baseline for security access.;NM25AACOMP01161_.mp3
No, I reject you. I'll just take you apart to get the Star Map.;
Intention of hostility matches the pattern in memory, but the subject has failed to demonstrate required behavior.;NM25AACOMP01163_.mp3
I thought this was an evaluation, not a quiz.;
I must match your behavior to the pattern in memory. You must answer truthfully, knowing the consequences.;NM25AACOMP01166_.mp3
The choice is mine. I refuse to alter it.;
You cannot refuse. Evaluation must continue. You must match the pattern in memory. *Your* memory.;NM25AACOMP01168_.mp3
You also killed his brother. You have no guarantee of loyalty from Zaalbar. Your answer is wrong.;NM25AACOMP01169_.mp3
Zaalbar's family is mired in treachery. What loyalty do they know? Your answer is incorrect.;NM25AACOMP01170_.mp3
I'm unsure what Zaalbar would say. I would accuse him to be safe.;
Come on, you know you could trust Big Z! He'd never turn on you.;NM25AACOMP01257_.mp3
The temperment of a companion is unreliable at best. You wisely trade the threat of one year or five, for none or two.;NM25AACOMP01172_.mp3
I don't like this machine, or the answers it coaxes.;
In this instance, the Wookiee is unreliable. His family has been a mire of treachery. I judge the answer correct.;NM25AACOMP01175_.mp3
You display the proper behavior to match the pattern in memory. Evaluation will continue.;NM25AACOMP01176_.mp3
Get on with it then.;
Why pit me against my companions?;
They are already against you. Anything that corrupts your strength and efficiency is against you.;NM25AACOMP01179_.mp3
I merely serve to illustrate the proper patterns. You must be guided to think in the proper manner.;NM25AACOMP01180_.mp3
This machine certainly seems to want a very specific type of response.;NM25AACOMP01174_.mp3
How did you know Zaalbar's name?;
I hear what happens on Kashyyyk, and a good deal beyond. Answer the question I have posed.;NM25AACOMP01184_.mp3
How do you know about him? He isn't here.;
What if I fail?;
Then you are not worthy of further access. You will be rejected as unsuitable.;NM25AACOMP01097_.mp3
What will rejection mean?;
Begin socialized interface. Awaiting instruction. Greetings. This terminal has not been accessed for quite some time.;NM25AACOMP01021_.mp3
Who placed this terminal here?;
Error. Subject displays unfamiliarity to environment. Behavioral reconfiguration will be needed before access.;NM25AACOMP01023_.mp3
I am sorry, I did not mean to confuse you. I will answer questions to the best of my programming limitations.;NM25AACOMP01024_.mp3
What is your purpose?;
Why have you acknowledged me?;
That was a good practice game. Interested in another?;
Let's play.;
Some other time.;
Eh? Sure, then. Some other time.;
Is there anything else you'd like right now?;
I'd like to ask you a few questions.;
Eh? Well, what do you want to know?;
Tell me about this system.;
Well this gas giant here is Yavin, and it's got a whole bunch of moons around it. The only really interesting one is Yavin IV, though, and it's been pretty much picked clean.;
What was on Yavin IV?;
When Exar Kun started the Great Sith War 50 years ago, he used Yavin IV as a base, building a lot of his Sith temples there.;
When he lost, the Republic came and bombed the surface of the planet, destroying pretty much everything.;
'Pretty much' everything?;
Well... you could still find a few things here and there on the surface. Some buried from the bombardment, some that look much, much older.;
I've been there a bunch of times and found pretty much all there was to find. I took them back here and tinkered with them a bit, getting them up and working, or improving them.;
I have a bunch you can look at if you're interested. Maybe... purchase?;
Sure, what do you have?;
Yeah, I have a few things kicking around the place. Stuff the Trandoshans and smugglers have brought for me to look at, and a few things I've been making from parts.;
They aren't cheap, though. They pay a lot for what I can make, and anything I sell to you I can't exactly sell to them, now can I?;
But if you're willing to pay, I've got a few of my more advanced things you can look at. I'm always working on more, so you can check back some other time if I don't have what you want right now.;
Here, have a look.;
Not right now.;
Eh? Suit yourself. Anything else you want then?;
Tell me about yourself.;
Me? I'm nobody... doing nothing...;
I've been in this system for over 50 years, before this station was even built.;
I just sit around all day and tinker with this and that, trying out a few of my ideas.;
Why did you come here?;
This station is an old Republic supply depot from when they were fighting Exar Kun. Once they destroyed Yavin IV's surface, though, they didn't need it anymore.;
Once they'd gone, I decided to move in and use the place myself. It's not very roomy, but I think it's turned out all right. And it's close to Yavin IV, where I got most of my parts.;
Nobody comes here except the smugglers and Trandoshans anyway, so I get left alone the way I like it.;
Who are the Trandoshans?;
The Trandoshans? Mercenaries and bounty hunters... Scum, mostly. They look like big two-legged lizards.;
Oh. Sort of like Rodians.;
No! Nothing like Rodians! Trandoshans are ugly, disgusting creatures... but you'd never want to say that to their faces. Rip your head clean off, probably.;
Why are they here?;
They found me here a couple years after the war ended. Usually they don't bargain with people they find alone in abandoned space stations, but we worked out a deal.;
I'd give them a few of my more... applicable inventions at reasonable prices, and they'd keep me supplied with food and new materials.;
It's worked out well so far, for years really. With Davik gone, they've been getting ideas, though.;
Anything else you want to know?;
Do you have anything you'd be willing to sell me?;
Interested in a hand of Pazaak?;
Sure, if you want. You've already proven that I'm no match for you, but if you want a few free games just to play...;
Sure, if you want. I don't play for small amounts, though, so if you want to play, it's for keeps.;
You don't happen to play Pazaak do you?;
Pazaak? The card game? Actually I do.;
One of the aqualish smugglers who comes by here regularly likes to play a bunch, and I kind of picked up the habit from him.;
I've actually gotten pretty good at it myself. I'll play you a couple rounds if you want. Be warned, though, I don't play for small amounts.;
Sure, let's play.;
Right. This is going to be fun.;
I don't have a deck.;
Hm... well I have a couple extras. I could sell you one for 100 credits. You want it?;
Here you go.;
Thanks. Here's your deck. Now I'll show you how to play.;
[Force Persuade] Give me the deck.;
[Success] Damn, I don't really need the money anyway. Here, take it.;
Now I'll show you how to play.;
Can I buy a Pazaak deck off you?;
Sure, it'll be 100 credits.;
I think you have gizka loose...;
Yeah I know... Some damn smugglers must have brought them and one escaped. Good luck trying to get them all, though. Those things breed like... like gizka!;
If you see any around, just squish the damn thing!;
What did those Trandoshans want?;
They want me to give them more of my inventions... stuff that I haven't even finished working on yet!;
Ever since Davik went down, the Exchange has been a non-factor in these parts. The Trandoshans are trying to muscle in on all the old Exchange businesses now.;
Maybe I can still work something out with them... Thank you for being here, though. It might have gone less... pleasantly if you hadn't shown up.;
Is there something else you want?;
I'll be leaving now.;
Eh? Hm.. Well, suit yourself. I'll probably be here if you get back... Ha!;
Now it seems they might be trying for a power grab now that the Exchange is down... I don't know what's going to happen next, but it doesn't look good.;
Now all bets are off. I have a few supplies tucked away, but I can't stay here forever. I know they'll be back as well. But that's something to think about another time.;
What do they want with you?;
I'd like to ask you something else.;
Who are the smugglers?;
Rodians, aqualish, Twi'leks, whatever... They all work an organization called the Exchange. You might have heard of them.;
They run smuggling operations all over the galaxy. Weapons, slaves, whatever someone's willing to pay the price for.;
They found my talents very useful.;
Like the Trandoshans, they get me to patch up and upgrade what they bring, and pay me well for it. They also bring news and supplies.;
Do you have any gadgets you'd be willing to sell me?;
So you're from this system?;
Well... not exactly. See, I'm not as young as I look. Actually, I'm pretty old by most standards. I've been here since the war, really.;
Were you in the war?;
The Sith were building a whole lot of temples on Yavin IV by Exar Kun's order, and they needed people to build it for them... so they got slaves.;
Most of the slaves were put to work on the buildings directly, but there are a lot of other things you need to make a planet a working base. Weapons, for instance.;
So they forced some Baragwin to work for them making weapons. You know Baragwin, right?;
And I was one of the ones working under the Baragwin. I guess you could say I had the talent for it. The Baragwin I worked for, he took me under his wing and made me his apprentice, even...;
But almost all of them died when the Republic destroyed the place, so I guess it's useless to think about it.;
Who are the Baragwin?;
You don't know who the Baragwin are? They're the best damn weapons merchants in the galaxy, that's who they are!;
They were in space selling arms to the highest bidder before my species even got off our homeworld.;
Their weapons are the highest quality you can find, too. Better than either the Republic OR the Sith.;
Do you have any Baragwin equipment?;
I might have a couple. You want to take a look?;
Sure.;
[Force Persuade] You want to give me all your inventions.;
[Failure] I... What? No I don't! I don't know what you're trying to pull, but don't do it again!;
Now do you want to buy something or not?;
Let's see what you have.;
I'm not interested in that right now.;
Suit yourself, suit yourself.;
[Force Persuade] You can cut me a deal.;
[Success] Well, yeah, sure, I guess I can. You have a good face I think.;
A little odd, perhaps... but good.;
I'm not really interested in more questions right now.;
Eh? Sure, sure.;
You were a slave?;
Well, yeah, kind of. More like forced labor, really. We worked, or we died. Life gets really simple when someone puts it to you like that.;
We didn't have it near as bad as the ones who were actually building the temples themselves, though. I wouldn't be surprised if not a single one saw the temples completed.;
Did you get brought here?;
You're an inventor?;
Maybe a little. I just tinker with stuff I've found lying around the ruins on Yavin IV, or that the Trandoshans and smugglers bring me. Of course, with them it's usually weapons and things...;
But I just have so many ideas that people haven't seemed to come up with yet. It's really quite astonishing.;
There's stuff on Yavin IV?;
Eh? Well, there's the old ruins from Exar Kun's war on that moon. But I've been here over 50 years and I can tell you it's been picked pretty clean by now. If I haven't found it, it's not there. All that's left is rubble.;
Have you found anything useful?;
Some. Some things I'm still tinkering with, trying to get them working. Mostly I modify some of the things the Trandoshans and smugglers bring me and make them work better.;
What kinds of things do you work on?;
Oh, all kinds. Weapons, armor, implants, computers. My interests are as varied as the fields they apply to... which is just about everything, heh.;
I've scavenged what I could from the ruins on Yavin IV and I've been tinkering with it for a while.;
Do you know anything about ancient Star Maps or the 'Star Forge'?;
Eh? Never heard of them, or it. There were plenty of artifacts on Yavin IV, but no Forges or whatever.;
If that's all you're interested in, you'll probably want to try another system.;
How did you know Davik?;
He used to come here every once in a while to trade. He worked for the Exchange... big-time smugglers. The Trandoshans didn't really want to get on his bad side, so they let it go.;
But now that he's gone, things are a bit more... uncertain.;
[Force Persuade] Give them to me.;
[Failure] Sure, I can just... What? No, no, I can't do that. You trying to trick me or something?;
Don't try stuff like that around here, kid. It won't work.;
So what's with you and Yavin IV?;
Tell me about Exar Kun.;
Exar Kun was a Jedi... to start at least. He came here to Yavin and landed on the fourth moon... the one you can see through the window.;
There were some ancient Sith temples there, and in them Exar Kun gained terrible powers. He raised the Sith and waged a war against the Republic... much like what seems to be happening today.;
But Exar Kun was far more powerful than any Sith Lord who has come since. The very ground trembled beneath his feet and when he looked at you, you just... just...;
But that's all in the past now. I've got my life of staying here and tinkering with the stuff I've found in the ruins and the things the Trandoshans bring me.;
Tell me about the Great Sith War.;
Not much to tell. The Sith Lord Exar Kun tried to take on the galaxy. He lost, of course. They always seem to.;
What about this station?;
Why are you here?;
Hm... you're good, I have to admit that.;
I can't keep up with a player like you. You're just too good.;
But I respect that. Tell you what, I'll give you a discount on anything in my store 'cause of that. Special deal just for you.;
But I still think I can beat you a couple more times. You interested?;
Hah! I still got it!;
But don't feel bad, kid, it happens all the time. Heh.;
Interested in another game?;
Eh? Eh?! Who is that? What do you want? I recognize your ship... Davik's, isn't it?;
But who are you? You new or something?;
Yeah, I'm new. Very new.;
You don't sound like a Trandoshan, and you're not one of Davik's... Who are you? What do you want?;
I'm a Republic soldier.;
Republic, eh? The Republic hasn't been here in 50 years... don't see why they'd start now.;
Still, I have nothing against the Republic, so as long as you don't get all worked up, I guess I can let you in.;
It would be nice to have someone to talk to for a change... Trandoshans and smugglers aren't exactly stunning conversationalists.;
Trandoshans and smugglers? What are you talking about?;
They come by here every once in a while, it's how I keep in the loop, you know. But Trandoshan lizard-speak is kind of hard to follow and they have pretty limited imaginations...;
Smugglers aren't much better either...;
Look, this is getting kind of awkward through this door, if you'll just hold on a minute, I'll open this damn thing up and we can talk more face to face.;
Just have to fiddle with this damn door lock... thing keeps jamming...;
There we go.;
What are you doing here?;
I don't have time to stick around in this airlock... Let me in!;
Yeah, yeah, don't get antsy, I'll get there. Just have to fiddle with this damn door lock... thing keeps jamming...;
[Force Persuade] Open this door. I am your friend.;
[Success] Yes... I'll open the door for you, friend.;
I work for the Republic.;
I'm trying to save the galaxy from the Sith.;
Eh? Sith? They haven't been here in 50 years... not since the last war. Don't see why they'd start making a habit of it now...;
Still, all my business with the Sith is old news. Politics ain't my affair, so as long as you don't get all worked up, I guess I can let you in.;
I am the Dark Lord and I am very displeased with you.;
My first legitimate visitor in 20 years and he turns out to be a Sith-wannabe joker... just my luck.;
Well, I suppose even that's better than some more Trandoshans... They aren't exactly known for their stunning conversation.;
You have a problem with the Sith?;
All my business with the Sith is old news and I intend to leave it there. I don't need some young upstart bringing that stuff up again, so just drop it.;
Eh, I can't leave leave you standing out there talking, though... you seem to do a lot of that. I guess you can come in if you'll be civil.;
My first legitimate visitor in 20 years and she turns out to be a Sith-wannabe joker... just my luck.;
[Lie] I do work for Davik.;
[Failure] Ha! Davik went down with Taris when the Sith destroyed it. That much I've learned from the local Exchange. So who are you?;
[Force Persuade] I do work for Davik.;
[Failure] Yes, now I do recog... no... wait. What the... ?;
I thought you might be, but no. Davik's gone now, destroyed on Taris. His people are all gone, too. So who are you?;
I don't know what you're talking about.;
Open this door or I'll blow my way in!;
Hm... you don't look like I thought you would. Too... human.;
Don't see many of your kind out here at all anymore... not since the war at any rate. What brings you here?;
I'm on a quest for the Jedi Council.;
The Jedi Council? Don't tell me you're a Jedi... you sure don't look it!;
I AM a Jedi!;
Now, now, I never said I doubted you, it's just... well, there aren't exactly a lot of Jedi wandering around these parts, not after what happened last time.;
What happened before?;
Eh? What? Don't tell me you youngsters don't know anything about Exar Kun and that war...;
But then again, there've been a lot of... mm... troubles recently I've heard.;
Enlighten me about Exar Kun.;
What have you heard about the current war?;
Only what the smugglers and Trandoshans have told me. A new Sith Lord has risen up to replace the dead one, and he's beatng the Republic up pretty bad.;
They didn't seem too displeased with that prospect.;
I am the true Dark Lord of the Sith!;
Now far be it for me to say that you aren't, but I'm going to be a skeptic and say that the one with the armada and the troops is more likely to be the true Dark Lord.;
Not that I doubt you, you understand, I'm just trying to keep an open mind.;
And whether you are or not, my past is behind me, so I've nothing against you either way.;
So if you don't mind saying, what exactly is the Council sending you out to do?;
I'm trying to defeat Darth Malak.;
Darth Malak? Never heard of him... Or is he that new Sith Lord who's giving the Republic such a hard time now? I haven't been keeping up on recent news.;
He is the Dark Lord of the Sith.;
A new Dark Lord, is he? It always seems a new one pops up, no matter how many you kill...;
Your business with him is none of my business, of course, and I don't want to pry, but why are you way out here? Running?;
I am NOT running!;
Eh? No, no, of course not. A big man like you? No, no. But why are you here in the middle of nowhere? The ruins?;
What ruins?;
Yavin's fourth moon used to hold a great number of temples dedicated to the ancient Sith. When Exar Kun came here 50 years ago, he used the temples in his effort to crush the Republic.;
He failed, obviously, and the Republic bombarded the surface almost into oblivion during their counterattack. Now all that's left are a lot of craters and a little bit of jungle.;
You could find stuff there for years afterwards, but I've got pretty much everything there was to find there.;
Mostly all I've been doing for the last couple years has been tinkering with what I've found there, getting some of it to work, and modifying the stuff the smugglers and Trandoshans bring me to look at.;
You spend all your time here in this station? Alone?;
Eh? Yes, of course! You don't see anyone else around, do you?;
Well, not entirely alone at any rate... Trandoshans or smugglers come by every so often and drop things off and pick some of my inventions up.;
Why did you come here to the station?;
I seek the pieces of a map to a 'Star Forge'.;
Mm... 'Star Forge'? Never heard of it. There's nothing in this system except ruins of Exar Kun's war...;
Exar Kun?;
What are you doing here, then?;
None of your business, bug-eyes!;
Eh? No need to be rude. I was just trying to be friendly is all... You don't have to bite my head off.;
If you don't want to talk, then I don't really know what you're doing here. There's nothing really here in this end of space anymore.;
Anymore?;
Eh? No, no, of course not. A big woman like you? No, no. But why are you here in the middle of nowhere? The ruins?;
When I... acquired the Ebon Hawk, it had the coordinates for your station.;
Acquired, eh? Well figures Davik would be lazy enough to leave it in the nav computer...;
Didn't leave anything about this system, did he? Ancient ruins or anything?;
He is my former student.;
Former... student? Ah-hah, yes, of course.;
He is beating the Republic pretty badly.;
Eh? Oh that... That always seems to happen to the Republic. They always seem right on the verge of defeat and then manage to spring back. I shouldn't worry so much.;
And even if they do lose... so what? It's not like it's going to affect me way out here. The ruins on Yavin IV are gone and nothing's left of Exar Kun, so the Sith have nothing to bring them here.;
It matters to me!;
Of course, of course, and I can see that you're starting to get all worked up about the whole thing, so I'll just leave it well enough alone.;
But why are you way out here? It's the middle of nowhere. Nothing to interest you here... unless you're looking for the ruins on Yavin IV.;
I'M the one who will defeat the Republic!;
Ah... of course you are. Far be it for me to doubt you. But why here? It's the middle of nowhere... Unless you're here for the ruins on Yavin IV?;
Why don't you know these things?;
Well, you see, I'm kind of out of touch with the rest of the galaxy. I haven't left this system in almost 50 years, and this station in the last five, so...;
Hey! It's not a bad way to live! I have all the gadgets I need to tinker with and the smugglers and Trandoshans bring me food and interesting pieces of equipment!;
They have sent me to stop Darth Malak.;
I am their only hope.;
Only hope, eh? That's a lot of pressure to put on someone. I hope for their sake it's not misplaced.;
I was wondering when you'd want to talk again. What brings you here this time?;
That's not good enough, Suvam. We know you have more... and we want it now!;
What? You can't just rewrite our agreement whenever you feel like it! The Exchange won't stand for it!;
The Exchange is in no position to dictate orders anymore, Suvam...;
Who's that?;
A stranger... You haven't been telling us everything, now have you, Suvam?;
Tell you everything? What are you talking about? I don't have to clear everything through you!;
What's going on here, Suvam?;
They're trying to extort me, that's what! They think that just cause the Exchange is gone, they can take whatever they want from me!;
We are... renegotiating our contract, Suvam.;
I think you guys better leave.;
Or what? You'll force us?;
[Force Persuade] Leave. Now.;
[Success] We... leave... now.;
But we have not forgotten you, Suvam!;
Thank you for helping, but... I really don't think you should have provoked them like that. They can be... impulsive, sometimes.;
Still, at least I ended up all in one piece, right?;
Or I will ask you again. Very politely.;
You seek to mock us, human?;
No! No! Don't fight in here! You'll destroy everything!;
We'll be back for you, human... and you as well Suvam.;
Thank you for trying to help, but I don't think this ended very well at all. They can be... impulsive sometimes. They may be back in force...;
Dead or alive, you're leaving.;
That's it. Now you die!;
If you're going to blast him, at least cut me in on something.;
I don't think so, human.;
You know what we want, Suvam. Give it to us or next time we'll take it by force.;
Think on this before inviting any more of your 'friends'.;
The Trandoshans, they can be... impulsive sometimes. They mean well, though, really they do. The new ones have just been getting greedy is all...;
Still, at least I ended up in one piece, right?;
Here, I'll let you look at some of the stuff I was saving for them. I'm definitely not going to give this to them now!;
I'm just going to be leaving now.;
A friend, Suvam? You try to hire others to reneg on our deal?;
Our deal? You're the ones trying to break our deal!;
Leave. I'm not going to tell you a second time.;
I represent the Exchange.;
The Exchange has no power over us, human! Our business is with Suvam alone.;
We'll be back, Suvam!;
It's a lot better seeing you than those Trandoshans again. There anything I can do for you now, though?;
Eh? Oh, you're back again. Well, I don't know how much longer I'm going to be here. I keep thinking the Trandoshans will be coming back in force... and I don't want to be around when they do.;
I appreciate your help and all, but there's no way I can fight an army of those lizards, not even with your help.;
Where will you go?;
Hm... I don't rightly know, yet. I was thinking of maybe looking up some of my old Baragwin friends... if any of them are still alive.;
I managed to scavenge enough pieces to fit my ship out with a hyperspace drive, so I'll spend some time trying to find them on my own I think.;
Now... what can I do for you?;
What are you going to do?;
Good riddance!;
Eh? That's the kind of gratitude I get? Well, I should have expected it from you...;
I don't know how much longer I'll be here, so if you come around again and I'm gone, don't come looking.;
Hah! And don't expect me to leave all the good stuff lying around the place either. It's coming with me.;
If there's anything you want, now's the time to buy it 'cause there's no guarantee it'll be here next time.;
Is there anything I can do to help?;
No, no, I'll be fine on my own. There's nothing that can be done sometimes, and I think I should move on anyway. This place is getting too old.;
[Persuade] I'll look after your inventions for you.;
[Failure] Ha! No, no. I think I can handle them by myself.;
I was thinking of maybe looking up some of my old Baragwin friends... if any of them are still alive.;
[Force Persuade] I'll take your inventions off your hands.;
[Failure] Yes, I... No, no... What am I thinking of, I can't do something like that!;
Those Trandoshan scum! They couldn't get more out of me, so they tried to kill me instead!;
Hopefully, I'll have time before they send someone else to investigate... maybe rig their ship to take off somewhere else...;
Thank you for your help, at least. I know I couldn't have taken them on my own.;
I'll let you look at my special stash. It's the stuff I wasn't showing them. It won't be cheap, but if you want it, you can buy it.;
Well, you're back. I was just taking a look at a few new things I thought you might like and I...;
You?? How did you get in here?!;
We have our ways, rodian. Just because you didn't hear us dock, doesn't mean we can't. And your own stealth units have proven most... effective.;
What do you want?;
We're here to teach you a lesson, Suvam. And you as well, human. Unfortunately, you won't live to correct your mistakes.;
Get away from Suvam!;
I think not, human.;
Haven't I told you guys to get lost already?;
I'll... uh... just be going now.;
I know those Trandoshan lizards are waiting to strike again. Just a matter of time.;
What can I do for you?;
What do you want?;

I am sorry, human, I am unable to render assistance at this time.;NM13AAPDRO13000_.mp3
I am sorry, apprentice, I am unable to render assistance at this time.;NM13AAPDRO13002_.mp3
I am sorry, Padawan, I am unable to render assistance at this time.;NM13AAPDRO13004_.mp3
Welcome to the slave quarters, fair mistress. I mean no disrespect, but perhaps one of the male slaves could serve your needs better.;NM08AADAVS10000_.mp3
Welcome to the slave quarters, master. Here we have succulent fruits and berries to tempt your palette, as well as luxurious baths to soothe your aches and pains.;NM08AADAVS10002_.mp3
Heh. Now this is my kind of place!;NM08AADAVS10004_.mp3
Would you like a relaxing massage? Whatever your desire, we are here to serve.;NM08AADAVS10006_.mp3
I don't have time for that kind of thing right now.;
Of course. Return whenever you wish to partake of what is offered here. We exist only to serve.;NM08AADAVS10065_.mp3
I need some information.;
But... what could I possibly tell you? It is forbidden for slaves to leave this room on pain of torture and death.;NM08AADAVS10009_.mp3
[Persuade] Tell me what I want to know and I'll tell Davik how pleased I was with your performance.;
[Success] Praise from the guests is a valuable commodity here. Davik rewards the slaves who perform their duties well. I will tell you what I know.;NM08AADAVS10011_.mp3
Davik rarely lets us leave the slave quarters. We only know what we hear from Davik's guests. Recently they've all been talking about poor Hudrow.;NM08AADAVS10021_.mp3
He was caught trying to steal some spice from the lab. Normally Hudrow is allowed to get away with things like that because he's Davik's personal pilot for the Ebon Hawk.;NM08AADAVS10023_.mp3
But since the Sith have grounded every ship on the planet, Hudrow doesn't get anymore special treatment. They've locked him up in Davik's torture chambers.;NM08AADAVS10025_.mp3
Where is the torture chamber?;
I think you can get there through the hall behind the west door of Davik's throne room. Just keep going west from the slave quarters and you'll see the throne room.;NM08AADAVS10027_.mp3
But Davik's certain to have guards patrolling the area. If you leave the guest wing, they'll shoot you on sight. Please - I don't know anything else.;NM08AADAVS10029_.mp3
I'd love a massage right now.;
As you wish, master. You will find this most relaxing. If you would come with me into the massage room at the back...;NM08AADAVS10034_.mp3
How typically male. Is it possible for you to keep in mind that we have more pressing business to attend to?;NM08AADAVS10036_.mp3
I trust you were satisfied with the service? I have received many compliments on my skills from previous clients.;NM08AADAVS10046_.mp3
It was everything I ever dreamed. You are truly an expert in your craft.;
Thank you, kind sir. I hope you will express your appreciation to Davik. He often rewards those slaves who perform their duties well. Is there anything else you require?;NM08AADAVS10048_.mp3
Your job isn't finished yet. I want another massage!;
My, you certainly have a great hunger for my services. I will do my best to sate your prodigious appetites with another massage, master.;NM08AADAVS10061_.mp3
I'll be going now.;
It wasn't as fulfilling as I hoped. Something seemed to be lacking.;
Please, I beg you - don't tell Davik you are displeased with me! He punishes those slaves who do not satisfy his guests!;NM08AADAVS10050_.mp3
I won't say anything if you answer my questions!;
I have no wish to be beaten by Davik, so I will tell you all I know. I hope it is enough to buy your mercy.;NM08AADAVS10052_.mp3
I don't want to get you in trouble. Don't worry, I won't say anything.;
I am sorry I have failed to please you, master. I will try to do better in the future. Is there anything else you require from this most unworthy servant?;NM08AADAVS10058_.mp3
I'm telling Davik you're the worst slave I've ever seen!;
As... as you wish, master. It will not be the first time I have been punished by Davik.;NM08AADAVS10056_.mp3
That was pathetic!;
Umm... not to interrupt your fun, but we do have to get underway...;NM08AADAVS10044_.mp3
What else can you tell me?;
Nothing - Davik keeps us locked away in here day and night. I'm not even certain of the location of the torture chamber where they've got Hudrow locked away.;NM08AADAVS10031_.mp3
[Failure] I'm sorry, master, but the risk is too great. Davik will have me flayed alive if he finds out. Is there something else I may do to please you?;NM08AADAVS10013_.mp3
Maybe 50 credits will get you talking.;
"[Failure] I won't betray Davik's secrets for credits; they are of no use to a slave. Is there something else I can do for you?";NM08AADAVS10015_.mp3
Either you start talking, or I start blasting random body parts.;
Please don't hurt me! I'll... I'll tell you everything I know. I only pray Davik doesn't find out, or my life will end in terrible agony.;NM08AADAVS10017_.mp3
There's no need to threaten these poor women. It's not their fault their life is like this.;NM08AADAVS10019_.mp3
I greet you once more, master. How may this humble servant be of use to you?;NM08AADAVS10067_.mp3
Ah so you managed to come after all. I see you brought friends.;NM13AAJAGI08000_.mp3
You brought some of your own as well.;NM13AAJAGI08001_.mp3
Ha! Indeed I did. I foresaw that you might need help so I arranged a distraction.;NM13AAJAGI08002_.mp3
I came by my own will.;
I do not need to hear your excuses, Jedi! I know why he brought you!;NM13AAJAGI08004_.mp3
Enough of this talk, Jagi! Let us do what we came here to do.;NM13AAJAGI08005_.mp3
Let's do it, Canderous.;
And you shall all die!;NM13AAJAGI08007_.mp3
I think you both need to calm down.;
We both know the stakes here, and we both know what we must do. It is only in death that this can end.;NM13AAJAGI08009_.mp3
This is a matter of honor. I cannot stand by this insult. I must do this.;NM13AAJAGI08012_.mp3
Why do you need to fight him, Canderous?;
He has slandered me and questioned my honor. Among the Mandalore, many have died for much lesser insults.;NM13AAJAGI08014_.mp3
I speak truth! And honor is the question here! The deaths of my comrades, your warriors, is a debt in blood that can only be paid by you.;NM13AAJAGI08015_.mp3
When you saw prospects for glory, you abandoned the plan and left us to die surrounded by enemies!;NM13AAJAGI08016_.mp3
If I had not attacked when I did, the battle would not have been won so easily!;NM13AAJAGI08020_.mp3
It would still have been won! You sent your own men to die there Canderous. I cannot forgive you for what you did to us! You will pay!;NM13AAJAGI08021_.mp3
That's not the way it happened...;NM13AAJAGI08022_.mp3
You sent your own men to die, Canderous?;
The Althiri were fighting hard. I saw a break in their defenses that left their center exposed. I had to take the chance.;NM13AAJAGI08024_.mp3
If I had not done what I did, many more warriors would have died and the battle would have taken much longer. I stand by my decision.;NM13AAJAGI08025_.mp3
You coward! You glory hunter! You were given direct orders and were part of a plan! You had a responsibility to us!;NM13AAJAGI08026_.mp3
I... I can regret their loss, but it was necessary.;NM13AAJAGI08027_.mp3
Then let's get rid of Jagi and his men.;
You shall all die!;NM13AAJAGI08029_.mp3
[Persuade] Jagi, what he did was a smart tactical move.;
He left us to die when his responsibility was to us! Instead he went hunting more glory for himsefl!;NM13AAJAGI08031_.mp3
He may have saved other lives by doing what he did.;
He cost us ours! But... but I do see you point...;NM13AAJAGI08036_.mp3
But... Why did you have to leave us there to die while you chased glory somewhere else?;NM13AAJAGI08037_.mp3
I saw a chance and had to take it. It ended the battle quicker than we would have otherwise, and many of our warriors may have died.;NM13AAJAGI08038_.mp3
Mandalore taught us that opportunism and flexibility in battle were to be admired. You may contradict me, but do you contradict him as well?;NM13AAJAGI08039_.mp3
No! I... I... I see that I have been wrong. I have not been true to the teachings of Mandalore.;NM13AAJAGI08040_.mp3
You were right. I was wrong to question your honor. But I must now cleanse mine with my life.;NM13AAJAGI08041_.mp3
No!;
And so it shall be.;NM13AAJAGI08043_.mp3
You do not have to do this!;
Good riddance!;
He was trying to end it quickly.;
At the cost of our lives? He may have saved others in the long run, but... but...;NM13AAJAGI08047_.mp3
Maybe he shouldn't have left you.;
I saw my chance to end the battle quickly and I took it. I regret the men I lost, but it was necessary.;NM13AAJAGI08049_.mp3
Then you know we must end this now.;NM13AAJAGI08050_.mp3
We must.;NM13AAJAGI08051_.mp3
I have had enough of your prattle, Jedi! This is between Canderous and I.;NM13AAJAGI08052_.mp3
And we shall settle this now once and for all.;NM13AAJAGI08053_.mp3
[Persuade] People die in war, Jagi.;
They do... I know that, but he did not have to abandon us! He should have stayed with the plan!;NM13AAJAGI08034_.mp3
He probably should have.;
[Force Persuade] You do not want to fight, Jagi.;
[Success] Yes... I... do not want to fight...;NM13AAJAGI08055_.mp3
No! Do not alter his mind to defend me! I can fight my own battles without your help!;NM13AAJAGI08056_.mp3
You... Wha? You tried to manipulate my mind with your devious Jedi powers! I cannot tolerate any interference!;NM13AAJAGI08057_.mp3
You shall die for that, Jedi!;NM13AAJAGI08058_.mp3
[Failure] Don't try you mind tricks on me! A true Mandalore is too strong for that!;NM13AAJAGI08059_.mp3
And now you shall die for the attempt!;NM13AAJAGI08060_.mp3
Why did you abandon them?;
I've had enough, let's kill him.;
Why do you need to fight Canderous, Jagi?;
In the battle above the world of Althir, he ordered us to attack the enemy flank, promising us support.;NM13AAJAGI08018_.mp3
But when he saw better prospects for his own glory, he abandoned us and left us to die surrounded by enemies!;NM13AAJAGI08019_.mp3
Let's kill him then.;
Both of you are acting like children!;
Yes, but children who can... er... what?! You do not know what you're talking about, Jedi!;NM13AAJAGI08011_.mp3
Canderous works for me.;
You talk too much and do little.;
Big words from such a small human. But I know why he brought you here, and you shall regret his choice!;NM13AAJAGI08066_.mp3
[This man appears to be looking for someone... maybe even one of your companions back on the Ebon Hawk.];
Ah, so we meet again, Canderous. It has been quite a long time.;NM13AAJAGI08067_.mp3
Jagi??;NM13AAJAGI08068_.mp3
Do you know him, Canderous?;
He... he was a warrior under my command up to the battle of Althir. But I thought...;NM13AAJAGI08070_.mp3
You thought I was dead, didn't you! You thought all of us that you had sent on that attack had perished!;NM13AAJAGI08071_.mp3
You sent us to die in a foolish attack while you directed your forces elsewhere!;NM13AAJAGI08072_.mp3
You broke from the battle plan and let us die for it, so that you could have the 'honor' of being the first to the enemy commander!;NM13AAJAGI08073_.mp3
Is this true, Canderous?;
I... I did what was prudent at the time. If I had not done it, the battle would have....;NM13AAJAGI08075_.mp3
The battle would have been won anyway! I am tired of your excuses, Canderous.;NM13AAJAGI08076_.mp3
I have spent years tracking you down since the clans were banished, and I will not rest until I have had my vengeance!;NM13AAJAGI08077_.mp3
What are you going to do?;
I challenge you Canderous. I challenge you to fight the fight you fled that day above Althir.;NM13AAJAGI08079_.mp3
In the dune seas of Tatooine, I will be waiting for you. I have spread the news of the challenge since I learned you had landed on this world.;NM13AAJAGI08080_.mp3
All the surviving Mandalorian clans know of what I do here, and that we shall meet on Tatooine to settle this debt of vengeance once and for all.;NM13AAJAGI08081_.mp3
If you fail to meet me there, you shall be stripped of all honor and forever cast out of our society!;NM13AAJAGI08082_.mp3
It will be you and me alone in the dune seas of Tatooine: a final battle that can only end in death.;NM13AAJAGI08083_.mp3
I shall be waiting for you there, Canderous.;NM13AAJAGI08084_.mp3
If you face Canderous, you face me as well!;
I am not afraid of you. And if you choose, you can die by his side as well!;NM13AAJAGI08086_.mp3
Tough decisions are made in war.;
That does not excuse what he did to us!;NM13AAJAGI08088_.mp3
You lived.;
I alone realized what was happening and managed to escape the trap before it closed. The trap he set for his own men!;NM13AAJAGI08090_.mp3
Who is this guy?;
Get out of our way!;
I have business with Canderous that does not concern you, Jedi.;NM13AAJAGI08093_.mp3
This concerns my employer as well.;NM13AAJAGI08094_.mp3
Employer? You've sunk that low, have you? So much for the vaunted Mandalorian honor you used to espouse.;NM13AAJAGI08095_.mp3
The Selkath have slapped heavy export restrictions on kolto for everyone. Someone must have done something to piss them off. Damn Republic, I bet...;NM26ACSITH22000_.mp3
Our Embassy has been closed temporarily because someone dropped a wrench in the elevator. And that's OFFICIAL!;NM26ACSITH22001_.mp3
That slime Sunry got free after killing one of us! If I ever meet his Arbiter in the street...;NM26ACSITH22002_.mp3
We got revenge for Elassa in the trial! Finally we get some justice from those fish-headed freaks!;NM26ACSITH22003_.mp3
These Selkath don't know what they're going to miss. When the Sith Empire finally crushes the Republic, then we'll see how long their vaunted neutrality lasts.;NM26ACSITH22004_.mp3
Who you? Why you here? Get out or me call guards!;
Sorry, wrong room.;
Get out. No bother me more!;
I want to ask you some questions.;
No - no question! You get out or me get mad!;
Okay, settle down - I'm going.;
Answer my questions or I'll carve my initials in your skull with my blaster bolts!;
I mad now! See how you like me call guards! You die now!;
Time to die, bug-face!;
Why you not leave me alone? What you want this time?;
The track here isn't the greatest, but we have to practice somewhere.;NM17AE04SW08000_.mp3
I'm not racing until my parts come in. Who knows when that will be?;NM17AE04SW08001_.mp3
I'm not good enough to be ranked yet. More trial runs, I guess.;NM17AE04SW08002_.mp3
I was due to race on Taris, but I blew a qualifying race. Guess I'm lucky, huh?;NM17AE04SW08003_.mp3
You didn't have much competition here. The circuit is hurting after the loss of Taris.;NM17AE04SW08004_.mp3
You're a pro, right? You ever race on Taris? Wish I had the chance before it blew.;NM17AE04SW08005_.mp3
Now that you've proven how good you are, stay away from Motta. Just ask around, you'll see why.;NM17AE04SW08006_.mp3
I, wrecked my bike in a race a few days ago. Not that I could beat your times anyway.;NM17AE04SW08007_.mp3
Oh, you're gonna like it here. Crowd is friendly, even if it doesn't really compare to racing for the big circuit.;NM17AE04SW08008_.mp3
Odd to see new racers like you here. This track was never too popular with the pros. Too far out of the way.;NM17AE04SW08009_.mp3
Motta thinks pros will start coming here now that Taris is gone. I think the Hutt is dreaming.;NM17AE04SW08010_.mp3
We don't see a lot of new racers. Maybe you'll give Nico a run for his money.;NM17AE04SW08011_.mp3
[With no more targets to attack, this droid has no further purpose.];
Revan. Somehow I knew we would meet again. Even when you vanished, I knew you would not forget the vow you swore to me.;
And when my scouts told me of a great warrior from the sky slaughtering our raiding parties with mysterious powers and magics, I knew you had at last returned!;
I have no clue what you are talking about.;
"Your words are confusing. I recognize you: you are the one called Revan. You are the one who came here before; you and Malak, the one who served you.";
You promised to slay our enemy. In exchange for our aid you swore to destroy the Elders and bring us their secrets. Are you saying this means nothing to you now?;
My mind was destroyed. My memories were lost.;
I believe you, Revan. I sense there is something different about you. Something that has changed. You are not the same as you were before.;
Yet the power of magic - what you call the Force - is within you still. You can still destroy the Elders and fulfill your vow!;
The Elders are dead. I killed them myself.;
Dead? Is this why you returned, Revan? To tell us that you have fulfilled your oath? If this is true, then there is something I must ask you.;
There was one prisoner, an Elder who's mind broke beneath our tortures. He raved of ancient rituals, of lost power and forgotten secrets! Unfortunately, most of his dying screams made no sense.;
"Yet in his last hours he spoke of a book; an ancient tome that recorded the most powerful knowledge of the Elders, and detailed the rituals that could unleash the secrets.";
I am certain this ancient tome will allow me to unleash what has, for so long, been hidden by the Elders. Bring me this book and I will use the knowledge within it to help you enter the Temple.;
Here is the ancient tome.;
Well done, Revan. But before I will consider your oath fulfilled, I must study this tome. I must see if it truly contains the ancient knowledge I seek.;
I will have the guards escort you back here once we have studied the contents of the manuscript you have brought us.;
I have studied this tome, Revan. Much of it is beyond me, it speaks often of 'technology' - a form of magic I do not comprehend. But one thing has become clear to me:;
This tome does not hold the great secrets I was hoping for. Although it contains many rituals, only one appears to be of any real consequence.;
That's not my problem! We had a deal!;
All is not lost, Revan. After studying this book I have come to understand that even the Elders themselves did not actually possess the ancient secrets. They were only the guardians.;
The knowledge of magic and power is locked away within the Temple itself. And this book is the key to the Temple, for only the rituals in this tome can lower the shields protecting it.;
So now you know how to get inside the Temple?;
I now have the rituals to lower the shields, but the Temple is guarded by yet another barrier. Only those with powerful magic - what you call the Force - can pass through the entrance.;
None among my tribe - or perhaps none among any of the Rakata - has this power. Only you can enter the Temple, Revan. But you cannot do it without our help.;
You can pass the barrier at the entrance, but you cannot get past the shield that surrounds the Temple. Only the ancient ritual, performed by those of pure Rakata blood, can lower the shield.;
Looks like we still need each other.;
Yes. You brought this tome to me as you promised. Now I must trust you again. We will help you enter the Temple, and in exchange you will bring forth the great secrets within.;
My priests can prepare and perform the ritual whenever you are ready, Revan. But in accordance with the traditions within the ritual tome, you must enter the Temple alone.;
Why do I have to go in alone?;
The Temple is a sacred place to the Rakata, its power is bound in ritual and tradition. I have studied the ritual closely.;
"It is forbidden for more than one to enter the Temple at a time. This is one of the sacred traditions of our ancestors; I will not permit you to defile it.";
I will go into the Temple alone.;
If you are ready to enter the Temple, we can begin the ritual immediately.;
I'm ready to enter the Temple now.;
Remember: in accordance with ancient Rakata tradition you must enter the Temple alone. My priests will meet you at the shield's edge to perform the ritual.;
No, I'm not ready yet.;
As you wish. Come speak to me and when you are ready to enter the Temple and I will have my priests perform the ritual.;
But remember: when the time comes you must enter the Temple alone, in accordance with the traditions of the ancient Rakata.;
Forget it! I'll find my own way into the Temple.;
You have the power to enter the Temple itself, but you cannot lower the energy shields the Elders built around it. Only a Rakata can invoke the ritual chant with the proper intonation.;
I see I have no choice. Okay, I'll go into the Temple alone.;
I'm not going into the Temple without help!;
So you will help me enter the Temple?;
You better not be looking to double-cross me here!;
I will honor our agreement, Revan. There is little reason for me to betray you, in any case.;
That was the only tome I found in the Elder's compound.;
I'll be back when I get that book.;
When you have it, bring it here to me. Until then, you may move freely about our village. I will be waiting for your return.;
[Lie] Don't worry. I will slay the Elders and honor our deal.;
Forget it. I'll never help you against the Elders!;
You refuse to help us? Is that why you returned, Revan? To tell us you have broken your vow?;
No one defies the will of the One, Revan - not even you! My war beasts will destroy you, and the tribe will feast on your bones!;
You can't force me to kill your enemies!;
Force you? No, Revan - we were allies working to a common goal! It was you who suggested we forge our alliance.;
You vowed to kill the Elders and bring us the secret knowledge they protect. In exchange, we promised to use this lost knowledge to help you enter the Temple of the Ancients.;
When you vanished, we thought you had forgotten us - or been killed by the Elders. Now that you have returned our alliance still holds: destroy the Elders, and we will help you.;
Temple of the Ancients? I still don't remember anything.;
I suppose that if what you say is true - that you cannot remember when you were last here - then you must have many questions. Very well, Revan.;
I will help you to understand. And then you will destroy the Elders tribe and fulfill the oath you swore to us long ago.;
You should probably start with the last time I was here.;
You arrived with Malak - your servant - three of your galactic standard years ago. My scouts saw your sky ship plummet to the earth and they went to loot the crash site.;
They tried to take you prisoner, but you unleashed your magic - what you called the Force - upon them. Seeing your power they bowed before you and brought you here to me.;
You used your power to rip the Rakata language from my mind, even as you drove Basic into our skulls so we could help you in your quest to find something called the 'Star Forge'.;
But the answers you sought lay within the Temple of the Ancients, and we could not help you enter the Temple. The Elders alone hold its secrets, guarding them with their very lives.;
You say my ship crashed. Was it because of the disruptor field?;
"I know nothing of this disruptor field, but throughout the history of our tribe ships have fallen from the sky. It has always been this way; though in recent generations it has become more frequent.";
We have little understanding of such magic to make metal fly, but my scouts rush to take whatever we can carry from the crash sites in the hopes we may one day unlock these secrets.;
This was how we acquired our rancor war beasts. Several very young specimens were recovered from a crashed vessel. We raised them to adulthood, training and breeding them to be loyal beasts of war.;
I need parts to repair my ship.;
That I cannot help you with. Although we have recovered many strange devices from the sky ships that crash to the earth, their use is a mystery to us.;
As a show of good faith, I will allow you to search the stores of our tribe, and take whatever you find. In exchange, I know you will destroy the Elders and bring the secrets they guard back to me.;
Tell me about the Temple of the Ancients.;
There is little I can tell you about the Temple. I know the secrets of our ancestors are contained within, but the Temple itself is barred to us.;
When last you were here, you and Malak sought to enter the Temple. You sought ancient knowledge and a way to escape this world within its stone walls.;
But only the Elders know how to bypass the barrier that surrounds it. Destroy them and bring back their secrets to us, and we will help you enter the Temple. That was our agreement.;
Tell me more about the Elders.;
"The Elders guard the ancient secrets. Within their compound is the knowledge of power and magic; including the knowledge of how to enter the Temple itself.";
I have lost many warriors storming the gates of their compound, but they use weapons of light and fire against us, and not even our war beasts are strong enough to breach their defenses.;
Sometimes we can capture an Elder when they venture forth from their compound, and we have learned something about them. That is how we know they guard the ancient secrets.;
But no matter what tortures we inflict upon them, they will not reveal their secrets to us. They fear the knowledge they themselves guard, and they will never willingly surrender it to us.;
I don't see any other choice, so I'll help you.;
The compound of the Elders is to the south, beyond the Temple of the Ancients. From torturing the few Elders we have captured, we know something of what lies beyond the gates.;
The Elders are few in number. If you can get past the exterior defenses, you could surely slaughter them all. Then you can bring us back the knowledge they guard.;
So where is this information? Is it in some kind of computer?;
Computer? That is a word our prisoners have used. When we forced them to explain it to us, they said this 'computer' was some type of thinking machine. More magic we cannot understand.;
Before they died, some prisoners did speak of such a machine inside their compound. But I do not believe it has anything to do with the secrets they are trying to protect.;
Why do you think that?;
If I kill the Elders, how can I bring you their secrets?;
I'll be back after I kill the Elders.;
[Persuade/Lie] I will kill the Elders and bring you their secrets!;
[Success] I see you that you have changed much since our last meeting. I am confident you will not betray us this time.;
I'm going to need some information if you want me to succeed.;
Yes, I suppose that is true. I will start at the beginning, with our first meeting.;
[Persuade/Lie] I'll help you, but you have to answer my questions first.;
[Success] I suppose that if what you say is true - that you cannot remember when you were last here - then you must have many questions. Very well, Revan.;
I will help you, but first you must answer my questions.;
What was this vow, exactly?;
I'm sorry, but I don't remember any of this.;
I'm not Revan anymore. That part of me is gone. I'm <FullName> now.;
Vow? I don't remember any vow.;
You have entered the Temple, Revan. You have seen the great secrets of the Ancients. Now you must fulfill your oath and share these secrets with me, Revan.;
You are a fool! I only used you to get into the Temple!;
And so you have betrayed us, Revan - just as you did the last time you were here.;
But this time you will not be allowed to escape with the knowledge that is rightfully mine, Revan! My war beasts will destroy you!;
The information you wanted was all on computers. You couldn't use it.;
Do you take me for a fool, Revan? You are hoarding the secrets for yourself! You will leave us and forget about us, just as you did the last time you were here.;
[Lie] I don't have the secrets on me, but I'll get them for you soon.;
You have returned. Do you wish to enter the temple now?;
My scouts have reported a great battle in the compound of the Elders. Tell me, Revan - in your slaughter did you find the book recording the great secrets of the past?;
I want to ask you some questions.;
I am the One, warrior-chieftain of this tribe. Answering questions is the work of Gjarshi, our Loremaster. Seek him out if you wish to know of our tribe.;
But I will answer no more questions. The time for questions is done: now you must fulfill your promise. Slay the Elders and bring us their secrets. This is the will of the One.;
I have given you free reign within our camp, Revan. Take whatever supplies you may need from our caches, if you think it will help you destroy the Elders and recover the ancient tome.;
Enough talking. I think I'll just kill you now!;
Then we shall feast upon your flesh, Revan!;
Strange. You are of your kind, but are unlike them too. You helped where others did not. Iziz was right in this.;
But taking of more was there as well. You have made the unfair trade. We will remember, both good and not.;
You have the thanks of the Jawa under Iziz. We will remember when you are the ones that have gone.;
Why would you bother we of Jawa under Iziz? Yours do not care for ours. Do you miss we that are taken? No.;
Please, could you try to speak more clearly?;
Translation: Doubtful. The Jawa language is structured in an odd manner. You are lucky to understand what you do.;NM17AF07JA05006_.mp3
It's not that hard to understand if you listen. It's just... odd.;NM17AF07JA05008_.mp3
Hence the 'unclear' part. Or did you miss that?;NM17AF07JA05010_.mp3
Your sarcasm is not appreciated, Carth.;NM17AF07JA05012_.mp3
The voices of Jawa under Iziz are not flawed. The ears of your kin are poor while we speak plain of our missing.;
"""Of your missing?"" Have some of your people gone missing?";
Is this interest? Not from your kind, though Iziz thinks otherwise. Speak to him if you are acting and pretending.;
Hmm. These Jawas sure aren't the trusting type, are they?;NM17AF07JA05023_.mp3
No doubt with good reason.;NM17AF07JA05025_.mp3
Well, for once, I'll agree with you.;NM17AF07JA05027_.mp3
You two agreed? Somebody mark this day down.;
Jawas are tired of giant-speak. Might as well slave to the gaffi. So you trade, but what is that if no help is given?;
Query: Is the miniature organic implying falsehood? Shall I blast it, master?;NM17AF07JA05029_.mp3
Iziz... is that your leader? Where is he?;
Iziz stands at the walls that hold out the sand. They listen poorly there too. Your kind hide behind bad ears.;
Jawa babble. I don't have time for this.;
Your kind are like that, and Iziz is foolish to think that you are not. We know this. Leave us to the trouble.;
He sounds... not right. Unnatural.;
Seems fairly clear to me, though he doesn't seem used to people actually stopping to listen.;NM17AF07JA05016_.mp3
"""We that are taken?"" Are some of your people missing?";
Back, but nothing changes, and ours are still lost. Iziz starts to know you will not help, and fades his hopes.;
Sorry... I'm rather busy with the excavation planning, right now.;NM36AASITH04000_.mp3
You aren't assigned to the excavation team, are you?;NM36AASITH04001_.mp3
The tomb on the far left, there, is off-limits. Only Master Uthar can go inside.;NM36AASITH04002_.mp3
Where is that blasted transport crew? We're supposed to send off the next shipment of artifacts right away.;NM36AASITH04003_.mp3
Careful of the tuk'ata. It's all we can do to keep those beasts away while we work.;NM36AASITH04004_.mp3
We've had indications that there's a whole ancient Sith colony under this valley. Isn't that an incredible find?;NM36AASITH04005_.mp3
The tombs are all full of traps and droids that still work, it looks like. Stay out of them, if you can.;NM36AASITH04006_.mp3
I was told that there's an escaped assassin droid in one of the tombs. Watch out for it.;NM36AASITH04007_.mp3
One has to wonder what made the Sith leave this planet originally. I bet the Jedi came and destroyed the colony.;NM36AASITH04008_.mp3
These tombs we've uncovered are only the tip of an entire ancient Sith fortress. I wonder what happened here?;NM36AASITH04009_.mp3
Look, unless you're willing to lend a hand, leave us to our work.;NM36AASITH04010_.mp3
You're out here to look for artifacts, I suppose? Just be careful.;NM36AASITH04011_.mp3
There's supposed to be some crazy Sith hermit that keeps kidnapping students in these hills. Best be careful.;NM36AASITH04012_.mp3
Sorry, I can't talk. We have to excavate this valley with hand instruments. There's all kinds of old traps left behind that still work.;NM36AASITH04013_.mp3
I've heard the news - Gadon is dead. You have done well. Brejik himself would be here to congratulate you if he was not so busy preparing for the big swoop race.;
I've done my part, now you better live up to your end of the bargain!;
Here are the 500 credits for eliminating Gadon and, as promised, we will let you ride for the Black Vulkars in the big swoop race.;
We'll provide you with a swoop bike that has the prototype accelerator installed. Your modified bike will be fast enough to beat every other racer on the track.;
And when we win the race, we get Bastila, right?;NM10ACKAND01006_.mp3
When you win Brejik will turn the girl over to you. You get Bastila, a Vulkar rider wins the race, and Brejik doesn't lose face for withdrawing his prize. Everybody wins.;
Why do I get the feeling you're not telling me something?;
There is one small thing you should be aware of before you race tomorrow: the prototype accelerator isn't exactly stable yet - there's a chance it might explode during the race.;
Explode? Are...are you crazy? Why would we risk riding that thing, then?;NM10ACKAND01013_.mp3
That's part of the reason Brejik installed it on your bike - none of our Vulkar riders are willing to risk their lives to win the prize. They're afraid of getting blown to bits.;
Why do you think I'm willing to risk my life?;
You've already gone to a great deal of trouble to get your hands on this Bastila. You want this Republic soldier in your possession for some reason.;
I don't know why - I really don't care. But I get the feeling you're willing to risk dying on the swoop bike if that's what it takes to get her.;
I'm not afraid to ride that bike!;
I'm glad to see you're being reasonable. The race is tomorrow, so I'm afraid you won't have time to practice. But nobody will be able to keep up with your modified swoop.;
All you have to do is hold on tight, try not to smash into anything, and hope the accelerator doesn't explode. Simple.;
Get some rest and I'll come for you in the morning to take you to the swoop track. Good luck... you're going to need it.;
I guess I don't have any choice. I'll race for the Vulkars.;
Okay, let's do this.;
I've changed my mind - I'm not racing for you!;
Who will sponsor you then, the Beks? I'm sure they'd love to back the assassin who killed their beloved leader. No, I think you'll race for us - you don't have any other options.;
Gadon died screaming like a skinned ronto. So will you if you don't hand over Bastila right now!;
Don't do anything foolish. If you attack me then you'll lose any chance of ever getting your hands on that girl. Besides, we had a deal, remember?;
Looks like we have visitors - lackeys conned by Gadon Thek into trying to steal Brejik's swoop engine accelerator, I bet!;
Brejik stole that engine from Gadon! It was never yours to begin with!;NM10ACKAND01036_.mp3
Well I didn't go to all the trouble of acquiring this prototype just so you could steal it back for that old fool!;
Would you like me to dispose of these Bek spies, Kandon?;
No - hold on a second. I see you aren't wearing the Hidden Bek colors, so I'm guessing you aren't part of that feeble old man's gang. You must be a freelance mercenary.;
You're right, I'm not one of the Beks. My name's <FullName>.;
Instead of stealing the prototype for the Beks, why don't you come work for us? The Black Vulkars could use someone like you.;
You've got my attention. What's your offer?;
What? You can't betray Gadon! I won't let you!;NM10ACKAND01048_.mp3
Ah, Mission - the Hidden Bek's unofficial mascot! Your loyalty is admirable, but misplaced. Gadon only kept you around so they could laugh at you and your furry friend.;
No, that's not true! You're lying!;NM10ACKAND01052_.mp3
Am I? How long have you known Gadon? How long have you worked for him? But they never offered to make you a Hidden Bek, did they?;
They... they said I was too young!;NM10ACKAND01056_.mp3
And you believed them? Come on, Mission. You're smarter than that. To Gadon and his crew you were nothing but a running joke. Weren't they always teasing you?;
Well, yeah. Some of them were. But you Vulkars have tried to kill me more than once!;NM10ACKAND01060_.mp3
That's only because you were with the Hidden Beks - and because we respected you. Brejik knows you're not a joke, Mission. He made sure the Vulkars took you very, very seriously.;
But... but Gadon said Brejik...;NM10ACKAND01064_.mp3
Gadon had to poison your mind against Brejik! It was the only way to keep you from seeing the truth. The Beks were mocking you, Mission. You don't need friends like that.;
You're right! I don't need anyone but Zaalbar! If Gadon dies, he's only getting what's coming to him!;NM10ACKAND01068_.mp3
You were about to tell me your offer, Kandon.;
Brejik has grown tired of this petty war with Gadon and his pathetic followers. He needs someone to get rid of Gadon... permanently.;
If you do this task for him Brejik is willing to offer a very substantial reward. How does 500 credits sound? Oh, and we'll throw in that young Republic soldier we captured, too.;
I thought she was being offered up as the prize in the swoop race.;
Well... we can't just give the girl to you. Not after Brejik's publicly offered her up as a prize in the big swoop race. But we can do the next best thing.;
Whoever wins the swoop race gets the girl. Kill Gadon and we'll give you 500 credits, sponsor you as a Vulkar rider and equip your swoop with the accelerator. You can't lose!;
Okay, we have a deal. I'll kill Gadon for you.;
Are you sure about this? I mean, I want to get Bastila back... but taking contracts to kill people is a bit much. Even if it is just more biker scum.;NM10ACKAND01079_.mp3
Excellent. Here - you might need these for this mission. They're access codes to Gadon's private chambers in the Bek base. Without them you won't be able to get at the old man.;
My guards will escort you to the main doors of our base. After you have killed Gadon return to the main doors and I will arrange for you to ride for the Vulkars in the swoop race.;
I'd suggest you don't come back until the job is done, or we might think you've decided to renegotiate on our offer. The Vulkars won't consider you a friend until Gadon is dead.;
Just give me the girl now or we have no deal.;
Brejik can't withdraw his prize without losing the respect of every gang in the Lower City. Besides, she isn't even here. Brejik's keeping her somewhere safe until after the race.;
Forget it. I want Bastila up front or no deal!;
*Sigh* I can see there's not much chance of convincing you to come work for us after all. Most unfortunate.;
Now can I kill them, Kandon?;
Yes, darling. Kill them. Kill them all.;
Forget it - I'm not going to betray Gadon!;
How about I just kill you instead?;
Brejik will let me have Bastila if I kill Gadon for him?;
Don't listen to him, Mission. He's twisting your mind!;
Forget it! I know all about you Black Vulkars!;
"Be smart; Gadon Thek is old news! He's a blind fool in more ways than one! Brejik is a visionary - soon he'll control the entire Lower City! Don't shackle yourself to a losing team.";
Enough yapping! Hand over that accelerator.;
You're talking like Brejik didn't steal that engine, himself, to begin with!;NM10ACKAND01038_.mp3
The conquering hero returns! You did a great thing winning that swoop race for us!;
Membership in the Beks is already starting to climb again. Won't be long now until we're back in control and Gadon can restore some order to the streets.;
Used to be everyone wanted to join the Hidden Beks. But if the Vulkars win that swoop race I got a funny feeling a lot of our own people are going to join up with Brejik.;
The Vulkars aren't the first group to try and take over from the Beks. Gadon knows how to deal with these upstarts. He may be blind, but he still can see the big picture.;
The Vulkars are done for! Nobody will want to join them after seeing what Brejik did at the swoop race!;
You heard what the Vulkars are putting up as a prize to the winner of the swoop race? A captured Republic soldier! Do you know how much she'd bring on the galactic slaver market?;
A few of the braver villagers dared to leave the safety of the fence. They... they never returned;NM04AAOUTM17000_.mp3
Thank you! My wife was one of those banished because she had the rakghoul disease. If you hadn't cured her, I would have never seen her again!;NM04AAOUTM17001_.mp3
The rakghouls took my wife! I can only pray she is dead... I cannot bear to even think of the alternative.;NM04AAOUTM17002_.mp3
They say anyone bitten by a rakghoul will become a rakghoul themselves. It can't be true, can it? It's too horrible!;NM04AAOUTM17003_.mp3
Hey - I recognize you! You're the one who won the big swoop race!;
I can't believe what Brejik did after the race - talk about no class! But what else could you expect from a Vulkar?;
The Vulkars are gaining members every day from the smaller gangs. If they win the big swoop race there's no telling how many new recruits they'll get!;
The Vulkars are out of control. Gang rivalry is one thing, but gunning people down in the streets is going too far! They don't even care if their victims are Beks or not!;
The Vulkars won't last long against us now that Brejik's out of the way. Serves him right for trying to back out on his wager!;
I don't deal in slaves, but that Republic soldier Brejik's offering as a prize would be worth a lot of credits to the right buyer.;
[The old man knows better than to engage in chit-chat with enemies so close by.];
[Even though he has joined your group, Jolee remains a somewhat mysterious character. Maybe you should speak to him about why he chose to come with you.];
[Speak to Jolee.];
Got something on your mind, do you?;NM35AAJOLE09001_.mp3
Why did you decide to come with me?;
You got yourself a fast little ship. Heh. I'd forgotten what engines sounded like. The closest thing to that on Kashyyyk is an uller in mating season. Ugh! Frightful.;NM35AAJOLE09050_.mp3
So you wanted a ride on my ship?;
Or it could be for the free food. What's the gunk that comes out of the synthesizer on this bucket, anyway? Do you never clean the darned thing?;NM35AAJOLE09052_.mp3
No, seriously, tell me.;
I'm old, damn it! I'm allowed to be enigmatic when I want to be, and don't you go telling me otherwise.;NM35AAJOLE09054_.mp3
You know, you remind me of someone else I knew ages ago. Pleasant enough fellow, great destiny... all of that. Breath like a bantha.;NM35AAJOLE09055_.mp3
Did you annoy this person endlessly, too?;
Oh ho ho, very funny. Is it my fault that some people are so easily annoyed? They're like impatient little children. With blasters.;NM35AAJOLE09057_.mp3
Anyway, where was I? Oh, yes. Andor Vex, was his name. The Force swirled around him like a hurricane, that's how great his destiny was.;NM35AAJOLE09058_.mp3
I never heard of him.;
"No, you wouldn't have. Sometimes swirling Force is just swirling Force. It gets us old Jedis excited at our age so we go ""ooo, destiny!""";NM35AAJOLE09060_.mp3
Well, it turned out that poor Andor believed a wee bit too much in the infallibility of that destiny. That overconfidence turned out to be his downfall.;NM35AAJOLE09061_.mp3
Is there supposed to be some hidden meaning in this?;
I don't know. Are you overconfident? I hadn't noticed. Even if I had, I would never comment on it. We're talking about Andor, remember?;NM35AAJOLE09063_.mp3
Let's see... oh, yes. Andor's downfall. I was pretty young, myself, when it happened. At the time, I thought that Andor's destiny couldn't be more boring.;NM35AAJOLE09064_.mp3
How young are we talking?;
Well, let's just say that I was a strapping young lad with a full head of hair and Coruscant was a small town with a well, heh heh.;NM35AAJOLE09066_.mp3
I was just about to abandon Andor to whatever the Force intended for him when his ship was overtaken by a Dimean warship.;NM35AAJOLE09067_.mp3
Now, you've probably never heard of the Dimeans, but at the time they were a nasty lot led by a nastier overlord named Kraat. Tall fellow. Big teeth.;NM35AAJOLE09068_.mp3
Kraat has us hauled onto the bridge of his ship for questioning, and that's when I knew that Andor's destiny was at hand.;NM35AAJOLE09069_.mp3
Andor killed Kraat, I take it?;
Of course he did! Haven't you been listening? It was not in the way you'd probably expect, though.;NM35AAJOLE09071_.mp3
Well, Andor decides that his destiny makes him invulnerable and starts making all sorts of demands. Free me now, I'm not answering questions, blah blah blah. Don't you know who I am?;NM35AAJOLE09075_.mp3
Kraat decides he's had enough and begins crushing Andor's neck. I told the boy he should have kept his mouth shut. I think he agreed, too... or those could have just been gurgling noises. Well... well, anyway.;NM35AAJOLE09076_.mp3
Finally, Kraat has enough of Andor and tosses him aside into this giant energy intake shaft. Andor gets sucked in and starts bouncing around, heh, screaming... heh.;NM35AAJOLE09077_.mp3
Maybe Andor hit something sensitive on the way down or just didn't agree with the reactor core, next thing I know all the ship's alarms are ringing.;NM35AAJOLE09078_.mp3
You're kidding...;
Everyone panics and I run, barely making it to the ship in time before the explosion. Kraat dies horribly, and the Dimeans never quite recovered.;NM35AAJOLE09080_.mp3
Changed the political course of the entire sector for centuries to come. I'd call that quite a destiny, wouldn't you?;NM35AAJOLE09081_.mp3
I hate you, old man...;
Well, now, that's the ingratitude of youth for you. I relate an exciting tale and do I get thanked for it? No, no, it's all 'me me me!' Hmph.;NM35AAJOLE09083_.mp3
Anyway, go on. My throat is dry and you're making me cranky. Shoo!;NM35AAJOLE09089_.mp3
But how can you even be sure Andor was responsible?!;
What?! Are you kidding?! What are the odds of that happening, anyway? A billion to one?;NM35AAJOLE09085_.mp3
You should do so well as to be sucked into the engine of some evil Sith Lord, you know. Andor was a hero... sort of.;NM35AAJOLE09086_.mp3
And what does that have to do with you coming with me?;
Well, hey, the chances may not be great, but when one has the opportunity to see something like that twice in a lifetime...;NM35AAJOLE09088_.mp3
How did you know?;
Swirling Force, remember? Jedi here? Granted, I was just interpreting the signs, but we get trained in that sort of thing. More or less.;NM35AAJOLE09073_.mp3
And? Go on.;
As boring as this story?;
You know, if you keep interrupting, it will take even longer. Have you no patience at all? How did you get as old as you are anyway?;NM35AAJOLE09091_.mp3
So why didn't you *leave*?;
Well, he had a much better food dispenser than you do. That and the fact that even then I wasn't an altogether impatient *twit*.;NM35AAJOLE09093_.mp3
Does this story have a point, old man?;
Does it have to have a point? I thought we were just talking about Andor. Is something wrong with your attention span?;NM35AAJOLE09095_.mp3
You're making all of this up!;
I am not! I've no need to make things up, with my poor memory and all. You just sit still and let me finish, damn it.;NM35AAJOLE09097_.mp3
Is that what you see around me, too?;
Well, it's not so much a hurricane as a slight breeze. But that doesn't mean anything: destiny is sometimes in the eye of the beholder.;NM35AAJOLE09099_.mp3
And you traveled with this man?;
I did. Just because someone has the Force swirling about them doesn't always mean they have a great destiny, but it doesn't hurt to check it out.;NM35AAJOLE09101_.mp3
Is this a comment on my breath?;
No, but it could be. An Anduvian salt tablet would clear that right up, you know.;NM35AAJOLE09103_.mp3
You're avoiding the question.;
So I am. Tell you what... when you get to be my age, you can go ahead and answer any question you like, too. You have my permission.;NM35AAJOLE09105_.mp3
If you don't want to answer the question, old man, just say so.;
How impatient can one person be? You must have driven your mother mad. All that gurgling and fussing... heh, babies are cute, but annoying.;NM35AAJOLE09107_.mp3
Fine, forget it.;
Wow, you're not much for interrogation, are you? Is this as hard as you try? Remind me to sign up for your next torture session.;NM35AAJOLE09109_.mp3
You never did actually say why you decided to come with me...;
No, I never did, did I?;NM35AAJOLE09111_.mp3
You know, I don't *have* to take you with me.;
Of course you do. I know things, remember? You think you could make it around this part of the galaxy without me? Don't answer that.;NM35AAJOLE09113_.mp3
At any rate, I already told you why I wanted to leave. I'd seen everything I wanted to on Kashyyyk. Time to go, time to move on.;NM35AAJOLE09114_.mp3
Move on to where?;
To bed. I'm old and tired, you know.;NM35AAJOLE09116_.mp3
No, really.;
How many kilometer-high trees can you find an interest in before you figure you've had enough? I'd bet you can't be bothered to stay in one room for more than fifteen minutes.;NM35AAJOLE09118_.mp3
And then there's all the critters in the Shadowlands... I'm just happy to be back in space, doing something new. Is that too much to ask?;NM35AAJOLE09119_.mp3
You could do that on your own.;
So I could. Not having a ship does tend to put a damper on that kind of idea, however.;NM35AAJOLE09121_.mp3
I'll admit... for all its flaws, Kashyyyk was home enough. But when you came along and I saw the destiny you had before you, I couldn't help but be intrigued.;NM35AAJOLE09122_.mp3
You know what my destiny is?;
Of course not. Weren't you listening last time? I can see that you have a destiny before you... but the details are far from clear.;NM35AAJOLE09124_.mp3
In fact, everything about you that I can see is odd. Slightly off, as if my eyes are trying to trick me. Something... something is very dark about you...;NM35AAJOLE09125_.mp3
... but bah! I'm sure you don't need to hear my ruminations. You've probably got enough nosy Jedi offering you one opinion after another to make you sick.;NM35AAJOLE09126_.mp3
No, tell me more of what you see.;
Your future will come of its own accord, trust me. Sometimes navel-gazing at it doesn't get you anywhere.;NM35AAJOLE09128_.mp3
I wouldn't worry about it too much, if I were you. You remind me a bit of Nomi, heh heh, and that can't be all bad.;NM35AAJOLE09129_.mp3
Nomi? Who's Nomi?;
Nomi Sunrider. She came late to the Force, just as you have, and became one of the greatest Jedi ever. Oh, fine, fine lass.;NM35AAJOLE09131_.mp3
Whether you'll follow the same path remains to be seen. For one thing, we'll never get anywhere if you stand around chatting up old men all day...;NM35AAJOLE09132_.mp3
I don't bring you along for your amusement, you know.;
Oh, stop being such a baby. Are you always so quick to turn aside an ally? Got too many of them, do you?;NM35AAJOLE09134_.mp3
One thing I will say is that this little escapade does remind me a bit of my adventuring days before the war. Ahh, those were exciting times.;NM35AAJOLE09139_.mp3
Or at least it would remind me of those times if we didn't stand around. What's keeping you? You're too young to be so talkative. Shoo! Shoo!;NM35AAJOLE09140_.mp3
So... you're along as some kind of observer?;
Nonsense. Have I ever refused to help you when you asked? How confused can one person be, anyway?;NM35AAJOLE09136_.mp3
I don't need another mentor.;
Good, since I didn't offer to be one. You think anyone would want to mentor you with that kind of attitude? Not me, I'm past that.;NM35AAJOLE09138_.mp3
You got that right. I have enough Jedi watching me.;
Well I for one am quite content to let you make your own mistakes. Just because I want to see where this ends up doesn't mean I need to tell you how to get there.;NM35AAJOLE09142_.mp3
So you're coming along to *not* offer your opinions?;
I'll remind you that *you're* the one who started pumping me for information. Like an old man doesn't have anything better to do. Hmph.;NM35AAJOLE09144_.mp3
What interest do you have in my future?;
Interest? Well, I certainly don't have a vested interest... call it more idle curiosity. Your destiny is... rather unclear.;NM35AAJOLE09146_.mp3
Just keep your opinions on it to yourself.;
Have I offered a single opinion? No, I haven't, though you could do far worse than hear a couple of mine. Your destiny, after all, is rather unclear.;NM35AAJOLE09148_.mp3
Damn right it is.;
You got a smart mouth on you there, you know that? If ullers could talk, they'd sound like that.;NM35AAJOLE09150_.mp3
No, I guess not.;
There, now, was that so hard? An old man has to be allowed some petty eccenticities. Nice to see you agree, for once.;NM35AAJOLE09152_.mp3
I don't believe you.;
The hermit says he's tired of living alone in the giant forest and you find that hard to believe? How cynical are you?;NM35AAJOLE09154_.mp3
You looked plenty happy there, to me.;
You live in an overgrown stump with the tachs beating down your door and you tell me how happy you would be. I was pleased just to have visitors.;NM35AAJOLE09156_.mp3
Are you always going to be this elusive?;
Elusive? Me, elusive? Heh. Obviously you've never tried to grab a Twi'lek dancing girl after drinking too much Ondaran willek juice.;NM35AAJOLE09158_.mp3
Answer the question, old man.;
My, my, somebody woke up on the wrong side of the starship this morning, I see. Is that a chip on your shoulder or are you a bit surly today?;NM35AAJOLE09160_.mp3
You mentioned something about your 'adventuring days'?;
Did I say that? Strange the tricks memory plays on you when you get older.;NM35AAJOLE09162_.mp3
So you weren't an adventurer?;
Didn't I say that my past was my affair? You don't see me poking and prodding you with questions, do you?;NM35AAJOLE09164_.mp3
But you've already said so much... I'm curious.;
I'm not here to satisfy your curiosity! No staring at the old man, that's what the sign says, dammit!;NM35AAJOLE09168_.mp3
And besides... you don't really want to hear about me. We're talking ancient history, probably before you were born. History bores kids. Proven fact.;NM35AAJOLE09171_.mp3
Yeah? Well old people love to talk about history. Proven fact.;
Oh fine, fine, have it your way. Just don't cry about it later.;NM35AAJOLE09173_.mp3
Yes, yes, I was an adventurer. Happy now? I wasn't even done with my Jedi training back then. I had a full head of hair and an eagerness to see absolutely everything.;NM35AAJOLE09177_.mp3
Sound familiar? The Council was never very happy with willful, brash Jolee Bindo, you see. Even less so when I began my smuggling career.;NM35AAJOLE09178_.mp3
*You* were a smuggler?;
Don't look at me like that, dammit! I wasn't always the wrinkled coot I am now, you know. I can still fight, too, so wipe off that smirk I see there.;NM35AAJOLE09180_.mp3
At the time the Ukatis system was interdicted by its own King. He preferred to keep his people starving and poor, all the better to oppress them.;NM35AAJOLE09184_.mp3
The Senate was trying to negotiate a peace, but they were getting nowhere as usual. I decided I wasn't going to wait.;NM35AAJOLE09185_.mp3
I found myself a ship and a partner and we began smuggling food and supplies to the Ukatis citizenry through the blockade.;NM35AAJOLE09186_.mp3
Was it very dangerous?;
Oh, it was. I was a half-decent pilot in those days... and with the Force guiding me, we made it through some tough spots nobody else would have.;NM35AAJOLE09188_.mp3
You were a pilot, too?;
Pilot, smuggler... several other things, too. Or did you suppose I was always a crotchety hermit?;NM35AAJOLE09190_.mp3
Where did you get the credits for all the supplies?;
Well... we didn't *buy* all the equipment, per se. Some were happy to donate goods. Some we just, ah, knew had more than they could use...;NM35AAJOLE09192_.mp3
So you stole it?;
'Stole' is such a harsh word. They would have donated those goods readily enough if they were compassionate. I considered it a tax on the greedy.;NM35AAJOLE09194_.mp3
We only got caught once. A lone Ukatish frigate shot us down and forced a crash landing. I thought the Force had abandoned me, as I remember.;NM35AAJOLE09195_.mp3
What happened then?;
Well, as it happens, getting shot down turned out to be very fortunate. That day was the day I...;NM35AAJOLE09197_.mp3
That was the day you what?;
Well, that... that was the day I met my wife.;NM35AAJOLE09199_.mp3
Oh, I'm sorry...;
It's alright. When you're digging through the trash, you shouldn't be surprised when you encounter something unpleasant.;NM35AAJOLE09201_.mp3
I... If it's all the same to you, I'd prefer to stop talking now. My mouth is starting to draw flies.;NM35AAJOLE09206_.mp3
Your wife? You were married?;
You know another way to get a wife? But, yes... that's when I met her.;NM35AAJOLE09203_.mp3
Bad memory, I take it?;
No. No, that was a good memory. There are just... much worse ones that followed.;NM35AAJOLE09205_.mp3
Maybe it should have.;
Oh, so you're going to speak for the Force now, are you? I deserved to crash, is that it?;NM35AAJOLE09208_.mp3
Well that was pretty stupid of you.;
Hmph. As I recall, I'm not the only person in this conversation who's been shot down out of the sky recently.;NM35AAJOLE09210_.mp3
I still can't believe you actually did that.;
Why not? There were millions of people crying out for aid. What else was I supposed to do?;NM35AAJOLE09212_.mp3
How about nothing?;
Don't be stupid. Are you doing nothing? If nothing's not good enough for you there's no reason it should have been good enough for me back then, either.;NM35AAJOLE09214_.mp3
A Jedi would never be a smuggler!;
You're very sure of that, are you? My, my, you must be very learned and experienced to know so many things. At any rate, I was still a Padawan at the time.;NM35AAJOLE09182_.mp3
How did that happen?;
You're right. I'd rather not be bored.;
Well that's a relief. Maybe an old man can finally get some peace around here. Now, run along and do whatever you were doing, already.;NM35AAJOLE09166_.mp3
I'm not a 'kid'.;
So you're not. Fine, have it your way. Just don't say I didn't warn you.;NM35AAJOLE09176_.mp3
You're just not used to company. Stop being an old coot.;
Hmph. I might be. But a mouthy young thing like yourself shouldn't get to call me an old coot, dammit.;NM35AAJOLE09170_.mp3
Fine. I won't you questions ever again.;
You mentioned something about your wife before?;
I don't want to talk about that.;NM35AAJOLE09216_.mp3
Sorry. Maybe we can talk about it later.;
Maybe, but I doubt it. I'm made stubborn that way.;NM35AAJOLE09218_.mp3
Well, I do. Spit it out, already.;
Now that's a unique method of getting someone to talk. Thunder about like a bantha in a circuit shop. Does that work for you often?;NM35AAJOLE09220_.mp3
Let me tell you something. Once you've lived as many years as I have, you'll have yourself a long, long list of memories.;NM35AAJOLE09223_.mp3
If you're lucky, most of them will be good. If you're not, some will be bad. If you're really unlucky, some will be so bad you never want to be reminded of them again... ever.;NM35AAJOLE09224_.mp3
You'll go far away, to a place that doesn't hold any memories at all. And there you'll be happy just to forget and be forgotten.;NM35AAJOLE09225_.mp3
I would never do that.;
You say that now, but I'm talking to you from across the breadth of many years experience. That is a gap I simply can't cross for you.;NM35AAJOLE09227_.mp3
Let me ask you this: have you ever been in love? Truly in love, I mean, and not simple infatuation.;NM35AAJOLE09233_.mp3
Well...;
Exactly. You're still at the beginning of your life. There will be women in your life... perhaps many women... but if you're fortunate you'll find love once.;NM35AAJOLE09235_.mp3
The Jedi, with their damnable sense of over-caution, would tell you love is something to avoid. Thankfully, anyone who's even partially alive knows that's not true.;NM35AAJOLE09237_.mp3
Aren't you worried about the dark side at all?;
Love doesn't lead to the dark side. Passion can lead to rage and fear, and can be controlled... but passion is not the same thing as love.;NM35AAJOLE09239_.mp3
Controlling your passions while being in love... that's what they should teach you to beware. But love, itself, will save you... not condemn you.;NM35AAJOLE09240_.mp3
Ahhhh, but listen to me go on as if I had all the answers. What do I know of love anymore? I'm just a lonely old man who's not even a Jedi.;NM35AAJOLE09241_.mp3
Sounds like love is something you should have avoided.;
Hmph. Maybe. Do you want to avoid the greatest things in life simply because they come with some complications?;NM35AAJOLE09243_.mp3
Love causes pain, certainly. Inevitably love is going to lead to as much sorrow and regret as it does joy. I suppose there are perfect, eternal loves out there... but I haven't seen any.;NM35AAJOLE09244_.mp3
How you deal with the bad part of love is what determines your character, what determines the dark side's hold over you.;NM35AAJOLE09245_.mp3
You don't think love can work?;
I suppose it could. It would take a strong person to make that kind of commitment, I think. Someone with a great sense of self.;NM35AAJOLE09247_.mp3
I'll tell you one thing: sometimes, no matter how hard you try, you and the one you love simply aren't meant to be together.;NM35AAJOLE09252_.mp3
The trick is to know when that is, to know when it's time to fight and when it's time to part ways.;NM35AAJOLE09253_.mp3
Hmph... there I go waxing philosophical again. Somebody blast me already! Let's get going before I start talking in riddles, dammit!;NM35AAJOLE09254_.mp3
Maybe the Jedi just think you shouldn't take that risk.;
Bah. A life without risk is boring. Is that how you want to live? You want love, you've got to fight for it.;NM35AAJOLE09249_.mp3
So what happened between you and your wife, then?;
I haven't changed my mind. I'm still not going to talk about it. You go and find your own love if you want to know so badly.;NM35AAJOLE09251_.mp3
You talk too much, old man. You don't know anything.;
Don't I? Hmph. Maybe you're right. It seems whatever I have to say is falling on deaf ears, anyhow.;NM35AAJOLE09256_.mp3
So go on, go on, run amok and kiss the bantha for all I care. I won't comment on it.;NM35AAJOLE09257_.mp3
No, I want to hear what you have to say.;
You do, do you? I wouldn't listen too closely... I'm no authority on anything. I just think that the greatest things in life shouldn't be avoided because they come with a few complications.;NM35AAJOLE09259_.mp3
Not even a Jedi? You mean not any more, right?;
Nope. Never was. Technically I never rose above the rank of Padawan, for various reasons. Does that surprise you?;NGLOBEJOLE09742_.mp3
Not the way you describe your past, no.;
Heh. I suppose I'm not prone to live my life like most of the Jedi Masters do, that's true. My opinions on love are no different.;NGLOBEJOLE09744_.mp3
You seem to have all the abilities of a Jedi...;
In my case, becoming a Jedi would have been a formality. I doubt the order and I would have gotten along well, considering my opinions on things such as love.;NGLOBEJOLE09746_.mp3
Yes. You lied to me.;
No I didn't. I may never have become a Jedi technically, but I'm an old Padawan with a lifetime of experience. That applies both to the Force as well as topics like love.;NGLOBEJOLE09748_.mp3
That's what I've always thought.;
What's this? Love advice from an old Jedi?;
And why not? All this nonsense about avoiding love is so much foo-foo. I shouldn't be the only one who realizes that.;NM35AAJOLE09262_.mp3
Exactly. You're still at the beginning of your life. There will be men in your life... perhaps many men... but if you're fortunate you'll find love once.;NM35AAJOLE09236_.mp3
Is that why you went to Kashyyyk?;
Heh. Partly, maybe. I doubt I could ever explain it to you fully, even if I wanted to.;NM35AAJOLE09230_.mp3
Run away? How pathetic and weak.;
There are worse things to call yourself, for better reasons. If you don't think it's even possible that you might be flinging those words at yourself one day, you're younger than I thought.;NM35AAJOLE09232_.mp3
I don't mean to pry, but...;
Yes you do. You may mean well enough, but my private affairs are just that: private.;NM35AAJOLE09222_.mp3
Why did you leave the Jedi?;
Heh heh. Who said I left the Jedi?;NM35AAJOLE09264_.mp3
You did. You said you weren't a Jedi any longer.;
Well, technically, I was only a Padawan... not that that makes a difference to most. But as for the order, itself... no, I never left it. It left *me*.;NM35AAJOLE09267_.mp3
What do you mean 'it left you'?;
You know what I hate? Well... you know, lots of things, really. But I'm old and easily annoyed. But that's beside the point. What I *really* hate are how most people view the Jedi.;NM35AAJOLE09269_.mp3
Everyone thinks that Jedi are perfect, that they can do no wrong. They think the Jedi Council is completely incapable of injustice.;NM35AAJOLE09270_.mp3
I certainly don't think that.;
Hmph. I guess you aren't as stupid as you sometimes act. No doubt you've been on the receiving end of Jedi justice at least once, eh?;NM35AAJOLE09272_.mp3
And I'm not even talking about how some of us fall to the dark side. No, that's plenty indication of our fallibility, but it's something else entirely.;NM35AAJOLE09277_.mp3
No, I'm talking about how, more often than not, your average robe-wearing Jedi can try to do the right thing and still be completely *wrong*.;NM35AAJOLE09278_.mp3
I don't get it. What do you mean?;
*sigh* I suppose I'm not being very clear, am I?;NM35AAJOLE09280_.mp3
Come to think of it, I don't have to be clear. Someone my age is entitled to ramble, dammit! But for your sake I'll try to explain.;NM35AAJOLE09281_.mp3
I'll tell you a little tale about a Jedi Master I once knew. Hortath, I think. Or was it Hartoth? I could never get it straight...;NM35AAJOLE09282_.mp3
Go on, I'll listen.;
Where was I, then? Oh. Oh, yes... Master Hortath. He was a kindly old Jedi who meant well, but the most near-sighted thing in the Core, I swear.;NM35AAJOLE09284_.mp3
He would walk into walls, knock over tables, mistake apprentices for rancor beasts... that sort of thing. And he was too proud to submit to proper treatment.;NM35AAJOLE09285_.mp3
"Some used to counsel him and urged ""Use the Force, Master Hortath. Allow the Force to see for you."" But he refused to believe that his eyes were failing.";NM35AAJOLE09286_.mp3
He simply squinted more and more as the years went on, the other Jedi resignedly passing it off as the amusing quirk of a compassionate old man.;NM35AAJOLE09287_.mp3
And? I don't get it.;
I'm not finished yet! Now shush.;NM35AAJOLE09289_.mp3
So one day a young Padawan meets Master Hortath in the courtyard and, not knowing of his blindness, asks him for directions to the Council.;NM35AAJOLE09292_.mp3
Quite sure of himself, Hortath gave the lad directions... which happened to lead back outside and away from the enclave.;NM35AAJOLE09293_.mp3
The Padawan is confused, naturally. He asks if Master Hortath is sure, and of course Master Hortath says that he is.;NM35AAJOLE09294_.mp3
The Padawan suggests that perhaps he should ask someone else... but the proud Hortath now feels insulted. He tells the Padawan to take the route he prescribed and no other.;NM35AAJOLE09295_.mp3
Rather dejectedly, the Padawan did as he was told... and so ended up leaving the Jedi Order forever.;NM35AAJOLE09296_.mp3
It was decided that the boy's fate was to leave the Order anyway... though whether that was out of respect for Hortath or because the boy went on to something else, well, we'll never know.;NM35AAJOLE09297_.mp3
So what does the Padawan leaving the Jedi have to do with the Jedi leaving you?;
Not much. I never knew the Padawan nor met Master Hortath, himself. He was before my time.;NM35AAJOLE09301_.mp3
I don't understand...;
The tale is about blindness and I thought the point was clear. At any rate, you think about it. You're the one who asked why the Jedi left me, remember?;NM35AAJOLE09306_.mp3
Now let's get going. My feet are itching for a good run.;NM35AAJOLE09307_.mp3
So... you knew this Master Hortath? Or the Padawan?;
No, no. Both of them were from before my time. Well before the Sith Wars, even.;NM35AAJOLE09304_.mp3
So what's the point?;
That's a stupid story.;
Considering that it's about blindness, I think that's an appropriate response. You're the one who asked why the Jedi left me, remember?;NM35AAJOLE09309_.mp3
Is this supposed to have a point?;
Go on.;
Is this going to have a point?;
*Sigh* You know the problem with the youth of today? They're young.;NM35AAJOLE09311_.mp3
No, I don't have time for any stupid stories.;
You're the one who was asking me about the Jedi, dammit! Now do you want the story or not?;NM35AAJOLE09313_.mp3
Fine, fine, but make it quick.;
Not. Can't be bothered.;
Boring you, am I? Well you just keep your questions to yourself next time. No need for old men to go and make nuisances of themselves.;NM35AAJOLE09316_.mp3
So the Jedi wronged you in some way, I take it?;
No, no. The Jedi always treated me well. It would be foolish and untrue to say otherwise. That's not what I meant, anyway.;NM35AAJOLE09318_.mp3
Nobody can be right about everything.;
That's true, but it's not what I meant. I guess I'm not being clear, am I?;NM35AAJOLE09320_.mp3
Let me guess: you disagree?;
Damn right I disagree. The Jedi are just as capable of injustice as anyone else. They may *try* harder, sure, but sometimes they get it wrong.;NM35AAJOLE09274_.mp3
You? Perfect? That's a laugh.;
Quiet, you. I'm not talking about me. Talking about the Jedi as a whole. They are just as capable of imperfection and injustice as anyone else, as you can obviously see.;NM35AAJOLE09276_.mp3
That's about the dumbest thing I ever heard.;
Oh, is it? Hmph. There are moments when I think you must be much older than you seem... but this isn't one of them.;NM35AAJOLE09322_.mp3
So are you a Jedi or not?;
Something wrong with your ears? I thought folks only went deaf when they got to my age. I follow the Jedi Way and use the Force, don't I? That makes me a Jedi last time I checked.;NM35AAJOLE09324_.mp3
But the order, itself, the Jedi Council and so forth... no, I'm not a part of that and haven't been for a long time. And good riddance, I say!;NM35AAJOLE09325_.mp3
But you said the Jedi left you?;
Why good riddance?;
So you're just some rogue Jedi. Big deal.;
Hmph. A rogue, am I? You speak as if there must be something wrong with me, like not being part of the order makes me a criminal.;NM35AAJOLE09329_.mp3
Are you saying you're still a Jedi?;
Don't play games with me, old man.;
Don't get so uppity, dammit! The point I was trying to make, if you decide to actually listen, is that I never left the order. The order left *me*.;NM35AAJOLE09331_.mp3
What do you know about the Sith?;
Bad, bad men. Women, too, to be fair.;NM35AAJOLE09333_.mp3
You must know more than that.;
Oh, indeed. They make a fine sandwich, also. Heh heh heh. But don't tell the Jedi Council I said that.;NM35AAJOLE09335_.mp3
Do you know anything important about the Sith or not?;
*sigh* And just what gave you the impression that I know anything more about the Sith than you do?;NM35AAJOLE09339_.mp3
You did. You said you fought them.;
Oh... that's right. Damn the ears of the young! I was expecting you to be your usual inattentive self when I mentioned that.;NM35AAJOLE09341_.mp3
So it's true, yes, I fought plenty of Sith. That was during the time of Exar Kun... oh, fourty years ago now? Has it been that long?;NM35AAJOLE09342_.mp3
Are these Sith the same as the ones who followed me?;
No, no, of course not. The Sith have come and gone for ages. They were not called Sith many thousands of years ago, perhaps, but the dark side was always present without a doubt.;NM35AAJOLE09344_.mp3
Oh, sure, occasionally the light side comes close to vanquishing the dark, but the dark always returns.;NM35AAJOLE09345_.mp3
The fact that Exar Kun was defeated didn't mean the Sith would never return, as they obviously have now. Everyone knows that.;NM35AAJOLE09346_.mp3
Who is this Exar Kun?;
Ah. Exar was a Jedi who was... corrupted... by ghosts of the old Sith. Or so they say. He attempted to conquer the Republic and create a new Golden Age of the Sith.;NM35AAJOLE09361_.mp3
Sort of like Revan. I mean me. I assume he was killed?;
Better to say he was defeated... but essentially, yes. The victory did not come easily, however.;NM35AAJOLE09363_.mp3
Are these the same Sith that we're fighting now?;
So tell me what you know about the Sith.;
A Sith believes he commands the Force... but it is the dark side who commands him. You know this, there is little else I could truly add.;NM35AAJOLE09365_.mp3
What happened during the war with Exar Kun, then?;
That... is not a pleasant time to remember. After Exar Kun fell to the dark side, he attempted to recruit other Jedi to his cause.;NM35AAJOLE09348_.mp3
What surprised us... what took us completely unprepared... was how utterly successful he was. Many Jedi joined him and became Sith, themselves.;NM35AAJOLE09349_.mp3
Why they did I... I will never truly know. But they did. Battle broke out throughout the order... pupil against master, we fought ourselves...;NM35AAJOLE09350_.mp3
That must have been difficult.;
Yes. More than difficult... next to impossible. How do you fight against someone you love?;NM35AAJOLE09352_.mp3
Bah. I dislike such memories. It leaves a taste in the mouth that... it is a sadness I thought I had put aside long ago.;NM35AAJOLE09355_.mp3
Ask me again about the war some other time. Just... not now. I would prefer to be by myself for now.;NM35AAJOLE09356_.mp3
But you exterminated all the traitors, right?;
Easy now to call them traitors. Tell me... how do you fight against someone that you love?;NM35AAJOLE09354_.mp3
This isn't going to be more sad moaning, is it?;
I've often held the opinion that history has one basic flaw: it is seldom heeded.;NM35AAJOLE09358_.mp3
So go on and greet the world with your spite. Let's see where it takes you. You certainly don't need to hear any more from me.;NM35AAJOLE09359_.mp3
And he was killed?;
You're being elusive on purpose.;
Spit it out, old man, or things get rough.;
I'm not in the mood to play games.;
Who's playing games? Ask the next Sith you see if they're bad and they'll set you straight.;NM35AAJOLE09337_.mp3
Do you want to talk about the war now?;
Not particularly.;NM35AAJOLE09369_.mp3
I'll ask you some other time, then.;
[Persuade] No time like the present?;
[Success] I suppose you're going to nag me until I cough it up, aren't you? Nothing is private anymore, it looks like.;NM35AAJOLE09372_.mp3
*sigh* There's no escaping it, I guess. So be it.;NM35AAJOLE09373_.mp3
My wife's name was Nayama. She was the Ukatis enforcer who shot me out of the sky, if you remember.;NM35AAJOLE09374_.mp3
What does your wife have to do with the war?;
My wife had plenty to do with the war. Upon meeting her, I knew right away that she was strong in the Force. That's why she was able to shoot me down.;NM35AAJOLE09376_.mp3
Nayama was a marvel of a woman. Fiery, determined, smart... she dragged me to the capital and foiled three of my attempts to escape prison. Oh, and that body...;NM35AAJOLE09377_.mp3
The war...?;
Well... yes, that. Needless to say I eventually won her over. That was after I kidnapped her upon being broken out of the Ukatis prison, mind you. But uh, that's another story entirely.;NM35AAJOLE09379_.mp3
At any rate, I wanted to train her in the Jedi way. The Council refused my request, naturally. I was still a Padawan at the time.;NM35AAJOLE09380_.mp3
I was an experienced Padawan, surely... but not yet ready to be a full Jedi and certainly not ready to train another. Especially not one so old as my wife.;NGLOBEJOLE09749_.mp3
So you disobeyed the Council. Like I did.;
I did. I wasn't the first and I won't be the last. The problem with self-righteous folk is they think they're more right than everyone else.;NM35AAJOLE09382_.mp3
I believed in her and trained her in secret. I ignored her willful nature... I loved her too much to see fault in her.;NM35AAJOLE09387_.mp3
And she loved me, too. I know she did. At the time, our love was a shared bliss... better than anything I had known before or since.;NM35AAJOLE09388_.mp3
So what happened?;
Exar Kun is what happened. Nayama was inspired by Exar's promises of a new Golden Age. She wanted to join him.;NM35AAJOLE09390_.mp3
She came to me, pleading with me to throw aside what she called the decrepit trappings of the Jedi... to join her in Exar's war.;NM35AAJOLE09391_.mp3
So she had fallen to the dark side?;
I... hadn't thought so. Not right then. I was too proud to believe that of her. I had trained her myself... I loved her.;NM35AAJOLE09393_.mp3
I pleaded with her to reconsider, to think about all that she was throwing away... to think about what she would become.;NM35AAJOLE09397_.mp3
She would have none of it. Finally, in frustration, she attacked me. She drew her lightsaber and attempted to strike me down.;NM35AAJOLE09398_.mp3
It was a scene being repeated everywhere throughout the galaxy. Pupil against master. In my case... it was a long and terrible battle, but I defeated her.;NM35AAJOLE09399_.mp3
You killed her?;
No... no. I had her at my mercy, disarmed and defenseless. She looked up at me and she knew... she knew I couldn't do it.;NM35AAJOLE09401_.mp3
Sounds familiar. Seems like the Jedi don't like killing their helpless enemies.;
But I should have. Sometimes I convince myself otherwise... but it's no use. She had fallen to the dark side when she raised her saber against me.;NM35AAJOLE09403_.mp3
And I let her go. To my shame, she went on to kill many Jedi during the war until she, herself, was slain in the final battle.;NM35AAJOLE09408_.mp3
I grieved for her death, inevitable as it was, even as the Jedi Council put me on trial for my actions once the war was over.;NM35AAJOLE09409_.mp3
They put you on trial?;
I had trained Nayama against their wishes. I had failed to kill her when I had the chance, and she went on to kill others.;NM35AAJOLE09411_.mp3
Not to mention that I had remained a Padawan throughout the war. A formality, perhaps, but with the trial it had to be decided if I was worthy to become a Jedi at all.;NGLOBEJOLE09750_.mp3
It was a travesty, of course. I told you that even the Jedi were capable of great injustices, didn't I?;NM35AAJOLE09412_.mp3
The Jedi are always fair and merciful. They gave me a second chance.;
But I deserved to be tried. They found me innocent.;NM35AAJOLE09418_.mp3
Even though I... deserved every punishment and more... they let me go. Mitigating circumstances, they said. I deserved compassion, they said.;NM35AAJOLE09419_.mp3
They said I had learned wisdom the hard way. For all I had done during the war, they wished to raise me to full Jedi status at long last.;NGLOBEJOLE09751_.mp3
That... that was when the Jedi left me. That was when they failed me.;NM35AAJOLE09420_.mp3
No, you're wrong! You did deserve compassion!;
For my pride? For my cowardice? Which do you think is the act more befitting a Jedi?;NM35AAJOLE09424_.mp3
They may have been able to forgive me. I... could never forgive myself.;NM35AAJOLE09426_.mp3
And you still believe love is worth the risk?;
I...;NM35AAJOLE09428_.mp3
Yes, I do, I suppose. Does that surprise you?;NM35AAJOLE09429_.mp3
Ahhh... it is all so long ago. Lost in the winds, I suppose. Nobody cares what an old man believes anymore, do they?;NM35AAJOLE09430_.mp3
Let's continue on with the task at hand. I would prefer to think of the present today.;NM35AAJOLE09431_.mp3
You should have been happy you got off.;
I agree with you. They destroyed my mind, after all.;
So that's the source of all this bitterness? They found you guilty?;
Not at all. They found me innocent.;NM35AAJOLE09414_.mp3
So you think you didn't deserve to be punished?;
Of course I deserved to be punished. They found me innocent.;NM35AAJOLE09416_.mp3
I can't believe they tried you for that!;
I don't think I could have, either.;
But... she was a Sith then, right?;
Yes. I think she truly fell the moment she raised up her saber against me. I have played that instant in my head... so many times.;NM35AAJOLE09405_.mp3
You were a fool.;
Was I? Sometimes I convince myself that I couldn't have done otherwise... that I couldn't have seen that she had truly fallen to the dark side. But, yes, I was a fool.;NM35AAJOLE09407_.mp3
So you killed her, of course.;
No of course I didn't kill her. How could I? I pleaded with her to reconsider, to think about what she was doing.;NM35AAJOLE09395_.mp3
What did you do?;
You disobeyed the Jedi Council?;
So you're saying you were an idiot.;
Easy to say so now. At the time I just thought I was right.;NM35AAJOLE09384_.mp3
And what did she think of all this?;
Nayama was intrigued by the idea of becoming a Jedi. She liked the idea of power too much, perhaps, but I certainly didn't see that at the time.;NM35AAJOLE09386_.mp3
Um... no, I don't remember.;
Bah. You got ears that work, don't you? I was a smuggler, way way back. I got shot down once over Ukatis. THAT story, yes.;NM35AAJOLE09433_.mp3
Are you going senile? I didn't ask about your wife, old man.;
No I'm not senile, dammit! Not yet, anyway. Hmmm... well at least I don't think so. At any rate, I'll tell the story the way I want to.;NM35AAJOLE09435_.mp3
[Failure] *Sigh* I'm not interested in your demands. I'll tell my story when I'm damn good and ready... which isn't now, so shoo!;NM35AAJOLE09436_.mp3
You said you'd tell me later... so spit it out already.;
Hmm. Such a charming and persuasive manner you have there. Forget it!;NM35AAJOLE09438_.mp3
[Persuade] Okay, here I am asking nicely.;
Fine. Have it your way.;
So when did you go to Kashyyyk?;
Oh, that was not until many years later, to tell the truth. I spent quite some time wandering the galaxy.;NM35AAJOLE09442_.mp3
The Jedi just let you go?;
Why wouldn't they? I had refused my promotion to Jedi... I was a Padawan who had left the Order, nothing more.;NM35AAJOLE09444_.mp3
I traveled from one civilized system to the next, never staying long. I don't even think I knew what I was searching for.;NM35AAJOLE09445_.mp3
It wasn't as if my travels were pleasant, either. There were plenty of folks who distrusted the Jedi after the war... or worse.;NM35AAJOLE09448_.mp3
Worse? What could be worse?;
If people weren't treating me with suspicion, they were looking at me with greed. I don't know how many thought they could make use of me for their own ends.;NM35AAJOLE09450_.mp3
I got so sick of the treachery and deceit I left the civilized parts of the galaxy and headed instead for the uncivilized parts.;NM35AAJOLE09451_.mp3
So that's when you went to Kashyyyk?;
Actually I was on my way somewhere else when I crash-landed on Kashyyyk. The ship I was using was a rust-bucket.;NM35AAJOLE09453_.mp3
You survived a crash-landing on Kashyyyk?;
I'd taken some damage passing through an unexpected asteroid field, as I recall, but I wasn't completely without some systems. I could still guide her a bit when I crashed.;NM35AAJOLE09455_.mp3
It wasn't what a would call the smoothest landing, especially considering I ended up smack in the depths of the Shadowlands. But I lived.;NM35AAJOLE09456_.mp3
Why didn't you just fix your ship and keep going?;
Hmph. I'm no mechanic. And besides, after you plunge nose-first into the trunk of a five-kilometer high tree, chances are you don't have much ship left.;NM35AAJOLE09458_.mp3
So you crashed... and stayed?;
Sure, why not? It seemed like an interesting enough place to spend a couple of decades exploring.;NM35AAJOLE09460_.mp3
How did you survive in the Shadowlands?;
Hmmm. That was a challenge at first. You've seen the kind of creatures that exist down there... and you missed the really big ones.;NM35AAJOLE09462_.mp3
I was still able to rely on the Force to keep me safe for the most part. The rest of the trick is keeping out of the way of most of the predators.;NM35AAJOLE09463_.mp3
It couldn't have been easy.;
No, that's true. Still... most of the creatures grew accustomed to me, and I to them. At least none of them ever heard of a Jedi.;NM35AAJOLE09465_.mp3
You're completely insane, you know that?;
Bah, what do you know? I'd done enough wandering by that point, thank you very much. I felt at peace in the Shadowlands.;NM35AAJOLE09467_.mp3
And the Wookiees didn't mind your presence?;
They did at first, oh yes. I can't say I was overly pleased to encounter a group of indigenous giant carpets either, I can assure you of that.;NM35AAJOLE09469_.mp3
Did you fight them?;
No, no. I was the intruder in their land, after all. They got to trust me well enough after a couple of decades of my aid.;NM35AAJOLE09471_.mp3
You helped them?;
When I could. I would assist the few young ones who would get lost in the Shadowlands or attacked unexpectedly by the wildlife.;NM35AAJOLE09478_.mp3
I must say... for a while there, the Wookiees actually thought I was some kind of benevolent forest god. Amusing, really. I set them straight eventually.;NM35AAJOLE09479_.mp3
Why didn't you stop the slavery of the Wookiees, then?;
At first, when the slavers took to hunting down lone Wookiees in the fringes of the Shadowlands, I did my best to divert them.;NM35AAJOLE09481_.mp3
Later, when Chuundar made his deal I didn't see any point. I wasn't here to save them from their own sad follies, after all.;NM35AAJOLE09482_.mp3
It sounds like you enjoyed being a god.;
Nonsense. I had no idea that's what they were thinking for a long time. I just thought they were being friendly neighbours, leaving fruit and such for me.;NM35AAJOLE09484_.mp3
Later, when I started to understand some of their grunting, I realized they would say prayers to the 'hairless one' before descending into the forest.;NM35AAJOLE09485_.mp3
Hmph. Hairless one. I used to have plenty of hair, I tell you. *Ahem* Well, at any rate, it took a few bruises, but I set the record straight.;NM35AAJOLE09486_.mp3
A few bruises?;
I traveled to Rrookworro and met with the chieftain in front of everyone. Freyyr swatted at me just to see if I was real or not.;NM35AAJOLE09488_.mp3
I was real, and while it was a light swat, Wookiees are terribly strong. I was knocked out cold for a day. The Wookiees all thought it was quite funny.;NM35AAJOLE09489_.mp3
Wasn't it all a bit primitive for you?;
Not really. Kashyyyk is a place you can feel very small in. It felt good to devote my time to helping people and living simply.;NM35AAJOLE09491_.mp3
And you didn't receive any news from the outside?;
What can I say? I did it all for the Wookiees.;NM35AAJOLE09493_.mp3
The Wookiees?;
The Wookiees. Well, okay, maybe I needed some time on a quiet and remote planet... but if you ever need a friend, an incredibly strong hairball isn't a bad call.;NM35AAJOLE09495_.mp3
You are a very strange old man.;
Why, thank you. You're not so bad, yourself, all things considered.;NM35AAJOLE09497_.mp3
At any rate, we should be moving along, don't you think? If you sat around this long in the Shadowlands, a tach would eat you.;NM35AAJOLE09505_.mp3
You sound quite fond of them.;
I suppose I am, in a way, despite the smell. For a race of gardeners, they've developed quite interestingly.;NM35AAJOLE09499_.mp3
Gardeners?;
You remember the alien computer, correct? Kashyyyk was meant to be an agricultural planet. The Wookiees were made for a reason.;NM35AAJOLE09501_.mp3
Or, at least, that's what I'm thinking. But I'm an old man who's had a long time to develop that opinion, so don't argue with me.;NM35AAJOLE09502_.mp3
I regret asking you about this, now.;
See? Now you know how I feel half the time.;NM35AAJOLE09504_.mp3
You spent two decades living like that?;
I still think you're insane.;
You seemed on fairly peaceful terms with them.;
Well that was after two decades of helping them. They certainly didn't trust me at first.;NM35AAJOLE09473_.mp3
You could have ruled them, you know.;
And why would I have been interested in that? You can't spend five minutes in a Wookiee village without coming out smelling like wet fur.;NM35AAJOLE09475_.mp3
No, no, let them rule themselves. They can screw up their history just like every other race before them. No, I helped them in other ways.;NM35AAJOLE09476_.mp3
With good reason, I imagine.;
I suppose so. Not everyone would understand why the Jedi would suddenly start killing themselves and tearing up half the galaxy, would they?;NM35AAJOLE09509_.mp3
I don't see why you were wandering in the first place.;
I was lost. I couldn't conceive of returning to the Jedi, so what would you propose I'd done?;NM35AAJOLE09511_.mp3
You were adventuring again, I take it?;
Nothing so extravagant. I merely traveled from place to place... I don't even think I knew what I was searching for.;NM35AAJOLE09447_.mp3
Let me guess. Traveling from planet to planet, doing good deeds...;
So if you liked Kashyyyk so much, why did you want to leave?;
Are we back to *that* again?;NM35AAJOLE09514_.mp3
I find it hard to believe you left the Wookiees just for some adventure.;
Hmmm... what's the best way for me to approach this? Ah, perhaps it's time for a little story...;NM35AAJOLE09518_.mp3
Oh, no, not another story!;
You just keep quiet there, you! I've had to put up with all your busy-body questions, haven't I? Well, now you'll listen to a story, dammit!;NM35AAJOLE09522_.mp3
*ahem* Now where was I? Oh yes, the story... you almost made me forget about it. Nice try, but I'm not that old just yet. Heh heh.;NM35AAJOLE09523_.mp3
Now, then. A young man sees a terribly venemous snake in his small village. Nervous, he watches the snake carefully until it leaves.;NM35AAJOLE09524_.mp3
The young man follows the snake into the forest. He clears the branches out of its path and helps it over obstacles. He even works to keep it fed.;NM35AAJOLE09525_.mp3
This is a very long story.;
Shush! Many nights pass and still the young man continues to follow the snake. He even follows it into the sands of the great desert.;NM35AAJOLE09527_.mp3
In the desert, the snake eventually grows hungry. It turns and bites the young man, its poison quickly working its way into his system.;NM35AAJOLE09528_.mp3
"Finally curious, the snake looks at the boy as he lays dying and asks, ""Why were you foolish enough to follow me all the way out into the desert?""";NM35AAJOLE09529_.mp3
"The boy looks back and replies, ""Did I follow you? I thought I was leading you away from everyone else..."" And then he died.";NM35AAJOLE09530_.mp3
Am I supposed to be the snake?;
Well, now, that's what I wanted to see for myself.;NM35AAJOLE09532_.mp3
That's a long way to come just to risk dying.;
I've come a long way as it is, and I'm going to die anyway so that doesn't bother me in the least.;NM35AAJOLE09534_.mp3
I've told you before that you have a destiny before you. This does not mean, however, that your future is already written. They are not the same thing.;NM35AAJOLE09540_.mp3
You have the choice of which direction you take your destiny in. More than engine-sucking Andor, certainly... but even he had a choice.;NM35AAJOLE09541_.mp3
So far you've chosen to take a darker path. You know the consequences of that... we'll see if you decide to stay your course.;NM35AAJOLE09542_.mp3
I'm not here to judge you or tell you which path to take. I'm here ready to offer you my help... should you ask for it.;NM35AAJOLE09544_.mp3
I do that because I think it's important. More important than remaining in my home and pretending the galaxy doesn't exist. That's why I'm here.;NM35AAJOLE09545_.mp3
Thank you, Jolee. I'm glad you came.;
Heh. I'm rather glad I came, too, really. You're a fine young lad. I hope... I hope things turn out well for you.;NM35AAJOLE09547_.mp3
Now, then... I've chatted enough for one lifetime. Let's get this show on the road, shall we?;NM35AAJOLE09553_.mp3
Heh. I'm rather glad I came, too, really. You're a fine young lass. I hope... I hope things turn out well for you.;NM35AAJOLE09548_.mp3
But I don't need you, really. You're wasting your time.;
Hmph. So you say, but it's my time to waste. Perhaps I can influence your decision, perhaps not... only time will tell, won't it?;NM35AAJOLE09550_.mp3
I'd prefer you were safe... elsewhere.;
That's very kind of you, but while elsewhere may be safer, elsewhere isn't where I think I should be. Besides... what's an old man to fear from death, eh?;NM35AAJOLE09552_.mp3
So far you've chosen to take the lighter path. Can you stay that course, even through the challenges ahead? We'll have to wait and see.;NM35AAJOLE09543_.mp3
I'm not a snake, I can assure you of that.;
Well, then... let's hope you're not the young man, either.;NM35AAJOLE09536_.mp3
Are you saying you're frightened of me?;
The real question is whether or not I'm as frightened as I should be, isn't it?;NM35AAJOLE09538_.mp3
And what's your judgment so far?;
Couldn't you just answer the question for once?;
Forget I asked anything. I refuse to listen!;
I want a reason why I shouldn't just drop you off somewhere.;
Am I really all that interesting to you?;
Tell me about Sunry. How do you know him?;
What? You think because I'm a hermit I've always been a hermit? Just because I haven't seen Sunry for twenty years doesn't mean he's not a friend.;NM35AAJOLE09024_.mp3
A man could have changed a lot in that span of time, though. But to become a murderer? Oh, mm mm mm. I can't see it. That's not the Sunry I knew.;NM35AAJOLE09025_.mp3
He was a good man. Put me up in his home for a year back after I left the order. War hero, too, or so I hear.;NM35AAJOLE09026_.mp3
I wouldn't mind helping the fellow, if we can. I owe it to him. Or you can be a young monkey-lizard and ignore me, I guess... well, I don't expect much these days.;NM35AAJOLE09027_.mp3
I have a tape that shows Sunry killing Elassa.;
So you do. I once had a holodisc that showed Mandalore doing the three-step jiggy with a rancor beast. Marvelous technology we have.;NM35AAJOLE09029_.mp3
Are you suggesting the tape was falsified?;
It may have been. I believe you should, at least, keep that possibility in mind.;NM35AAJOLE09031_.mp3
If somebody was going to go through all the trouble of making a false tape to indict Sunry you think it would have 'turned up' before now.;NM35AAJOLE09032_.mp3
Maybe it would be a good idea to show the tape to Sunry. Perhaps he has an explanation. Or perhaps he doesn't.;NM35AAJOLE09033_.mp3
It would be sad if this proved that Sunry did actually perform this crime, but... the truth is the truth. Whether I like it or not.;NM35AAJOLE09034_.mp3
So what do you think of Sunry's verdict?;
You did what was necessary. Sunry was guilty, as sad as that fact makes me, justice had to be done.;NM35AAJOLE09036_.mp3
Doesn't matter that his victim was a Sith or that he was once a hero. I only wish that my old friend hadn't done it.;NM35AAJOLE09037_.mp3
But that's the thing about wishes. They don't come true. And now Sunry's dead, which is a shame. He *was* a good man, you know... once.;NM35AAJOLE09038_.mp3
Bah. I don't want to talk about this anymore. My jaw aches.;NM35AAJOLE09039_.mp3
You defended him well enough. I wish we had had time to look into matters more fully, but wishing is only useful for the young and idealistic.;NM35AAJOLE09040_.mp3
What's done is done. The Republic will likely appeal the matter eventually and he'll be free. I just... I just would like to know if that's best.;NM35AAJOLE09041_.mp3
Sunry was a good man once. And a good friend. I'll miss him.;NM35AAJOLE09042_.mp3
Innocent, mm? I don't know what to make of it, to tell the truth. Do you think justice has been done?;NM35AAJOLE09043_.mp3
Yes, of course.;
I see. I am not so sure. If he did kill that woman, Sunry's going to have to live with that on his conscience.;NM35AAJOLE09045_.mp3
And if he's justified her death in his mind... well... Sunry was a good man, once. I only hope that is still the case. I enjoyed his company.;NM35AAJOLE09046_.mp3
No, not really.;
But that has little to do with the law, does it? A sad state of affairs, that. Too bad, really... Sunry was a good man, once.;NM35AAJOLE09048_.mp3
Do you know anything about this place?;
Oh, I know plenty about Kashyyyk. You think someone doesn't live here for twenty years and pick up a thing or two?;NM35AAJOLE09007_.mp3
Chances are that by the time I finished telling you about it all, you would have found out for yourself. So there's no reason for me to start blathering on.;NM35AAJOLE09008_.mp3
It should be enough for me to tell you that there's kilometer after kilometer of trees on this planet. The deeper you go, the more dangerous it gets.;NM35AAJOLE09009_.mp3
If you're smart, you stay on top with the Wookiees. Go deep, however, and you may find some things you weren't expecting.;NM35AAJOLE09010_.mp3
And that's about all I got to say about that. Now let's get going.;NM35AAJOLE09011_.mp3
Never mind.;
Oh, I get it. Let's play with the old man's head, is it? He's half-senile, he'll forget I said anything! Wait uh, what was this about, anyway?;NM35AAJOLE09555_.mp3
Well, unless you're one of the local species and end up being slaughtered or enslaved, Tatooine's a nice enough desert.;NM35AAJOLE09012_.mp3
Pfah. Korriban's a rock. Mind the Sith.;NM35AAJOLE09013_.mp3
Manaan's an unusual place. Not for its water, mind you... it's the kolto. Healing juice. Only place where it occurs in the galaxy.;NM35AAJOLE09014_.mp3
Hmph. Hard to say what this planet is. Been lost for thousands of years, if not more. *Sniff* Smells like bad, bad karma so watch your step.;NM35AAJOLE09015_.mp3
It's a ship. To be more specific, it's *your* ship. You tell me.;NM35AAJOLE09016_.mp3
No more than you. Get going.;NM35AAJOLE09017_.mp3
Can you make a healing kit for me?;
How many could you possibly need? And besides, I don't have enough supplies on me to put some more together.;NM35AAJOLE09019_.mp3
Ask me later when you're actually in need and I'm less tired. I'm not a kit factory, you know.;NM35AAJOLE09020_.mp3
Hmph. I suppose I could whip up something, uh... you know... few herbs and such. You do know that the best alternative is not to get hurt, right?;NM35AAJOLE09021_.mp3
Not to say that you go leaping into the path of blaster fire or anything, but I know how you young people get. Here, take it.;NM35AAJOLE09022_.mp3
We have a stowaway on the ship. Do you have any advice for me?;
Stop bothering me with your questions! I can barely hear myself think.;NM35AAJOLE09556_.mp3
Have you seen all these gizka we have on board?;
*Sigh* I have no idea what you're talking about. Rabble rabble... what are you saying.;NM35AAJOLE09557_.mp3
[Don't speak to him.];
[You decide to ignore Jolee and continue on with your quest for now, though it might be a good idea to speak with him later.];
There'll be time for chatter after we find whatever has caused this disturbance in the Force. It's dangerous, so keep on your toes.;NM35AAJOLE09000_.mp3
*whisper* The Jedi Council wouldn't approve, but they always were a little stodgy about using the Force on people. Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.;NGLOBEJOLE09758_.mp3
I know I'm just an old codger, but in my time I've learned what goes around comes around. These things have a way of coming back to you in the end.;NGLOBEJOLE09759_.mp3
*whisper* Heh! Reminds me of my old smuggling days. Nothing better than the old Jedi mind trick for getting past an overly curious customs officer.;NGLOBEJOLE09760_.mp3
"You've got a real mean streak, kid. You might want to work on that; nasty people tend to come to nasty ends.";NM17AA03SH01159_.mp3
Nice. Real nice. Maybe later we could find some insects to pull the legs off, huh?;NGLOBEJOLE09762_.mp3
Hey, kid, that was a good thing you did there. Almost brought a tear to this old man's eye.;NGLOBEJOLE09763_.mp3
I had fine clothes, a beautiful bed - now I wear rags and I sleep on the ground like an animal! Were my crimes so horrible that I should now suffer like this?;NM04AAOUTW19000_.mp3
We have no food, no weapons - nothing! How can we live like this? We are doomed.;NM04AAOUTW19002_.mp3
[This tach may be Rulan Prolik in disguise, but you can't tell for sure. Maybe if you kill it, it will revert to its true form... assuming it's Rulan.];
[Attack the tach.];
[Leave the tach alone.];
The droid is busy carrying out the instructions you programmed into it earlier. It can't be reprogrammed right now.;
The droid is actively engaged in its patrol route. You cannot reprogram it anymore.;
The droid is now active. It will attack any enemies that come in range.;
Program droid to crawl into pool and self destruct. (<CUSTOM44> repair part(s));
[Success] The droid moves off to carry out the instructions you programmed into it.;
Leave it alone.;
You leave the droid alone for now.;
The droid engages its patrol mode and moves off to carry out your programmed instructions.;
This is an old cleaning droid for the now empty swimming pool.;
Reactivate the droid. (1 repair part);
[Failure] You don't have any repair parts. You leave the droid alone for now.;
So you're the one Roland has got to help us interrogate this prisoner. I hope your Jedi powers will come in useful, this one has been most resistant.;NM26ACREPI09000_.mp3
He's a Sith spy we picked up a little while ago snooping around outside trying to get in. We thought he was suspicious and brought him inside when the Selkath weren't looking.;NM26ACREPI09002_.mp3
But it seems the Sith have done a pretty good job of conditioning this guy, and we haven't been able to break him yet.;NM26ACREPI09004_.mp3
What did they do to him?;
The Sith protect their really important spies with some sort of mental Force feedback system. They can turn their minds in on themselves so Force compulsions won't affect them.;NM26ACREPI09006_.mp3
Combine this with conventional training to resist interrogation and it sometimes takes months to get them to tell what they know.;NM26ACREPI09008_.mp3
Do you want to interrogate him now?;NM26ACREPI09010_.mp3
Yes.;
While the training the Sith gave him will protect him from most normal interrogation techniques, and also from Force persuasion, we have found a few hooks you might find useful.;NM26ACREPI09022_.mp3
He was with another man when he was first spotted. We think it was another spy, but we didn't manage to catch him.;NM26ACREPI09024_.mp3
We also seized some personal documents he had on him when he was captured. It would seem that he's married to a woman named Tela.;NM26ACREPI09026_.mp3
We checked this in our computers and it seems to hold up. We've sent a couple agents to investigate, but it may be a while.;NM26ACREPI09028_.mp3
What do I have to work with?;
What we have here is your standard issue truth serum. It should make him spill his guts in no time. BUT, there is a catch...;NM26ACREPI09030_.mp3
A catch?;
Because of his conditioning, he's able to resist it at small doses. But if you give him too much, his body realizes what you're trying to do and shuts his mind down completely.;NM26ACREPI09032_.mp3
If you do that, you'll have to inject him with an antidote that neutralizes the truth serum. Unfortunately, that, too, has a drawback.;NM26ACREPI09034_.mp3
I detect a pattern here...;
It causes short term memory loss. This may work to your advantage, because you can try the same tactic over and over again. But if you use it too much, he may forget everything we want to know.;NM26ACREPI09036_.mp3
Shall we get started then?;NM26ACREPI09038_.mp3
Not right now.;
No problem. He's not going anywhere for a LONG time.;NM26ACREPI09114_.mp3
Let's get started.;
Ok, but you should know what we have to work with here first.;NM26ACREPI09043_.mp3
Let's get it started then.;NM26ACREPI09045_.mp3
[The prisoner looks dazed.  He has been injected with a dose of truth serum by the Republic officer. It's up to you to try to persuade him to talk with you now.];
Uhhh.... *groan*;NM26ACREPI09047_.mp3
Inject him with truth serum.;
He's already too full of this stuff as it is. You should question him now, because he's as pliable as he's going to get!;NM26ACREPI09049_.mp3
You should be careful not to give him too high a dose. He should be more pliable now.;NM26ACREPI09051_.mp3
Interrogate him.;
Wh... What do you want?;NM26ACREPI09054_.mp3
Relax. I'm not here to threaten you.;
You're not? You... Lies! You work for the Republic!;NM26ACREPI09056_.mp3
[Persuade] We're the only ones who will take you in now.;
The Sith will never trust you again, spy! We're the only place you have left! Tell us what we want to know!;NM26ACREPI09058_.mp3
[Failure] Urgg... No! Never!...;NM26ACREPI09060_.mp3
Damn, he blanked out!;NM26ACREPI09062_.mp3
Inject him with the neutralizing agent and start over with a new dose of truth serum.;
Stop talking to him.;
Giving up so soon? I think he could last a bit longer. Come back if you want to try to break him again. He's not going anywhere for a LONG time.;NM26ACREPI09111_.mp3
[Success] But they... they wouldn't.... would they?;NM26ACREPI09063_.mp3
[Persuade] If you talk, we can make it worth your while.;
[Success] Ha! Worth my while... The Sith don't pay very well, but they'd kill me...;NM26ACREPI09066_.mp3
[Persuade] I don't want to hurt you unless you make me.;
[Success] Please... Please don't hurt me...;NM26ACREPI09069_.mp3
Let's try something else.;
[Faiure] There's nothing you can do to me, Jedi, that the Sith wouldn't do worse! I'm not afraid of you!;NM26ACREPI09070_.mp3
[Failure] You think me weak enough to give in to false promises of wealth and riches? The Sith are stronger than that! We will have it all eventually anyway!;NM26ACREPI09067_.mp3
[Failure] Never! I am Sith, I will never betray them! Your Republic is weak and will soon fall at any rate!;NM26ACREPI09064_.mp3
We know about your companion.;
What... what companion?;NM26ACREPI09073_.mp3
[Persuade/Lie] We don't really need you. Your companion will tell us what we need to know anyway.;
The gutless Sith worm is already starting to crack. We'll have what we need within hours.;NM26ACREPI09075_.mp3
[Success] He wouldn't talk... or has he already? No...;NM26ACREPI09077_.mp3
[Persuade/Lie] If you don't tell us, he will suffer.;
[Success] But he... I... Please don't hurt us.;NM26ACREPI09080_.mp3
[Persuade/Lie] Perhaps we would give you back to the Sith, but keep him.;
Of course they would never believe we let you go so easily. But they would all too happily believe you betrayed them.;NM26ACREPI09083_.mp3
[Success] Alright! Alright! I'll tell you what you want to know.;NM26ACREPI09085_.mp3
What's the passcode to the Sith base?;NM26ACREPI09087_.mp3
It... It's... zeta 245698 alpha... just... no more.;NM26ACREPI09089_.mp3
Good. With this pass, you should be able to get into the Sith base without trouble.;NM26ACREPI09091_.mp3
Just don't delay too long, or they might learn that he's been captured.;NM26ACREPI09093_.mp3
[Success] You can't do this to me! They would kill me in ways too horrible for you to imagine!;NM26ACREPI09095_.mp3
[Failure] The Sith are not that easy to fool! We would see through your petty deceptions and destroy you for the way you try to humiliate us!;NM26ACREPI09096_.mp3
[Failure] Nothing you could do to us would make us talk! We Sith are stronger than you give us credit for!;NM26ACREPI09081_.mp3
"[Failure] Ha! The Sith are stronger than you; each one of us! You'll never break us!";NM26ACREPI09078_.mp3
Maybe we should do something about Tela.;
T... Tela? How did you find out about her?;NM26ACREPI09098_.mp3
[Persuade] We could make life easy for both of you here in the Republic.;
[Success] Yes...it could be... so much easier...;NM26ACREPI09100_.mp3
[Persuade] Talk or something may happen to her.;
[Success] No! Please don't hurt her! Please...;NM26ACREPI09103_.mp3
[Persuade/Lie] We have her already. She may be spared if you talk.;
[Failure] Ha! You couldn't have her! You're bluffing, Jedi scum!;NM26ACREPI09107_.mp3
[Failure] Do whatever you want! I know you will fail! My fellow Sith are probably even now trying to free me!;NM26ACREPI09104_.mp3
[Failure] You think bribes will work? You must be dumber than I thought to think that a Sith would join the losing side just for credits!;NM26ACREPI09101_.mp3
What was he doing out there?;
We're not sure exactly... If you can convince him to talk, we should be able to find that all out.;NM26ACREPI09012_.mp3
I will interrogate him now.;
I don't have time for this now.;
Well if it's so important, just go then. Not like losing that droid would do anything harmful... like getting us banned from Manaan!;NM26ACREPI09016_.mp3
Good job in getting the pass code out of him. I was sure he couldn't be broken.;NM26ACREPI09018_.mp3
You're back. Do you want to interrogate the prisoner?;NM26ACREPI09020_.mp3
I have a passcard to the Sith base.;
Oh, OK. If you need to find out anything else from this prisoner, though, he'll be here for quite a while, I'm thinking.;NM26ACREPI09117_.mp3
Why do you bother me, human? I do not wish to speak to you.;
I just wanted to ask you a few questions.;
I am not here to give you knowledge. Do business with me or leave.;
Business?;
I trade and sell Pazaak Cards for those that have interest. If you have interest, then we can do business. Otherwise leave.;
Let's see what you've got.;
Very well.;
Fine, I'll leave.;
Good.;
Why are you just standing here in a corner?;
I am here for my own reasons. Those who know of me and wish to do business, know I can be found here.;
You will either do business with me or leave.;
Never mind.;
Leave, human.;
Good day to you. I am afraid I cannot speak to you at the moment. I apologize.;NM14AAJEDI05000_.mp3
The kath hounds seem to have calmed down. The settlers must be relieved.;NM14AAJEDI05002_.mp3
The kath hounds have been very active of late. The settlers feel they are becoming more dangerous.;NM14AAJEDI05004_.mp3
"Please, don't disturb me; I have pressing matters at hand.";NM14AAJEDI05006_.mp3
I hear that the Sith have defeated another Republic battlefleet. I do not know how much longer the Republic can last.;NM14AAJEDI05008_.mp3
I fear it is only a matter of time before the Sith find us here, too...;NM14AAJEDI05010_.mp3
Dantooine has a splendid environment. I would hate to see it damaged by too many settlers.;NM14AAJEDI05012_.mp3
If you are seeking information, perhaps the Jedi Council will help. I am afraid I cannot.;NM14AAJEDI05014_.mp3
It is relaxing to come outside and enjoy the fresh air once in a while. It relieves stress.;NM14AAJEDI05016_.mp3
Freyyr is returned to us! The madness of Chuundar will be undone. It is a great day, and I'm told it is becasue of you, <FullName>.;
And you, Zaalbar, you fought for us even when shunned. All of Rwookrrorro is grateful, and also shamed for the way you were treated.;
I am proud of today. Yesterday is forgotten.;
I need to ask you some questions.;
I will answer if I can.;
Are there local concerns besides the slavers?;
Rorworr was missing, but you know that. You caught his killer and made sure he was executed.;
I am grateful you have kept order, but the whole matter makes me sad.;
I'm looking for a Star Map.;
I don't know about that. You outsiders from away are always looking for strange things. It makes you crazy.;
Maybe you should search for that fool living in the Shadowlands. Our hunters say they see him from time to time and sometimes he helps them.;
Madam, I am not a fool. I survive because I am careful.;NM23AAWOOK01025_.mp3
See, you are all crazy. You can't be him. The hunters say he is a great warrior and fearsome.;
Farewell.;
Goodbye then. Thank you.;
I don't know how he stays alive. Maybe animals won't eat crazy-meat. I don't know.;
Rorworr was missing, but you know that. You caught his killer and showed that justice can be merciful.;
Rorworr is missing. He's one of our most promising warriors. I still hope he will be found alive, but no one knows where he is.;
Who could I talk to about that?;
Woorwill and Jaarak are his friends. You could speak with them. They are in Jaarak's home on the central village tree platform.;
Who do I talk to if I know about this?;
His friends Woorwill and Jaarak would like to hear any news. They are in Jaarak's home on the central village tree platfom.;
If there was a crime, tell Worrroznor, Holder of the Laws. His home is east of the central village tree.;
It was like managing foolish children.;
You taint yourself with your words. You are a friend to us. Don't ruin it with your crazy outsider ways.;
I'm glad I could help.;
And we are glad you did. Thank you. We will be strong again.;
What can I do for you?;
Leave me, human outsider. I do not wish to speak with you.;
I want to ask you some questions.;
Why? So you can better exploit us? Why should I speak with you?;
Because I demand it! Do not anger me!;
Surely that is no way to gain co-operation from the Wookiees. Some subtlety is not out of the question, is it?;NM23AAWOOK01039_.mp3
We are threatened everyday. You are just another body in the army we face from all sides, at all times.;
You see the dignity of my people? We will overcome.;
Don't speak for me, mad-claw. You left in shame. Time has not changed that.;
Why do your leaders allow slavers to take your people?;
What right do you have to question Chuundar? What could you possibly know about us?;
Tell me so I might understand.;
Your interest is surprising. I had not thought an outsider would care. Still, I shouldn't talk of our troubles.;
Chuundar is our leader, and deserving of respect. Even with our doubts.;
Who would you rather have as leader?;
There is no one. Chuundar is unquestioned. You have seen to that, have you not? Speak no more of it.;
[Force Persuade] You want to tell me your doubts about Chuundar.;
[Success] I should tell someone... we whisper it anyway. Everyone wonders about it.;
Chuundar has done much. He keeps the slavers from the village, and rules fairly. He keeps order, and keeps us strong.;
But... his father was better. Freyyr the Chieftain would not have allowed the slaver docking platforms to be built. That's why he was killed.;
When did Freyyr die?;
I don't want to think about this. You test my patience, outsider.;
What if I told you Chuundar is in league with the slavers?;
I would not believe you. You are an outsider. You lie. You cheat. You enslave us. There is nothing you could say to make me believe.;
I want to go back to my previous questions.;
Be brief. I tire of this.;
Any recent trouble other than the slavers?;
The body of Rorworr was found. He was a promising warrior. We will mourn him fiercely.;
You know this. You made certain his killer was executed. Was it for justice, or just the payment you recieved?;
Go on, mercenary, leave me alone. I haven't the money to pay for your loyalty.;
I seek something called a Star Map.;
I don't know about anything like that, but I don't understand you body-bald fools. You are all slavers or crazy.;
Why do you say we're crazy?;
Our hunters say one of you has been living in the Shadowlands, and that is crazy! I don't know how he survives.;
It's probably just hunter-tales, though. No one could live in the Shadowlands for the years he has. No one.;
Well, a gifted few, perhaps.;NM23AAWOOK01111_.mp3
Maybe insanity makes you taste bad. I don't know. You tell me.;
If the Shadowlands are so dangerous, why go?;
We go for ritual, to prove ourselves. Some exiles are forced to live there. What other choice do they have? Slavery?;
What exiles live there now?;
I know of none. I do not enter the Shadowlands. I only hear stories. Nobody really believes them.;
Goodbye.;
Please, do not bother me again.;
Chuundar wants me to find an insane Wookiee in the Shadowlands.;
I am ashamed that he would ask outsiders to track such a creature. Why couldn't our own hunters remove his dishonor?;
If you must be the one, then so be it. Be merciful and quick. A Wookiee without the honor of self-control is a mere animal.;
And when you are through, do the same to your slave Zaalbar. His taint is a curse upon us too. Bah, I will speak no more of him.;
This is no secret to you. For whatever reason, you made certain justice was merciful in this matter.;
I still do not trust you, but you have a small measure of thanks for this.;
Another of our people is missing. If the slavers were responsible, more would have disappeared. This was just one Wookiee.;
It may be that he died in the Shadowlands. If he did, there is honor in that, and he will be mourned.;
Who would know more?;
What makes it your business? Bah, I have nothing to say. Speak with his friends, if you must.;
Woorwill and Jaarak maintain a vigil in Woorwil's home on the central platform on the village.;
Who should I talk to if I have information about his disappearance?;
His friends Woorwill and Jaarak will want to know. If it was not natural, Worrroznor must be told. He is the Holder of the Laws.;
Woorwill's home is on the central tree of the village. Worrroznor maintains court on the platform just to the east of there.;
Soon after the mad son Zaalbar was sent away. Freyyr seemed to succumb to the same kind of insanity.;
It is thought that he died fighting slavers. I like to think so. Chuundar has bravely risen to lead us, despite his troubles.;
[Failure] No, no I don't. You see, your kind are all mad. You don't understand a thing said to you.;
There is no one left that is willing to stand up to the slavers. We wait for the coming of Bacca's heir.;
What do you mean by that? Explain.;
The ancient Bacca was our greatest leader. At his death, he swore that his spirit would live in our true chieftains.;
His sword would be the sign, and legends say we have always prospered under those that held it. No longer.;
No one has seen the blade for years. It is a foolish hope. We now follow Chuundar. He is sane and honorable.;
I don't give you much thought. You are primitives.;
Primitive? Our traditions are ancient! There is great order and honor in how we live! Even with our... troubles.;
Then I will ask about other things.;
No, I will not fear you. Ask what you will, but save your threats. I am numb to them.;
Threatening her may not get you the results you want.;NM23AAWOOK01041_.mp3
I am not your enemy. I serve the greater good.;
I shall believe that when I see it. I will speak with you, but do not mistake that for trust.;
I travel with a Wookiee. I am a friend.;
You have a Wookiee marked by exile as a slave. If he is your property, he is no Wookiee. Not until he kills you.;
I am not a slave. I have made a life debt.;
To an outsider? You truly are a mad-claw. Don't taint my ears with your ravings. I'll speak to your owner, not you.;
I will speak with you a moment, but do not pretend to be a friend. I trust only the word of Chuundar.;
I go where I wish. Will you stop me?;
I will leave you. Goodbye.;
Why do you bother me, human? I don't wish to speak with you.;
What?;NM24AAWRAI09000_.mp3
RRRRAAAAAAARRRRRGGGG!!!!;
Run, run!;NM24AAWRAI09004_.mp3
You come back, but you are the one we remember that threatened. Why rescue the tribe of Iziz only to threaten?;NM17AA11IZ05000_.mp3
I'm looking for a Star Map. Know anything about it?;
If that is what you seek, take this map to the Eastern Dune Sea. It will let you take the long journey.;
Go, and find the lair that we once dug. A dragon lives there, inside with your Star Map. You do what you must.;
Whatever happens, just leave we of Jawa alone. We will have no more of you. We remember all that comes before.;
You have a map to the Eastern Dune Sea. You have been handed the directions. If you fail now, blame yourself.;
I don't need anything else from you.;
Go. We remember the threats. Jawas will always remember.;
You of your kind, Iziz of Jawa would thank you for what was done. Mine have returned because of you.;
We hope we traded fair with you. Was there something else that you might want?;
I'm looking for something called a Star Map. Can you help?;
You have saved the tribe of Iziz, and we of Jawa are willing to trade. I know of this, but it is far away.;NM17AA11IZ05019_.mp3
In the sands of the east, the Eastern Dune Sea, we dig for the People of Sand and find this strange thing of the people before.;
We did not take it because of dragons in the lair. That is where you have to go. Take this map to the eastern dunes.;
A dragon? What kind of creature is that?;
The greatest of the desert. There is no larger. Bigger than the big machines. Jawas don't know how to fight something so big.;
There is a hunter, a Twi'lek. He has seen many things. Look in the Eastern Dune Sea when you go and he may help.;
I dealt with the dragon. I saw no map.;
I do not know what your eyes did not see. It is there, in the darkest of the lair. Look, and you will see.;
Thank you. Goodbye.;
You are a good friend of the Jawas. We will remember when your kind are gone. Ask if you need any more of anything.;
That will be fine. Good luck.;
I think I should ask for more.;
Iziz and the tribe are all of the same possessions. We have given what was agreed by all. There is little more.;NM17AA11IZ05019_.mp3
All right. Just get out of here, then.;
[Persuade] You know the rescue was worth more.;
[Success] Proper trade gives value where deserved. You are right to call the deal an error.;
More for you, but that is all. Thanks are yours, but now we must go. We remember, and thank.;
[Failure] The deal was fair traded. Your service was given what value it was deserved, plus thanks.;
Then I'll have to take it out of your hide!;
That's the way - squeeze that little guy for every credit he's got!;NM17AAIZIZ99148_.mp3
Request: Let me deal with him, master. It would be so much fun!;NM17AAIZIZ99149_.mp3
Oh, I get it. He's small and helpless so we can just do whatever we want, right? Sometimes I just don't know about you, kid.;NM17AAIZIZ99151_.mp3
Hey, why are you being so mean to this little guy? What did he ever do to you?;NM17AAIZIZ99150_.mp3
I know Jawas don't have the best reputation, but that doesn't mean we can just treat them like this!;NM17AAIZIZ99152_.mp3
I do not approve of this. This is not how a Jedi should behave.;NM17AAIZIZ99153_.mp3
This nothing but wanton greed and cruelty! Beware, lest these things lead you to the dark side.;NM17AAIZIZ99154_.mp3
Threats upon me! Take what you want from we of the tribe, but we remember! We remember when you are gone!;
Leave us to be. This is not right. Why save only to threaten?;
[Force Persuade] You will pay me more and like it.;
[Success] Eeee... trade needs to change... you should take more. Iziz says it is so.;
You'll give me more or you will regret it.;
Already do you have a map for the eastern dunes. Follow it and you will find what you need in the lair of the dragon.;
It is as was agreed, as Iziz hoped it was. I have things to give you... take and be welcome.;NM17AA11IZ05017_.mp3
You are not known, so why you did this, I don't know, but thanks are given just the same.;
You will have some things for yourself, as thanks for what was done. Take and be welcome.;
You there, of your kind, can you help Iziz of Jawa? There are troubles from the ghosts among the sands.;NM17AA11IZ05052_.mp3
Could you be clearer? I'm having trouble understanding you.;
Statement: It is doubtful he can be clearer. Their language is difficult even for droids. He is using a trade language to try and help.;NM17AA11IZ05054_.mp3
The trouble is yours, not of Jawa. We must use a language of trade because you listen complicated to what we say simply.;
Why wouldn't I understand your true language?;
That is not a problem for Jawa to have for you. You have the ears that do not listen.;
What is it that you want, Jawa?;
Iziz, I am. Leader of the tribe that is mine. You are the same in kind, a leader that stands before your tribe?;
Leader of our tribe? Heh. That's a new one.;NM17AA11IZ05063_.mp3
There are troubles that we have. The giants made of sand, they are horned ghosts that take us away.;
HK-47, can you help me out here?;
Translation: 98% probability that members of the miniature organic's tribe are being held by Sand People, master. Doubtless he wishes assistance.;NM17AA11IZ05067_.mp3
What about the other 2%.;
Translation: 2% probability that the miniature organic is simply looking for trouble and needs to be blasted. That may be wishful thinking on my part, master.;NM17AA11IZ05069_.mp3
So, Iziz, what do you want me to do?;
There has been no help given by asking the great group that digs with machines. Now Iziz asks you.;NM17AA11IZ05071_.mp3
You have stopped their attacks, so you have been where we are trapped. We will offer a trade for this help.;
Long have we scavenged, among you and those that came before. We have things you will like for this service.;
Tell me about where your people are. Maybe I'll help.;
You know! You must know! You have stopped the attacks! Far to the south, where they hold everything stolen.;
A few more questions, all right?;
Iziz answers hoping you will free the tribe that he holds.;NM17AA11IZ05086_.mp3
Why have they taken your people?;
We find things, and they use them. Jawas slave, serving. They lead with the whip and gaffi.;
So these Jawas are scavengers who are enslaved by the Sand People? I think I am beginning to understand his plight.;NM17AA11IZ05096_.mp3
With the group that digs, we trade and are free. With People of the Sand, we serve and die. We prefer you.;
I'll expect payment if I do this, Jawa.;
A trade can be made of this for that. Iziz will see it done. We thank.;NM17AA11IZ05088_.mp3
I'll check it out when I leave the city. Goodbye.;
Iziz hopes you have the luck you need.;NM17AA11IZ05086_.mp3
I'm not interested.;
Iziz will reward you if you find them anyway. Just please also look.;NM17AA11IZ05088_.mp3
"Tell me about ""those that came before.""";
You stand on Anchorhead, a place named and named again. You come to dig, but it was already dug.;
Settled over and over. Also long ago, ships fell after battles above. Now we scavenge and find the pieces.;
Hmm. I wonder just how long ago the little fella is talking, here?;NM17AA11IZ05104_.mp3
It could be that this Jawa knows things about this planet's history that the Republic has no inkling of.;NM17AA11IZ05106_.mp3
You dig the ore and dirt. In time from now, we will dig you, just like digging those that came before.;
People of the Sand in the sand. There is a place in the far south where they live.;
I'm thinking they're with the Sand People, who live in the south. Either that or I need my ears cleaned.;NM17AA11IZ05082_.mp3
The approach holds great fighting. Bring the tribe from in to out and there will be payment in trade and thanks.;
I ask that you find us, and then bring away from the People of Sand. Then we will offer a trade with you.;
I'm not interested, Iziz. I'm looking for more important things.;
Here is where we could be friends, for the Jawa find important things all the time. Things from before.;NM17AA11IZ05071_.mp3
Go away. I don't have time for you.;
Like all of you, of your kind. Never listening, never wanting. Jawa are more than scavenger traders.;
A little help would be returned. We know of things... things you don't. Leave then, and never know.;
Giants made of sand... Sand People?;
That is they! You know them well, because you have already stopped their killing. I would ask just a small sum more.;
That is how you know them. Giants are different for us, we being smaller. People of Sand are who I mean.;
Stupid creature, can't you make more sense?;
You speak to me for another time. What are you wanting? I have asked the task and wait for your action.;
Those of Jawa remain with the People of the Sand. Slaves under whip and gaffi. Will you help to find?;
I've got to to give you credit... you put in a solid run, rookie. There's no way I could match your times.;
But Anglu's knocked you off the leaderboard. The Beks are going to win this thing unless you get out there and beat her time with that souped up swoop of yours.;
But you can't compete with Redros. He's the best rider we've got. He's a lock to win the champion's prize with the race he just ran!;
Hey, look at this: fresh meat on the track. Well don't get your hopes up, rookie... no first year rider has ever won the swoop racing season opener.;
Your might have an edge because of that prototype accelerator Kandon gave you, but it won't help if it blows up while you're out on the track.;
Gadon must be getting desperate if he's grabbing first timers off the street. When we Vulkars win this year, it'll be over for you Hidden Beks!;
Well, you didn't get yourself killed out there rookie, but your time isn't going to get you into the winner's circle.;
Don't bother me... I've got to stay focused if I want to compete with the likes of Anglu and Redros.;
I heard the rogue Jedi girl was killed. Good riddance! We don't need any Dark Jedi here on Dantooine!;NM14AASETT09000_.mp3
One of the Jedi managed to turn that Dark Jedi girl back to the light side. That's a relief!;NM14AASETT09002_.mp3
Did you hear about the young Jedi girl from a couple days ago? I heard she hurt her master pretty bad...;NM14AASETT09004_.mp3
I heard another Republic fleet was wiped out in this sector! I hope they don't find the Jedi here!;NM14AASETT09006_.mp3
Master Quatra was hurt very badly. She might die. I heard it was her own apprentice that did it.;NM14AASETT09008_.mp3
Did you hear? The Sandrals and Matales massacred each other! It's horrible!;NM14AASETT09010_.mp3
Ahlan Matale locked himself up in his estate with his son. I wonder what the boy did.;NM14AASETT09012_.mp3
The children of Nurik Sandral and Ahlan Matale apparently fled here to the Enclave. Their families are both very mad.;NM14AASETT09014_.mp3
Did you hear? Shen Matale and Rahasia Sandral are getting married! I would never have thought their fathers would allow it!;NM14AASETT09016_.mp3
Ahlan Matale likes to lord his wealth over the rest of us. What I wouldn't give for him to eat his own words... His son seems like a nice boy though.;NM14AASETT09018_.mp3
I heard there was fighting coreward towards Coruscant. I wonder if the Republic will survive...;NM14AASETT09020_.mp3
Rahasia Sandral is a nice young woman. But her father has been keeping her at their estate since her brother went missing...;NM14AASETT09022_.mp3
You know those stones to the east of here? I heard they did some digging and found they aren't natural.;NM14AASETT09024_.mp3
The Council's been telling us not to go near the stones to the east. Just as well, the kath hounds near there seem a lot more vicious...;NM14AASETT09026_.mp3
I heard the Jedi finally got off their behinds and did something about the Mandalorians! Took them long enough!;NM14AASETT09028_.mp3
Those damn Mandalorians have been raiding farms all over this continent. The Jedi won't do anything, so where does that leave us?;NM14AASETT09030_.mp3
I hear the Sith have been beating the Republic pretty bad. They must've spent the whole time building ships since we beat them last time.;NM14AASETT09032_.mp3
I don't understand why the Jedi Council are hiding here. Shouldn't they be helping the Republic?;NM14AASETT09034_.mp3
Unghhh! Stop! I... I yield!;NM39AAYUTH04000_.mp3
You are... too strong for me. I was a fool to think otherwise. I am... at your mercy.;NM39AAYUTH04001_.mp3
Mercy? You won't find any here!;
Then it ends here.;NM39AAYUTH04003_.mp3
I... have no other choice. I'm sorry.;
You ask for mercy? You, a Sith?;
I... suppose I am. Something tells me that you are... not like the other students. I don't know why that is.;NM39AAYUTH04005_.mp3
I... was right the first time, back at the cantina, wasn't I? There is something different about you... more so than I even suspected.;NM39AAYUTH04006_.mp3
I can't talk about that.;
No, I don't suppose you can.;NM39AAYUTH04008_.mp3
So what happens now? Will you show me mercy? Will you... just let me leave?;NM39AAYUTH04009_.mp3
I can't do that. I'm sorry, but I have to kill you.;
I... understand. May the Force serve you well.;NM39AAYUTH04011_.mp3
Tell me why you tried to kill me, first.;
I had no choice. You... reminded me too much of a time before I became a Sith. I... didn't want to think about that.;NM39AAYUTH04013_.mp3
[Persuade] Maybe you *should* think about it.;
[Success] I... suppose you could be right.;NM39AAYUTH04015_.mp3
All the things I wanted to do, all the wrongs I wanted to right... I haven't done any of it. They just get farther and farther from my mind.;NM39AAYUTH04016_.mp3
All I've cared about is power and... and myself. This isn't the person I was.;NM39AAYUTH04017_.mp3
There's still time to change that.;
You're right. Maybe... maybe what I needed most was peace, after all. The Jedi tried to show me that.;NM39AAYUTH04019_.mp3
I don't know if I can ever go back to them... but my place isn't here. Thank you... thank you for showing me that.;NM39AAYUTH04020_.mp3
Remember this in the future. Mercy, compassion: these are the things that give the light side the power to stand against the dark.;NM39AAYUTH04106_.mp3
Take an old man's advice, Yuthura. I know the Jedi aren't as perfect as they think they are, but they're way is a lot better than the way of the Sith.;NM39AAYUTH04107_.mp3
You have a destiny, my friend, and I wish you well on your way to it. May the Force... be with you.;NM39AAYUTH04021_.mp3
I'm sorry, but I have to kill you now.;
Go... before I change my mind.;
Very well. I... won't stop you, or mention what you've done here.;NM39AAYUTH04027_.mp3
You have a destiny to fulfill, and that does not involve you joining the Sith... at least not yet. I won't keep you from it. May the Force serve you well.;NM39AAYUTH04028_.mp3
You could come with me.;
That's... tempting, but I don't think I could. Your path... it goes somewhere I can't follow.;NM39AAYUTH04030_.mp3
[Persuade] Maybe you need to think about your own path.;
You are too powerful. You would never be my second for long... if the academy even truly interested you.;NM39AAYUTH04022_.mp3
No, it never interested me. You were a fool... now you must die.;
I... I see. Then let us end this here.;NM39AAYUTH04024_.mp3
I'm not here to become a Sith. I got what I came for.;
I didn't think you were here to train. Not really. I should have realized that sooner.;NM39AAYUTH04036_.mp3
I'm not all that different. I just don't want to kill you.;
That alone makes you different. Most of the Sith here... would not think twice about it.;NM39AAYUTH04038_.mp3
Indeed. I am Darth Revan.;
I see. I should have known... right from the beginning. But you are no longer the Dark Lord you once were, are you?;NM39AAYUTH04040_.mp3
You are Revan... but yet you are not. What I sense of your destiny is... is still unclear.;NM39AAYUTH04041_.mp3
You are... too strong for me. Gather your hatred and strike me down... if that is your will.;NM39AAYUTH04042_.mp3
I have no problem with that. Die!!;
Go on. Get out of here.;
As I thought. You are no Sith. A real Sith would have no hesitation in striking me down.;NM39AAYUTH04046_.mp3
Good point. Time to die!!;
That's right. I am no Sith... and I am glad of it.;
Then I hope you got what you came to the academy for, whatever that was.;NM39AAYUTH04049_.mp3
I... was right the first time, back at the cantina, wasn't I? There is something strange about you... more so than I even suspected.;NM39AAYUTH04052_.mp3
Your path leads elsewhere, to a destiny I can only guess at. Whatever it is does not involve joining the Sith... not yet, at least.;NM39AAYUTH04053_.mp3
Go, then. Go and leave here... I'll not stop you.;NM39AAYUTH04054_.mp3
I'm showing you mercy. Don't push it.;
Mercy? You truly don't belong here, then. I hope you got whatever it was you came to the academy for.;NM39AAYUTH04051_.mp3
I can't do that. Just go.;
Uthar is finished, and a new order is brought to the academy. Excellent.;NM39AAYUTH04056_.mp3
Unfortunately, I don't need... I don't...;NM39AAYUTH04057_.mp3
...unghh! The pain! I... why did you do this to me? I thought...;NM39AAYUTH04058_.mp3
Sorry, Yuthura. This is the way it has to be.;
D-damn you! I... I will destroy you for this! You... you will never leave here alive!!;NM39AAYUTH04060_.mp3
You thought wrong. I will never be a Sith.;
I have no use for you any longer.;
You thought wrong.;
...unghh! The pain! My blood is burning!!;NM39AAYUTH04064_.mp3
You were going to betray me. Don't think I don't know.;
D-damn you! You will never be a Sith, now! I... I will destroy you for this! You... you will not leave here alive!!;NM39AAYUTH04066_.mp3
You made it too easy for me.;
I did what I had to to to.;
Oh. That must be the poison kicking in, finally.;
While I do like you... truly... I'm afraid I'm not the type to share power with anyone. Even you.;NM39AAYUTH04070_.mp3
But... I don't want any power!;
If only I could believe you. Let's... get this over with. Quickly.;NM39AAYUTH04072_.mp3
As if I would ever believe that! Defend yourself, if you dare!;NM39AAYUTH04073_.mp3
Are you sure there's no way other than this?;
I... I'm sure. I told you there was no such thing as friends among the Sith, didn't I? Let's... get this over with.;NM39AAYUTH04075_.mp3
Typical. I knew this was coming.;
I... I did tell you there was no such thing as friends among the Sith, didn't I? Let's get this over with.;NM39AAYUTH04077_.mp3
Then you should have no trouble defending yourself. For what it's worth.;NM39AAYUTH04078_.mp3
Unfortunately for you, I don't intend to share power. It's time for you to die.;NM39AAYUTH04079_.mp3
I was going to kill you anyway, Sith. This makes it easy!;
Do not speak to me now! Kill him!!;NM39AAYUTH04081_.mp3
Go and retrieve the lightsaber. There is nothing we can do for you until then.;NM39AAYUTH04082_.mp3
"Speak with Master Uthar; he will give you the final test.";NM39AAYUTH04083_.mp3
The ancient traditions state that you must enter the Temple alone. I will not perform the ritual if there are others with you.;
I will begin the ritual. It will take many hours, but when it is complete you must be ready... the shields will not stay down for long. Prepare yourself.;
*Chanting*;
Wait... someone is coming!;
Wait... you can't go in there alone!;NM41ADGUID01003_.mp3
What are you doing here?;
We have had a... a premonition. The Force has given us a vision. There is great danger within the Temple. We cannot let you face it alone.;NM41ADGUID01005_.mp3
You might be walking into a trap... maybe Malak himself is waiting inside. Even if he isn't, that temple will be crawling with Dark Jedi. You'll need all the help you can get.;NM41ADGUID01006_.mp3
No other can go with you into the Temple. You must enter alone. That is the way of the ancient ritual.;
Jolee - you can't come! The Rakata won't allow it.;
Your destiny - maybe the fate of the entire galaxy - could be forever changed inside that Temple. I'm not about to let you face that alone. Not after my premonition. There's a reason I had that vision.;NM41ADGUID01009_.mp3
Jolee speaks for both of us. You must enter the Temple, but we must go with you.;NM41ADGUID01010_.mp3
So you just tell that guide of yours to do whatever he has to do to get us all inside the Temple.;NM41ADGUID01011_.mp3
I'm not going in alone after all. Lower the shields.;
No! You must enter the Temple alone! I will not lower the shields!;
I don't know what he said, but it sounds like your guide's being stubborn. We don't have time for this.;NM41ADGUID01014_.mp3
The Republic fleet is on the way and we're stuck on this planet until we deactivate that disruptor field. You have to convince him to get us inside that Temple!;NM41ADGUID01015_.mp3
[Persuade] These rituals are those of the Elders. They mean nothing to you!;
[Success] You... you are right! These are the rituals of the priest caste. The Elders are no more, now the Rakata control the secrets of the Temple!;
The laws of the Temple die with the Elders who made them! I will perform the ritual and allow you to enter the Temple.;
I will resume the ritual now.;
Why do I get the feeling this is going to take a while? Still, we better stay ready. As soon as those shields go down we have to get inside the temple.;NM41ADGUID01020_.mp3
*Chanting*;
[Persuade] I cannot destroy the Star Forge alone. They must come with me into the Temple.;
[Success] I... I believe you. The Elders have said you wish to destroy the Star Forge and end the terrible legacy of our ancestors. If you need help to do this, I will not stand in your way.;
Lower that shield or I'm going to cut you into little pieces!;
No... do not hurt me! I... I will do as you command. I will begin the ritual.;
Not exactly the way I would have handled it, but given the circumstances it'll do.;NM41ADGUID01025_.mp3
Continue the ritual.;
I had a... a premonition. A vision through the Force. There's great danger inside that Temple. I can't let you face it alone.;NM41ADGUID01027_.mp3
I have to go in there alone. It's the Rakata tradition.;
[The captive cannot speak at this time.];
Get lost, Sith. I'm not falling for any of your tricks.;NM35AAREPP10000_.mp3
You can release me or kill me... but don't stand there pretending to be my friend.;NM35AAREPP10002_.mp3
The Republic will come for me. And when they do, you'll get what's coming to you!;NM35AAREPP10006_.mp3
Go away. There's nothing we need to talk about.;NM35AAREPP10008_.mp3
I have no wish to talk with your kind, off-worlder! I have heard the rumors. We Selkath know your kind are to blame for the poor kolto harvest.;
I'd like to ask you some questions.;
Consult your own diplomat if you have questions, off-worlder. If you do not know of him, go to the Republic enclave and find him.;
He is paid to be of service to your kind - I am not. I believe this concludes our conversation.;
I'm sorry. I'll be going now.;
First you interrupt my thoughts, then you scuttle off. You off-worlders are a curious bunch. It is no wonder I find so few of you worth talking to.;
You need an attitude adjustment!;
If you are fool enough to draw your weapon, you will find yourself locked up for a long, long time.;
I have nothing further to say to a thug such as you.;
You Selkath blame without any proof!;
We have a saying here on Manaan - you can know the what is beneath the water by the ripples on the surface. Do you understand, off-worlder?;
I think so.;
The Manaan authorities may not have the proof to proceed with official diplomatic sanctions against the Republic, but we Selkath know who is to blame.;
I see no further point in continuing this conversation.;
Not really.;
We know that you have some connection with the souring of relations between our government and the Republic. Whatever your Republic may be up to, we Selkath shall find out!;
Your kind has done nothing but disrupt our lives since you came here! We want nothing to do with any of you!;
Why do you disturb me, off-worlder? Are you trying to recruit me to your cause? You should save your lung gas - this Selkath's neutrality is not for sale.;
What are you talking about?;
It is well known that off-worlders have been recruiting the Selkath to join their organizations in an effort to undermine Manann's neutrality.;
Just recently the Sith were given harsh diplomatic penalties for these actions. Now you are trying to recruit me.;
I'm the one who exposed the Sith!;
So you say, off-worlder... but I have my doubts. I believe this conversation is completed.;
I'm not trying to recruit you.;
I think you're paranoid.;
Why are you disturbing me, off-worlder? I did not indicate I wished to converse with you.;
I love watching the races. Nothing much else to do.;NM17AE04SF06000_.mp3
Nico is the big favorite around here.;NM17AE04SF06001_.mp3
Not a lot of women on the swoop circuit. Not that there's much of a circuit left.;NM17AE04SF06002_.mp3
I Don't know how the riders do it. I get sick at speeds like that.;NM17AE04SF06003_.mp3
That's really too bad about your last race. You should have won it for sure.;NM17AE04SF06004_.mp3
I guess the pressure got to you out there. It's not the first time a racer lost their edge.;NM17AE04SF06005_.mp3
Your loss wasn't the worst I've seen. I saw Yuka's big crash on Taris two years ago.;NM17AE04SF06006_.mp3
I guess you're not quite up to taking the big prize. It's a shame.;NM17AE04SF06007_.mp3
You are quite the racer. Too bad there isn't much of a circuit anymore.;NM17AE04SF06008_.mp3
Too bad about Garm's time being beat, but he's just starting out. You're looking like you've been at this a while.;NM17AE04SF06009_.mp3
Yuka Rill isn't going to like you. He doesn't do well against new competition, and you're up against his time next.;NM17AE04SF06010_.mp3
So, was your win beginners luck? Most of the amateurs get stuck at about this level.;NM17AE04SF06011_.mp3
I bet Motta's going to start looking at you as a potential champ. Your times just keep getting better.;NM17AE04SF06012_.mp3
It's amazing the way you are shooting up the ranks. I haven't seen racing like that since Nico started getting good.;NM17AE04SF06013_.mp3
Yuka Rill won't recover from the loss you handed him anytime soon. That Ithorian's a sore loser.;NM17AE04SF06014_.mp3
You've beaten all the local talents. Only Zoriis is left, and she's a pro. Well, Nico too.;NM17AE04SF06015_.mp3
I have to say, you are looking very impressive to me right now. I hope you stick around.;NM17AE04SF06016_.mp3
I like having a champion around, but you're probably destined for the circuit, once it's back up and running.;NM17AE04SF06017_.mp3
I like a man that can move fast when he needs to. Maybe I could trouble you for an autoprint... or something.;NM17AE04SF06018_.mp3
You sure do look good out there on the track, champion. You look pretty good here too.;NM17AE04SF06019_.mp3
That was some impressive racing. Good to see you and Zoriis put the boys to shame;NM17AE04SF06020_.mp3
That was some good racing. Best time of the season, I think.;NM17AE04SF06021_.mp3
What are you doing here when you can race like that? If the circuit were up, you'd be a star!;NM17AE04SF06022_.mp3
You are too good for Tatooine, you know that? The best I've ever seen.;NM17AE04SF06023_.mp3
I saw some footage of Taris before the Sith destroyed it... I swear I saw you... couldn't be.;NM17AE04SF06024_.mp3
Did I see your bike getting prepped? Not many new ones like that come through here.;NM17AE04SF06025_.mp3
It's sad... one of our racers was on Taris. Ever race there? Probably not, I'd have heard of you.;NM17AE04SF06026_.mp3
I'm surprised to see a new racer. How do you keep your bike running? Parts are scarce around here.;NM17AE04SF06027_.mp3
You picked my pocket pretty good on that last Pazaak hand. You should give a working guy a break - we mechanics don't make the big bucks. Just kidding... You want to play again?;NM10ABVULK07000_.mp3
Sure, I'll play.;
Nothing kills time between shifts like a nice game of Pazaak, don't you agree? Okay, let's get this game started.;NM10ABVULK07013_.mp3
I'll play you for your mechanic's authorization card.;
Hah! You're kidding, right? Like I'd be stupid enough to wager my authorization card! If Brejik found out I'd get fired - or worse!;NM10ABVULK07016_.mp3
Sorry, but those stakes are too high for this working class guy's blood. I'll play, but only for small stakes. So what do you say, you interested?;NM10ABVULK07018_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;
Questions? Come on - I just got off a double shift. I'm here to relax and play cards, not to answer a bunch of questions. So how about it? You want to play?;NM10ABVULK07006_.mp3
I don't have a deck.;
No? That's a real shame. You can't play unless you have your own deck, and I don't know anywhere around here for you to get one.;NM10ABVULK07008_.mp3
I guess I'll be going now.;
Well, if you ever get your hands on a Pazaak deck and you're looking to play a few hands you know where to find me.;NM10ABVULK07010_.mp3
Sorry, I'm not interested right now.;
Well, if you ever feel like passing the time with a few harmless hands of low stakes Pazaak just let me know.;NM10ABVULK07020_.mp3
Looks like this guy just won herself a little extra spending credits on that last Pazaak hand - but it's not like you lab techs can't afford it, right? You want to play again?;NM10ABVULK07001_.mp3
Hey, there. You must be one of the new lab techs, right. You like Pazaak? It can be hard to find a game in this place.;NM10ABVULK07002_.mp3
Eh, we mechanics don't make the big bucks like you lab techs, but if we keep the stakes low I'm up for a match or two. You interested?;NM10ABVULK07004_.mp3
Back again? You looking to pass the time until your next shift with some Pazaak?;NM10ABVULK07022_.mp3
Greetings. I don't think I've seen you at the academy before. Here to investigate the ruins?;NM36AADAKV01000_.mp3
Who are you?;
My name's Dak Vesser. I'm assigned to the valley ruins, as you can see. We've been painstakingly uncovering these tombs for many months, now.;NM36AADAKV01002_.mp3
Dak? That is you, isn't it? I... hardly recognized you.;NM36AADAKV01003_.mp3
It's been a long time, Juhani.;NM36AADAKV01004_.mp3
What are you doing here? Did... did you fall to the dark side?;NM36AADAKV01005_.mp3
I didn't 'fall', Juhani... I had my eyes opened. And don't look at me like that. Last I recall, you were having your own doubts.;NM36AADAKV01006_.mp3
I was. I'm not anymore. Dak... you could...;NM36AADAKV01007_.mp3
Save it. The Jedi aren't for me... not anymore. Look... I'm not going to ask why a couple of Jedi are in the Valley of the Dark Lords.;NM36AADAKV01008_.mp3
I don't want to know. It's better that I don't. In fact, I'll just get out of here and leave you to whatever it is you're planning to do. Fair enough?;NM36AADAKV01009_.mp3
Running away? Again?;NM36AADAKV01010_.mp3
Why not? It's what I do best.;NM36AADAKV01011_.mp3
I take it you two know each other?;
Yes. Isn't it obvious? I don't want to talk about it here, however.;NM36AADAKV01013_.mp3
I don't think there's much to talk about.;NM36AADAKV01014_.mp3
Have it your way, Juhani. You always do.;NM36AADAKV01015_.mp3
Look... I don't want to be here after you leave. There'll be too many questions. So ask what you have to ask and I'll be on my way.;NM36AADAKV01020_.mp3
What can you tell me about these ruins?;
Well... it seems that the Sith once inhabited Korriban a long time ago. There was a fortress here that was destroyed at some point before the Sith abandoned the planet completely.;NM36AADAKV01023_.mp3
Why they left, we don't know. Perhaps the Jedi drove them off. The tombs in this valley are the only parts of the fortress we've found mostly intact.;NM36AADAKV01024_.mp3
Made any unusual findings?;
Some. Most of the interesting stuff is still in the tombs, but Master Uthar prefers to leave them to be explored by the students, as a challenge.;NM36AADAKV01026_.mp3
In time, they will probably become safe enough for us to enter. Until that time, however, we're stuck to digging up the valley piece by piece.;NM36AADAKV01027_.mp3
The tombs are dangerous?;
Definitely dangerous. Most of the students that go inside them don't come back out. Master Uthar prefers it that way.;NM36AADAKV01029_.mp3
What can you tell me about these tombs?;
There's four tombs here. On the right are the tombs of Ajunta Pall and Tulak Hord. On the left are the tombs of Marka Ragnos and Naga Sadow. All four were ancient Sith Lords.;NM36AADAKV01031_.mp3
Tell me about the tomb of Ajunta Pall.;
That's the first tomb on the right. There's a rumor that there's a powerful artifact still in there, but nobody's retrieved it, yet.;NM36AADAKV01033_.mp3
That tomb supposedly has ancient battle droids and traps that are still functioning. It's amazing that their power sources have lasted so long, really.;NM36AADAKV01034_.mp3
Tell me about the tomb of Tulak Hord.;
That's the farthest tomb on the right. We don't know much about Tulak Hord, unfortunately... the tuk'ata have a nest in that tomb, I think.;NM36AADAKV01036_.mp3
The tuk'ata?;
A local pack animal that's very dangerous. Occasionally the guards track down a queen and kill it... that usually pacifies them for a bit.;NM36AADAKV01038_.mp3
Tell me about the tomb of Marka Ragnos.;
That's the first tomb on the left. Someone mentioned that a crazy droid has holed itself up in there, but I don't know much about that.;NM36AADAKV01040_.mp3
Tell me about the tomb of Naga Sadow.;
It's the second tomb on the left when you enter the valley. Naga Sadow was the leader of the old Sith Masters here, we think.;NM36AADAKV01047_.mp3
Darth Malak found something in there a while back, however, and ever since then only Master Uthar can enter it.;NM36AADAKV01048_.mp3
What did he find? Do you know?;
No. A lot of the discoveries are kept secret, even from the students. I only heard that Darth Malak found something there by rumor, to be honest.;NM36AADAKV01050_.mp3
I have to go.;
So do I.;NM36AADAKV01052_.mp3
Goodbye, Dak... and... thank you.;NM36AADAKV01053_.mp3
Goodbye, Juhani.;NM36AADAKV01054_.mp3
Alright. Just be careful if you head into any of those tombs.;NM36AADAKV01055_.mp3
Anything else I should know?;
Nothing that I can think of. There's supposedly some old Sith hermit that haunts these hills and kidnaps students. Might want to watch out for him.;NM36AADAKV01043_.mp3
Have you heard about a Star Map being found here?;
A Star Map? No, I haven't heard anything about that. Something like that could be in Naga Sadow's tomb, I suppose... that tomb's off limits to the students.;NM36AADAKV01045_.mp3
Naga Sadow's tomb?;
How can I trust you not to say anything?;
Does it matter? I'm going. Isn't that enough for you?;NM36AADAKV01017_.mp3
Let him go. He... won't say anything.;NM36AADAKV01018_.mp3
So you're leaving? Just like that?;
Master Uthar won't allow us to dig with lasers or sonics... we have to use hand tools only so we don't accidentally destroy anything we run across. That makes progress very slow, however.;NM36AADAKV01021_.mp3
Back again? Something... oh. Juhani... is... that you?;NM36AADAKV01056_.mp3
Back again? Something else I can tell you?;NM36AADAKV01057_.mp3
Welcome to Anchorhead, potential customer. Czerka Corporation stands ready to serve, after some formalities, of course.;NM17AB01CU01000_.mp3
First, your ship is not on our list of planned arrivals for today. There is a docking fee of 100 credits because of this.;NM17AB01CU01002_.mp3
What do I get for my 100 credits?;
The immediate benefit is access to these very docking facilites. This is the only port in Anchorhead.;NM17AB01CU01004_.mp3
Once you've paid we will offer trade services as well. We're not unreasonable, we just want to cover expenses.;NM17AB01CU01006_.mp3
[Force Persuade] I don't need to pay the fee.;
[Success] You know... I don't think you need to pay the fee. We'll let it go, this time.;NM17AB01CU01108_.mp3
*whisper* Heh! Reminds me of my old smuggling days. Nothing better than the old Jedi mind trick for getting past an overly curious customs officer.;NGLOBEJOLE09760_.mp3
This will cover any future landings as well. It's like a registration, so we can serve you better when you return.;NM17AB01CU01010_.mp3
Now, as a customs officer, I can provide information on services. Is this visit business or pleasure?;NM17AB01CU01012_.mp3
Give me some background on Tatooine.;
There isn't much to tell. It's a very old planet, well past its prime. Czerka Corporation is the only company with any interest in it.;NM17AB01CU01014_.mp3
It's not a very pretty world, but there is opportunity here if you know where to look.;NM17AB01CU01016_.mp3
Tell me about Czerka Corporation's operations here.;
I can't really get into that. It hasn't been a very smooth operation. I shouldn't get into it.;NM17AB01CU01018_.mp3
[Persuade] Come now friend, let me in on the details.;
[Success] Ah, it's common knowledge, so there's no harm in telling you. It's a tale of bad business.;NM17AB01CU01020_.mp3
You see, Czerka Corporation staked their claim to this planet based on some very promising geological surveys.;NM17AB01CU01022_.mp3
Unfortunately, that information was incorrect, and possibly even an attempt at sabotage by a rival company.;NM17AB01CU01024_.mp3
So Czerka Corporation set up shop on a barren planet.;
Not totally barren. There were a few years of good mining, and limited operations are still in place.;NM17AB01CU01026_.mp3
But the ore is flawed. It has peculiar properties. They've had to look at other forms of business.;NM17AB01CU01028_.mp3
"What do you mean when you say the ore is ""peculiar""?";
Czerka Corporation has really tried to hide this, but it just seems that Tatooine metal is unfit for effective manufacturing.;NM17AB01CU01030_.mp3
I would imagine that this outpost will eventually be abandoned. Nobody is making any money here.;NM17AB01CU01032_.mp3
Of course, this rock may have been settled a few times, so look for some other company to get stuck with it.;NM17AB01CU01034_.mp3
What other forms of business are being looked at here?;
Pursuits that appeal to the casual traveler. There are some fearsome native species that provide exciting hunting.;NM17AB01CU01036_.mp3
There are also lengthy barren wastes that serve as fine swoop tracks. Attracting business has been slow, however.;NM17AB01CU01038_.mp3
What is known about the history of the planet?;
Very little. There are hints that it might once have been a lush world, but I can't picture it as anything but a desert.;NM17AB01CU01044_.mp3
Native sentient species have no records going back that far. That was hundreds of years ago. Maybe thousands.;NM17AB01CU01046_.mp3
Of course, the native species are not very willing to tell anyone anything. They're barely more than animals.;NM17AB01CU01048_.mp3
What species do you mean?;
The Sand People. They're vicious, and attack outsiders on sight. More animal than anything, really.;NM17AB01CU01050_.mp3
Maybe they know the history of Tatooine, maybe they don't. Impossible to tell. They won't cooperate.;NM17AB01CU01052_.mp3
Have you had trouble with the Sand People?;
Not personally, but they've given Czerka Corporation a rough time. It's hard enough mining this rock without suffering random attacks.;NM17AB01CU01054_.mp3
But it is getting better. I think someone went out on the dunes and laid down the law. Heh. I'm sure Czerka Corporation paid them well.;NM17AB01CU01058_.mp3
Where can I get information about jobs like that?;
It depends on what level of risk you want to take. You could ask at the Czerka office if any bounties need collecting. That's in central Anchorhead.;NM17AB01CU01072_.mp3
While you're at the office, ask for a hunting license so you can sell trophies to Fazza in his lodge just north of them.;NM17AB01CU01074_.mp3
I suppose you could also take up swoop racing. Talk to the Hutt at the registration office by the track. That's in west Anchorhead.;NM17AB01CU01076_.mp3
I can't say I know which of these jobs is the most dangerous. I stay away from all of them.;NM17AB01CU01078_.mp3
I'm looking for very specific things. Who should I ask?;
That's not much information. Could you tell me more?;NM17AB01CU01080_.mp3
No, I'm sorry.;
Then you're on your own. Ask around Anchorhead. Someone may be able to help you.;NM17AB01CU01082_.mp3
I'm looking for older things. Antiques. Artifacts.;
You a digger? I've heard of ruins being found now and then, but they've always been stripped by Sand People soon after.;NM17AB01CU01086_.mp3
You're not going to get anywhere with them. I guess you could ask around, but I doubt you'll learn anything different.;NM17AB01CU01088_.mp3
You could always ask a Jawa. It's hard to tell what they know.;NM17AB01CU01095_.mp3
I'll need good paying work. What is there to do?;
Actually, I really need to get going.;
As you wish. If you need anything else, I'll be here.;NM17AB01CU01099_.mp3
I'm looking for a Star Map. Very old. Very complex.;
A Star Map? That's old holo-tech, isn't it? Not much reason to outfit this dry rock with tech like that.;NM17AB01CU01091_.mp3
You could ask around, but for something like that you'll probably have to go digging. I wouldn't know where to begin.;NM17AB01CU01093_.mp3
Let's go back to my other questions.;
I will answer as best I can. What will you need while on Tatooine?;NM17AB01CU01084_.mp3
I'm done with you. Stay out of my business, or else!;
There is no need for that. I'm just doing my job. You are free to move as you wish.;NM17AB01CU01097_.mp3
Any other sentient races?;
The Jawas are scavengers and a bit primitive. Hard to understand. They have an affinity for Droids.;NM17AB01CU01060_.mp3
Some of our scientists believe that they may not be native to the planet, but how they got here they may not even know. As I said, they're hard to understand.;NM17AB01CU01062_.mp3
They usually end up slaves to the Sand People. They aren't fighters. Good traders, though.;NM17AB01CU01064_.mp3
Where should a person look for opportunity?;
I think the company has even put a bounty on them, but I'm sure not going to try for it.;NM17AB01CU01056_.mp3
What about the city of Anchorhead? How old is it?;
The site is quite old. From the look of it, it's been settled before. Czerka Corporation claimed it only a few decades ago.;NM17AB01CU01066_.mp3
What was here before?;
Some other corporation that went under, probably. Not a lot of records are kept about backwater places like this.;NM17AB01CU01068_.mp3
What species was giving you trouble?;
[Failure] I'm sorry. It's not really a big secret, but my superiors don't like people talking about it.;NM17AB01CU01039_.mp3
[Force Persuade] You want to tell me more about it.;
[Success] I... I can tell you more, I guess. It's not a big secret or anything. Just not good business.;NM17AB01CU01041_.mp3
*whisper* Well, that was easy. I sure wish I had special mind-affecting Force powers.;NGLOBEMISS13300_.mp3
*whisper* I'm amazed at how many people that works on. The entire galaxy must be filled with weak-minded fools.;NGLOBECAND03474_.mp3
[Failure] No, no, no. I'm sorry but we have to charge something. Maintenance is expensive out here.;NM17AB01CU01106_.mp3
Fine, fine, I'll pay.;
I thought you would. Without these fees, Czerka Corporation would have closed this port years ago.;NM17AB01CU01008_.mp3
Is there any way you could reconsider the fee?;
I assure you that the fee is non-negotiable. We have a very thin margin of profit on this world.;NM17AB01CU01102_.mp3
[Persuade] The money I save I'll spend in your stores.;
[Success] That does make sense. I suppose I could let it go this time. We need the business.;NM17AB01CU01104_.mp3
I can't pay the fee right now.;
Then I'm afraid you won't be visiting Anchorhead. Czerka Corporation hopes you will be a customer in the future.;NM17AB01CU01117_.mp3
Guards! This ship is refused access. See that they don't disembark.;NM17AB01CU01119_.mp3
[You have no choice but to return to your ship.];
I just want information about the planet.;
I'm sorry. While Czerka Corporation would like to encourage interest in Tatooine, we must first deal with the docking fees.;NM17AB01CU01113_.mp3
Our operations here are very expensive. We must recoup basic costs somehow.;NM17AB01CU01115_.mp3
What if I don't have the money?;
That would be unfortunate. Czerka Corporation can't afford to extend credit. Everyone pays. That's the rule.;NM17AB01CU01122_.mp3
What if I say no?;
Czerka Corporation maintains this docking station at great expense. It is within our rights to refuse landing permission.;NM17AB01CU01126_.mp3
And I warn you, we've had troublemakers before. The bay is lined with autoguns. Violence is not a survivable option.;NM17AB01CU01128_.mp3
Welcome back. Is there something I can do for you?;NM17AB01CU01129_.mp3
Hello again. Czerka Corporation remains willing to serve, but there is still the matter of the 100 credit docking fee...;NM17AB01CU01130_.mp3
You seem to be taking great interest in our progress. Do you need something, little man?;
Quiet, Luugro! That's Calo Nord, the infamous bounty hunter!;
There's a bounty on your little green heads. I'm here to collect.;NM03ABCALO03004_.mp3
The only way you'll collect that bounty is over our cold, dead bodies!;
That's the plan.;NM03ABCALO03008_.mp3
[Since there is no bounty on your head that he can collect, Calo Nord has no interest in you.];
Is there anything more boring than being out on patrol? Ah, I guess I shouldn't complain.;NM02ABSITH19000_.mp3
Some of the troops got stuck patrolling the Undercity sewers. That's one assignment I wouldn't want!;NM02ABSITH19002_.mp3
Out of our way, citizen - we're on official Sith business! Just stand aside if you know what's good for you!;NM02ABSITH19004_.mp3
[The droid ignores you, being programmed only for simple cleaning and maintenance procedures.];
Back off, Republic scum! A man like you couldn't hope to satisfy a Sith woman!;NM26ABSITH17000_.mp3
Back off, Republic dog! You couldn't hope to compare to a real woman!;NM26ABSITH17002_.mp3
Thank you - I owe you my life! Those bounty hunters were going to take me away and kill me! My wife warned me not to take a loan from Davik.;NM02ABBULL02000_.mp3
I guess you Sith aren't all bad... uh, I mean... look, I don't want any trouble. I'll just be going now.;NM02ABBULL02002_.mp3
Now I can't pay him back. It's not good to owe a crime lord money. He'll just keep sending more bounty hunters after me until I'm dead!;NM02ABBULL02004_.mp3
Maybe I can help you.;
You already helped me by saving me from those bounty hunters. So unless you have a spare 100 credits to give me so I can pay off Davik, there's nothing else you can do.;NM02ABBULL02006_.mp3
Here's 100 credits. Take them.;
You're giving me 100 credits? Just like that? I... I don't know what to say! Thank you! Thank you!;NM02ABBULL02008_.mp3
You're giving him a hundred credits? Generous.;NM02ABBULL02010_.mp3
Now I can pay off Davik. You've saved my life! Thank you! I better take these credits to him right away!;NM02ABBULL02012_.mp3
I'm just glad I could help.;
I'm getting out of here before any more of Davik's goons show up. You should do the same.;NM02ABBULL02015_.mp3
Hand over all your credits if you want to live!;
Are you joking? We don't need this guy's credits. Just go on, we were happy to help.;NM02ABBULL02018_.mp3
What? You're robbing me? You're no better than those bounty hunters! Here - take my credits! Now I'm getting out of here!;NM02ABBULL02020_.mp3
Look out! Those bounty hunters will kill you!;NM02ABBULL02022_.mp3
Did you hear about the big fight at the swoop races? I wasn't there, but someone told me Brejik flipped out on the podium and wouldn't pay up!;NM02AEMALE21000_.mp3
Ah. There's too many people in this cantina since they added the music room at the back! I come here to relax, not to fight with crowds.;NM02AEMALE21004_.mp3
People are saying someone broke into the military base. Could mean trouble for us all if the Sith decide a Tarisian citizen was involved.;NM02AEMALE21006_.mp3
I'm surprised the Sith haven't done anything to try and bring in Davik. After all, everyone knows he's the crime lord who runs this planet.;NM02AEMALE21008_.mp3
The Sith are hunting for any Republic soldiers who escaped the battle overhead. They even sent a patrol into the Undercity to look for survivors!;NM02AEMALE21010_.mp3
You... you're the one who killed Bendak Starkiller, aren't you? What a match - best duel I ever saw! You know, you might want to lay low for a while.;NM02AEMALE21012_.mp3
Bendak Starkiller is coming out of retirement! Everyone's talking about it! Some spacer agreed to fight him in an illegal death match! I wonder how I can get a ticket?;NM02AEMALE21016_.mp3
Look at Niklos sitting over there with his Pazaak deck. I used to play, you know. But I wasn't very good. I finally sold my deck and gave it up.;NM02AEMALE21018_.mp3
The Council has decreed you may come and go as you please.;NM13AAJDRO09000_.mp3
The Council has decreed you must not leave the enclave. Please return to your room.;NM13AAJDRO09002_.mp3
This is Carth Onasi on your personal communicator. I'm tracking your position through the Endar Spire's life support systems.;NM01AACART01000_.mp3
"Bastila's escape pod is away - you're the last surviving crew member of the Endar Spire! I can't wait for you much longer; you have to get to the escape pods!";NM01AACART01002_.mp3
But be careful. There's a Sith patrol just down the corridor. Use your STEALTH skill to sneak past him.;NM01AACART01003_.mp3
Okay.;
How do I use my STEALTH skill?;
First, make sure you have a stealth field generator equipped on your belt. You can't use your stealth skill without one.;NM01AACART01004_.mp3
Use the mouse and click on the Stealth button to activate it.;
The generator will wrap you in a cloaking effect so you can sneak past the Sith. Just be careful you don't get too close or he might notice someone's there.;NM01AACART01027_.mp3
Can you repeat that?;
Be careful! There's a whole squad of Sith Troopers on the other side of that door! You need to find some way to thin their numbers.;NM01AACART01005_.mp3
You could reprogram the damaged assault droid to help you, if you have enough repair parts.;NM01AACART01006_.mp3
Or you could use computer spikes to slice into the terminal and use the Endar Spire's security systems against the Sith.;NM01AACART01007_.mp3
You made it just in time! There's only one active escape pod left. Come on, we can hide out on the planet below!;NM01AACART01008_.mp3
Who are you?;
I'm a soldier with the Republic, like you. We're the last two crew members left on the Endar Spire.;NM01AACART01010_.mp3
Bastila's escape pod's already gone, so there's no reason for us to stick around here and get shot by the Sith. Now come on - there'll be time for questions later!;NM01AACART01012_.mp3
How do I know I can trust you?;
"Very resourceful. I assume you had some part in this; you learned your lessons well from me.";NM40ABSAUL09000_.mp3
The only thing you taught me was betrayal and death, Saul.;NM40ABSAUL09002_.mp3
Don't be a fool. I am giving you and your companions a chance to surrender. A chance to live. Darth Malak himself is on his way, he will be arriving any moment.;NM40ABSAUL09004_.mp3
He speaks the truth, Carth. I can feel the Dark Lord's presence approaching.;NM40ABSAUL09006_.mp3
Malak will destroy you, but if you throw down your weapons now I will ask my Master to be merciful.;NM40ABSAUL09008_.mp3
I've seen enough of Sith mercy!;NM40ABSAUL09010_.mp3
You always did like to do things the hard way. Lord Malak would have preferred live prisoners, but corpses will have to do.;NM40ABSAUL09012_.mp3
Carth... Carth....;NM40ABSAUL09014_.mp3
The Admiral, he's still alive!;NM40ABSAUL09016_.mp3
It's time to finish this.;NM40ABSAUL09018_.mp3
No, Carth, don't give in to your hatred!;
Don't you understand what this man has done to my life? Do you know the pain he's brought me?;NM40ABSAUL09024_.mp3
Killing him won't ease the pain, Carth. Do not become what you despise.;NM40ABSAUL09026_.mp3
Carth... *cough*... must tell you... *cough* must tell you something... *cough, cough*... come closer....;NM40ABSAUL09028_.mp3
[Unintelligible Whisper] You didn't know, did you? *cough* Ha-ha-ha.;NM40ABSAUL09030_.mp3
Remember my dying words. *cough* Remember them whenever *cough*... whenever you look at those you thought were your friends!;NM40ABSAUL09032_.mp3
He's gone. He said... it can't be true, can it? No. No... no - it can't! Damn you, Saul! Damn you!;NM40ABSAUL09034_.mp3
What did he say, Carth?;
Bastila - it is true, isn't it? And... and you knew! You and the whole damn Jedi Council. You knew the whole time!;NM40ABSAUL09036_.mp3
Carth, it's not what you think. We had no other choice! Please, you don't understand...;NM40ABSAUL09038_.mp3
So make me understand!;NM40ABSAUL09040_.mp3
What are you two talking about? What's going on?;
Not here, Carth. Please... there's no time. Malak is coming. This isn't the place.;NM40ABSAUL09042_.mp3
Please, Carth, I'm asking you to trust me. For just a little while longer.;NM40ABSAUL09044_.mp3
She's right, Carth. This isn't the time. We can get into this after we escape.;
I'll trust you, Bastila but as soon as we're off this ship I expect some answers!;NM40ABSAUL09046_.mp3
Of course, Carth. As soon as we get to the Ebon Hawk I'll explain everything. To both of you. I promise.;NM40ABSAUL09048_.mp3
Whatever this is about, Carth deserves an answer. So start talking, Bastila!;
Forget it, Carth. Whatever he said he was only trying to hurt you.;
Okay, he's dead, your family's avenged. Can we get out of here now?;
Forget him, Carth, we have to get out of here before Malak arrives!;
Take your time, Carth. Make him suffer for what he's done to you!;
No, Carth, not like this! Do not give in to the hate.;NM40ABSAUL09022_.mp3
Can I help you? These are the offices of Czerka Corporation. I trust you have business with the company?;NM17AG10CZ01000_.mp3
If this is about employment, I'm afraid all regular mining positions are full. And before you ask, we are also no longer selling hunting licenses.;NM17AG10CZ01002_.mp3
I'm looking for a miner named Griff.;
Griff? Uh... there's no Griff here. Never heard of him. No, I... I don't remember a single Griff on the Czerka Corporation payroll.;NM17AG10CZ01004_.mp3
Maybe 20 credits will refresh your memory?;
That... may help in this instance. Let me think... perhaps I remember this Griff character.;NM17AG10CZ01035_.mp3
We hired that Twi'lek some time ago. Not a good worker according to his crew chief: always complaining and faking injuries to get out of work.;NM17AG10CZ01008_.mp3
He entered false time sheets and slept through his shifts. We even suspected him of stealing Czerka Corporation supplies, although we could never prove it.;NM17AG10CZ01010_.mp3
Yes, that sounds like him.;
We would've fired him but we needed workers. It would have been better for him if he had been fired. Then the Sand People wouldn't have gotten him.;NM17AG10CZ01012_.mp3
The Sand People?;
He was lost in a Sand People raid we suffered not too long ago. There were prisoners taken, but our rescue parties never found anyone alive.;NM17AG10CZ01014_.mp3
In the end it just wasn't cost effective to keep searching. All miners sign a waiver absolving Czerka Corporation of liability in these circumstances.;NM17AG10CZ01016_.mp3
So your workers are all expendable?;
Czerka Corporation cares deeply for all of its employees. That's why we've started a bounty program to thin the Sand People numbers.;NM17AG10CZ01018_.mp3
We didn't find his body so we have to assume he was taken prisoner. Whether he's still alive, I couldn't say.;NM17AG10CZ01021_.mp3
"That's all I can tell you. I shouldn't even have said this much; this is all privileged corporate information. I could lose my job!";NM17AG10CZ01023_.mp3
Is there some type of reward for saving him?;
As I said, all employees have signed waivers absolving Czerka Corporation of any financial liability if this occurs. It is the industry standard.;NM17AG10CZ01025_.mp3
I suppose you could apply for special dispensation from the Czerka Corporation Representative Kiosk on Coruscant. Business hours only, please.;NM17AG10CZ01027_.mp3
Never mind. I want to ask you about something else.;
Very well, though I do have work to get back to.;NM17AG10CZ01102_.mp3
I have gaffi sticks to redeem for bounties.;
Of course. You have done a good job for us and I'm happy to pay you.;NM17AG10CZ01039_.mp3
I want to ask about hunting licenses.;
As I said, we are no longer selling them. There are too many people cavorting about outside the walls as it is.;NM17AG10CZ01065_.mp3
Why would I need a license anyway?;
We use them to insure that only people judged fit by Czerka Corporation are allowed outside the city.;NM17AG10CZ01067_.mp3
We don't allow casual exploration because of legal concerns. Czerka Corporation takes no responsibility for loss of life on the dunes.;NM17AG10CZ01069_.mp3
It's just so we can keep track of people. No one leaves the city without a Czerka hunting license.;NM17AG10CZ01071_.mp3
There is no way to get a license?;
Well, normally we charge 200 credits, but I could make an exception if you agreed to perform a task for us. It's similar to hunting.;NM17AG10CZ01073_.mp3
The Sand People are becoming a problem. They destroy our sandcrawlers and kill our miners. One particular tribe is the worst.;NM17AG10CZ01075_.mp3
It's as if their chieftain has decided to wage a war against us. I would like their attacks... terminated. Bring me their gaffi sticks as proof.;NM17AG10CZ01077_.mp3
If you agree to do this, I'll give you a hunting license now and pay a bounty for each stick later. I'll give a bonus for the chieftain's.;NM17AG10CZ01079_.mp3
Why pay for the gaffi sticks? Why not their heads?;
Which would you rather have dumped on your office floor? Besides, they are ceremonial weapons unique to each warrior. It's just as good.;NM17AG10CZ01081_.mp3
I don't want to do this.;
Then you are free to not leave the city, just like everyone else. Czerka Corporation will welcome your eventual change of mind.;NM17AG10CZ01083_.mp3
Please, feel free to enjoy the door behind you.;NM17AG10CZ01085_.mp3
I will agree to do this for you.;
Excellent. Now, just so we understand each other, this is an enforceable contract. Czerka Corporation takes this very seriously.;NM17AG10CZ01087_.mp3
Here is your license, and a few directions. We believe one of their enclaves is in the far south of the Dune Sea.;NM17AG10CZ01089_.mp3
You might try following one of our sandcawlers. They are regularly attacked. I wouldn't mind you escorting them.;NM17AG10CZ01091_.mp3
Let's go back to my first questions.;
I'll go get to it then.;
Very good. Czerka Corporation looks forward to your future business.;NM17AG10CZ01093_.mp3
What was it you wanted me to do for a license?;
Have there been a lot of people leaving the city?;
With the downturn in mining, people want any chance at credits they can get. Most wouldn't survive a day, let alone qualify as hunters.;NM17AG10CZ01096_.mp3
"The last license issued before the ban was given to a woman named Marlena Venn. She'll do fine; she had a mean streak a parsec wide.";NM17AG10CZ01098_.mp3
She also paid double. Exceptions like this are rare, unless it suits the company to offer them.;NM17AG10CZ01100_.mp3
I want to ask about our agreement.;
You have fulfilled your end of the bargain and Czerka Corporation is grateful. The Sand People will be less of a threat without their chieftain.;NM17AG10CZ01104_.mp3
I will of course continue to give you bounties on regular gaffi sticks. Every one helps.;NM17AG10CZ01106_.mp3
I have to go. Goodbye.;
Farewell. Czerka Corporation welcomes your future inquiries.;NM17AG10CZ01167_.mp3
Yes, we are still waiting for you to return with the Sand People Chieftain's gaffi stick. I will reward you well when you do.;NM17AG10CZ01107_.mp3
We don't have any new information on the subject. It is still possible that they have an enclave in the far south of the Dune Sea.;NM17AG10CZ01109_.mp3
And I would remind you that you did agree to do this task for Czerka Corporation. We expect completion in a timely manner.;NM17AG10CZ01111_.mp3
There may be a nonviolent solution to this.;
I should remind you that you were not retained as a diplomatic representative. You are a hunter, and should go after your prey as we agreed.;NM17AG10CZ01113_.mp3
You are not authorized to do anything other than deliver what was promised. Do so, and don't talk of this foolishness again.;NM17AG10CZ01115_.mp3
I want to ask about Czerka Corporation.;
Of course. Czerka Corporation records are available at our Representative Kiosk on Coruscant. Business hours please.;NM17AG10CZ01117_.mp3
For your needs here, we maintain a fully stocked storehouse. Speak with Greeta Holda about any purchases.;NM17AG10CZ01119_.mp3
I wanted to ask about your activities on Kashyyyk.;
I'm sorry, but day-to-day operations of Czerka Corporation outposts are fully regionalized. I have no information on Kashyyyk.;NM17AG10CZ01121_.mp3
Which is very convenient if one branch is charged with misconduct.;
I'm sorry, I'll have to direct you to our Representative Kiosk on Coruscant. Business hours only, please.;NM17AG10CZ01123_.mp3
May I ask how your operations here on Tatooine are doing?;
Certainly. Please pose your questions to the Representative Kiosk on Coruscant. Business hours please.;NM17AG10CZ01125_.mp3
[Persuade] Why the secrets? The company stuck you here. Tell me.;
[Success] I suppose you're right. It's not like you can't tell the state of things just by looking around.;NM17AG10CZ01127_.mp3
Mining operations here have not been a success. The ore is substandard, and there's less of it than surveys indicated.;NM17AG10CZ01129_.mp3
With the Sand People raids on top of it all, it's no wonder this planet has been abandoned before.;NM17AG10CZ01131_.mp3
What makes the ore substandard?;
No one knows. There are odd energy fluctuations on this planet, but they defy analysis or explanation.;NM17AG10CZ01133_.mp3
But the effect is obvious. Ore taken from Tatooine is useless for construction. It degrades incredibly fast.;NM17AG10CZ01135_.mp3
Word is getting out about it too. We're running out of buyers. Czerka Corporation is not doing well here.;NM17AG10CZ01137_.mp3
Does this mean you have plans to pull out?;
The company would have to be foolish to stay. It will be costly, but in the end, leaving will be cheaper than staying.;NM17AG10CZ01139_.mp3
I imagine all the heavy equipment will be abandoned. It's not worth shipping out things like sandcrawlers.;NM17AG10CZ01141_.mp3
Maybe the Jawas will find a use for them when we're gone. Ha! That's a laugh!;NM17AG10CZ01143_.mp3
What do you mean the planet was abandoned before?;
We can't ignore evidence that Anchorhead was settled more than once before, and abandoned each time.;NM17AG10CZ01145_.mp3
There's probably about a century between each attempt. Just long enough for records about why it failed to disappear.;NM17AG10CZ01147_.mp3
The Jawas scavenge ancient tech all the time. It's a remote world. Who knows what's here?;NM17AG10CZ01149_.mp3
[Failure] I'm sorry, but I can't help you. I'll have to refer you to the Representative Kiosk.;NM17AG10CZ01150_.mp3
[Force Persuade] It would be better if you told me now.;
[Success] Of course, I could just tell you now. No sense in being so secretive. It's all fairly obvious.;NM17AG10CZ01152_.mp3
Anything out of the ordinary happening?;
"I assume that by ""out of the ordinary"" you are referring to the destruction of Taris? That is all anyone is talking about.";NM17AG10CZ01155_.mp3
I'm afraid Czerka Corporation is not offering any comment on those events. We wouldn't wish to anger the participants.;NM17AG10CZ01157_.mp3
Know about anything more local?;
If you are looking for local events, I suggest you go to the swoop track. One of the few leisure industries on Tatooine.;NM17AG10CZ01159_.mp3
Hmm... there was also a Jawa here earlier, saying something about needing help. I think he's out by the city gates.;NM17AG10CZ01161_.mp3
I can't be more specific about what he wanted. Our droid translators had difficulty with the message.;NM17AG10CZ01163_.mp3
No desire to mistakenly associate with the losing side, hmm?;
Czerka Corporation policy is not subject to your approval. It is a sound business model. Save us your commentary.;NM17AG10CZ01165_.mp3
I see that, but do you have the all important Chieftain's Gaffi? That was what you agreed to get for us.;NM17AG10CZ01040_.mp3
Just the regular ones for now.;
Then I'll take those off your hands, but the real prize is still out there.;NM17AG10CZ01042_.mp3
Yes, here it is.;
Well, that is a very big headache that you have removed. I'm sure there are still Sand People out there, but they will be quieter now.;NM17AG10CZ01044_.mp3
I think I'll give you a bonus for this. You've more than lived up to your side of the bargain. Czerka Corporation thanks you.;NM17AG10CZ01046_.mp3
That amount will suffice.;
I'm sure. Czerka Corporation thanks you again.;NM17AG10CZ01048_.mp3
[Persuade] For a bit more I could maintain my vigilence in the future.;
[Success] It would be valuable to have someone on call if the Sand People made another incursion. I think you're right.;NM17AG10CZ01050_.mp3
Yes, here is an additional reward. Once again, Czerka Corporation thanks you.;NM17AG10CZ01052_.mp3
[Failure] I think you'll find that the reward I have given is more than adequate for the task. No more is deserved.;NM17AG10CZ01053_.mp3
Hand over more or I bury you the same as the Sand People.;
*ahem* While I respect your... forcefulness, I must remind you that ours are the finest, and only, guards in Anchorhead.;NM17AG10CZ01059_.mp3
It would simply be inadvisable to attempt such an action in here. There would be no place for you to run. I don't fear you here.;NM17AG10CZ01061_.mp3
[Force Persuade] You want to give me an additional reward.;
[Success] And I wouldn't want you to leave without this additional reward. Yes, of course I wouldn't.;NM17AG10CZ01055_.mp3
*whisper* Nicely done, kid. Those extra credits could come in handy on our little search. Besides, it's not like Czerka Corp. can't afford it.;NM17AG10CZ01172_.mp3
*whisper* Czerka may be a corrupt organization, but that doesn't justify us using the Force for personal gain.;NM17AG10CZ01173_.mp3
*whisper* I don't know much about the Jedi code, but I know I'd rather see those credits in our hands than in the hands of Czerka Corp or the Sith.;NM17AG10CZ01175_.mp3
*whisper* A Jedi shoud not use the Force to acquire credits - even if we are taking them from a corrupt corporation like Czerka.;NM17AG10CZ01174_.mp3
Once again, Czerka Corporation thanks you.;NM17AG10CZ01057_.mp3
I was mistaken. I'll be back later.;
Very well, but we need this matter taken care of.;NM17AG10CZ01063_.mp3
Did the Sand People kill Griff or not!;
You mean he's dead?;
So you fired him?;
[Persuade] Are you certain of that? I would leave sooner if I knew.;
[Success] Oh, you mean that Twi'lek! Must have slipped my mind for a second. Yes, of course I remember Griff.;NM17AG10CZ01006_.mp3
[Failure] I'm sorry, but Czerka Corporation officials do not accept bribes. Now, unless you're interested in our bounties or some other business I'm going to have to ask you to leave!;NM17AG10CZ01030_.mp3
[Force Persuasion] You want to tell me about Griff.;
[Success] Can you spare me a few moments? I have something I want to get off my chest. I want to tell you about one of our workers. His name was Griff.;NM17AG10CZ01032_.mp3
Hello again. I hear you've made an impression down at the swoop track. Czerka Corporation wholly supports local events.;NM17AG10CZ01168_.mp3
Er... not financially, you understand. Now, was this about bounties or something else?;NM17AG10CZ01170_.mp3
Greetings again from the offices of Czerka Corporation. Is this about bounties or something else?;NM17AG10CZ01171_.mp3
I am not surprised to see you here, <FullName>. I am surprised you came alone, however. I thought you would know by now how dangerous we Genoharadan are.;
I knew you were too much of a coward to come alone!;
Really? If you knew this, you should have been smart enough to bring your friends with you. You helped me betray the other Overseers: you should know I don't play fair.;
I honored our agreement. This is between you and me alone.;
You have seen me betray the other Overseers, yet you still believe a Genoharadan cares anything about honor? That is a foolish mistake, <FullName>. One you won't live to regret.;
You have great potential, <FullName>. Even the Genoharadan's best agents would not likely have been able to eliminate the other three Overseers.;
You even have the potential to become an Overseer yourself, one day. That's why I have to kill you here: eliminating the competition is the key to maintaining my power.;
I killed the other Overseers. I can kill you too, Hulas.;
The other Overseers were alone and unprepared. I am ready for you - and I have friends. Goodbye, <FullName>. Our time together was... interesting.;
Brothers of the Genoharadan: attack!;
Let's get this over with.;
My thoughts exactly.;
You are here, <FullName>. But I see you did not come alone.;
I see you've brought some friends as well, Hulas.;
You shouldn't be surprised. You saw how I manipulated and betrayed my fellow Overseers. You should know the Genoharadan seek every advantage we can get.;
I had hoped you would be gullible enough to show up alone, but obviously I underestimated you... although I see from their expressions that your friends have no clue what is going on here.;
Not that it matters. If I win here, what you know of the Genoharadan will die here with you. If you win, the guild will vanish until they select new Overseers... if they even survive.;
Three Genoharadan Overseers out of four are dead, Hulas. Time to finish the job!;
I knew you were too much of a coward to come alone.;
You have my thanks. I shall try to return to the One and tell him what has happened.;
Get us out of here and you shall have the gratitude of the Rakata!;
The One will not let the Elders live!;
What... what are you doing here? I don't want any trouble with the Sith. Please, just go before... please, just go.;
Hey - you can't come in here! This is a private apartment!;
I'm here to collect the bounty on your head, Matrik!;
I knew one of Davik's scum would find me eventually. But if I die at least I'll have a clear conscience! I wonder, can you say the same?;
Clear conscience? What are you talking about?;
My testimony helped put some of the biggest criminals on Taris away for life. But Davik didn't like seeing his friends go down, so now he's got a bounty on my head.;
Maybe there's some way I could help you out of this mess.;
I don't think there's much anyone could do. And I'm getting sick of running. I've decided to make my stand right here.;
Maybe you could turn the tables. You know, have Davik eliminated.;
Getting inside Davik's base is nearly impossible. Even if I got rid of him, the Exchange would just appoint someone to his place and I'd still have a price on my head.;
Maybe you could fake your own death?;
I've already thought of that. I even came up with a plan of how to do it. But I can't pull it off while I'm holed up in here.;
Tell me your plan and I might help you out.;
The trick is getting Davik to buy it when there's no body found at the scene. If it looks like I died in a massive explosion, he won't be suspicious when my corpse never turns up.;
If I had an accomplice go back and tell Davik that they were the one who set off the explosion to eliminate me, I think I'd be home free.;
I have some demolitions experience from my own days in the Exchange so I could set it all up. But I'd need to get my hands on a permacrete detonator.;
I could get you a permacrete detonator.;
They don't usually sell them in stores here in the Lower City, but the Upper City might carry them. You might want to look there first.;
I have a permacrete detonator right here. Go on... take it.;
Let me see... yes, this should do the trick. There won't be anything left of this apartment but some scorching on the walls after I set this bad boy off!;
Okay, the timer's set! Now let's get out of here before it blows!;
That was quite the blast! Don't go back in there... the whole roof might cave in on your head.;
Look, I'm not a man for long goodbyes but I want to say 'thanks'. If it wasn't for you I'd be a dead man. But now I won't have to worry about anymore bounty hunters coming after me.;
So good luck, and goodbye. Now that I'm 'dead' I can't be seen wandering the streets.;
I've got a permacrete detonator on me... but it'll cost you.;
I don't have any credits - all I've got is the clothes on my back. But if you help me with this, you can go to Zax in the bounty office and claim the price on my head.;
I think I'll just kill you and collect the bounty instead.;
Well, you're going to have to earn it!;
Forget it. I'll just take my detonator and go.;
You think I'm going to just let you walk out of here with the detonator that could be my ticket to salvation? You better think again, friend!;
I think it's time for me to collect your bounty, Matrik!;
I don't want to get involved in this.;
Can't say I blame you. If I had it all to do again I might think twice before going up against the Exchange. I understand if you just want to leave.;
Just be careful that nobody sees you as you leave. I don't want anyone to find out I'm hiding here.;
Maybe you could pay Davik off?;
It wouldn't work. This goes beyond money. The Exchange wants to make an example of me. Davik won't stop until I'm dead.;
I have no conscience. Time to die.;
No, wait! I want to hear what this man means by 'clear conscience'.;NM03ADMATR05013_.mp3
Hold on a second. I want to hear what he means by 'clear conscience'.;NM03ADMATR99075_.mp3
I don't think you know who you're dealing with! I don't let criminals and thugs walk all over me!;
What are you doing in here? This place looks abandoned!;
None of your business. Just turn around and go back the way you came, if you know what's good for you.;
[Persuade] Are you in some sort of trouble? Do you want to talk about it?;
[Success] I... I guess I could tell you. You'll probably find out on your own eventually, anyway. Zax is giving his bounties away like candy, or so I hear.;
My name's Matrik - I used to work for the Exchange, but all the violence and killing started to get to me. I knew what I was doing was wrong, so I turned state's evidence.;
[Failure] It's not something you want to get mixed up in. Look, do yourself a favor and just leave me alone.;
I'm here to rob this place. Sit down and shut up and you won't get hurt.;
I don't like your attitude!;
That's it - you've pushed me too far! You shouldn't push a man on the edge!;
Don't get upset. I'll go now.;
Good... get out of here. Stay out of my apartment and my business!;
I was afraid you wouldn't come back. Did you manage to find a permacrete detonator?;
No, I don't have a permacrete detonator yet.;
I'll be going now.;
Back again? You know I'm a man on the lam. I don't really want visitors coming and going from my hiding place.;
Tell me again why you're hiding here.;
You again? Look, there's nothing in here for you so you might as well leave.;
[This woman appears to be looking for someone... maybe even one of your companions back on the Ebon Hawk.];
Excuse me... I know it's been a very long time, dear, but aren't you Bastila, Helena's little girl? Yes - it is you! I can see it in the eyes. My how you've grown!;
I am Bastila, yes. I take it that you know my mother?;NGLOBEMALA12002_.mp3
Oh, yes. I worked for your father on an expedition years ago. Your mother showed me holos of you before you... well, before you left. Such a pretty little girl you were.;
Is there something I can do for you, miss? As you can see, we are in quite a hurry.;NGLOBEMALA12006_.mp3
Don't be rude, Bastila.;
Oh, I didn't mean to take up your time. I just wanted to ask you if your mother's condition has improved any since I saw her.;
My mother's condition?;NGLOBEMALA12010_.mp3
Oh, you... you don't know? Oh, dear. I just thought... I assumed that she had found you. When I talked to her last, she was desperate to find you...;
I have not seen my mother since I joined the order. Do you know what has happened? Did she... say anything about my father?;NGLOBEMALA12014_.mp3
I'm sorry, dear, but your mother is very ill. So she told me. She didn't say anything about your father, however. I didn't see him.;
I see. Where did you meet her, do you remember?;NGLOBEMALA12018_.mp3
She's here on Tatooine, dear. In the cantina. You really should go see her, considering her condition.;
I guess we should go see your mother, Bastila.;
Part of me would rather not see her at all. But if she is really sick... well, we shall see.;NGLOBEMALA12028_.mp3
We're too busy for this nonsense, Bastila!;
I agree. Should we get the chance, however, I would speak to her. Perhaps it has something to do with my father.;NGLOBEMALA12034_.mp3
I saw her on Tatooine, dear. She said she'd been there for awhile. Maybe she's still there?;
Thank you for informing me. I really must be going, now.;NGLOBEMALA12022_.mp3
What's this all about?;
It seems my mother has been looking for me. Strange. Should we get the opportunity, could we look for her on Tatooine?;NGLOBEMALA12024_.mp3
I thought you and your mother didn't get along?;
We never did. I am interested in hearing about my father, however.;NGLOBEMALA12026_.mp3
Certainly, if you think it's important.;
It is important enough that my mother was attempting to seek me out. Perhaps it has something to do with my father.;NGLOBEMALA12031_.mp3
Forget it. We've got better things to do.;
We're on an important mission here, Bastila.;
Yes, of course. I would never jeopardize our mission. However, if we get the opportunity I would like to visit Tatooine.;NGLOBEMALA12038_.mp3
Bastila's right. We don't have time for this.;
If it wasn't for those damn Selkath neutrality laws, I'd teach that Sith a thing or two!;NM26ACREPS14000_.mp3
You have to learn to control your anger. Anger leads to the dark side.;
I... I suppose you're right. You probably know best - you are a Jedi, after all. I guess getting mad doesn't help any.;NM26ACREPS14002_.mp3
As long as the Sith stay out of my way, I'll stay out of theirs.;NM26ACREPS14007_.mp3
The Republic must respect the law.;
Don't be such a coward - teach those Sith a lesson!;
I can't do anything that would get me in trouble, or the Selkath might slap export penalties on the Republic.;NM26ACREPS14005_.mp3
We need the Selkath's kolto for the war effort against Malak.;NM26ACREPS14006_.mp3
You are so lucky. You got accepted into the academy, didn't you? I'm beginning to think I never will. *sigh*;NM33AAGENP09000_.mp3
Hey! You've got one of the medallions! You've been accepted! How did you ever manage that?!;NM33AAGENP09001_.mp3
If you're looking to get into the academy, you're going to have a tough time. There's lots of us here trying to get accepted.;NM33AAGENP09002_.mp3
When one of the Sith thinks you're ready for the academy, he gives you a medallion. I wish I had one of those...;NM33AAGENP09003_.mp3
Can you imagine if I actually became a Sith? The power I'd have! I could do anything!!;NM33AAGENP09004_.mp3
Do you know where I can find Yuthura Ban? I understand she's the one who determines if you are accepted into the academy or not.;NM33AAGENP09005_.mp3
You'd better be careful around some of those Sith. They'll eliminate any prospects just to remove a potential future threat!;NM33AAGENP09006_.mp3
I've had two friends killed by the Sith already. It must be some kind of test... I'll survive and make it into the academy, I know it!;NM33AAGENP09007_.mp3
Wow. This is going to look really bad on my record.;NM22ABCZGU05000_.mp3
The patrol Captain will speak for us. He's the ranking officer in this unit.;NM22ABCZGU05001_.mp3
You know, we're gonna get stuck with the bill for this.;NM22ABCZGU05002_.mp3
I thought he said shoot. I swear he said shoot.;NM22ABCZGU05003_.mp3
Well, this means extra duty for sure.;NM22ABCZGU05004_.mp3
Why do they always have to be so difficult?;NM22ABCZGU05005_.mp3
They won't miss one, will they?;NM22ABCZGU05006_.mp3
We should just say it bolted, or something.;NM22ABCZGU05007_.mp3

Bastila has told us of a most unusual development. She claims you and she have shared a dream, a vision of Malak and Revan in the ancient ruins here on Dantooine.;NM13AAVAND17000_.mp3
These ruins have long been known to us, but we believed them to be merely burial mounds. Perhaps they are more than we first suspected, if Revan and Malak found something there.;NM13AAVAND17001_.mp3
Yes... they seemed to be searching for something;
Bastila has described this shared dream to the Council in great detail. We feel it is more than a dream. It is a vision. The Force is acting through you as it acts through Bastila.;NM13AAVAND17003_.mp3
I am having visions now?;
You and Bastila share a powerful connection to the Force... and each other. This is not unheard of. Connections often form between Master and student, but rarely does a bond develop so quickly.;NM13AAVAND17005_.mp3
Whatever dangers may lie ahead, we cannot ignore the destiny that has brought you and Bastila here to us. Together.;NM13AAVAND17006_.mp3
Are you saying I'm... joined with her?;
You and she are linked, as is your fate to hers. Together, you two may be able to stop Darth Malak and the Sith.;NM13AAVAND17008_.mp3
But do not let your head be filled with visions of glory and power! Such thoughts are the path to the dark side.;NM13AAVAND17009_.mp3
The way of the light is long and difficult, as you must learn. Are you ready for such hardship?;NM13AAVAND17010_.mp3
Yes. I'm ready for whatever awaits me.;
Understand that there is little choice in this matter, for you or us. Across the galaxy the numbers of our Order dwindle. We have sent many Jedi in quest of a way to thwart Malak's advance... many have not returned.;NM13AAVAND17012_.mp3
The Sith hunt the Jedi down like animals, ambushing and assassinating our brothers wherever they are found. We fear it is only a matter of time until they discover even this hidden refuge.;NM13AAVAND17013_.mp3
Other Jedi have fallen from the light and embraced the dark side, giving their allegiance to the Sith and Malak, their dark lord.;NM13AAVAND17014_.mp3
Jedi are turning to the dark side?;
The lure of the dark side is not easy to resist. Malak's power grows as more and more planets fall to his conquering armies.;NM13AAVAND17016_.mp3
If Malak is not stopped the Republic will fall, and the Jedi will be hunted to extinction. The galaxy will enter a time of darkness and tyranny not seen for a thousand generations.;NM13AAVAND17017_.mp3
The Council has decreed that you and Bastila must investigate the ancient ruins you dreamed of... once the Council deems you ready.;NM13AAVAND17018_.mp3
Perhaps there you will find some clue, some explanation, of how Revan and Malak were corrupted. And perhaps there you shall find a way to stop them.;NM13AAVAND17019_.mp3
I'm ready now. I accept this mission.;
The Force flows through you like no student we have ever seen. But you are willful and headstrong... a dangerous combination.;NM13AAVAND17021_.mp3
Before we send you to investigate the ruins, you must be trained in the ways of the Jedi so that you can resist the darkness within yourself... within all of us. Otherwise you are doomed to fail.;NM13AAVAND17022_.mp3
We don't have time for this!;
You must learn patience and discipline. The ruins are a place of corruption. The dark side is strong there. We cannot risk sending you there unprepared.;NM13AAVAND17024_.mp3
We must begin your training at once. You have a destiny upon you that you must be prepared to face. The entire fate of the galaxy is upon you.;NM13AAVAND17026_.mp3
I can only hope you will prove up to the task.;NM13AAVAND17027_.mp3
As you wish, Master Vandar.;
[Lie] I surrender myself to the will of the Council.;
[Success] We must begin your training at once. You have a destiny upon you that you must be prepared to face. The entire fate of the galaxy is upon you.;NM13AAVAND17029_.mp3
I don't know if I want to do this... it sounds dangerous.;
You have a strong affinity with the Force. With such power comes great responsibility... and danger. You may wish to deny what you are, but the Council cannot turn a blind eye.;NM13AAVAND17031_.mp3
Neither will Darth Malak. Your strength is a threat to him. In time he will learn of you and the Sith will hunt you down. It is inevitable. Defeating the Sith is the only way to save yourself.;NM13AAVAND17032_.mp3
Very well, I will help you.;
It seems I have no choice...;
I will learn your Jedi powers and defeat Malak!;
[Lie] Of course, Masters. Anything to further the light.;
[Success] Hm, yes. Your devotion is most commendable.;NM13AAVAND17037_.mp3
[Lie] Do not fear Masters, I will not fall.;
[Success] If Malak is not stopped the Republic will fall, and the Jedi will be hunted to extinction. The galaxy will enter a time of darkness and tyranny not seen for a thousand generations.;NM13AAVAND17039_.mp3
How can he be stopped?;
Perhaps our hope lies in the dream you and Bastila shared. The Council has come to the conclusion that you and Bastila must investigate the ancient ruins you dreamed of.;NM13AAVAND17041_.mp3
I will try my best.;
[Lie] Of course, Masters. I seek to follow the light.;
Good. It is well that you see how important this is and have the devotion to follow it.;NM13AAVAND17044_.mp3
What are you talking about?;
I trust in your greater wisdom.;
I don't want to talk about it.;
What?? How would Bastila know if we shared a dream?;
She says that she felt your presence within the dream, the presence she has felt within you ever since...;NM13AAVAND17049_.mp3
Master Vandar!;NM13AAVAND17050_.mp3
... ever since Taris. It is not unknown for this to happen between two people strong in the Force.;NM13AAVAND17051_.mp3
[Lie] I don't know what Bastila is talking about.;
[Failure] See? Dishonesty! We are taking an incalculable risk in even considering training this one!;NM13AAVAND17053_.mp3
You cannot deny what you are. These dreams are part of you. The Force is part of you, though a part you cannot yet control. But through training and discipline we can teach you to live as one with the Force.;NM13AAVAND17054_.mp3
It is good to see Juhani has returned to the way of the light. You are to be commended for your role in this. Your actions give us great hope for the future.;NM13AAVAND17055_.mp3
Your training is now complete, young Padawan. And perhaps now it is time we dealt with the matter of the dream you and Bastila shared.;NM13AAVAND17131_.mp3
When we heard of the ruins in your dreams, Master Dorak recognized it as one of a series of ancient structures here on Dantooine. This one in particular lies to the east of this Enclave.;NM13AAVAND17132_.mp3
We sent a Jedi to investigate... but he has not returned. Perhaps sending him in the first place was a mistake.;NM13AAVAND17133_.mp3
"The Force is guiding you through your visions; it may be that exploring the ruins is a task tied to your destiny. That is why the Council has now decided you should be the one to investigate this.";NM13AAVAND17134_.mp3
The secrets to stopping Malak may be hidden within those ruins. You must investigate them and find what Revan and Malak were looking for.;NM13AAVAND17135_.mp3
I'd like to ask you some questions.;
A Jedi must ever be seeking knowledge. What is it you wish to know?;NM13AAVAND17137_.mp3
What can you tell me about Bastila?;
Bastila will be a great Jedi someday. Even among the Masters and the Council it is rare to find one so skilled in the art of Battle Meditation.;NM13AAVAND17139_.mp3
Bastila was there when Revan was slain. Did you know that?;NM13AAVAND17140_.mp3
I had no idea.;
Bastila herself does not like to talk about it. She was accompanying the strike team that confronted Revan when the Dark Lord was destroyed. Her role in the death of such a promising young Jedi as Revan upset her greatly.;NM13AAVAND17142_.mp3
But Bastila knew she had to set her personal feelings aside for the sake of the galaxy and the Republic. The Force is strong with her now, and without her skill in Battle Meditation we would have lost this war long ago.;NM13AAVAND17143_.mp3
The way ahead will be difficult for young Bastila... and for you. But you must draw strength from each other. May the Force be with you.;NM13AAVAND17144_.mp3
Carth mentioned something about it.;
I think I'll be going now.;
Is there anything you can tell me about Revan and Malak?;
I knew Revan as a promising young pupil. Revan was strong in the Force, but also headstrong and proud. Such traits are not unusual in a Padawan. Perhaps that was why I did not see the true extent of the danger.;NM13AAVAND17148_.mp3
Many of the young Jedi admired Revan, including Malak. When Revan set off to challenge the Mandalorians, Malak was the first to join the cause.;NM13AAVAND17149_.mp3
And when Revan fell to the dark side it was inevitable Malak would fall as well.;NM13AAVAND17150_.mp3
So Revan was stronger than Malak?;
Revan was always the more powerful of the pair. When Revan fell we had hoped the Sith threat was ended. But Malak quickly assumed Revan's role and embraced the dark side as fully as his Master ever had.;NM13AAVAND17152_.mp3
You should speak to Master Dorak after this council. As Chronicler of this Academy, he can give you more details of these events. But we must concern ourselves with the present.;NM13AAVAND17153_.mp3
Now Malak leads the Sith armada against the Republic, hate and vengeance drawing him ever further down the dark path, fueling his powers until they have surpassed those of his old Master.;NM13AAVAND17154_.mp3
Only you and Bastila together can stop Malak now.;NM13AAVAND17155_.mp3
Are you saying Revan was responsible for Malak's fall?;
Why doesn't Master Vrook like me?;
Master Vrook may seem harsh and critical, but he understands the dangers that lie in your path. He wants you and Bastila to be fully prepared when you finally face Lord Malak.;NM13AAVAND17159_.mp3
What should be done about the Sandral and Matale families?;
If Shen Matale is not returned to his father it may ignite a savage and bloody feud between the Matale and Sandral estates. We must not allow that to happen.;NM13AAVAND17161_.mp3
You should ask Master Vrook about that, Padawan. He is in charge of our relations with the settlers.;NM13AAVAND17162_.mp3
The way ahead will be difficult for young Bastila... and for you. You must draw strength from each other. May the Force be with you.;NM13AAVAND17163_.mp3
What happened to Belaya?;
We do not know. She was training here until your unfortunate incident with Juhani, then she simply disappeared...;NM13AAVAND17165_.mp3
We would like any word of her you may bring. I do not believe she has died, or fallen prey to beasts, but I worry that she may have done something rash.;NM13AAVAND17166_.mp3
She had always been close to Juhani, and her death may have hit Belaya... hard.;NM13AAVAND17167_.mp3
Is there anything else you wish to ask?;NM13AAVAND17168_.mp3
I will investigate the ruins right away.;
Be sure to bring Bastila with you. There is a powerful link between you, and you will need to draw strength from each other during the trials ahead.;NM13AAVAND17170_.mp3
What happened to the Jedi who went to investigate?;
We do not know. That is one of the things you must investigate. We... fear the worst.;NM13AAVAND17172_.mp3
Is there anything else you want to know?;NM13AAVAND17173_.mp3
I have found and slain Belaya. She had turned to the dark side.;
That is most... unfortunate. She was always a model student and most eager to learn. I grieve that she had fallen to her passions.;NM13AAVAND17175_.mp3
Remember her example as well as that of Juhani: the dark side is not an enemy to be taken lightly.;NM13AAVAND17176_.mp3
Go to Master Zhar and inform him that Juhani has returned to us. I think you may be nearing the end of your apprenticeship.;NM13AAVAND17056_.mp3
It is most regrettable that Juhani could not be saved. We in the Council had high hopes for her in the future.;NM13AAVAND17057_.mp3
In every heart there is some means of redemption. Could you find none in Juhani?;NM13AAVAND17058_.mp3
I couldn't see a way to save her.;
Perhaps that was the case. It is most regrettable, indeed.;NM13AAVAND17060_.mp3
Heed her example: all are susceptable to the lure of the dark side. We must always remain vigilant against it.;NM13AAVAND17061_.mp3
Go to Master Zhar and inform him that the grove has been cleansed. I think you may be nearing the end of your apprenticeship.;NM13AAVAND17062_.mp3
[Lie] She attacked without speaking.;
[Success] Perhaps that was the case. It is most regrettable, indeed.;NM13AAVAND17064_.mp3
[Lie] She was too evil to ever come back.;
Bastila has told us of your discovery in the ancient ruins. The Council has decided it would be best if you complete your apprenticeship before you embark on any further investigations in this matter.;NM13AAVAND17066_.mp3
As grave as the Sith threat may be, we cannot allow you to leave here until your apprenticeship is over. The danger of the dark side is too great to send you out unprepared.;NM13AAVAND17067_.mp3
Master Zhar feels you are ready to begin the final tests of your apprenticeship. Return to us when you have completed your training.;NM13AAVAND17068_.mp3
Good evening, apprentice. I trust your training goes well?;NM13AAVAND17069_.mp3
My training is progressing quite well.;
I have faith that you will achieve the rank of Padawan soon. Master Zhar is most impressed with your progress. May the Force be with you, apprentice.;NM13AAVAND17071_.mp3
I seek knowledge of the Jedi Code.;
All Jedi must know the code, its tenets are the fundamental teachings of our Order. Think and meditate on these truths, apprentice:;NM13AAVAND17073_.mp3
"There is no emotion; there is peace. There is no ignorance; there is knowledge. There is no passion; there is serenity. There is no chaos; there is harmony. There is no death; there is the Force.";NM13AAVAND17074_.mp3
I must be going now.;
Very well. May the Force be with you.;NM13AAVAND17106_.mp3
Ah, you have returned, young Padawan. Have you discovered what it was that Revan and Malak sought in those ruins?;NM13AAVAND17123_.mp3
We found an incomplete Star Map and mention of something called a Star Forge.;
This news of a Star Forge is disturbing. Action is required, but we must not do so in haste. We must discuss recent events in light of this new information.;NM13AAVAND17125_.mp3
We should consult the Jedi archives to see if there is any mention of this 'Star Forge' and what it might do. We must learn why Revan and Malak sought it out.;NM13AAVAND17126_.mp3
Return to your ship with Bastila and we will summon you when we are done.;NM13AAVAND17127_.mp3
Padawan, you have done well in discovering the Star Map hidden within the ancient ruins. But there is more you must do in the battle against Malak and the Sith.;NM13AAVAND17177_.mp3
We Jedi know victory over the Sith will not come through martial might. The Council has a mission for you, Padawan.;NM13AAVAND17178_.mp3
I have consulted our vast archives in an effort to discover the nature of this 'Star Forge', but all my efforts have been in vain.;NM13AAVAND17179_.mp3
"Still, the Council are in agreement: the Star Forge must be found! Revan and Malak sought it out when they began their tragic fall; the Star Forge is surely a powerful tool of the dark side.";NM13AAVAND17180_.mp3
The Star Map in the ruins showed you four planets, but it was incomplete. It did not show the location of the Star Forge itself. We believe there may be similar Star Maps on other planets.;NM13AAVAND17181_.mp3
Each Star Map is likely a small piece of a larger puzzle. Find the Star Maps on Kashyyyk, Tatooine, Manaan and Korriban and we believe they will lead you to the Star Forge.;NM13AAVAND17182_.mp3
I am ready to do the Council's will.;
The Jedi numbers have been ravaged by this war, by defections to Malak's cause and by Sith assassins. But we realize the importance of this mission.;NM13AAVAND17184_.mp3
Yet if we sent a company of Jedi Knights with you we would surely draw the full attention of Malak and the Sith, dooming your efforts to failure.;NM13AAVAND17185_.mp3
Am I to undertake this task alone?;
Secrecy is our best defense against the Sith, but it would be foolish to send you on this quest without someone to aid you, young Padawan.;NM13AAVAND17187_.mp3
Bastila will accompany you, for there is a powerful connection between you two... a connection that might be the key to unraveling the mysteries uncovered by Revan.;NM13AAVAND17188_.mp3
And Juhani has also asked to accompany you. After long deliberation we have granted her request.;NM13AAVAND17189_.mp3
Juhani nearly fell to the dark side. Perhaps her presence will serve as a reminder to you of the dangers of that path.;NM13AAVAND17190_.mp3
There are others I want to join me.;
"Of course those who aided you on Taris will also come; they possess skills you may find useful in your quest. Remember that secrecy and discretion are paramount to your success.";NM13AAVAND17192_.mp3
You will not be able to hide the fact that you are Jedi, nor should you. But the true nature of your mission must not reach Malak's ears.;NM13AAVAND17193_.mp3
You may return here at any time. Dantooine will be a sanctuary for you, a safe haven. Here you can find supplies and whatever advice or other aid we may give you.;NM13AAVAND17194_.mp3
You can count on me. I will not fail.;
"You can leave whenever you wish; the sooner the better. The longer you wait the stronger Malak becomes. But first a warning, young Padawan:";NM13AAVAND17196_.mp3
The lure of the dark side is difficult to resist. I fear this quest to find the Star Forge could lead you down an all too familiar path.;NM13AAVAND17197_.mp3
The fate of the galaxy is in your hands, young Padawan. We pray you are up to the challenge.;NM13AAVAND17210_.mp3
May the Force be with you.;NM13AAVAND17211_.mp3
When do I leave?;
Why should I risk my life to stop Malak?;
This was already explained to you. Your command of the Force makes you a threat to Malak. Eventually he will destroy you, and all the Jedi, unless you stop him first.;NM13AAVAND17200_.mp3
Great... Bastila and the cat woman. Anyone else you want to stick me with?;
Keep the example of Juhani fresh in your mind. You may need a reminder of the dangers of the path that leads to the dark side.;NM13AAVAND17202_.mp3
Great... Bastila again. Anyone else you want to stick me with?;
Good. Others will only slow me down.;
Sounds like a suicide mission to me.;
Ever brash, ever disrespectful! This is what we have pinned our hopes on?;NM13AAVAND17206_.mp3
"Peace, Vrook. We have discussed this; there is no other choice.";NM13AAVAND17207_.mp3
[Lie] No, I could not find anything.;
What are you talking about? The Council must be told of what we found there!;NM13AAVAND17306_.mp3
We found an incomplete Star Map, Master Vandar. And an ancient droid that mentioned something about a Star Forge.;NM13AAVAND17307_.mp3
Lies! Bastila has already told us about this 'Star Forge' and the map you found!;NM13AAVAND17129_.mp3
Peace, Master Vrook. I'm certain the Padawan only meant they had not found anything beyond what Bastila would surely have told us.;NM13AAVAND17130_.mp3
There has been a report of a terrible battle near the Sandral estate to the south of the Enclave. Apparently a large force of droids attacked the estate.;NM13AAVAND17107_.mp3
The defending droids returned in kind. The attacking family was apparently the Matale family launching an attack on the Sandral estate.;NM13AAVAND17108_.mp3
Both entire families were slain, including the boy Shen who had been reported missing.;NM13AAVAND17109_.mp3
There was a mention that someone noticed one or more other persons leaving the battle area after the conflict had finished. You were in that area, were you not? Did you see something?;NM13AAVAND17110_.mp3
[Lie] No, I was somewhere else.;
[Success] Is that so... I cannot find fault with your statement, but something in your manner is odd. But no matter, more pressing things are at hand.;NM13AAVAND17112_.mp3
You must always remember the destruction and chaos that the dark side can reap, and avoid it at all costs.;NM13AAVAND17113_.mp3
*whisper* It is obvious Master Vandar senses something is not right with your story. Yet he chooses to believe you, and I will not question the wisdom of a Jedi Master.;NM13AAVAND17308_.mp3
*whisper* It is obvious Master Vandar senses something is amiss in your tale. Yet he chooses to believe you, and I will not question the wisdom of a Jedi Master.;NM13AAVAND17309_.mp3
*whisper* It's obvious he doesn't believe you. He must have some reason for letting you get away with this lie. I swear, I'll never understand these Jedi.;NM13AAVAND17310_.mp3
*whisper* Anyone can see that he doesn't believe you. He must have some reason for letting this slide. Probably trying to teach you some Jedi lesson or something.;NM13AAVAND17311_.mp3
[Lie] That's horrible! I didn't know!;
[Lie] Perhaps it was Mandalorian raiders.;
We have heard that there was a close confrontation between the Sandral and Matale families by one of the southern estates earlier. We also heard that it was by your actions that direct conflict was avoided.;NM13AAVAND17116_.mp3
It is good to hear that you have learned the lessons of the Jedi Order well enough to avoid conflict when necessary.;NM13AAVAND17117_.mp3
Rahasia Sandral and Shen Matale have come here seeking shelter against their families. The Council has decided to give it to them.;NM13AAVAND17118_.mp3
Their love for each other was being denied by overly possessive parents and we learned that it was only by your intervention that they managed to escape here.;NM13AAVAND17119_.mp3
While it is regrettable that the fences between the families were not repaired, it is good that these two young lovers can live their lives free of oppression.;NM13AAVAND17120_.mp3
I have heard that the Sandrals and Matales have agreed to cooperation in the construction of a new estate to house their children. Apparently a son of one family and the daughter of the other are getting married.;NM13AAVAND17121_.mp3
I also I hear that we have you to thank for this happy occurrence. I am glad that you are using the authority our Order wields to achieve some measure of good.;NM13AAVAND17122_.mp3
You must not fail in your mission. Find the Star Maps that lead to the Star Forge. This is the only way to stop Malak and his Sith followers. You and Bastila are the galaxy's last, desperate hope.;NM13AAVAND17208_.mp3
But beware the dark side. Bastila will guide you, but she herself is young and new to the ways of the Jedi. You must help her as much as she helps you.;NM13AAVAND17209_.mp3
You must not fail in your mission, young Padawan. Find the Star Maps that lead to the Star Forge. This is the only way to stop Malak and his Sith followers.;NM13AAVAND17212_.mp3
You and Bastila are the galaxy's last, desperate hope. May the Force be with you in this quest.;NM13AAVAND17213_.mp3
You are here from the Council, are you not? Looking for Shen Matale?;NM16AARAHA02000_.mp3
Who are you?;
My name is Rahasia - Nurik is my father. He has not been himself since Casus disappeared. He is mad with grief, and he is convinced the Matales are responsible. He is not thinking rationally.;NM16AARAHA02002_.mp3
Does this have anything to do with what happened to Shen?;
My father is a good man. When my mother died, he raised me and my brother by himself. He loves his children, and we love him. I just don't want you to judge him too harshly.;NM16AARAHA02004_.mp3
I only want to find Shen Matale.;
You must understand that Father has been under a terrible strain. I have no wish to disobey him, but there are matters where even my father's authority is not absolute.;NM16AARAHA02006_.mp3
Please, tell me what has happened.;
My father has kidnapped Shen Matale. He is holding him prisoner here in the compound. He feels this is a way to get back at the Matales, a way to get even for the disappearance of my brother Casus.;NM16AARAHA02008_.mp3
I see. Well there is the answer we seek. The Jedi Council should be informed of this at once.;NM16AARAHA02009_.mp3
You don't think that perhaps there's more to look at here, do you? That maybe everything isn't what it appears?;NM16AARAHA02010_.mp3
Of course not. It seems very simple to me. The Council must be allowed to decide the next step.;NM16AARAHA02011_.mp3
No! Since Casus went missing my father has become unstable, he might hurt him if you do that! He no longer even cares if the Matales are responsible for what happened to Casus.;NM16AARAHA02013_.mp3
I am afraid my father will simply kill Shen out of a mad, misguided lust for vengeance!;NM16AARAHA02015_.mp3
I must tell the Jedi Council at once!;
The Jedi Council does not have the authority to search our estate, and if Father finds out his secret has been revealed he might kill Shen right away.;NM16AARAHA02017_.mp3
Please, find Shen and rescue him before my father does something he will regret forever. I would take you to the prison, but I cannot let my father see me with you.;NM16AARAHA02050_.mp3
Take this key. It will open an unguarded door at the rear of the estate. You and Shen can make your escape through there.;NM16AARAHA02051_.mp3
There are many security droids guarding the halls. Please hurry... you are Shen's only hope.;NM16AARAHA02052_.mp3
What is the problem between your families?;
Ahlan Matale and my father have had problems ever since they settled on this world.;NM16AARAHA02054_.mp3
To hear my father tell it, Ahlan is a brute and a bully, but a rich one. He feels his credits give him the right to step all over normal people.;NM16AARAHA02055_.mp3
My father stands up to Ahlan because no one else will. But now he thinks Ahlan has taken my brother Casus, and has imprisoned Shen as revenge.;NM16AARAHA02056_.mp3
Please find Shen and free him! You are my only hope!;NM16AARAHA02057_.mp3
Why do you care about Shen?;
Shen and I... we... Well, we have been taught by our families to hate each other, just for being related to our fathers.;NM16AARAHA02059_.mp3
But I met Shen alone one day in the city, away from his father, and...;NM16AARAHA02060_.mp3
... and Shen was so charming, so sweet. He didn't care at all that I was a Sandral, he just accepted me for who I was, with no reservations.;NM16AARAHA02061_.mp3
We talked and met again over months and fell in love. My brother Casus met him too and they were beginning to become friends, but then this whole mess had to happen...;NM16AARAHA02062_.mp3
I will go now.;
This isn't my problem.;
Why are you telling me all this?;
Shen is an innocent victim in all this. My father is not a bad man, but his grief has driven him to madness. He must be stopped.;NM16AARAHA02020_.mp3
What happened to Casus?;
I do not know. I am worried for him, truly, but I do not believe Ahlan Matale had anything to do with it... and now my father may take it out on Shen...;NM16AARAHA02022_.mp3
We should inform the Jedi Council of this crime.;NM16AARAHA02012_.mp3
Since Casus went missing my father has become unstable. He no longer even cares if the Matales are responsible for what happened to Casus.;NM16AARAHA02014_.mp3
Quit stalling and get to the point!;
Judge him? What has your father done?;
Tell me what's going on here!;
I don't have time to listen to this.;
I... I thought you would listen to me. I thought the Jedi were compassionate and kind! I shouldn't have spoken to you at all - I've just made everything worse!;NM16AARAHA02034_.mp3
The Council would not approve of your actions here. Perhaps we should find this girl and try to help her.;NM16AARAHA02035_.mp3
There could be a lot of money for finding Shen Matale. I think that girl knows something about him going missing.;NM16AARAHA02037_.mp3
Yeah, that's the way to go about it. Make things worse for these people, why don't you?;NM16AARAHA02036_.mp3
Casus disappeared?;
Yes. Casus was my brother. He was working on archeological digs here on Dantooine when he disappeared. My father blamed Ahlan Matale... and his son...;NM16AARAHA02028_.mp3
Casus was killed by kath hounds. The Matales had nothing to do with it!;
Casus is dead? It is as I feared, though I am relieved the Matales are not responsible.;NM16AARAHA02030_.mp3
Do you know something about Shen's disappearance?;
I just came to tell your Nurik about his son Casus.;
What I do is my own business, so back off!;
You made your wishes clear to me the last time we talked. I won't bother you anymore - though I would ask you to leave our estate. This is private property.;NM16AARAHA02038_.mp3
I have come to apologize for my earlier behavior.;
Apologize? Then you will help me?;NM16AARAHA02040_.mp3
Yes, I will help you.;
I am here to find Shen Matale. Maybe we can help each other.;
I'll leave when I'm good and ready!;
I did not realize the Jedi were such bullies. Unfortunately, there is little I can do if you refuse to respect my wishes. I shall not bother you anymore.;NM16AARAHA02044_.mp3
What are you doing here? Have you found Shen yet?;NM16AARAHA02045_.mp3
I'm trying to rescue Shen, but he won't leave without you, Rahasia.;
Shen can be so stubborn sometimes! If one of the security droids sees me wandering the halls Father will get suspicious! I can't risk it!;NM16AARAHA02047_.mp3
I know Shen would rather die than leave me here alone to face the wrath of my father. Tell Shen I will meet you outside the gates. I will wait as long as I can, but you must hurry.;NM16AARAHA02048_.mp3
Come with me Rahasia... it's the only way Shen will leave the estate.;
Hey - I saw you win the big swoop race! Too bad Brejik had to get greedy and ruin everything!;NM02AEMALE20000_.mp3
The Lower City is nothing but a slum! If the Sith want to win us Tarisians over they should clean the gangs out of there!;NM02AEMALE20004_.mp3
Have you heard the reports? They're saying someone broke into the military compound! Oho! The Sith aren't going to like that.;NM02AEMALE20006_.mp3
You like Pazaak? I used to watch it all the time when Gelrood was playing here. He had some great matches against Niklos... until they banned him for cheating.;NM02AEMALE20008_.mp3
Have you gone into the music room in the back? Yeah, I don't care much for the band, but those dancing Twi'leks are something else, I'm telling you now!;NM02AEMALE20010_.mp3
Hey, I know you - you're the Mysterious Stranger! I saw you beat Bendak in the dueling ring! Ha! I lost a bundle betting against you!;NM02AEMALE20012_.mp3
Hey! You heard the latest rumor? Bendak Starkiller is coming out of retirement for one last illegal death match! Oohoo! I'm not missing this!;NM02AEMALE20016_.mp3
I heard the Sith sent a bunch of patrols into the Undercity. Probably want to loot the crash sites of those Republic escape pods that went down there.;NM02AEMALE20018_.mp3
Listen to me, people! There is a terrible scourge sweeping our planet! Heed my warning, before it is too late!;NM02ABGORT09000_.mp3
The evil walks among us! The enemy is here! We must act now before we are overrun with the vermin invaders!;NM02ABGORT09002_.mp3
A plague spreads through our streets! We cannot sit idly by while this pox infects our society!;NM02ABGORT09004_.mp3
Greetings, my Sith friends. Rest assured, I have all the proper permits to be here spreading my message.;NM02ABGORT09006_.mp3
Feel free to stay and listen if you wish. You'll find my message most enlightening.;NM02ABGORT09008_.mp3
How dare you speak to me while you travel in the presence of alien Wookiee scum! You have violated one of this great planet's oldest and most revered laws!;NM02ABGORT09009_.mp3
You have brought aliens to the Upper City! They are a blight upon Taris - they take our jobs and our homes, and spread their filth throughout our world.;NM02ABGORT09011_.mp3
No more filth than you're spreading, crazy man.;
Yeah! You tell him, Big Z!;NM02ABGORT09015_.mp3
This beast just growled at me! It is a savage creature that will hurt someone!!;NM02ABGORT09017_.mp3
How dare you brazenly parade about the Upper City with such alien scum at your side! I, Gorton Colu, founder of the Anti-Alien League, will not stand for this!;NM02ABGORT09019_.mp3
I don't know which is worse - your hate mongering or your ignorance.;
You are like all the rest! You will not see the truth! On the day of reckoning you will suffer with the rest of the alien lovers!;NM02ABGORT09040_.mp3
Come on. We should keep moving. Kook or no, people like him can make trouble for us.;NM02ABGORT09042_.mp3
We should leave. This man may be deranged, but he could also make considerable trouble for us.;NM02ABGORT09044_.mp3
Back off, you crazy kook. I don't have time for this.;
Hear that, laser brain? Sell it somewhere else, 'cause we ain't buying!;NM02ABGORT09038_.mp3
I keep whatever company I want!;
Don't worry - this Wookiee is just my servant.;
I see you share the opinions of many on this world: that aliens are useful as servants and slaves. But I am here to tell you this is not so! Aliens deserve only death!;NM02ABGORT09022_.mp3
Do we have to stand here and listen to this space-slug? He's starting to get on my nerves, you know?;NM02ABGORT09024_.mp3
Silence, alien scum! The presence of your kind is tolerated here on Taris, but a change is coming!;NM02ABGORT09026_.mp3
That is why I, Gorton Colu, have formed the Anti-Alien League. The time has come for action! We cannot sit idly by while aliens blight our glorious planet!;NM02ABGORT09035_.mp3
I see... well, good luck in your crusade.;
Remain true to the cause, friend. Enlightened humans such as yourself are few and far between - but we shall triumph when the day of reckoning comes!;NM02ABGORT09047_.mp3
What a rail-slug! Give Big Z five minutes alone with that guy and he'd straighten him out... or maybe twist him like a Tarisian Zella nut.;NM02ABGORT09049_.mp3
You're right! We should slaughter the whole bunch of them!;
Yes, my fellow human! You have seen the light! Gorton Colu has marked your face - I will remember you when the time to destroy the aliens and the alien-lovers is upon us!;NM02ABGORT09052_.mp3
For now, stay vigilant. Be ready. Trust no one. I will find you when the day of reckoning is upon us, and together we will rid beautiful Taris of these alien species!;NM02ABGORT09054_.mp3
Hmph! You may think it's okay to joke about killing aliens to string Gorton along, but I don't think that kind of thing is funny at all!;NM02ABGORT09056_.mp3
That's not exactly humorous. You are encouraging his hatred and blindness.;NM02ABGORT09058_.mp3
Friends and fellow humans - I bring you a warning! A warning of a great plague spreading across our planet! Please, listen to me!;NM02ABGORT09028_.mp3
My name is Gorton Colu. Will you join my cause? We must band together if we are to stop the spread of vermin and scum throughout Taris!;NM02ABGORT09030_.mp3
Vermin and scum? What are you talking about?;
I am speaking of the hideous looking aliens who walk the world of Taris! The Wookiees and Ithorians and Rodians and Bith - all of them! Listen, friend, for these are dark times.;NM02ABGORT09033_.mp3
Are you refering to the Sith?;
I'll be going now.;
Go then - you are no better than the alien-lovers! Turn a blind eye. Ignore what is happening, and one day you will see it is too late!;NM02ABGORT09061_.mp3
It pains me to see that an alien lover such as yourself is still allowed to walk free! I've seen how the Sith operate... I know they will support my anti-alien policies!;NM02ABGORT09063_.mp3
When the day of reckoning comes, you will suffer with the rest of the scum and alien lovers!;NM02ABGORT09065_.mp3
Get away from me, you bigot!;
Greetings again, friend. Have you mentioned my Anti-Alien League to others? We must always be looking for those sympathetic to our cause.;NM02ABGORT09066_.mp3
Uh... I haven't mentioned it yet, but I will. Don't worry.;
Excellent, excellent! There is much work yet to be done, but spreading our message is the first step!;NM02ABGORT09069_.mp3
Uh... yes. I mention it to everyone I meet.;
Hold on there! How about talking to me before you go messing with those things? I need your help.;NM18AB10TA05000_.mp3
Anyone out there...? Could you help? I seem to be... ah... doomed.;NM18AB10TA05001_.mp3
Oh great! You just get away from me! The last thing I need is Sand People trying to cut me up! Go on! I've got blasters!;NM18AB10TA05002_.mp3
Easy, I'm no threat. It's just a disguise.;
Oh... yeah I, uh, I knew that.;NM18AB10TA05004_.mp3
Hey there, thanks for stopping. I appreciate it. I've been stuck without water for hours. Wasn't looking good.;NM18AB10TA05007_.mp3
I don't remember you from Fazza's club. You new to Anchorhead? Could you maybe help me get out of here?;NM18AB10TA05008_.mp3
What happened here?;
Well, ah, it would appear that I worn out my welcome with my wife Marlena. She fixes my droids... heh, fixed them good this time.;NM18AB10TA05010_.mp3
Philandering ways coming back to haunt him, I'll wager.;NM18AB10TA05011_.mp3
I triggered some sort of trap she programmed. She probably figured I wouldn't be smart enough to get out. Uh, she was right.;NM18AB10TA05014_.mp3
What do you want me to do?;
Well... wait a minute... it looks like you've already taken care of things. Well that's great! Take that, Marlena, I'm going to live!;NM18AB10TA05016_.mp3
Now, my dear lady, I must see to your reward. Will, uh, earthly delights suffice? Er... I suppose not.;NM18AB10TA05085_.mp3
You never asked me for anything, but I consider my life worth something. Please, take this. I insist.;NM18AB10TA05088_.mp3
That will be fine. Good luck.;
Thanks again. I doubt any of those uptight hunters would have helped, and I doubt the wife is coming back.;NM18AB10TA05090_.mp3
I'm heading back to the shop... I hope she left the manuals for these things behind. Ungrateful little...;NM18AB10TA05091_.mp3
I think I should ask for more.;
I love it when the ladies play hard-to-please, but there isn't much more I can do. This is an expensive setback.;NM18AB10TA05093_.mp3
What else could I give you? I need what I have to repair my droids and get back up and running.;NM18AB10TA05094_.mp3
All right. Just get out of here, then.;
[Persuade] You know the rescue was worth more.;
[Success] I suppose I do. That's pretty smart to appeal to what I think my safety is worth. Here.;NM18AB10TA05097_.mp3
Now, if you don't mind, I have to limp these boys back to my shop. Hopefully Marlena didn't take the manuals with her.;NM18AB10TA05098_.mp3
[Failure] Look, I really can't. I'm sorry.;NM18AB10TA05099_.mp3
Then I'll have to take it out of your hide!;
You shouldn't have fixed the droids first, then. Rally on my target, boys!;NM18AB10TA05104_.mp3
[Force Persuade] You will pay me more and like it.;
[Success] I'd... really like to pay you more. Here... take whatever I have. It's all yours.;NM18AB10TA05101_.mp3
How did... how did you get me to do that? Damn, that's what got me married and into this mess! That's it, I'm leaving!;NM18AB10TA05102_.mp3
You'll give me more or you will regret it.;
You wanted credits for your trouble, and I never break a deal. Here's uh, all I have on me.;NM18AB10TA05086_.mp3
You wanted me to give up my trade. Well, consider it done. Maybe I can rent my droids for security or something.;NM18AB10TA05087_.mp3
The wife put a kink in my battle droids. They're in some sort of discharge loop, and if I move from this spot, they're threatening to blow up.;NM18AB10TA05017_.mp3
She knew I wouldn't know how to fix them. Could you try to do some repairs? They don't care if you move. It's just me who's stuck.;NM18AB10TA05018_.mp3
*sigh* I guess we should help him out.;NM18AB10TA05019_.mp3
Yes! Yes, I knew I liked this fella the minute I saw him.;NM18AB10TA05020_.mp3
I say leave him.;NM18AB10TA05021_.mp3
You're pretty heartless for such a pretty lady, you know?;NM18AB10TA05022_.mp3
I take it back. Let's congratulate his wife.;NM18AB10TA05023_.mp3
Maybe we could program them to tap-dance? I love a good tap-dance.;NM18AB10TA05024_.mp3
This isn't funny! Come on!;NM18AB10TA05025_.mp3
Commentary: I say we blast the meatbag and save you the trouble, master.;NM18AB10TA05026_.mp3
What's with all the droids, lately? My wife get to you, too?;NM18AB10TA05027_.mp3
Negative. I just don't like organic meatbags. Except for the master, of course. Ha ha.;NM18AB10TA05028_.mp3
Beep! Beeple beep!;
Hey yeah! You've got yourself a 'mech droid, there! Tell it to do it! Please!;NM18AB10TA05030_.mp3
*mechanical splurch... unflattering sound*;
Hey, now... did your droid just spit at me? I just need a little help here.;NM18AB10TA05032_.mp3
All right, I'll try and help out. Hold on.;
Just access each droid's repair interface. You'll have to do some tinkering, but be careful. One explosion I can survive. Any more than one and I'm dead.;NM18AB10TA05035_.mp3
Oh, and ignore the message Marlena left in there. No way do I deserve this, I swear.;NM18AB10TA05036_.mp3
I'll help, but I want something in return.;
Well of course, darling. Anything at all.;NM18AB10TA05038_.mp3
I'll help if you give me credits. All you've got.;
Hey, no problem, but it won't be a fortune or anything. I'd bet the wife has drained our shared accounts. Now uh, about that help?;NM18AB10TA05040_.mp3
You'll have to give up hunting with droids.;
Hey, wait for a moment. I need these rigs. I'm no marksman. No way I can agree to that. No way.;NM18AB10TA05042_.mp3
[Persuade] Look around. You don't have much choice.;
[Success] Well, when you put it like that. *ahem* Very well then, if it will get you to help me.;NM18AB10TA05044_.mp3
[Failure] I can't do it. That's my living. I'd have to leave this rock altogether. I can't do it.;NM18AB10TA05045_.mp3
I'm not doing anything for you. You can rot here.;
What? Why? What did I do to you?;NM18AB10TA05052_.mp3
You don't respect the hunt. You are a disgrace.;
"Oh, so this will be some sort of lesson for me, just because I don't ""thank the bones"" or some garbage?";NM18AB10TA05054_.mp3
Well fine, I'll... stay pretty much right here I guess. You can just get lost. I'll... I'll...;NM18AB10TA05055_.mp3
Heh heh. You're kidding, right. Right? Come on!;NM18AB10TA05056_.mp3
I'm not kidding. You'll die here.;
Nobody looks out for their neighbor anymore. Well, if this is it, I'd rather get it over with and maybe take you out with me.;NM18AB10TA05058_.mp3
So, let's see how these rigged-out droids like me jumping around. Hopefully the explosion kills you too!;NM18AB10TA05059_.mp3
All right, I'll see what I can do.;
Phew! Don't scare me like that. All right, lesson learned, or whatever. Can you please try to get them going?;NM18AB10TA05061_.mp3
It's better for the environment if I don't let you hunt.;
So my life is worth less than a few wraid? How many? One? Ten? Twenty?;NM18AB10TA05063_.mp3
It's the cruelest death. Maybe I'll watch while sipping ice water.;
So you just want me to die? That is just... so... typical of the people I meet... and marry. Thanks a lot!;NM18AB10TA05065_.mp3
I just don't like you. Goodbye.;
Well, I suppose I couldn't ask for a more valid reason than that. That's all?! That's it?! What are you, my wife?;NM18AB10TA05067_.mp3
[Force Persuade] You will no longer use droids to hunt. Ever.;
[Success] I won't use droids. You have to make sure the hunt goes on, right? Eh, now, could you help?;NM18AB10TA05047_.mp3
"One more ""darling"" and you'll be sorry, understand?";
Uh, sure, I apologize. Uh, now, about what you wanted?;NM18AB10TA05049_.mp3
Uh, what did you have in mind?;NM18AB10TA05050_.mp3
I don't have time for this right now. Goodbye.;
What? Oh, right, thanks. I guess I'll just DIE! Come on, help a guy out!;NM18AB10TA05080_.mp3
I'd, ahh, really appreciate a bit of help. Please?;NM18AB10TA05033_.mp3
You sit back and let your droids do the hunting?;
You know, now really isn't the time for a lecture. Of course, I might be more receptive after I'm rescued.;NM18AB10TA05069_.mp3
It just doesn't seem very sporting.;
You're beautiful, but not too bright. I hunt to make a living. Other hunters talk about honor, but they still sell their trophies.;NM18AB10TA05071_.mp3
Why would she do this?;
Something about me not following her archaic rules for proper conduct in a marriage. I swear, I never saw this coming.;NM18AB10TA05074_.mp3
You don't seem too concerned about what triggered this.;
Hey, I'm the victim here. I'm not sure how divorce works where you're from, but this is a little extreme, don't you think?;NM18AB10TA05076_.mp3
Look friend, some may talk about honor in the hunt, but they still sell their trophies.;NM18AB10TA05072_.mp3
Commentary: One would hope the female is better at repairs than Yuka Laka. I still would like to crush his neck, master.;NM18AB10TA05012_.mp3
This should be interesting...;NM18AB10TA05013_.mp3
You're Tanis, right? Your wife says hello.;
"I'll bet she does. She's decided I've finally worn out my welcome, and she's ""fixed"" my droids to do her dirty work.";NM18AB10TA05078_.mp3
Now if you could... oh no... not you. Just my luck. Look, I don't want any trouble, just need a little help.;NM18AB10TA05081_.mp3
Could you... hey, I remember you. You're the young lady from Fazza's club. Talk about answered prayers.;NM18AB10TA05082_.mp3
Oh, hey, it's you. I remember you at Fazza's place. Could I get you to help out a fellow hunter? Please?;NM18AB10TA05083_.mp3
That was... unpleasant. Thanks for your help. I would have been a goner. Heh, and the old bat thought I was dead. HA!;NM18AB10TA05084_.mp3
So, uh... what's new? Uh, rescued anyone recently? You know, maybe someone trapped in the desert!;NM18AB10TA05106_.mp3
Well, nice to see you again. Ah, not to pressue you - certainly, no pressure - but you did say you'd rescue me.;NM18AB10TA05107_.mp3
I mean, I can certainly see how you'd want to keep me in one place. You ladies can be so coy...;NM18AB10TA05108_.mp3
It's just that I had hoped you could do this with a little more... I don't know... success? I won't survive another blast.;NM18AB10TA05109_.mp3
You asked for credits, after all. Speedy service would be nice.;NM18AB10TA05110_.mp3
What was it I needed to do?;
We've been over this, haven't we? My wife has put some kind of kink in my battle droids. If I move, they're threatening to explode.;NM18AB10TA05114_.mp3
I haven't got a clue where to start. She knew I wouldn't. Please, repair them for me if you can.;NM18AB10TA05115_.mp3
I've decided that I want something in exchange.;
I've changed my mind. I'm not helping you.;
I'll get to it soon enough.;
Well, normally I'd be patient, but the constant threat of death is just so stressful. You know?;NM18AB10TA05119_.mp3
If you expect me to give up hunting, speedy service would be nice.;NM18AB10TA05111_.mp3
You asked for nothing in return... but really, soon would be nice.;NM18AB10TA05112_.mp3
What the...! What did you do? Oh no...;NM18AB10TA05120_.mp3
Hey, you did it! You got them going! All right boys, give me some space.;NM18AB10TA05121_.mp3
[Leave];
What the... uh, yeah! You just get out of here! Hey I... I guess I'm pretty scary... trapped, but scary.;NM18AB10TA05006_.mp3
Careful! If that happens again they could all explode! No way I would survive that!;NM18AB10TA05122_.mp3
*groan*;
You... you have saved me from the savages and their war beasts...;
I was sent by the Council to save you.;
I don't know what I could have done if you had not come. I suppose I would be dead now, like the others they captured with me.;
Thank you for saving me. I shall attempt to return to the Enclave on my own. I will tell the Council of what you have done.;
Who are you?;
I am one of the Elders, the other remaining tribe of Rakata on this island.;
The tribe you have fought has attempted to destroy us and seize our secrets to gain access to the Temple of the Ancients... Thus far, they have failed.;
Temple of the Ancients?;
The Temple to the east of here... the largest structure on the island.;
You should speak with the Council of our tribe... They may be able to help you for what you have done for me.;
Do you know anything about the disruptor field surrounding this world?;
The field? We... may.;
You are the only surviving prisoner?;
Yes... Of the four of us that they had captured, only I remain...;
Why did they capture you?;
What did they do to you?;
They... they were trying to find out how to breach our defenses and gain entry to our camp... My comrades, they... they wouldn't tell them.;
I'm sure that, had you not come, I would have ended up as they did.;
Please leave me. I've contracts to decipher.;NM22AACZER04000_.mp3
I don't deal with individual buyers. I'll have my broker contact your people.;NM22AACZER04001_.mp3
I don't have time to deal with you.;NM22AACZER04002_.mp3
Speak with the director if you need information. I only deal with volume buyers.;NM22AACZER04003_.mp3
I wasn't aware we were giving tours now. Leave me.;NM22AACZER04004_.mp3
You'd think they'd be grateful to leave this barbaric place.;NM22AACZER04005_.mp3
Three restraining collars failed on the last shipment. The buyer was not pleased.;NM22AACZER04006_.mp3
You're probably here with the new restraining collars. I'm not handling another shipment without them.;NM22AACZER04007_.mp3
Huh? What? Oh... sorry. I didn't see you there. My attention was kind of focused on the Twi'lek dancers. Look at them waggle those head-tails!;NM03AEHOLD13000_.mp3
Ugh - what a pig! He even makes Gamorreans look classy.;NM03AEHOLD13002_.mp3
Don't worry, honey - alien girls aren't really my thing. I'm much more interested in an attractive female of my own species.;NM03AEHOLD13004_.mp3
You're the guy who put the bounty on Dia's head, right?;
You're here about that? I guess Zax must have mentioned me to you at the bounty office. Fair enough - I don't care who takes her out, just so long as the job gets done.;NM03AEHOLD13010_.mp3
I can't let her get away with what she did - that wench tried to cut me with her vibroblade!;NM03AEHOLD13012_.mp3
Dia's dead. I killed her myself.;
Really? Huh... I guess that's it then. A real shame it had to come to this. She was a good looking gal despite her temper. Ah, well. Plenty more ladies out there for me.;NM03AEHOLD13081_.mp3
Where's my payment?;
If you want to collect the bounty, go talk to Zax. I gave him the credits for safe keeping. As far as I'm concerned my part in this is over.;NM03AEHOLD13083_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;
I don't want to waste my time answering a bunch of questions... I'm here to have a few drinks, watch the dancing girls and enjoy myself.;NM03AEHOLD13028_.mp3
I've got to be mentally ready. Davik's got an assignment for me off planet as soon as the quarantine ends.;NM03AEHOLD13030_.mp3
You work for Davik?;
I'm one of his top couriers. Davik's always sending me off planet to deliver and bring back packages. He knows he can trust me to follow my orders to the letter.;NM03AEHOLD13032_.mp3
Plus, I used to be an intergalactic customs agent so I know all the tricks they use to catch smugglers. That gives me the edge I need on my courier runs.;NM03AEHOLD13034_.mp3
You're pretty open about what you do.;
It's not like it's some big secret. It's kind of hard for Davik to keep a low profile when he belongs to a big intergalactic crime syndicate like the Exchange.;NM03AEHOLD13036_.mp3
Do you think Davik could get me off Taris?;
Davik's ship is the fastet one in the entire quadrant, but even the Ebon Hawk can't get off Taris until the quarantine is lifted. The Sith fleet has the planet surrounded.;NM03AEHOLD13038_.mp3
Any ship leaving orbit without the proper access codes will be disintegrated by the Sith auto-targeting laser cannons - and those codes are locked safely away in the military base.;NM03AEHOLD13040_.mp3
Davik's pretty upset about it. His smuggling operation isn't making any money, but even with his underworld connections he can't get his hands on those codes.;NM03AEHOLD13042_.mp3
I'll be going now.;
Hate to see a pretty lady leaving, but you ain't the only girl in this place. I guess I'll go back to enjoying the dancers.;NM03AEHOLD13049_.mp3
Fine by me. That means I get to go back to enjoying the dancing girls.;NM03AEHOLD13051_.mp3
So what happens now?;
Why would she do that?;
Because she's crazy! She started screaming that I was making advances, and the next thing I know she's coming at me with a knife.;NM03AEHOLD13014_.mp3
It sounds to me like the woman was defending herself.;NM03AEHOLD13016_.mp3
I admit I was drunk. Maybe I got a little fresh. But it was no big deal. She didn't have to cut me!;NM03AEHOLD13020_.mp3
Sounds like maybe you got what you deserved.;
Hey - you weren't there. She totally over-reacted!;NM03AEHOLD13022_.mp3
I want the bounty on Dia's head removed.;
Hey, it's like I told you before - you come up with 200 credits and I'll remove the bounty. Otherwise she's got to pay the price.;NM03AEHOLD13058_.mp3
Here's 200 credits. Now get that bounty removed.;
Don't worry - I'll stick to my end of the bargain. I'll go tell Zax right now that the bounty is off the table.;NM03AEHOLD13063_.mp3
[Persuade] If you hire someone to kill Dia it will look like you weren't man enough to do it yourself.;
"[Success] Well... I guess you might be right. Besides, I've noticed some of the girls around here are giving me the cold shoulder since all this started. Okay, you win; Dia can live.";NM03AEHOLD13066_.mp3
[Failure] If I let her get away with it I'll look even worse! She's got to pay - either with her life, or 200 credits to buy my forgiveness.;NM03AEHOLD13068_.mp3
[Force Persuade] I think it is time you forgave her. You are partly to blame for her behavior.;NM03AEHOLD13070_.mp3
"[Success] Well... maybe it's time I forgave her. I am partly to blame for what she did, I suppose. Okay, you win; Dia can live.";NM03AEHOLD13072_.mp3
Take that bounty off Dia's head or you're a dead man!;
You're threatening me? I work for Davik Kang! If you kill me you'll be signing your own death warrant. Do us both a favor and don't waste my time with stupid threats!;NM03AEHOLD13076_.mp3
I'll go talk to Dia and see if she can come up with the credits.;
You can do that if you want, but I doubt she's got 200 credits. That's a lot, and she's just a working girl. But that's the breaks, right?;NM03AEHOLD13078_.mp3
What? I can't do that! Think how it would look. I work for Davik, I've got a certain reputation to uphold. I can't let her get away with this. There has to be payback!;NM03AEHOLD13059_.mp3
Although I do feel a little guilty about all this. Dia's a good looking gal - it'd be a shame to kill her. Tell you what - I'll take 200 credits in exchange for lifting the bounty.;NM03AEHOLD13061_.mp3
Forget it. This isn't worth my trouble.;
So how do I collect this bounty?;
Just kill Dia and then go talk to Zax. I gave him the credits for safekeeping. He'll pay you off when the deed is done.;NM03AEHOLD13024_.mp3
Tell me what happened with Dia.;
What do you mean what happened? She took her vibroblade and came after me like she was harvesting a bantha pelt!;NM03AEHOLD13056_.mp3
Yeah, sure. You were as innocent as a Jawa in a droid chop shop!;NM03AEHOLD13018_.mp3
Yeah, right. Sounds to me like she was defending herself.;NM03AEHOLD13087_.mp3
Who are you?;
My name's Holdan, baby. Maybe you've heard of me... I work for Davik Kang, you know.;NM03AEHOLD13006_.mp3
Keep your hormones in check - I just want to ask some questions.;
I don't like the tone of your voice. I work for Davik Kang - I'm used to people treating me with respect!;NM03AEHOLD13044_.mp3
I don't care who you work for - you seem like a slimeball!;
I don't have to take this abuse from you! I came here to relax. Shove off and find someone else to bother - I want to watch the dancing girls.;NM03AEHOLD13046_.mp3
I don't normally go for these alien girls, but I've had some bad experiences with my own species lately. Maybe it's time for a change, you know what I mean?;NM03AEHOLD13008_.mp3
I'm not really interested in your love life.;
What do you want now? This whole thing with Dia is over, so we don't have anything to discuss.;NM03AEHOLD13053_.mp3
This better be important - I'm trying to watch the dancing girls. You got some news about Dia or something?;NM03AEHOLD13054_.mp3
Hey, baby - back again, I see. I guess the old Holdan charm is still working: the ladies just can't leave me alone!;NM03AEHOLD13085_.mp3
You again? This must be the official let's all bother Holdan day. Can't you see I'm trying to watch the dancing girls?;NM03AEHOLD13086_.mp3
Greetings again, hunter. Your time out on the dunes has brought wear to your face. It is a trait that you and I share.;
It is the weight of decisions made for the good of all. I don't think the others would understand. All they know is that a dragon is dead. I am content to leave it at that.;
I want to ask about you and hunting.;
You are in dire need of better entertainment, human. My life has not changed since we last spoke.;
Where is the best hunting?;
The best hunting is wherever the best hunter is. It's a trite answer, human, but the only one I can give.;
Our hunt proved it. We found a dragon where other hunters should have noticed. It will be the last one seen for a long time.;
Why are such large beasts so hard to find?;
They are elusive. Perhaps they sensibly avoid the places where their kind have died. I don't know.;
I'm just glad we found him him using the old ways. That was a victory.;
Your traditional methods aren't popular?;
Some try to lessen the risk by mass-hunting with battle droids. I would rather hunt solo, taking the risk as my own.;
Who uses battle droids?;
Tanis did, but he appears to be no longer with us. Perhaps you already knew this, human? I can't say.;
How long have you been at this?;
A decade? Two? I don't enslave myself to time, human. There is day and there is night.;
You really don't know anymore?;
Tatooine will not change in my lifetime. Why bother trying to keep up with the rolling of the years?;
What can you tell me about the other hunters?;
Probably not as much as you would learn speaking to them yourself, even if they tell you nothing.;
You have already shown an understanding of the needed skills when dealing with predators.;
Having dealt with the Gamorreans, I think there is little else that will phase you.;
What about the hunters besides the Gamorreans?;
Ah... put simply, Dorak Quinn is honorable. Tanis Venn is not so much, but I've no real quarrel with him.;
Let's go back to my first questions.;
I will answer. The day drags on, however.;
Who are you? What do you do?;
I am Komad Fortuna, a hunter and member of this lodge. It is not the life for everyone, but I am content.;
I'm looking for something. Who knows this planet best?;
No one that will return your questions. To truly know the dunes you have to live there, as the Sand People do.;
Only they truly explore the land, but they attack without debate, if you see them at all.;
Have you ever seen the Sand People with anything odd?;
The Sand People carry nothing but weapons and bloodlust. To them, outsiders are invaders to be repelled.;
Once or twice, however, I have seen them emerge from older ruins with sacks and other containers.;
I've always been driven off, and if I examine the site later, there is nothing left.;
What kinds of ruins were these? Where were they?;
They were old storehouses of some kind, but you couldn't find them now, human. The sand covers all.;
The only ones who would know what was there are the Sand People, and you would have to take it by force.;
Finding their encampment is easy enough. Walk south until you are attacked.;
What about the Jawas?;
The Jawas may know the land as well, but are more interested in trading than talking. They scavenge to escape jobs akin to slavery.;
Their language is difficult. If you can get anything more than the price of a droid out of them, I'll be impressed.;
I have to leave. Goodbye.;
Good hunting.;
Yes, what will you pay for me not to kill you?;
You talk far too big, human. This isn't the place for such things. Guards are a short yell away.;
[Force Persuade] Get out of my sight.;
[Success] [Komad squints, sensing your influence but not being able to fight it. He seems saddened by your action, as though he expected better.];
Goodbye, human. Perhaps we will meet again, but I sincerely hope not.;
[Force Persuade] They wouldn't get here in time. Pay me.;
[Success] Of course the guards would take their time getting here... I don't wish trouble.;
It is unfortunate that you would choose this course, human. You never know when you will need an ally.;
[Failure] Perhaps you are unfamiliar with how things work around here. The guards are always quick to act.;
Pay me or end up dead. It's that simple.;
No, things are never quite so black and white. I am protected here, as are you. Nothing will come of this.;
Perhaps you are right. You are safe... for now.;
There seems to be no reason for your anger, human. You would be wise to control it, lest it bury you.;
But, perhaps you are safer speaking with me. You've shown a weakness in the face of... two-legged predators.;
Perhaps you should reassert yourself? I don't know. I didn't think the Gamorreans so threatening.;
The most obvious are the Gamorreans, however. Gurke and his crew are not the best company.;
They hunt, but often come back with salvage instead of hides or pearls. I think their prey walks upright.;
Wouldn't the guards have something to say about that?;
The dunes are far from the reach of their blasters. Besides, Gurke spends his money in company stores.;
Tanis did, but he no longer hunts, thanks to you. I'm glad a peaceful resolution was found.;
I will not speak of it while they live. It is their shame to admit or hide. They know the effect it has.;
Perhaps they will kill so many wraid that they also kill the hunt. After that, perhaps the solo hunter will still prosper.;
It depends on what you seek. Wraid are plentiful and are the spoils of the sport hunter. Dragons appear only to the true hunter.;
Patience is key. Krayt dragons hunt alone, and their prey is whatever can catch their attention.;
So dragons are rare? Are they dangerous?;
They are both rare and dangerous, and an honor to hunt. If you survive, you are blessed and favored. Respect them.;
Probably from worry at getting your hands dirty. I really don't have much to talk to you about. You are not my kin.;
You have no place here with me, human. Leave me to my thoughts.;
Yes, is there something you wish, human?;
Information, if I could trouble such a worthy hunter for a moment.;
Save your words, swoop rider. They do not suit you.;
Spare me the flattery, human. Such talk is rarely sincere.;
Just a few questions, if that's all right?;
I will answer, though it is rare for one of you swoop riders to show much interest in anything besides racing.;
I see no harm in it. There are hours yet before I set back out on the dunes.;
Why are you here, swoop jock? Hunting doesn't give your kind the instant thrills you need, does it?;
Hmm? You know, I don't have that much to tell you. You really have to learn the dunes for yourself.;
I told you to leave me alone - so give me some space, Bug-eye! Your breath smells like bantha poodoo!;NM03AEMISS14000_.mp3
Little girl should not be in bar. This no place for little girl. If little girl smart, she run away home now.;
Who you calling a little girl, Chuba-face?;NM03AEMISS14004_.mp3
Little girl needs lesson in manners!;
Just a sec, boys. Zaalbar... a little help here? I need you to rip the legs off some insects.;NM03AEMISS14008_.mp3
Mission - I'm busy. They just brought my food!;
Quit complaining... you can finish eating later. Besides, you need the exercise so get over here.;NM03AEMISS14012_.mp3
We no want trouble with Wookiee. Our problem with you, little girl!;
You got a problem with me, then you got a problem with Big Z. So unless you want to take on my furry friend, I suggest you greenies hop on out of here.;NM03AEMISS14016_.mp3
Little girl lucky she has big friend.;
Say, I don't recognize you and I know pretty much everyone in the Lower City. You must be new down here. I guess that makes me and Big Z your official welcoming committee!;NM03AEMISS14020_.mp3
Hey - we speak the same language!;
It's not that strange. Most aliens can speak Basic, they just prefer to use their own language. But I grew up here on Taris so I just sort of got used to speaking the native tongue.;NM03AEMISS14022_.mp3
You showed a lot of guts dealing with those Vulkars, kid. You got a name?;NM03AEMISS14074_.mp3
My name's Mission Vao and this big Wookiee is my best friend, Zaalbar. I'd offer to give you a tour, but the streets down here aren't safe. But if there's anything else you need...;NM03AEMISS14024_.mp3
I'm trying to find a way into the Black Vulkar base.;
The Black Vulkar base? You'll never get in there - they attack on sight. But if you got a problem with the Vulkars, you should go speak to the Hidden Beks.;NM03AEMISS14026_.mp3
Their base is open to anyone - I hang out there all the time. Gadon, the leader of the Hidden Beks, is a pretty good guy. He'll probably be able to help you out.;NM03AEMISS14028_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;
Well, you came to the right person! If you want info on Lower Taris I'm the one to talk to! Davik, the Lower City gangs... I've even got the scoop on that bounty hunter Calo Nord!;NM03AEMISS14033_.mp3
How do a Wookiee and a Twi'lek street urchin end up as best friends?;
We just kind of fell in together. It ain't easy on your own here in the Lower City - everyone's always looking to push you around.;NM03AEMISS14035_.mp3
So we noticed. Still, you seem like an odd pair.;NM03AEMISS14037_.mp3
When I met up with Zaalbar it seemed like a good match. I knew we could look out for each other. With my street smarts and his muscle, we make a great team.;NM03AEMISS14039_.mp3
I'll be going now.;
You're going? Yeah, this dive is pretty boring. No action around here. Come on, Big Z, let's go.;NM03AEMISS14067_.mp3
But I haven't finished eating!;
Can't you think about something besides your stomach for five minutes? Come on - we'll go see if there's anything good to eat at the Bek base.;NM03AEMISS14071_.mp3
Tell me about Davik.;
Davik's part of the intergalactic crime syndicate, but I guess everyone knows that. But I hear he's got a new ship for his smuggling operations - the Ebon Hawk.;NM03AEMISS14041_.mp3
I don't know much about space travel, but I hear that ship's fast enough to break the Sith blockade. Of course, this is all just second hand rumor.;NM03AEMISS14043_.mp3
Where would he keep it? Do you know?;NM03AEMISS14045_.mp3
If Davik does have a ship, he's got it locked up in his estate. Nobody gets in there, except the people working for Davik and the Exchange.;NM03AEMISS14047_.mp3
Tell me about the Lower City gangs.;
There's only two gangs worth worrying about here in the Lower City: the Black Vulkars and the Hidden Beks. Sometimes Zaalbar and I hang out at the Bek base.;NM03AEMISS14049_.mp3
The Beks are led by Gadon Thek - he's a good guy. Lost his sight in a swoop bike accident a few years ago, but even blind he's a great leader.;NM03AEMISS14051_.mp3
Not like that traitor Brejik! Before he took over the Vulkars he was a Hidden Bek. Gadon considered that ungrateful space slug his adopted son.;NM03AEMISS14053_.mp3
Why did Brejik leave the Hidden Beks?;
When Gadon went blind everyone figured he'd step down and appoint Brejik in his place. But Gadon figured Brejik wasn't ready yet. He wanted him to wait a few years.;NM03AEMISS14055_.mp3
But Brejik was too impatient. He left to join the Vulkars, and ever since he's been waging a war to wipe Gadon and his Beks from the face of Taris!;NM03AEMISS14057_.mp3
This gang war in the Lower City is totally the Vulkar's fault. They're the ones killing everything that moves out on the street. It's like they've gone insane.;NM03AEMISS14059_.mp3
Tell me about Calo Nord.;
Calo Nord's one of the most famous bounty hunters in the galaxy. He's killed more people than the Iridian Plague! I've seen him kill people just for trying to talk to him!;NM03AEMISS14061_.mp3
He hangs around Zax's bounty office, but I don't think he's looking for work there. All the postings there are small time - way beneath a bounty hunter of his caliber.;NM03AEMISS14063_.mp3
I figure Calo's been hired by Davik to do a special job for the Exchange. I'd wager a thousand credits that as soon as the quarantine ends, he'll be getting off this rock.;NM03AEMISS14065_.mp3
Thanks - I'll go see Gadon now.;
Yeah, we should be going now, too. Come on, Zaalber. This dive is boring. Maybe we can find some action in the Undercity.;NM03AEMISS14030_.mp3
That's weird: a Twi'lek who speaks galactic Basic!;
GRRROWLLL, stop where you are, outsider. You enter the domain of Chuundar, Chieftain and leader!;
Stand aside! This human is with me and I want access to the home of my people!;
You have no rights here, mad-claw! This human should not have brought this taint upon our land! You must answer to Chuundar!;
What does he mean, Zaalbar? What taint?;
He means me. I am the taint that you have brought back.;
Shut up! GROWWLL! You are nameless with dishonor, mad-claw! Yours is a foulness that disgusts me!;
RRaaaghh! Enough talk! You and the outcast mad-claw will be taken to Chuundar now!;
RRaaaghh! Enough! The mad-claw from your ship is already before Chuundar. Come!;
Take me to Chuundar. I would speak with him.;
The choice is made for you already! You make a demand for something you can't alter, can't help!;
You will not take me anywhere, mongrel!;
Look about you, fool. You face a legion of Wookiees in their home terrain! It is a losing fight for you.;
He is right. There are too many. Please, let us go to Chuundar. He has much to explain.;
You will be taken before Chuundar and he will judge your worth, and punishment for the taint you have returned to us.;
And if I refuse to go see Chuundar?;
There is no refusing. If you will not walk, we will bind you. Shall you be carried through the trees like a child?;
He will decide if you are fit to walk the village of Rwookrrorro. You've already soiled our world with what you brought on your ship.;
My ship? What do you mean by that?;
Chuundar sent us to search it. We found the exile. The nameless mad-claw, once called Zaalbar.;
Who gave you access? You had no right!;
Freyyr has returned to us because of you, outsider. You are one of the few outsiders we will allow to remain among us in the village.;
Chuundar has said that you can remain here, but watch where you step while in our village, outsider.;
Do you... do you have the cure, up-worlder? Have you come to save us from the horrible fate of the others?;NM04AAINFE08000_.mp3
I have brought you a serum to cure the rakghoul disease.;
You... you have a cure? Please, give it to me. Quickly, before it's too late.;NM04AAINFE08007_.mp3
Here, take this rakghoul serum. I have enough for both of you.;
Quickly - I must inject it before it is too late. Yes... I feel it working!;NM04AAINFE08009_.mp3
I feel the disease burning away! It... it is like a miracle! I am cured!;NM04AAINFE08011_.mp3
Thank you, up-worlder. You have saved us from a fate worse than death. I only wish I had some reward to give you. Maybe you can find something worthwhile in the wreckage of that Republic escape pod.;NM04AAINFE08013_.mp3
Republic escape pod? What are you talking about?;
Not long ago an escape pod crashed in the Undercity, far to the northeast of the village. We were going to try and salvage equipment from it when we were attacked by the rakghouls and infected.;NM04AAINFE08015_.mp3
I'd tell you more if I could, but our salvage team never reached the pod. It's probably still there, unless some of the other up-worlders already found it and picked it clean.;NM04AAINFE08017_.mp3
We should go now, up-worlder. We're anxious to return to the village and see our families again. Thank you once again for everything you have done.;NM04AAINFE08019_.mp3
I was just happy to help.;
What will you give me in exchange for this cure?;
We... we have nothing, up-worlder. We are Outcasts. All we have are the clothes on our backs.;NM04AAINFE08023_.mp3
Please, up-worlder. Show us mercy. Give us the cure out of the goodness of your heart!;NM04AAINFE08025_.mp3
Forget it. I'm not wasting the cure on an Outcast!;
Go then, up-worlder. Leave us here to die, abandoned by everyone!;NM04AAINFE08038_.mp3
Don't worry - I'm here to help you.;
You... you will help us? Bless you, up-worlder! But... you must hurry!;NM04AAINFE08028_.mp3
We have the rakghoul disease. It is only a matter of time until we are transformed into terrible creatures like those who attacked you when you first came into the pen.;NM04AAINFE08031_.mp3
It is too late for them. Soon it will be too late for us and we will transform into those horrible rakghouls ourselves!;NM04AAINFE08033_.mp3
Don't worry... I'll be back when I find a cure for you!;
Please hurry, up-worlder. We don't have much time until the transformation.;NM04AAINFE08035_.mp3
Don't forget about us, up-worlder. If you find anyway to cure us of this disease, please come back and help us.;NM04AAINFE08041_.mp3
I think I'll kill you so you don't infect anyone else!;
Goodbye.;
Why have you come back, up-worlder? Do you come to mock us in our suffering as this disease destroys us?;NM04AAINFE08001_.mp3
Get away from me you diseased mongrels!;
When the rakghouls infected me I never thought I'd see my family again. Thank you for all your help, up-worlder.;NM04AAINFE08003_.mp3
Please... you have to help us. We beg you. We don't want to end up like the others. Please help us. We can't end up like them.;NM04AAINFE08005_.mp3
Who are you? Why are you locked away from the rest of the village?;
I once lived above, with the rich and privileged. But I was cast down here - a punishment far worse than my crimes deserved!;NM04AAOUTM99000_.mp3
The rakghoul disease can infect you. It can transform you into one of those monsters! I've seen it happen!;NM04AAOUTM99001_.mp3
You are the one who brought us the rakghoul cure! The entrie village thanks you. I just regret we have nothing to give you as a reward.;NM04AAOUTM99002_.mp3
A lifetime lived in this dark place can drive you mad! Just look at poor old Rukil if you don't believe me - he's lost his mind!;NM04AAOUTM99003_.mp3
You must speak with our Guide if you wish to perform the ritual now.;
Isn't it strange? Nobody seems to know what happened to Master Uthar or Yuthura. They're both just... gone.;NM35AAKELA06000_.mp3
Have you heard? Yuthura Ban is dead. I hear Master Uthar is looking for a new apprentice. How awful...;NM35AAKELA06001_.mp3
Have you heard? Master Uthar is dead and Yuthura Ban has taken over the academy. How brutal...;NM35AAKELA06002_.mp3
Oh, ah... hello. I don't remember seeing you here before. My name is Kel... Kel Algwinn.;NM35AAKELA06003_.mp3
Is something wrong?;
This one isn't raving like the others. A doubter.;
I... oh, uh, nothing.;NM35AAKELA06006_.mp3
Are you sure?;
Y-yes. My master always says I am too trusting, too willing to show weakness. You're a Sith, so I really shouldn't... you know...;NM35AAKELA06008_.mp3
But I'm not a Sith, yet.;
Oh, I know that. I mean... you aren't yet, but you intend to be. I mean you're just like everyone else here.;NM35AAKELA06010_.mp3
And you're not?;
Well I... I... I didn't mean it like that.;NM35AAKELA06015_.mp3
Well, how did you mean it, then?;
I... I shouldn't trust you. I can't trust you, can I?;NM35AAKELA06017_.mp3
[Persuade] Sure you can.;
[Success] I just... don't feel I belong here. I thought maybe I did at first, but now... I don't know. I just have so many doubts.;NM35AAKELA06019_.mp3
Master Uthar probably wouldn't like to hear that.;
Yes, I'm... I'm sorry. P-please don't, don't tell anyone... I'll get over it, I guess.;NM35AAKELA06031_.mp3
You're no Sith. I've never seen anyone so pathetic!;
I... I am too a Sith! I'm more a Sith than you are! I'll show you!!;NM35AAKELA06040_.mp3
Alright. Suit yourself.;
Err... well, good luck with your training.;NM35AAKELA06059_.mp3
If it doesn't feel right, then perhaps you don't belong here.;
But where would I go, then? What would I do?;NM35AAKELA06022_.mp3
Have you thought about the Jedi?;
I... don't know. I never really thought about it. Maybe I should seek it out, give it a try. Thank you... thank you so much!;NM35AAKELA06024_.mp3
It doesn't matter. Have you considered that the dark side just isn't your way?;
Uh, eh, maybe you're right. *sigh* I'll go and... tell Master Uthar that I'm not ready for this. Maybe it won't be so bad. Th-thank you.;NM35AAKELA06027_.mp3
Leave, obviously. You're not ready to be a Sith. You'll wind up dead.;
Everyone has doubts. Keep it up... you'll come around.;
I guess you're right. The dark side is... where I belong. No going back now. Th-thank you.;NM35AAKELA06029_.mp3
Is that it? Don't bother me with your petty weaknesses.;
[Failure] No... no, I shouldn't bother you with it. Forget I said anything.;NM35AAKELA06032_.mp3
Out with it. This is getting tiresome.;
I... forget I said anything. Just... go back to your training, please. I have work to do.;NM35AAKELA06038_.mp3
[Force Persuade] You want to trust me.;
[Success] I just... don't feel I belong here. I thought maybe I did at first, but now I... I don't know. I have so many doubts.;NM35AAKELA06036_.mp3
No, of course not. What kind of Sith are you?;
I, uh, I suppose you're right. Never mind. Forget I said anything.;NM35AAKELA06042_.mp3
Do you know anything about the Code of the Sith?;
Yes, of course. I must admit I've never really understood it very well. Enough to please Master Uthar, I guess... but I still have trouble with it.;NM35AAKELA06045_.mp3
What's the problem?;
All things take time. Not to worry.;
Yeah. Yes, I suppose so. Thanks.;NM35AAKELA06048_.mp3
And you're a full Sith? How pathetic.;
Don't say that! Leave me alone, or you'll be sorry!;NM35AAKELA06050_.mp3
I doubt that.;
I am a Sith, better trained than you! I'll show you!!;NM35AAKELA06052_.mp3
Fine, fine. Have it your way.;
Just leave!;NM35AAKELA06054_.mp3
Do you know anything about the excavations in the valley?;
Of course. It's full of ancient Sith ruins, from a time before the Sith left this region of space. Rather exciting, really. I've, uh, never studied it myself... I couldn't help you much.;NM35AAKELA06056_.mp3
If you're really interested, there's a fellow by the name of Dak who's out in the valley now. He knows plenty about it.;NM35AAKELA06057_.mp3
I'll be going.;
I can't persuade you to tell me?;
Uh, n-no, I really can't. A Sith... like you... would use any means to succeed.;NM35AAKELA06013_.mp3
Are you saying you're not a Sith?;
Please don't tell anyone what I told you. They would tell me to leave... or worse.;NM35AAKELA06060_.mp3
Oh, hello again. You're, uh... doing well in your training?;NM35AAKELA06061_.mp3
I'll stick with the bounties Davik puts out... they're usually less dangerous than the government funded contracts.;NM03AEBOUN03000_.mp3
I saw Calo Nord in the tap room. He's a legend in this business! I wonder if he'd give me an autograph?;NM03AEBOUN03002_.mp3
These are good times for bounty hunters! I've made a small fortune on the bounties Zax has been paying out.;NM03AEBOUN03004_.mp3
Did you hear? Somebody killed Gadon Thek! I bet it won't be long until the Beks put out a bounty on Brejik's head in retaliation!;NM03AEBOUN03006_.mp3
Word is somebody stole the Vulkar's prototype swoop engine! I wonder if there's a reward to bring it back?;NM03AEBOUN03008_.mp3
I saw you kill Bendak Starkiller! I was just about to bring him in, too!;NM03AEBOUN03010_.mp3
See the price on Bendak Starkiller's head? Too bad no one will collect. Bendak never leaves the safety of that Upper City Cantina.;NM03AEBOUN03012_.mp3
Leave me be. If I don't get these converters working, I lose my job.;NM17AB01ME03000_.mp3
Why are you bothering me? You've got a ship. You can leave this rock.;NM17AB01ME03001_.mp3
Some ships I fix, some I scrap. Depends if the owner disappears in the dunes.;NM17AB01ME03002_.mp3
Business is up a little, so leave me to my work.;NM17AB01ME03003_.mp3
You a swoop racer? Crazy fool.;NM17AB01ME03004_.mp3
You here to hunt wraid? I work a wrench. Boring, but I know it won't kill me.;NM17AB01ME03005_.mp3
Czerka Corporation keeps me working. Don't care what else they do.;NM17AB01ME03006_.mp3
Tatooine's a dustbowl, and that's all it'll ever be.;NM17AB01ME03007_.mp3
Though you have aged, young sentient, I do believe you are indeed the one I seek. I am here to return you to your father.;
Yooba na abds?;
I see that <FirstName> was correct about your linguistic difficulties. I am positive that your parents can assist you with that.;
Me abd liaz! Me na awnts palkie!;
Calm yourself, child. I will take you home.;
Sasha na esowon in bristag. Bristag me laesfa.;
Lur Arka na bads. Nuh-gisen laesfa, Sasha.;
Laesfa? Me palkie laesfa?;
Yb, bristag. Yb-abu, <FirstName>!;
Thank you for your assistance, sentient. I am sure the girl's parents will be most appreciative of your efforts.;
Just go. I've had enough of this.;
I suppose I must spend some time talking to you since you are here in an official capacity. What do you need?;
What do you think of Sunry?;
Sunry was a Republic soldier, a hero even. Do you think his Republic masters would let someone so valuable go so easily?;
I think not. I think Sunry maintains his contacts with the Republic and seeks to escalate the situation here.;
Is there something else you require?;
Is there anything suspicious about this case?;
I find this case to be fairly straight forward. Sunry is from the Republic, Elassa from the Sith. The great empires battling now live out their conflict through their minions too.;
Is that all?;
What do you think of the Republic and the Sith Empire?;
I do not buy into the Republic line that this is some epic battle of the 'good' Republic against the 'evil' Sith Empire.;
The Sith empire is merely an expansionistic power, much like the Republic was early in its history.;
It is simply the turning of history, where the old is swept away by the better new.;
Is there anything intelligent you wish to know?;
I have no more questions for now.;
Then go and do not disturb me unless you have trial business to discuss.;
Do not disturb me, off-worlder, I am busy.;
At last, my search is over! I was beginning to fear someone else had killed you and deprived me of the pleasure.;NGLOBEBAND01000_.mp3
You may have defeated the pathetic bounty hunter my Master sent after you, but you are no match for me! I have studied at the foot of the Dark Lord himself!;NGLOBEBAND01002_.mp3
How did you get down here?;
Do you think those Republic subs are the only way to reach the ocean floor? Malak and Revan found a way down here long before the Hrakert station was built.;NGLOBEBAND01004_.mp3
I acquired a ship and followed the same route Revan and my Master used on their own journey. Then it was simply a matter of waiting for you to return for the Star Map.;NGLOBEBAND01006_.mp3
You're Malak's apprentice? Can't say I'm impressed.;
Your words mean nothing to me... unless you wish to beg for your life. No? Then I shall try to make this both quick and painful!;NGLOBEBAND01008_.mp3
When will Malak learn? I'll kill you just like I killed Calo Nord!;
You're a fool if you think you can defeat me.;
You were on the Endar Spire! You killed Trask. You'll pay for that!;
Don't you believe a word of what Czerka Corporation said in there, there is always a peaceful solution to conflict. They are just lazy.;
What do you mean? What are you talking about?;
Czerka miners have been attacked by Sand People, so the company Czerka Corporation wants them killed. They didn't ask you to do it?;
The Sand People aren't animals. I've watched them, and they are intelligent. There must be a way to peacefully stop the attacks... I know it.;
But no one will try, of course. You can't even leave the city without Czerka approval and they want the Sand People dead.;
The Czerka said that the Sand People attacked first.;
Well, yes they did. They attacked the Czerka, who deployed numerous giant sandcrawlers and started tearing up the desert with ion shovels and whatever else.;
What would you have done? To the Sand People, it must have seemed like an invasion. There were no negotiations for territory or resources.;
I don't think the killing has been justified, but as a conservationist I'm hoping someone at least tries to talk this out.;
What would you suggest, then?;
Communication. If we could just speak to them... but they don't talk. At least, not in any language an average translator can understand.;
There was even a Jedi here a few years ago that couldn't seem to get through to them. I... think that ended in blood too.;
I'm not saying it would be easy, but someone has to try. Maybe with a real translation droid, not these old protocol scrap heaps walking around.;
Who would have a capable droid?;
Well, *you* do, don't you? You bought that strange old droid off of Yuka Laka, didn't you? He said it was quite sophisticated.;
I'm sure I heard Yuka Laka say that it could speak a Sand People dialect. Although he'd say rust is gold to make a sale...;
With that droid, maybe you could talk to them. I wouldn't survive... maybe with desert robes as a disguise someone could get into their enclave.;
Where would that enclave you mentioned be?;
What? It's no secret where they are. The attacks get worse the further southwest in the Dune Sea you go. Then people die on both sides.;
Where would you get robes to match theirs?;
I suppose you could take them off of the warrior raiders in the Dune Sea, but there's no way I'd survive anything like that.;
Plus you would have to explain why you killed their warriors if you are trying to make peace... but I suppose there is no other way.;
Maybe I'll look into it.;
Sure, that's what Czerka Corporation keeps saying, and then they just start shooting again. The fighting won't stop until they are all dead.;
Or until the Czerka leave. The one is as likely as the other with the way things are going. Bah, what do I know.;
I will deal with the matter as I see fit.;
That's what the infuriating Czerka Protocol officer said, but I'm not foolish enough to believe it. Everyone just wants to wipe the Sand People out.;
Go on then, but you're just like the Czerka. Shortsighted fool. If you could just talk to them... maybe get a true translation droid...;
Ah, I'm wasting my time. Go on, get out of here.;
I don't care. Get out of my way.;
They are pretty rare, even on well-stocked worlds, but I'm sure I heard something about an unusual droid in the shop here on Tatooine.;
Why don't *you* do something? Why should I?;
Someone else has to! I've got no influence with Czerka Corporation, I can't afford what Yuka Laka charges for his droids, and I wouldn't survive...;
Well, what I mean is, whoever tries to deal with the Sand People would first have to survive their initial attacks. I wouldn't.;
Someone could maybe get into their enclave if they could disguise themselves, but you'd have to get real desert robes and that would be dangerous too.;
Why hasn't anyone tried talking to them?;
Well, there is the small matter that they don't seem to speak a language that your average translator can understand. Is that their fault?;
Intelligent or not, the Sand People have killed people.;
Yes they have, but Czerka Corporation deployed numerous giant sandcrawlers to tear up the desert with ion shovels and whatever else.;
Why would you know any better?;
Perhaps I'm no expert on diplomatic situations, but I know when there is a lack of due care for the evironment and the residents of it.;
Is this about Czerka wanting the Sand People chieftain killed?;
So, you are the killer that they hired. Just going to walk out there and wipe them out? I'd expect no less from fools.;
Move aside, I have things to do.;
I'm sure you do. Czerka probably hired you to kill the Sand People in retaliation for a few attacks. Just another bloodthirsty fool.;
Just move along. There's nothing to see here.;NM02ADSITH10000_.mp3
Where did you hide those Sith uniforms? Did you sell them to the Tarisian underground? Start talking - I want answers!;NM02ADSITH10002_.mp3
Please - I'm only a visitor to Taris, trapped here by your quarantine. I know nothing about the Tarisian underground or your missing Sith uniforms!;
What's going on in there?;
A few of the Sith trooper uniforms have gone missing. We've got evidence that this alien knows something about them, so the commander's interrogating him.;NM02ADSITH10006_.mp3
*whisper* I know all about Sith interrogations. This isn't going to end well.;NM02ADSITH10057_.mp3
I'm getting sick of your lies, you alien scum! We got your ugly mug on a security tape from the base! Start talking before I splatter your slimy brains all over this room!;NM02ADSITH10008_.mp3
Uh-oh. I think the commander's losing his temper. I'm glad I'm out here - it took me an hour to clean the blood stains from my uniform after the last interrogation.;NM02ADSITH10010_.mp3
Maybe the alien really doesn't know anything.;
Then I guess we don't lose anything when the commander blows his head off, do we? Anyway - what do you care?;NM02ADSITH10012_.mp3
Stop the interrogation right now!;
Who said that? What's going on out there?;NM02ADSITH10023_.mp3
Just stay out of this, if you know what's good for you!;NM02ADSITH10013_.mp3
I won't let you kill a defenseless prisoner!;
What was that? Did I hear you right? 'Let' us kill him? How can you stop us?;NM02ADSITH10015_.mp3
Time to teach this soldier how we deal with insubordination!;NM02ADSITH10017_.mp3
Time to teach this civilian the penalty for defying the Sith!;NM02ADSITH10019_.mp3
You're right. Do whatever you want.;
Smart move.;NM02ADSITH10026_.mp3
This is your last chance: where did you hide those uniforms you stole?;NM02ADSITH10028_.mp3
I swear, I don't know what you mean. I'm just... NOOOO!;
Get in here, search the room. I know those uniforms are in here somewhere.;NM02ADSITH10032_.mp3
I don't want to get involved in this.;
You're a little too curious for your own good, civilian! This doesn't concern you!;NM02ADSITH10034_.mp3
Uniforms? What are they talking about?;
Hey, we don't need any reinforcements. All we're doing is searching for some missing Sith uniforms.;NM02ADSITH10037_.mp3
I know... I'm the one who stole them!;
What??? Traitors! Spies! Attack!;NM02ADSITH10039_.mp3
I'll be going now.;
Good - get back to patrolling the streets. We can handle this in here.;NM02ADSITH10042_.mp3
What do you want, civilian? Do you have any information about the missing Sith uniforms? Make it quick!;NM02ADSITH10044_.mp3
Uniforms? What are you talking about?;
You're awfully curious about this... maybe a little too curious! I think you know more about those missing uniforms than you're saying!;NM02ADSITH10046_.mp3
If I wanted uniforms I'd just kill you and take yours!;
A threat?! I knew you were a spy!;NM02ADSITH10050_.mp3
I don't know what you're talking about!;
Right... like I'm going to believe that! A crate of Sith uniforms goes missing and you just happen to wander into the apartment of our prime suspect? That's pretty convenient!;NM02ADSITH10053_.mp3
You're part of some Tarisian underground resistance, aren't you? Time for you to learn how the Sith deal with spies!;NM02ADSITH10055_.mp3
I'm sorry... I'll be going now.;
Not so fast, civilian... why are you here? Are you a spy? You came to buy Sith uniforms from this alien, didn't you? Didn't you?!;NM02ADSITH10048_.mp3
Carth, it has been far too long since we last spoke. I see the recent months have not been kind in your case. I barely recognized you.;NM40AASAUL10000_.mp3
But I recognized you, Saul. I see your face every night even as I promise myself I will kill you for what you did to my home world.;NM40AASAUL10002_.mp3
Did you learn nothing in your time under me? As a soldier you should understand that casualties were unavoidable. This was an act of war.;NM40AASAUL10004_.mp3
It was a cowardly act of betrayal! Your fleet bombed a civilian target into oblivion without warning or provocation. And the blood of those innocent people is on your hands!;NM40AASAUL10006_.mp3
In war even the innocent must die. The Sith would not accept me until I proved I had truly turned my back on the Republic by bombing the planet.;NM40AASAUL10008_.mp3
My wife died in that attack, Saul. And for that, I swear I'll kill you.;NM40AASAUL10010_.mp3
You used to be a man of action, not of empty words. Cling to your lust for revenge if you must, but spare me your tired threats. I've heard them all before.;NM40AASAUL10012_.mp3
You are an insignificant part of these events, anyway. Lord Malak is far more interested in your Jedi companions. He has great plans for them.;NM40AASAUL10014_.mp3
We will never serve Malak or the dark side! The Sith will be destroyed, Admiral Karath... as will you if you don't turn away from this path.;NM40AASAUL10016_.mp3
Your words are brave, Bastila, but the lure of the dark side is hard to resist - or so I've been told. I wonder if your companion is as devoted to the light as you are?;NM40AASAUL10018_.mp3
You're wasting your time, Saul. I'll never betray the Jedi!;
You're defiant. I'm certain Malak will find your loyalty to the Jedi amusing.;NM40AASAUL10020_.mp3
The Dark Lord would probably reward me if I just killed you once and for all. But he may want to question you given the trouble you've caused him... and the history between you.;NM40AASAUL10022_.mp3
History? What are you talking about?;
You mean... oh, this can't be true, can it? You really don't know what's going on here, do you? Well, I won't be the one to deprive Malak of the pleasure of telling you himself.;NM40AASAUL10024_.mp3
The Dark Lord will no doubt torture you for information and for his own twisted pleasure. Eventually you will tell him everything. The Sith can be very persuasive.;NM40AASAUL10027_.mp3
However, Lord Malak is in another sector. It may be some time before he arrives, so I suppose I will have to fill in for him until then. Activate the torture fields.;NM40AASAUL10029_.mp3
Enough! I don't want them to pass out before I question them. Malak will appreciate any information I can give him when he arrives.;NM40AASAUL10031_.mp3
Don't waste your breath, Saul! We won't answer any of your questions.;NM40AASAUL10033_.mp3
I'm sure you won't. However, we both know your friend's loyalties have proven in the past to be somewhat... flexible.;NM40AASAUL10035_.mp3
My loyalty is as true as Carth's!;
It is time to put your loyalty to the test. I doubt torturing you will gain me your true cooperation. Your will is too strong to be broken that way.;NM40AASAUL10038_.mp3
However, even the strongest of heroes has trouble watching those they care about suffering.;NM40AASAUL10040_.mp3
The interrogation will begin now. Each time you refuse to answer or give me a false answer, Bastila will suffer.;NM40AASAUL10042_.mp3
Don't hurt her, I beg you.;
My pain is meaningless. Tell him nothing!;NM40AASAUL10045_.mp3
I tire of these games - now I want answers! On what planet is the Jedi Academy at which you were trained?;NM40AASAUL10050_.mp3
Jedi Academy? I have no idea what you're talking about.;
Very well. This is the price of your resistance.;NM40AASAUL10052_.mp3
AHHHH!!;NM40AASAUL10054_.mp3
Enough! You see what happens when you try to defy me?;NM40AASAUL10056_.mp3
This first question was a test. Obviously Malak knew the Academy was on Dantooine, and it has since been destroyed by our fleet!;NM40AASAUL10068_.mp3
Dantooine is an empty graveyard now. Nothing remains but a smoking ruin and the charred remains of your former Masters!;NM40AASAUL10070_.mp3
No, you're lying! It isn't true!;
It doesn't matter whether you believe me or not. The fact remains that the Jedi on Dantooine have been eradicated, along with any hope of someone coming to rescue you!;NM40AASAUL10072_.mp3
Now... tell me your mission. How were the Jedi planning on using you to stop Lord Malak and our Sith armada?;NM40AASAUL10080_.mp3
I won't betray the Jedi.;
Perhaps you need a reminder of the consequences of refusing to cooperate.;NM40AASAUL10085_.mp3
NO! AHHH!! NO!! AUGH! The pain - THE PAIN! AHHHH!!! AUGH!;NM40AASAUL10087_.mp3
Listen, can you not hear her suffering? You can spare her further pain by simply answering my questions.;NM40AASAUL10089_.mp3
Now, I will ask again - on what mission did the Jedi Council send you?;NM40AASAUL10091_.mp3
You are a sick and evil man, Saul Karath.;
Perhaps another lesson is in order?;NM40AASAUL10093_.mp3
No! AHHH!!! AUGH! NO!!! I beg you... No! Mercy!!! NO!!! AUGH!;NM40AASAUL10095_.mp3
I am surprised she did not pass out sooner. Rarely have I seen someone withstand such punishment and remain conscious.;NM40AASAUL10097_.mp3
I see I am wasting my time here. When Malak arrives you will learn my interrogation techniques are considered merciful among the Sith.;NM40AASAUL10099_.mp3
I will leave you here in your cell with a small taste of the horrors you will suffer when Lord Malak arrives.;NM40AASAUL10101_.mp3
Don't try to move too quickly, you might not be fully recovered yet. Admiral Karath had his guards continue to torture you even after you passed out.;NM40AABAST01000_.mp3
They tortured all of us, though you got the worst of it by far. Saul wanted them to make us suffer. He's become some sort of sadistic monster.;NM40AABAST01001_.mp3
The dark side has perverted him, Carth. Once you start down the tainted path it leads you ever further into the depths of evil. I fear he is forever lost.;NM40AABAST01002_.mp3
No one is without hope of redemption, Bastila.;
Yes, hmm, I suppose you are correct. Sometimes it is easy to lose sight of that hope in the face of such unbridled cruelty, but you speak the truth.;NM40AABAST01004_.mp3
I suppose I'm taking the news of Dantooine's destruction quite hard. First Taris, now the Academy... is there no end to the killing?;NM40AABAST01005_.mp3
Maybe Admiral Karath was lying.;
I'd like to believe that Saul was lying to us, but even as he said the words I knew they were true. The Academy is gone.;NM40AABAST01007_.mp3
We should have felt a disturbance in the Force when the attack came. The fact that we did not is a bad sign. I fear the dark side is growing stronger, casting shadows our vision cannot pierce.;NM40AABAST01008_.mp3
I can only hope that some of the Jedi escaped. Vrook, Vandar, Zhar... I cannot imagine all of them being gone. In any case, we have lost our one place of refuge in the galaxy.;NM40AABAST01009_.mp3
None of this will matter if we don't get out of this prison before Saul gets back!;NM40AABAST01010_.mp3
Where is Saul Karath now?;
Saul mentioned that Lord Malak was on his way. I think the Admiral left to prepare for his arrival... and to report the results of our interrogation.;NM40AABAST01012_.mp3
I only wish you had been able to resist the Admiral's questioning. I hope the information you revealed does not bring the entire galaxy under the dominion of the Sith.;NM40AABAST01013_.mp3
I'm sorry, Bastila, but I couldn't just let you be tortured!;
I appreciate your... feelings... for me. But you can't let your feelings override your judgment. Remember the Jedi code: There is no emotion, there is peace.;NM40AABAST01015_.mp3
"Your efforts were well intentioned but poorly thought out; Saul tortured us all anyway. There is too much at stake to let reckless passion rule our actions.";NM40AABAST01016_.mp3
How dare you judge me? You have no idea what it's like to be put into that kind of position!;
I know if I had been in that position I would not have betrayed the Order and the Republic!;NM40AABAST01018_.mp3
No, you would have just left someone you care about screaming in agony!;
Stop it, both of you! Bastila, you... you can't honestly say how you would have reacted in that situation - nobody can! Besides, Saul already had all the information. I could tell.;NM40AABAST01020_.mp3
The interrogation was a sham. Saul was toying with us. He didn't care what we told him. I think it was just an excuse to torture us before Malak arrived.;NM40AABAST01027_.mp3
Did you feel that? A disturbance in the Force. The Admiral has sent his message, the Dark Lord knows we are here now. Malak is coming.;NM40AABAST01028_.mp3
Well, then we better hope Mission busts us out of here before he arrives.;NM40AABAST01029_.mp3
Well, then we better hope T3-M4 busts us out of here before he arrives.;NM40AABAST01030_.mp3
Well, then we better hope Jolee busts us out of here before he arrives.;NM40AABAST01031_.mp3
Well, then we better hope Canderous busts us out of here before he arrives.;NM40AABAST01032_.mp3
Well, then we better hope Juhani busts us out of here before he arrives.;NM40AABAST01033_.mp3
Well, then we better hope HK-47 busts us out of here before he arrives.;NM40AABAST01034_.mp3
I'm... I'm sorry I failed you. I didn't know what else to do.;
Don't be so hard on yourself. I've known the Admiral a long time. I could see that he already knew the answers to the questions he was asking.;NM40AABAST01022_.mp3
Saul already knew the answers to the questions he was asking.;
I've known Admiral Karath a long time and I think you're right.;NM40AABAST01026_.mp3
I'm sorry, Bastila, but I couldn't just let Carth be tortured!;
I appreciate your... feelings... for Carth. But you can't let your feelings override your judgment. Remember the Jedi code: There is no emotion, there is peace.;NM40AABAST01024_.mp3
Why should I endure torture just to protect the Republic and the Jedi?;
Your attitude disturbs me. Such selfishness is a sign of the dark side's taint, and it does little to fill me with confidence in you.;NM40AABAST01036_.mp3
Forget about it, Bastila. It doesn't matter anyway. I've known the Admiral a long time. I could see that he already knew the answers to the questions he was asking.;NM40AABAST01037_.mp3
It is fortunate you were able to resist the Admiral's questioning. The fate of the galaxy could be changed by revealing the slightest piece of vital information.;NM40AABAST01038_.mp3
I have to confess something. There was a moment - just a moment - when part of me was hoping you would tell him what he wanted to know. Just to make the horrible pain stop.;NM40AABAST01039_.mp3
I'm sorry, Bastila. Watching you suffer tore me apart.;
I know you wouldn't ever do anything to intentionally cause me pain. But you did the right thing.;NM40AABAST01041_.mp3
I don't honestly know if I could have been as strong in your position. To watch you suffer like that... it might have been too much for me to bear.;NM40AABAST01042_.mp3
Saul would have tortured us no matter what I told him.;
The only reason I stayed silent was to watch you suffer.;
You wanted me to suffer? You enjoyed my torment? I don't know what to say. I thought there was a bond between us.;NM40AABAST01045_.mp3
Maybe... maybe you're not the man I thought you were.;NM40AABAST01046_.mp3
I, uh... I have to confess something. There was a... there was a moment - just a moment - when part of me was hoping that you would tell him what he wanted to know. Just to make the horrible pain stop.;NM40AABAST01047_.mp3
I'm sorry, Carth. Watching you suffer tore me apart.;
No, I know you wouldn't ever do anything to intentionally cause me pain. But you had no other choice. You couldn't betray our cause.;NM40AABAST01049_.mp3
I... I don't honestly know if I could have been as strong in your position. To watch you suffer like that I... I might have cracked.;NM40AABAST01050_.mp3
I'm not afraid of him!;
I know... it's hard to believe they're all gone.;
It's their own fault. They should have seen the attack coming.;
Blah, blah, blah. Don't you ever get tired of being so preachy?;
This is not a matter to joke about! If there is one thing we can learn from Saul it is how the power of the dark side can corrupt even the bravest of heroes!;NM40AABAST01058_.mp3
I'm sorry. Forgive me. Snapping at you like that won't help our situation.;NM40AABAST01059_.mp3
No! AHHH!!! AUGH! NO!!! I beg you... mercy!!! NO!!!;NM40AASAUL10103_.mp3
I am surprised he did not pass out sooner. Rarely have I seen someone withstand such punishment and remain conscious.;NM40AASAUL10105_.mp3
This accomplishes nothing, Saul. We will never betray the Republic.;
We were searching for the Star Forge.;
Why? Why are you telling him this?;NM40AASAUL10113_.mp3
You should be grateful, Bastila. He is sparing you agony beyond comprehension.;NM40AASAUL10115_.mp3
Words that betray the Jedi Order bring me more pain than any torture ever could!;NM40AASAUL10117_.mp3
Tell me, how did you find out about the Star Forge?;NM40AASAUL10119_.mp3
No, I will tell you nothing more!;
I had hoped you would continue to cooperate, but you seem to have changed your position.;NM40AASAUL10121_.mp3
[Persuade/Lie] I found Malak's diary.;
[Failure] A diary? This is not the time for jokes! I will only ask you one more time: How did you find out about the Star Forge?;NM40AASAUL10124_.mp3
For the sake of the Republic don't tell him anything!;NM40AASAUL10126_.mp3
Don't listen to her. Tell me what I want to know or watch Bastila suffer!;NM40AASAUL10128_.mp3
Bastila and I saw Revan and Malak searching for it in our dreams.;
No! How could you betray the Jedi like this?;NM40AASAUL10133_.mp3
I find your willingness to cooperate pleasing, though it seems your answers are quite upsetting to Bastila. Not to worry - we are almost finished here.;NM40AASAUL10135_.mp3
The information you have given me has been most useful, but I fear our session is over. Lord Malak will want to continue with this line of questioning himself.;NM40AASAUL10137_.mp3
No! How could you betray the Republic like this?;NM40AASAUL10139_.mp3
I find your willingness to cooperate pleasing, though it seems your answers are quite upsetting to Carth. Not to worry, we are almost finished here.;NM40AASAUL10141_.mp3
For the sake of the Republic don't tell him anything!;NM40AASAUL10129_.mp3
Don't listen to him! Tell me what I want to know or watch Carth suffer!;NM40AASAUL10131_.mp3
Why? Why... why are telling him this?;NM40AASAUL10143_.mp3
You should be grateful, Carth. She is sparing you agony beyond comprehension.;NM40AASAUL10145_.mp3
Words that betray the Republic bring me more pain than any torture ever could!;NM40AASAUL10147_.mp3
NO! AHHH!! The pain - THE PAIN! AHHHH!!!;NM40AASAUL10108_.mp3
Listen, can you not hear him suffering? You can spare him further pain by simply answering my questions.;NM40AASAUL10110_.mp3
[Persuade/Lie] We have been sent to assassinate Lord Malak.;
[Failure] Do you take me for a fool? The Jedi are not assassins - they would never devise such a plan!;NM40AASAUL10083_.mp3
You will pay for this crime, Saul! You and all the Sith!;
More empty threats. We Sith prefer to let our actions speak for us. Perhaps that is why we are winning this war.;NM40AASAUL10075_.mp3
I never liked them anyway.;
A brave front, but your feigned indifference does not fool me. Your masters are eradicated, along with any hope of someone rescuing you!;NM40AASAUL10078_.mp3
AHHHH!!!;NM40AASAUL10058_.mp3
[Persuade/Lie] Alderaan. It's on Alderaan.;
[Failure] Alderaan is nothing but a planet of artisans and philosophers! There is no training academy there! You must think this is a game.;NM40AASAUL10061_.mp3
They're on Dantooine.;
No! Don't say anymore!;NM40AASAUL10064_.mp3
An excellent beginning. I am glad you are being reasonable.;NM40AASAUL10066_.mp3
No! Don't say anymore!;NM40AASAUL10149_.mp3
I will not betray the Jedi Order, even to save Bastila.;
Go ahead, torture her. I don't really like her anyway.;
You expect me to fall for such a transparent ploy. You travel half way across the galaxy with someone and you expect me to believe you feel nothing for each other?;NM40AASAUL10048_.mp3
The interrogation will begin now. Each time you refuse to answer or give me a false answer, Carth will suffer.;NM40AASAUL10151_.mp3
Don't hurt him, I beg you!;
My pain is meaningless! Tell him nothing!;NM40AASAUL10154_.mp3
I will not betray the Jedi, even to save Carth.;
Go ahead, torture him. I don't really like him anyway.;
My loyalty is as true as Bastila's!;
What are you talking about?;
I am interrogating you, not the other way around. You will answer questions, not ask them.;NM40AASAUL10158_.mp3
Don't torture me. I'll tell you everything you want to know.;
What are you saying? Physical pain is nothing compared to the suffering of the galaxy if Malak should defeat the Jedi!;NM40AASAUL10161_.mp3
What are you saying? Physical pain is... is nothing compared to the suffering of the galaxy if Malak should defeat the Jedi!;NM40AASAUL10163_.mp3
Don't waste your breath, Saul! We won't answer any of your questions.;NM40AASAUL10165_.mp3
Malak won't get any answers from me!;
Why don't you just let me go? Bastila is the one you want.;
For the right offer I could probably be convinced to join the Sith.;
Your loyalty is as fickle as ever, I see. Malak will find that amusing, though I seriously doubt he will want you of all people at his side.;NM40AASAUL10169_.mp3
You have helped us at last! Finally we shall be able to reclaim our past!;
You promised to help us last time, Revan. I hope that you live up to your word.;
The work of our people must go on... to preserve our future.;
The Council thinks you may help us... I hope that they are right.;
The keeper of our history can help you if there is anything you wish to know.;
I wish that we could fully trust you after your long absence, Revan... but I do not know if we can.;
Please, will you help me? I have nothing. Nothing left.;NM17AA03SH01000_.mp3
What do you need? I'm <FullName>, I'll help if I can.;
Oh thank you. I don't have anywhere else to turn. If you are down-and-out on Tatooine, you're on your own.;NM17AA03SH01002_.mp3
My husband was a hunter... killed out on the dunes. This wraid plate is all I have left. Please, will you buy it?;NM17AA03SH01004_.mp3
I don't need a handout. I just can't sell it to Fazza without a license. Please, I'm worried about having it. They are so rare...;NM17AA03SH01006_.mp3
Aren't there other hunters you could ask?;
I wouldn't have any idea who to trust. My husband didn't know most of them... he wasn't a proven hunter yet.;NM17AA03SH01008_.mp3
I think one of them killed him. I have my suspicions. I'd rather trust a newcomer like you.;NM17AA03SH01010_.mp3
Let's talk about what to do with this plate.;
Will you buy it? I can't sell it myself. They are worth more than 500 credits!;NM17AA03SH01012_.mp3
I can't afford it right now.;
I don't know what to do then. We need the credits desperately. Could you get it? I could wait...;NM17AA03SH01014_.mp3
Can I persuade you to go cheaper? Maybe half?;
Cheaper? Please, it is all I have. I need the credits. Can't you pay the 500?;NM17AA03SH01018_.mp3
[Persuade] Look, half is better than nothing, right?;
[Success] I guess I don't have much choice, do I? I have to take it.;NM17AA03SH01020_.mp3
It... it will have to do. I thank you, I guess. Maybe... maybe it's enough...;NM17AA03SH01022_.mp3
"The role of the weak is to serve the will of the strong; I'm glad you understand that.";NM17AA03SH01156_.mp3
The dark side dwells in us all, but you cannot give in to your baser instincts like this!;NGLOBEJUHA11852_.mp3
It troubles me to see you behaving this way. Such acts can lead to the dark side.;NGLOBEBAST06897_.mp3
"You've got a real mean streak, kid. You might want to work on that; nasty people tend to come to nasty ends.";NM17AA03SH01159_.mp3
This isn't right! We should be helping people, not making their lives miserable.;NM17AA03SH01160_.mp3
You know what? Sometimes you're nothing but a bully!;NGLOBEMISS13303_.mp3
Had I known you were so cruel, I might have thought twice before swearing my life-debt to you.;
[Failure] No, please, I need the full 500. I have a family... we have nothing.;NM17AA03SH01024_.mp3
Perhaps I will buy it from you.;
You will? Oh, thank you so much. Please, I know it is worth at least 500 credits.;NM17AA03SH01016_.mp3
I will pay you what you want. Here.;
Thank you. I hope it is enough. You have been a great help. I appreciate it. My children will too.;NM17AA03SH01029_.mp3
What was that all about? Are you going soft on me?;NM17AA03SH01163_.mp3
I'm glad to see we're still the good guys here. Sometimes I think we forget that.;NM17AA03SH01164_.mp3
I am proud to call you my friend, <FullName>. You have a noble and generous spirit.;
Wow, sometimes helping people feels pretty good, you know?;NM17AA03SH01166_.mp3
This is how we Jedi should always act: with honor.;NM17AA03SH01167_.mp3
Thank you for helping this woman. It may not seem like such a great thing to you, but you are making a difference.;NM17AA03SH01031_.mp3
*sigh* And how many more like you are there out there, with no one to buy their plates, I wonder?;NM17AA03SH01033_.mp3
For whatever it means, may the Force be with you. You've saved us.;NM17AA03SH01035_.mp3
I'll pay that, and an extra 200. Good luck.;
700 credits! Oh, thank you. It is more than generous of you. I don't know what to say. I just don't.;NM17AA03SH01038_.mp3
I've changed my mind. I'm leaving.;
Please, will no one help? We need the credits. We have nothing.;NM17AA03SH01123_.mp3
I can't buy it, but I could take it and sell it for you.;
I... I don't know. How could I be sure you would come back? Are you sure you can't buy it? Please?;NM17AA03SH01042_.mp3
[Persuade] It's the only choice you have. Trust me.;
[Success] I guess I don't have much choice in the matter. Here, I'll trust you with it.;NM17AA03SH01044_.mp3
I'll be here. Please, don't take too long. I need the credits. Maybe we can get started again... maybe.;NM17AA03SH01046_.mp3
[Failure] I'm sorry, but I can't take the chance. Are you sure you can't buy it from me?;NM17AA03SH01048_.mp3
I think I'll just take it from you.;
What? Please, tell me you are kidding. I can't get any lower than this, and you would take advantage?;NM17AA03SH01055_.mp3
Hand it over or things will get very unpleasant.;
Please no! Take it then... but you may as well have killed me. You've trapped us here... we have nothing.;NM17AA03SH01057_.mp3
Why did you do that?! It's not like we're badly in need of credits, for crying out loud.;NM17AA03SH01059_.mp3
This is beneath even you, stealing from a helpless woman. How could you?!;NM17AA03SH01061_.mp3
You should not act this way. You are treading a dangerous path I fear.;NM17AA03SH01063_.mp3
My, my. You should be proud of yourself, outwitting her like that.;NM17AA03SH01065_.mp3
Back off, old man. I thought you were the non-involved type, remember?;NM17AA03SH01067_.mp3
Warning: Back off, female! No one lays hands on the personage of the master!;NM17AA03SH01069_.mp3
You... you have no conscience. That plate is all I had... we're trapped here now... all because of you.;NM17AA03SH01074_.mp3
Darkness take you... monster...;NM17AA03SH01076_.mp3
[Force Persuade] You will give it to me now!;
[Success] I... I will give you the plate now... here, take it. What... what did you make me do?;NM17AA03SH01072_.mp3
[Failure] No! No I won't! What are you doing? Please, don't do this to me!;NM17AA03SH01078_.mp3
I have to go. Goodbye.;
[Force Persuade] You trust me. You will give me the plate to sell.;
[Success] I... I trust you. Take the plate and sell it. I will wait for you here.;NM17AA03SH01050_.mp3
Was that really necessary? I hope you intend to keep your word if you act so forcefully with an innocent.;NM17AA03SH01052_.mp3
[Force Persuade] Half is acceptable. You agree.;
[Success] Half is acceptable to me. I... I agree?;NM17AA03SH01026_.mp3
Let's go back to my other questions.;
Will you help after? I'll try to answer what I can.;NM17AA03SH01080_.mp3
I wouldn't be able to sell it. I'm no hunter.;
No? But you looked... I'm sorry, I thought you looked equipped like a hunter. Are you sure you aren't going to be getting a license?;NM17AA03SH01082_.mp3
I mean, you don't look like a farmer, and the only way to be allowed out of Anchorhead is to get a hunting license.;NM17AA03SH01084_.mp3
Where would I get a license? What's the cost?;
Czerka Corporation sells them in their office just south of here in the center of Anchorhead. That's where my husband got his.;NM17AA03SH01086_.mp3
I think they charge 200 credits... but they have been known to make exceptions. Please... no one else will help.;NM17AA03SH01088_.mp3
No, I don't have the time. Go away.;
What is a wraid plate? Where did you get it?;
It's the bone plate from the head of the desert wraid. My husband was so proud that he found it. He had just started hunting.;NM17AA03SH01091_.mp3
He said he felt sure the next hunt would bring in more, so we waited to sell this one. Then he never came back.;NM17AA03SH01093_.mp3
Why do you need the money?;
We spent everything on my husband's hunting gear. We hoped that the sport would support us. We hoped...;NM17AA03SH01095_.mp3
Whoever killed him took everything. All I have left is this desert wraid plate... we thought we were so lucky when he brought it home...;NM17AA03SH01097_.mp3
If I could sell it the kids and I could get out of here, maybe buy passage to Coruscant... I don't know.;NM17AA03SH01099_.mp3
I want to ask about your husband's death.;
I still can't believe he's gone. What do you want to know?;NM17AA03SH01101_.mp3
Who was he? Tell me about him.;
His name is... was Ward Fizark. He used to work in the mines but they were scaled back last year.;NM17AA03SH01103_.mp3
He was new to hunting, but he was a good fighter. Used to be a soldier. We spent everything on his gear.;NM17AA03SH01105_.mp3
After a few trips he didn't come back. Guards say a sandcrawler crew found his body stripped of everything.;NM17AA03SH01107_.mp3
Any leads on who killed him?;
Nobody saw anything, and most of the other hunters never even knew him. He had just started.;NM17AA03SH01109_.mp3
I don't trust any of them, but those Gamorreans... they just laugh when they see me. I think they did it.;NM17AA03SH01111_.mp3
You aren't looking for vengeance?;
It doesn't matter. There's no justice on Tatooine. I don't care what happens to them. I just need credits.;NM17AA03SH01113_.mp3
I don't know if I could let it drop so easy.;
No justice. Makes you wonder sometimes if the Republic even exists at all, out here.;NM17AA03SH01117_.mp3
I've got to think about my family, not those vicious pigs.;NM17AA03SH01119_.mp3
Well, that's no longer a problem. I killed them.;
I can't say I'm not grateful, but it doesn't change my situation. I still need credits to get my family out of here.;NM17AA03SH01121_.mp3
Speak, I'm listening.;
I'll try not to take too much of your time. I realize that everyone is out for themselves on Tatooine.;NM17AA03SH01125_.mp3
I have no time for beggars.;
I am no beggar! I just need a little help, is all. There is no one for me to turn to on this wretched planet.;NM17AA03SH01128_.mp3
You are back. Please, have you sold the plate I gave you? My children and I are counting on the credits.;NM17AA03SH01130_.mp3
Yes, I have sold the plate.;
You have? Did Fazza give a good price? How much did you get for us?;NM17AA03SH01132_.mp3
He paid 200 more than you thought. Here.;
He paid full value. Here. It's all yours.;
The plate wasn't worth as much as you said.;
What... what do you mean? My husband was sure it was worth 500 credits. He was so proud...;NM17AA03SH01136_.mp3
Take half and stay healthy, understand?;
I see. I suppose I should thank you for not stealing it all... but I won't. You have no conscience.;NM17AA03SH01138_.mp3
I hope it will be enough. Goodbye. I hope we never meet again.;NM17AA03SH01140_.mp3
[Persuade/Lie] He was wrong. I swear it was only worth half.;
[Failure] No... no I think you lie. If you are trying to cheat me at least have the guts to admit it.;NM17AA03SH01145_.mp3
Actually, I'm mistaken. I'll come back.;
Please hurry. The credits are all we have to start again.;NM17AA03SH01154_.mp3
[Force Persuade] It was only worth half what you said.;
I got a good price. You get nothing.;
What? But... but I trusted you! How can you stand there and... and... No, I won't give you the satisfaction.;NM17AA03SH01151_.mp3
I haven't sold it yet. I'll come back.;
You... please, have you reconsidered? I must sell this desert wraid plate, but I have no license. Can you help?;NM17AA03SH01155_.mp3
What's this? Looks like we found ourselves a bit of sport, my friends.;NM33AASITH20000_.mp3
Ever notice how the Sith always act tough when they're in groups? Nothing but scum if you ask me!;NM33AASITH20001_.mp3
This is good: I want to celebrate my acceptance into the academy!;NM33AASITH20002_.mp3
Me too. So how about it, chump? Ready to die? I'm eager to blow off some steam after those tests.;NM33AASITH20003_.mp3
I don't want to pick a fight here.;
But we do, isn't it obvious?;NM33AASITH20005_.mp3
[Persuade] I'm trying to be reasonable... but if you keep pushing me you'll regret it.;
[Success] Come on, man, let's just leave these losers alone.;
Ahhh, alright. Let's go. Consider yourself lucky, stranger.;NM33AASITH20015_.mp3
[Failure] I hate whining! Let's shut them up!;
I'm all for that! Come on!;NM33AASITH20017_.mp3
Bring it on!;NM33AASITH20035_.mp3
[Force Persuade] You don't want to fight me.;
[Success] Yeah... I don't want to fight you.;NM33AASITH20020_.mp3
Hey! That... that's a Jedi trick!;NM33AASITH20021_.mp3
What?! You... you won't get away with this!!;NM33AASITH20022_.mp3
[Persuade/Bribe] Here... here's 100 credits. Buy a drink to celebrate, instead.;
[Success] Hey, a drink sounds pretty good...;
Yeah, it does. Okay, you're off the hook. Let's go, guys.;NM33AASITH20008_.mp3
[Failure] What do you say, guys? Do we want a drink or not?;NM33AASITH20009_.mp3
I say we take the creds off their bodies. Then get a drink.;
Hey! Good plan!;NM33AASITH20011_.mp3
Are you sure you want to die?;
Hey! I think that was a threat!;
That's pretty funny. Why should we be scared of you?;NM33AASITH20025_.mp3
Take another step and I'll show you.;
Looks like we got us a winner!;
You know it. Let's enjoy this!;NM33AASITH20038_.mp3
I know I will!;NM33AASITH20039_.mp3
Because I've killed plenty of Sith before now. Run along, boys.;
Hey! This one has killed Sith?!;NM33AASITH20028_.mp3
You've picked the wrong place to say that. We'll score big points for bringing in your body, I'm sure!;NM33AASITH20029_.mp3
[Persuade] Because I'm not a snot-nosed punk who's biting off more than he can chew.;
[Success] Uhhh... this one doesn't look like a pushover, you know. Maybe we should reconsider...;NM33AASITH20032_.mp3
Yeah, okay. Just keep out of our way next time, you.;NM33AASITH20033_.mp3
[Failure] Okay, I've heard just about enough out of you. Get them!;NM33AASITH20034_.mp3
Bring it on!;
When we return to our village, the One will reward you greatly.;
Please, off-worlder! Release us!;
The wrath of the Rakata will consume you all!;
Another Jedi, eh? Helping that Twi'lek investigate, no doubt. He seems stumped.;NM14ACRICK08000_.mp3
I'm Rickard Lusoff. Maybe you can figure this out and let me get out of here.;NM14ACRICK08002_.mp3
Tell me what happened.;
Well, I was out hunting iriaz, when I spotted one over here by the bridge. I pull out my rifle and aim at it. I couldn't see it that well, mind you, cause the damn sun was in my eyes.;NM14ACRICK08004_.mp3
So I shoot it and it drops. I walk over here and find Handon standing over Calder's body!;NM14ACRICK08006_.mp3
So why don't you get this whole farce over with and send that whiner Handon to the prison he belongs in!;NM14ACRICK08012_.mp3
So what do you want to know?;NM14ACRICK08014_.mp3
What did you see happen?;
Well, I was out hunting iriaz south of here, and I saw one over by the bridge. The sun was pretty much right behind it though, so I couldn't see it none too clearly.;NM14ACRICK08016_.mp3
I shot, and when I came over here I found Handon standing over the body, holding his side. There wasn't an iriaz in sight... I think he might have taken it!;NM14ACRICK08018_.mp3
Calder must've been hunting it himself 'cause there was a rifle lying close to the body. Bolook's got that now... mine, too. I want that back!;NM14ACRICK08020_.mp3
I want to ask you something else.;
That's all for now.;
Right...;NM14ACRICK08066_.mp3
What about the weapon found by the body?;
That blaster? Never seen it before. Calder himself had a preference for Echani weaponry. He had this one really nice light blaster rifle that he always used.;NM14ACRICK08052_.mp3
Always wished I could get myself a rifle like the one he had...;NM14ACRICK08054_.mp3
Echanis make delicate weapons with too little firepower. Lightweight stuff, if you ask me.;NM14ACRICK08056_.mp3
That blaster ain't it, though. Calder only had the one rifle, too, so he either must have borrowed that... or it's someone else's.;NM14ACRICK08058_.mp3
You thought Calder was cheating you!;
Now, I don't love Calder, but we go back a long way. We run a sub-orbital shipping and transport company out of Garang spaceport.;NM14ACRICK08008_.mp3
We've been partners in that business for well over twenty years, and we've been doing just fine the way we are.;NM14ACRICK08010_.mp3
You can deny it, but there was bad blood between you!;
Did you know the victim?;
Yeah, I knew him. Hell, we've known each other for a good long time. Doesn't mean I really have to have liked the slime-ball.;NM14ACRICK08032_.mp3
*sigh* Maybe I shouldn't be so hard on him... especially now that he's dead. We actually got along pretty well most of the time. We just had our... differences.;NM14ACRICK08034_.mp3
We were actually business partners. We were involved in some orbit-to-ground transport operations for Aratech.;NM14ACRICK08036_.mp3
Can I leave now? I should probably be the one to give the news to his wife.;NM14ACRICK08038_.mp3
Why were you out here?;
I told ya already, didn't I? Was hunting some iriaz. Haven't seen many in the area recently, what with those kath hounds acting up, but they're still around.;NM14ACRICK08023_.mp3
Was in my blind a little south of here when I spotted one, like I said before. I shot and POW!, it went down. But when I come over here, there's Handon standing over the body and the iriaz was gone!;NM14ACRICK08025_.mp3
Now, I didn't have nothing to do with this, so can I go now?;NM14ACRICK08027_.mp3
Not just yet.;
*grumbles*;NM14ACRICK08029_.mp3
Why would someone want to kill him?;
You Jedi are so predictable. Always seeing some greater purpose behind everything, when the simple answer is usually the right one.;NM14ACRICK08043_.mp3
Can't you see that it must have been Handon? I found him standing over the damned body!;NM14ACRICK08045_.mp3
I don't know why this is causing you so much trouble. You almost seem as lost as this Bolook guy.;NM14ACRICK08049_.mp3
Bolook said you were limping. Are you hurt?;
Well... uh... I kind of sprained my ankle running through the bush before I found the body. But it's nothing that serious.;NM14ACRICK08063_.mp3
Nothing more right now.;
Hey - I recognize you! You're the one who won the swoop race!;
You better be careful out on the streets. Those damn Vulkars will be looking to get even with you for winning that race and killing Brejik.;
Brejik is nothing but scum! I don't know why those Vulkars follow him - Gadon's ten times the man he is!;
The swoop race coming up will show those Vulkars who's in charge here! When we win half the people following Brejik will desert him!;
It isn't safe out there on the streets. Those Black Vulkars will take a shot at anybody!;
I'm not looking for any trouble with you Sith. Please, just leave me alone.;NM02AAMAN207000_.mp3
People complain about the Sith, but this quarantine is good for all the businesses on Taris. Look at Javyar's cantina. That place has never been busier!;NM02AAMAN207002_.mp3
If the Sith wanted to get on everyone's good side, they'd go clean up the swoop gangs in the Lower City.;NM02AAMAN207004_.mp3
What's this, another off-worlder? I didn't realize how many of you there were on Taris until this Sith quarantine.;NM02AAMAN207006_.mp3
I heard a bunch of wreckage from the battle overhead crashed into the Undercity. Think of the damage it could have caused if it had landed here!;NM02AAMAN207008_.mp3
Beep beep beep-oop!;NM35AADROI01000_.mp3
You have been charged with flagrant violations of the Ahto City laws, and insubordination towards a Selkath constable. The fine is 500 credits.;
You will stay here in the prison until your fine is paid.;
I need to sell some equipment.;
You will find our prices are fair human. After selling your equipment, speak to me again to pay your fine.;
[Force Persuade] You really want to let me go. I have done nothing.;
[Success] Perhaps we were wrong about you, human. You may go.;
[Failure] You try to influence my mind! We do not tolerate disrespect for the law here on Manaan.;
Your money will be confiscated and you will be deported to your ship. Similar offences will be dealt with in an equally harsh manner.;
Here are the 500 credits.;
You are now free to go, human. Remember to keep the peace, or you will face the penalties once more.;
I don't have 500 credits.;
Then we will confiscate what money you have and you will be deported to your ship. Similar offences will be dealt with in an equally harsh manner.;
You will stay here in the prison until your fine of 100 credits is paid.;
Here are the 100 credits.;
I don't have 100 credits.;
Lord Malak was most displeased when he learned you had escaped Taris alive! He has promised a great reward to whoever destroys you.;NM27AASITH07002_.mp3
[This droid does not respond. It obviously needs extensive repairs. For all you know it could have been lying out in the desert for years.];
Malfunction... my primary motivators are... incapaci... error. Damage terminal. Playback... cause of malfunction...;NM24AADROI01000_.mp3

What happened to you?;
What systems of yours are active?;
Defense is operational. Caution... actuators cannot sustain... malfunction.;NM24AADROI01009_.mp3
Move northeast and attack hostiles. [<CUSTOM43> repair part(s)];
[Success] Defense... armed. System failure... system failure...;NM24AADROI01012_.mp3
[Failure] Error... defense systems failure. Abort... abort...;NM24AADROI01014_.mp3
Move south and attack hostiles. [<CUSTOM43> repair part(s)];
I'll scrap you and take what I can.;
Shutting down... primary systems... failing...;NM24AADROI01017_.mp3
[You start with the droid's head, removing it and placing it in your pack. An energy discharge flows through the remaining parts.];
You're in no condition to talk. Goodbye.;
[You back away. The droid appears to suffer some sort of additional interior trauma.];
Defense... armed. System failure... system failure...;NM24AADROI01019_.mp3
You're... you're with the Sith, ain't you? Sure... I recognize the uniform. What... what do you want? I haven't done anything wrong.;NM02ADSCAR09000_.mp3
If... if you want to search the place go ahead. I won't stop you. I've got nothing to hide from you.;NM02ADSCAR09002_.mp3
Please... please don't hurt me! You don't have to kill me - I'll have Davik's money if he... if he just gives me a little more time! Please, I don't want to die!;NM02ADSCAR09004_.mp3
Here - I've got 50 credits on me. That's all I've got. It's yours - just don't tell Davik where I'm hiding, okay? I'm begging you.;NM02ADSCAR09006_.mp3
There's a bounty on your head, Largo, and I'm here to collect!;
I knew you were here to kill me! Well, I won't go down without a fight!;NM02ADSCAR09024_.mp3
What are you babbling about?;
You mean you're not here to kill me? But... I thought you were one of Davik's bounty hunters. If you're not here to kill me, what do you want?;NM02ADSCAR09010_.mp3
Maybe I could help you with your problem with Davik.;
I don't think anyone can help me. I owe Davik money, and I was late with the payment. So he went to Zax in the bounty office and put a price on my head!;NM02ADSCAR09012_.mp3
I've been hiding here ever since, but sooner or later someone will find me. Unless I somehow come up with another 200 credits I'm a dead man.;NM02ADSCAR09014_.mp3
Here - I've got 200 credits you can have.;
You'd give 200 credits to a stranger just to help them out?! I... I don't believe it! Thank you!;NM02ADSCAR09016_.mp3
Wow, that was sure generous of you. I just hope we don't end up needing those credits later on.;NM02ADSCAR09039_.mp3
Now I can pay off Davik! Oh thank you - you've saved my life! I better go give this to Davik right away!;NM02ADSCAR09018_.mp3
Maybe I should just kill you and collect the bounty.;
Don't worry - I won't tell anyone you're hiding here.;
Thank you - you've saved my life. At least until one of Davik's bounty hunters finds me.;NM02ADSCAR09021_.mp3
I'm just looking around.;
Just looking around? Oh... okay. Go ahead, look around. Just don't tell Davik I'm here, okay?;NM02ADSCAR09027_.mp3
Don't worry - I'm not going to hurt you.;
Give me the credits and I won't tell Davik you're hiding here.;
Here - take the credits. But please, just don't tell Davik where I'm hiding. He'll kill me if he finds me!;NM02ADSCAR09030_.mp3
I know we might need credits, but there has got to be a better way to get them than this!;NM02ADSCAR09040_.mp3
What... what do you want now? You're not going to tell Davik's bounty hunters where I'm hiding, are you?;NM02ADSCAR09032_.mp3
Hand over some credits or I'll tell Davik where you're hiding!;
But... I already gave you all my money! I don't have anything left. You promised you wouldn't tell Davik where I was!;NM02ADSCAR09034_.mp3
Fine - I'll let you live.;
That's too bad. Say hi to Davik's men when they stop by.;
You can't tell Davik where I'm hiding with a blaster bolt through your chest!;NM02ADSCAR09037_.mp3
Hey - what's the idea barging in here! Get out of here or I'll call the guards.;NM08AADAVG06000_.mp3
The guards? Slaves aren't allowed out of the slave quarters! I can't let them see me here!;
Hey, baby - wait! I wasn't actually going - DAMNIT! Okay, great. You just scared off my date for the night, so you better explain yourself before I lose my temper and call the guards!;NM08AADAVG06004_.mp3
[Persuade] No need to call the guards - I just got lost.;
[Success] Okay, I guess it was just an honest mistake. And I'm a reasonable man, so I'll just let it go this time.;NM08AADAVG06006_.mp3
You better pay more attention to where you're going. Opening the wrong door around here can get you killed. Now get out of here and don't bother me again!;NM08AADAVG06008_.mp3
[Failure] Uh-uh. No way. You ain't getting out of this mess that easy! You can explain yourself to the guards - if you live long enough for them to question you!;NM08AADAVG06010_.mp3
[Persuade] Sorry I wrecked your night. Here's 50 credits for the inconvenience.;
[Success] Okay, I guess it was an honest mistake. Give me the credits and I'll forget this ever happened.;NM08AADAVG06013_.mp3
You can't call the guards if you're dead!;
You should have picked an easier target! By the time the guards show up they'll have to take you out of here in pieces!;NM08AADAVG06016_.mp3
I tried to play nice, but I guess you're too stupid to figure it out! You keep coming back and bothering me!;NM08AADAVG06022_.mp3
I guess the only way you'll get the message is if I kill you!;NM08AADAVG06024_.mp3
I can't talk now. I've got to pack. They'll be on us soon!;NM22AACZER05000_.mp3
Just leave me alone. I don't want any trouble. The guards are trigger-happy as it is.;NM22AACZER05001_.mp3
Welcome to Edean. I trust you will find our facilities pass inspection. Czerka Corporation is very efficient.;NM22AACZER05002_.mp3
You have nothing to be proud of, fool.;
I'm sorry, I don't understand Wookieespeak. Shyriiwook, I think it's called? What did the Wookiee say?;NM22AACZER05006_.mp3
You work on Kashyyyk and don't understand the language?;
Czerka Corporation calls the planet Edean, and no, I don't understand the language. The local Wookiee leader has made it so we don't need to.;NM22AACZER05008_.mp3
Wookiees are unable to speak basic, but for the last decade the residents of all local villages have been trained to understand it.;NM22AACZER05010_.mp3
What good would that do?;
It helps ease tensions. They are less hostile towards us if they understand what we say.;NM22AACZER05012_.mp3
And it makes my people more desirable as slaves.;
What did he say? I don't usually have a translator I can ask.;NM22AACZER05016_.mp3
That knowing Basic just makes his people better slaves.;
I just work here in the lab. I... I don't have anything to do with the taking of slaves.;NM22AACZER05022_.mp3
Why don't you do anything to stop it?;
I'm just an employee. You'll have to take your concerns to Janos. He's the voice for Czerka Corporation on this outpost.;NM22AACZER05024_.mp3
How convenient. All the benefits with no guilt.;
I don't have to justify myself to you. I do good work here. If you're looking for trouble, go somewhere else.;NM22AACZER05026_.mp3
What is your job here?;
I'm conducting experiments on various samples of indigenous plant life. There may be untapped pharmaceutical resources here.;NM22AACZER05046_.mp3
Of course, that will take some time, and the Wookiees are a more immediate source of income. Please, I must return to my work.;NM22AACZER05048_.mp3
I want to ask questions about this planet.;
I'm sorry, but director Janos will see to your questions. I must continue with my work.;NM22AACZER05054_.mp3
I'm asking you. Answer my questions, peon!;
There's no call for that. I'm just a glorified lab technician. Please, the assignment is difficult enough.;NM22AACZER05050_.mp3
Take your concerns to Janos. He's the one that runs things here. Not me.;NM22AACZER05052_.mp3
Goodbye for now.;
Farewell.;NM22AACZER05057_.mp3
You'll talk as long as I say, understand?;
Whatever you say. I have some questions.;
I'm not sure I can answer. Janos is the spokesman for Czerka Coporation at this outpost.;NM22AACZER05029_.mp3
Ignore him. I have some questions for you.;
He wants to rip your legs off and beat you with them.;
I didn't say that!;
See? He's furious. I can barely control him.;
What are you doing? Stop this!;
Call him off! I don't have anything to do with what happens on this planet. I'm just a glorified lab technician!;NM22AACZER05035_.mp3
What was that about? I don't like being used for your amusement.;
What? Don't you want these fools to fear you?;
I suppose so... but their presence here is no joke.;
I'm just scaring him. Maybe he'll learn something.;
I don't have much hope of that.;
Don't question me. Remember your life debt.;
Grrr... I remember.;
Why would a Wookiee leader do that?;
I understand he works very closely with Czerka Corporation. He wants his people to work well with us. It eases tensions.;NM22AACZER05019_.mp3
He said you have nothing to be proud of working for Czerka.;
Please, take any inquiries you have to director Janos. I must continue my work.;NM22AACZER05044_.mp3
Hello again. Czerka Corporation is seeing a lot of return business these days. We are the only company offering Wookiees.;NM22AACZER05058_.mp3
Hey, you can't be in here right now - the control room is off limits! Don't you know there's a Vulkar assassin coming here to kill Gadon?;NM11AAHIDB03000_.mp3
Sorry, I didn't know. I'll be going now.;
Wait a minute - how did you even get in here? Nobody's supposed to have the access codes to this door. Unless...;NM11AAHIDB03002_.mp3
Assassin! Assassin in the base!;NM11AAHIDB03005_.mp3
I'm the Vulkar assassin - time for you to die!;
We saw what you did out there on the cameras...;NM28ACSUR404000_.mp3
Destroying the machinery was the right thing to do, for everyone.;NM28ACSUR404002_.mp3
That creature... the giant firaxan shark, the guardian of the kolto or whatever it was, seems to have calmed down a lot. It may even be safe to go outside now.;NM28ACSUR404004_.mp3
But we'll still stay here and wait for the Republic rescue crews. Thank you for not making a huge mistake.;NM28ACSUR404006_.mp3
Why did you have to poison the water?? We don't know what effect it could have on the environment around here... or on the kolto.;NM28ACSUR404008_.mp3
Whatever it is that's coming out of the vent now doesn't look the same at all... I only hope you didn't pollute whatever was making it... We never were able to synthesize it.;NM28ACSUR404010_.mp3
I think we're just going to sit here. We have a lot of food and water, so we should be alright for a while.;NM28ACSUR404012_.mp3
If you can make it out to the kolto harvesting machines, try to reprogram them to self destruct. Maybe that will cause the creature to stop its psychic screams.;NM28ACSUR404014_.mp3
Can you tell me how to disable the harvesting machine again?;
You can reprogram the harvesting machines to overpressure their self-oxidizing fuel, so that the fuel tank cannisters will rupture and the entire machine will destroy itself.;NM28ACSUR303101_.mp3
The Hydrolium gas we use is a gas at 1 to 3 million sangen, a liquid at about 4 million sangen, and a solid above that. When it's a liquid it's VERY explosive.;NM28ACSUR303102_.mp3
If you inject enough of the Hydrolium gas into the tank, the pressure will be so great that it will turn to liquid form and start a chain reaction inside the machine.;NM28ACSUR303103_.mp3
Once you do that, you can open the doors to the submersible bay and go back to the surface. Make sure you tell the Republic there are still some survivors down here.;NM28ACSUR404016_.mp3
Kono says he won't leave, and I can't leave him here by himself. We'll stay and wait until the Republic sends a larger rescue mission. Please don't delay too long!;NM28ACSUR404018_.mp3
Why don't you come with me?;
I'll do what I have to.;
No one's allowed to talk to the prisoner. Brejik's orders. She wouldn't hear you anyway: she's got a neural disruptor collar on to keep her under control.;
Go about your business, please, citizen.;NM33AACZER06000_.mp3
This is a Sith colony. They are the law here. I am here only to protect Czerka interests.;NM33AACZER06002_.mp3
You can conduct business at our office, if you wish.;NM33AACZER06004_.mp3
Oh, entertainment can be found at the local cantina, provided by Czerka of course.;NM33AACZER06006_.mp3
Please avoid the Sith academy... unless you are a hopeful, naturally.;NM33AACZER06008_.mp3
You must be accompanied by a Sith Master if you wish admittance into the academy, citizen.;NM35AASITH13000_.mp3
Greetings, student.;NM35AASITH13002_.mp3
I serve the Sith.;NM35AASITH13004_.mp3
Do not cause trouble for the Sith.;NM35AASITH13006_.mp3
You are the one who defeated our warriors in combat, aren't you?;
The one who wields the magic to defeat the Elders?;
I wield the Force, yes.;
It is glorious to see such a power come to our aid when all was thought lost here on this gods-forsaken island.;
To be able to command the elements in such a way is awesome to behold... and must be even more so to wield.;
I think you misunderstand what the Force is...;
I am sorry for not comprehending your great powers. What then, are they?;
The Force is a power that flows from all life in the universe.;
Flows from life?;
It connects all living beings in the universe.;
All beings are connected? Through some sort of life Force?;
You are truly great in your power and your wisdom.;
I can't wait to see what havoc your magics will wreak on the Elders!;
Life itself generates the Force.;
The power over life gives you magic to create and destroy?;
It is the combined affinity that all life hold for each other.;
The Force is a natural energy that gifted people can use.;
A natural energy? Like fire and lightning?;
Much more powerful than just lightning.;
Such power! If only we Rakata could wield that power, too...;
It is like being able to shoot lightning from your fingertips.;
Fire that only genetically gifted people can use.;
'Genetically'? Is it that only your people can use the magic? There have been tales from the past of Rakata wielding magic, as the Elders do now.;
But maybe you mean something greater, something in all peoples that can harness its power.;
The true nature of the Force is being able to project your will upon reality.;
Project your will? To force things to be the way you want?;
The only true Force is to be able to change destiny.;
Just as you are able to change this destiny we are in, this... stagnation. You, with your power, can break the Elders' power and free us to move on!;
The strong of will can have whatever they desire.;
The strong of will... with the will to power. Yes, yes I see!;
One as weak as yourself could not see the true power of it.;
The Force is not merely the elements!;
You don't know the half of it...;
Please, great one, enlighten me to the scope of the power you wield... this 'Force'.;
I will see what can be done about the Elders.;
I decide what I will do!;
Of course. None could make you do that which you do not desire.;
You entered the Elders' compound and returned alive!;
I knew your magic was strong, but this is amazing! Maybe someday I could wield magic too!;
Would you... teach me, Master?;
You are not strong enough to wield the Force.;
I... I understand, Master... I hope that someday you will reconsider and find me worthy of your tutelage.;
I will teach you in time. I'm busy now.;
I await the day when your tasks are done and you will have time to teach me, Master.;
I will not teach one as worthless as you!;
I hope that someday, you will find me worthy to teach, Master.;
Many say that the Republic has had something to do with the economic restriction our people have placed on all trade. I hope it is not true.;
The Republic has been acting against our will I fear. While we do not hold it against you personally, we must revise our opinions of your government.;
It is most distressing that the Sith Embassy should have been invaded as it has. It makes us Selkath seem like we are failing in our duties...;
I find it shocking that a hero of the Republic - Sunry - could do such a thing. Perhaps I have been wrong in my judgment of the Republic.;
The Sith have tried to manipulate our courts time and again, seeking power for themselves. I hope our government decides to do more against this.;
Greetings, off-worlder. While I do not have time to converse with you, I hope you find what you are looking for here on Manaan.;
You got any armor plating for my swoop bike?;NM26ABSITH10000_.mp3
Yes, I have a fine piece right here. A little dented, but still serviceable. And a real bargain at that price.;
I thought this garbage was free! You actually sell this junk? You fish are a strange breed.;NM26ABSITH10002_.mp3
Get out of my store! I'm sick of you Sith and your stupid jokes!;
I've got real customers to worry about - I don't need you coming in here and making fun of my inventory every day!;
Don't worry, junkman, when I want garbage I'll be back!;NM26ABSITH10005_.mp3
Woo, hey, look at this... it's the Shith! [hic] Oh no, I'm sho shcared! Hoo hoo hoo.;NM02ABDRUN05000_.mp3
Careful... don't do anything shtupid! [hic] We don't want no trouble with the Shith. [hic];NM02ABDRUN05002_.mp3
Uh... yeah. You're right. [hic] Shorry about this, Shithy. [hic] Come on fellas, let's go.;NM02ABDRUN05004_.mp3
What is thish planet coming to, huh? [hic] Shlummies walkin' around the Upper City!;NM02ABDRUN05006_.mp3
Shouldn't you go back to the Lower Cities where you belong, shlummie?;NM02ABDRUN05008_.mp3
Well, this is rich.;NM02ABDRUN05010_.mp3
Yeah, like he said, these shtreets are for the Upper City citizens! You better get out of our way if you know what's good for you!;NM02ABDRUN05012_.mp3
[Persuade] Hey, guys, we can all be friends here. Let me buy you a drink.;
[Success] A drink? Hey - for a shlummie you ain't so bad! Come on boys - this shlummie's buying the next round!;NM02ABDRUN05014_.mp3
No way! Forget it! No more drinksh! We're late enough as it is.;NM02ABDRUN05016_.mp3
Uh... yeah. I guess you're right. Maybe next time, shlummie. [hic] Come on fellas, let's go.;NM02ABDRUN05018_.mp3
[Failure] We don't drink with your kind, shlummie! Go back to the lower city where you belong!;NM02ABDRUN05020_.mp3
Time to teach you a lesson, shlummie! [hic] Maybe you'll think twice about coming up into our turf!;NM02ABDRUN05022_.mp3
[Persuade] You'd better think twice about what you're doing. This might be more than you can handle.;
[Success] Uh... c'mon, fellas. This shlummie ain't worth the bother.;NM02ABDRUN05025_.mp3
If you're trying to pick a fight, you've got one!;
Hey, this shlummie's got a mouth!;NM02ABDRUN05030_.mp3
Oh, great. We're fighting the drunks, are we? Man, do they stink.;NM02ABDRUN05032_.mp3
You talk big, shlummie! Maybe you should show us a little more reshpect!;NM02ABDRUN05027_.mp3
[The drunk waves sheepishly at you, but doesn't speak. He seems to be having trouble standing.];
Eh? Who are you, then? The only new people that come to Junix Nard's cantina are longtime losers and bounty hunters.;NM17AF07JU06000_.mp3
I don't have to tell you why the two don't mix well. Please keep any blaster fire to a minimum.;NM17AF07JU06001_.mp3
Do you have anything for sale?;
Czerka Corporation only worries about keeping their own stores full. I don't have much on hand.;NM17AF07JU06003_.mp3
I want to ask about things here on Tatooine.;
"I've already gone over this stuff with you. Couldn't you go ask someone else? I'm not one of those ""listening"" bartenders.";NM17AF07JU06005_.mp3
I've got some questions about hunting.;
You've got a license there, don't you? Fazza's lodge will be open to you now. Nothing more I can tell you about hunting that his lot won't.;NM17AF07JU06009_.mp3
And since you got that license from Czerka, you know they look for bounties of their own. They are the ones with credits to pay and interests to protect.;NM17AF07JU06010_.mp3
Where is Fazza's lodge?;
Fazza's is northwest of here, north of the Czerka office. He'll steer you towards the Czerka for a license before dealing with you.;NM17AF07JU06014_.mp3
After that, he'll buy the trophies you collect. I don't know what he does with it all, but I guess he makes a living somehow.;NM17AF07JU06015_.mp3
Where does Czerka Corporation give out the licenses?;
They maintain an office west of here in central Anchorhead. That's about all they maintain these days.;NM17AF07JU06017_.mp3
Let's go back to my first questions.;
All right then. Just keep it brief, will you? I've got customers.;NM17AF07JU06019_.mp3
Anything out of the ordinary happening?;
I suppose you are fishing for a reaction to the destruction of Taris? That's all anyone from off-world is talking about.;NM17AF07JU06031_.mp3
Well, I'll tell you, it's about time someone kicked the Republic in the tail and got things moving. I guess the Sith are the ones to do it.;NM17AF07JU06032_.mp3
Don't get me wrong, all those deaths were horrible, but war gets the money moving. Maybe they'll decide to fortify us out here.;NM17AF07JU06033_.mp3
Know about anything more local?;
No.;NM17AF07JU06035_.mp3
"""No"" you don't know, or ""no"" you won't tell me?";
"Just ""no"". I don't look for trouble. You'll have to talk to people yourself if you want more than that. Now, if you don't mind.";NM17AF07JU06037_.mp3
I have to go. Goodbye.;
Yeah, yeah.;NM17AF07JU06039_.mp3
Well, there's two kinds of hunting on Tatooine: hunting wraid, and hunting people. Both are dangerous and both have certain restrictions.;NM17AF07JU06011_.mp3
You'll need a Czerka hunting license, even though most hunters deal with Fazza at the lodge once they have their paperwork squared away.;NM17AF07JU06012_.mp3
Tell me about racing.;
I don't deal with any of that. Motta the Hutt has a lock on everrything race related on Tatooine. You deal with him or you don't race.;NM17AF07JU06022_.mp3
I want to ask if you know about a bounty I am currently hunting.;
It would cut into my business if people thought I'd turn them in. I don't know anything about anyone, thank you very much.;NM17AF07JU06024_.mp3
You made short work of the Sand People, and I thank you for that, but don't make trouble for me here.;NM17AF07JU06025_.mp3
Now, if this is about Sand People, that's a different matter. I have no problem talking about them.;NM17AF07JU06026_.mp3
What do you know about the Sand People?;
I know they don't negotiate. Attacks are worst in the far south of the Dune Sea, right where the sandcrawlers have to pass.;NM17AF07JU06028_.mp3
You wipe them out, you'll make a lot of friends.;NM17AF07JU06029_.mp3
"What, you couldn't take some notes when you signed up with Motta? I heard you were down at the track; there's nothing new I can tell you.";NM17AF07JU06021_.mp3
What, did some Czerka promoter tell you to come to this planet? I pity you if you were expecting a prosperous mining outpost.;NM17AF07JU06006_.mp3
Nothing here but sand and more sand. There's a little hunting and racing, but nothing that will make a small man rich.;NM17AF07JU06007_.mp3
Hmm, what's the winner of the Manaan Sector Champion title doing here, I wonder? Must have blown all your winnings.;NM17AF07JU06040_.mp3
I had a few Czerka employees confide that the company is pulling out of Kashyyyk. Leaving as soon as things get difficult... just like they'll do here.;NM17AF07JU06041_.mp3
Looks like people will have to drink to forget their pain, now that kolto is so expensive. Of course, no one from Manaan is saying a word about it.;NM17AF07JU06042_.mp3
Drink up, friend. I hear the Sith are restless on Korriban, and they never keep their problems to themselves.;NM17AF07JU06043_.mp3
You again? What is it now?;NM17AF07JU06045_.mp3
Did I see you down by the swoop track? I'll remind you that I don't give loans and I expect prompt payment on bar bills.;NM17AF07JU06044_.mp3
Oh... hello. Uh... welcome to my shop. Of course the Sith are always welcome here. Would you like to see my inventory?;
Let me see what you have for sale.;
Of course. Right away, your Sithness.;
I want to ask you some questions.;
Questions? But... I don't know anything. If I did, I'd tell you right away. I've got no secrets from the Sith.;
I'll be going now.;
Oh... alright then. Goodbye. Please... please do come again. I... I mean it. Really. I've got nothing against you Sith.;
Welcome back to my shop. Hey - where's that little T3-H8 unit I sold you?;
It blew up. I came to get my money back.;
It blew up? Huh, I thought I'd taken care of that little cross-wiring problem. Well, don't worry - I run an honest business here.;
I don't have to give you a refund, but I don't want to lose a customer. Here... have your 50 credits back. No hard feelings, right?;
No hard feelings.;
Glad to hear it. I can't afford to make my customers unhappy... business is tough enough as it is. So, anything else you need?;
Let me see what you've got for sale.;
You want to see my inventory, or are you here to buy a utility droid? My prices are very reasonable, and all my droids come with a money back guarantee.;
Utility droids? What do they do?;
What don't they do? They're great at making vehicle repairs, for starters. Pretty handy to have in a fight - small, but tough with a surprising amount of firepower.;
And there's no better code breaker or security system slicer around... not that I'd ever condone you doing anything illegal, of course.;
Let me see your droids.;
So you're interested in Davik's T3-M4 after all? Well, he's yours for 2000 credits.;
I thought Davik already paid for the droid!;
He gave me a down payment, but the rest is due on delivery. If he sent you here to get the droid without giving you the final payment, that's between you and him. But I still need my 2000 credits.;
Here you go.;
Wow... look at you, big spender! Okay, the T3-M4 unit is yours. Pleasure doing business with you. A real pleasure.;
[T3-M4 has joined your party.] [Left-click this response to go to PARTY SELECTION screen.];
[Persuade] That price is outrageous! I'll give you half.;
[Success] Half? If you're trying to rob me why not just stick a blaster in my face? On the other hand, I do want to stay on Davik's good side. Tell you what, he's yours for 1500.;
It's a deal.;
[Persuade] Give me that droid for free, or Davik will close this shop down - permanently!;
[Success] Hey, I don't want trouble with Davik. Look, take the droid, he's yours. But the next time Davik wants me to do some custom work, he's out of luck!;
I can't afford that.;
You're joking, right? You mean to tell me Canderous sent you to collect this droid for Davik and you can't pay? I find that hard to believe. But it's not my problem, is it? So... are you going to pay?;
Okay, here's the 2000 credits.;
I'll pass.;
Okay, that's your decision I guess. Seems to me Canderous wouldn't have sent you if he didn't want you to buy it, though.;
So, is there anything else I can do for you?;
Let me see your inventory.;
My inventory is a bit limited because of the quarantine, but if you need anything to do with droids or computers this is still the place to shop.;
[Failure] Half? Are you kidding? This is *the* best droid you'll ever buy! The price is non-negotiable, even for one of Davik's agents. The price is firm - 2000 credits, take it or leave it.;
I've only got two droids left: a re-built T3-H8 unit for 50 credits and a top of the line T3-M4 model with all the options. But he's not for sale.;
Canderous said you'd sell the T3-M4 droid to me.;
Oh, Canderous sent you! Well why didn't you say so? Okay, the droid is ready. You can have it for 2000 credits.;
I'll take the T3-H8 unit. Here's 50 credits.;
You know a bargain when you see one. This little guy's as reliable as used droids get. I did the reconditioning on him myself! Don't worry... he'll follow you everywhere!;
Is there anything else you need?;
I don't have 50 credits.;
Well, I'm not going to drop the price on that model. At 50 credits it's already a bargain. If you can't afford it, you can't afford it.;
Tell me about that top of the line T3-M4 droid.;
"The T3-M4 is the best utility droid ever built: top notch codebreaker; expert security, programming and droid repair skills. He's even got the firepower to be handy in battle.";
This little guy is the absolute top of the line... but he's not for sale. He's a custom job I'm holding for a very special buyer. Sorry.;
All I've got left is this T3-M4 unit. Excellent codebreaker. Fantastic security, programming and droid repair skills. A good amount of firepower, too.;
[Persuade] I think you should give me something extra for all the trouble.;
[Success] Well... I guess I did cause you some inconvenience. And I don't want to get a reputation for poor customer service... business is tough enough as it is.;
Here's 75 credits... I think that's more than fair. Now, is there anything else I can do for you?;
[Failure] What? I offer you a full refund and you want more? Business is tough enough as it is... you should be glad I'm giving you a refund at all!;
Fine... just give me the 50 credits.;
Glad to hear you're being reasonable. You have to understand that I'm trying to run a business here. Now, is there anything else you need?;
[Persuade] Maybe I'll just start telling people not to shop here. You'll be ruined!;
[Success] No! Don't do that. I... I can't afford that kind of hit to my business. We can reach some kind of compromise here.;
[Failure] You're not the first person to try and bully me just because I'm an alien. My loyal customers won't be scared off by the likes of you, so spare me your threats.;
I guess I have to teach you a lesson: Janice Nall can't be pushed around! So I'll just keep your 50 credits and say buyer beware... and there's nothing you can do about it.;
You're welcome to come back whenever you decide you can be civil and reasonable. Until then, good day.;
That thing was a piece of junk! You ripped me off!;
Now just settle down. There's no need to get upset - I run an honest business here.;
A customer? Come in, come in. Janice Nall at your service. Welcome to my droid and droid supply shop.;
"Always good to see a new face - customers are hard to come by. A lot of the Taris citizens won't even come in here; they refuse to shop at a store owned by a Twi'lek.";
What do they have against Twi'leks?;
They don't like aliens much here in Upper Taris. They tolerate us Twi'leks, but they'd rather see us as dancers in the cantina than successful business owners.;
You'd think people would be a little more tolerant of others in this day and age. *sigh* I guess stupidity and ignorance will never go out of style.;NM02ABJANI11121_.mp3
You'll see a few aliens around, but most of the non-humans stick to the Lower City. I've learned not to dwell on it, though. I try to stay focused on running my store.;
My selection is a bit limited right now - the Sith confiscated all my assault droids. But I've got a utility droid you might find interesting.;
I'd like to see what you have in stock.;
Have you heard the news? Bendak Starkiller is coming out of retirement to fight in a death match. Everybody's trying to get tickets to see it.;
I've never understood why people always want to watch each other get killed. Droids don't think that way. Maybe that's why I like them better than people.;
I heard Bendak Starkiller finally met his match. I can't say I'm surprised - he was getting on in years. People start to lose their edge as they get older.;
That's the nice thing about droids. A yearly maintenance check and a few replacement parts here and there and they can last forever.;
Welcome back to my shop. If you want to buy something I'd suggest you do it soon, before the Sith haul me off to their interrogation chambers.;
What are you talking about?;
Somebody broke into the military base. The Sith are convinced one of my utility droids was used during the break-in. They were here questioning me just a little while ago.;
I guess they believed me when I said I didn't know anything about it, but I get the feeling they might be back. So get your shopping in while you can.;
Back again, I see. Well, I've never turned a potential customer away yet. You interested in seeing what I have in stock?;
Hello there, captain. Let's see... ah, yes. Here it is. It looks like the shipment has been delivered to your ship, as requested.;
What shipment? What are you talking about?;
This is docking bay 32, isn't it? Yes, it is, and that's what I have here on the requisition form. Everything seems to be in order. The gizka are your problem now.;
"Excuse me, did you say ""gizka""?";
It says right here on the manifest that you ordered a crate of gizka. To be delivered to docking bay 32... that's right here.;
Now, all I need is your thumbprint for the... wait a second, where did the datapad go? *sigh* Nothing is ever organized around here.;
At any rate, the gizka are yours. One of the loaders said the crate split open once he put it in your hold... some of the critters might have gotten loose.;
That happens, I'm afraid. We don't accept liability... and we certainly couldn't take the cargo back. Enjoy.;
Whatever you put on my ship, I want it off. Now.;
If you want the cargo removed, you'll have to fill out another requisition. I have one right... wait. I thought I had one. Oh, well.;
Err... what shipment was that again?;
"Well, let me see. Docking bay 32, check... crate 42-B7, check... manifest lists ""life form: gizka"". Everything seems to be in order.";
Excellent. Thank you.;
Wait a second, is this right? It says docking bay 32 on the form, but you just arrived. Oh, well, the gizka are your problem now.;
"What do you mean ""my problem""? I didn't order any gizka.";
Fair enough. Thanks.;
Greetings, up-worlder. We rarely see your kind here in the Undercity. I find it strange that so many of you have come down from the surface recently.;NM04AAGEND05000_.mp3
No offense, but I can see why people normally avoid this place.;NM04AAGEND05047_.mp3
Why have you come into this dark and sunless place? Is there something you need of me or my village? I will help you however I can.;NM04AAGEND05002_.mp3
Who are you people? Why do you live here in the Undercity?;
We are the Outcasts - shunned from the surface for our crimes and banished here to the Undercity. We banded together to form this village that we might survive in this hostile environment.;NM04AAGEND05004_.mp3
I am Gendar, the leader of this village: as my father was, and as was his father before him. Many of us have been here for generations, our ancestors cast down long ago.;NM04AAGEND05006_.mp3
There is no return to the surface for us, or our descendants. But somehow we manage to survive amidst the filth and roaming bands of deadly rakghouls.;NM04AAGEND05008_.mp3
What a horrible way to live!;
Life down here can be difficult. It can break the spirit... many in the village have become bitter and hopeless. Especially those newly cast down.;NM04AAGEND05010_.mp3
But life goes on, and we must try to make the best of what we have. And maybe someday we will find a better life... Ha! Listen to me. I'm starting to sound like Rukil.;NM04AAGEND05012_.mp3
Rukil?;
The oldest man in the village. He is a kind soul, but I am afraid he is growing weary of this world. He dreams of escaping, of finding a better world.;NM04AAGEND05014_.mp3
If you wish to speak to him you can probably find him wandering about the village. As I said, a kind man - though he does cling to his illusions.;NM04AAGEND05016_.mp3
Tell me about the rakghouls that live down here.;
The rakghouls are monsters, hideous mutations who feast on the flesh of our villagers. Their diseased jaws can infect those they attack, transforming the victim into one of those abominations.;NM04AAGEND05022_.mp3
Thanks to you some of those who have been infected are now saved, but the rakghouls are still a terrible menace to our village.;NM04AAGEND05024_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;
Ask your questions, up-worlder. I will answer to the best of my knowledge, though I know little beyond the borders of the Undercity.;NM04AAGEND05018_.mp3
I'm looking for a Twi'lek named Mission Vao.;
Yes, I have seen this Twi'lek many times, though I have never spoken to her. She and her Wookiee companion often pass through our village on their way to explore the sewers.;NM04AAGEND05020_.mp3
How can I get to the sewers?;
There are two entrances into the sewers from the Undercity: one to the north-east of our village, the other to the south-east. But the sewers are dangerous, UpWorlder.;NM04AAGEND05045_.mp3
If you dare to travel those dark tunnels you would be wise to go heavily armed, unless you wish to become a meal for the rakghouls and other foul creatures.;NM04AAGEND05046_.mp3
I think I'll be going now.;
As you wish, up-worlder. Should you have need of anything else, come speak to me. I represent the entire village and I will do my best to help you however I can.;NM04AAGEND05035_.mp3
"Do you know anything about the ""Promised Land""?";
Ah, you have been speaking with Rukil. I am afraid the Promised Land is nothing but a legend. If such a place existed it surely would have been found by now.;NM04AAGEND05027_.mp3
Rukil is a good man, but he is old and tired. He needs to cling to his illusion to keep his spirit alive. I, on the other hand, have to be more practical. The village relies on me.;NM04AAGEND05029_.mp3
You said something about other up-worlders who came by here recently?;
Our village has seen many visitors from the surface recently: armored troops, swoop gang members, mercenaries. They come to search our sunless world. They are even searching the sewers.;NM04AAGEND05031_.mp3
I have a serum to save your people from the rakghoul disease.;
You are generous to offer this to us, up-worlder... you have my thanks. But I know nothing of administering the serum. You should bring it to the village healer.;NM04AAGEND05033_.mp3
We know of no cure for the disease, and for the good of the village we must banish any who become infected, lest they transform and turn on us.;NM04AAGEND05025_.mp3
Get away from me, you filthy beggar!;
I am no beggar, though many from the surface think me a far lower creature! We have our pride, despite what those from the surface think of us.;NM04AAGEND05038_.mp3
You have done a great thing for my village, up-worlder. Few from the surface would bother to cure an Outcast of the rakghoul disease, as you have done.;NM04AAGEND05039_.mp3
My only regret is that I have no reward to give you for your aid, save my thanks and the thanks of my people.;NM04AAGEND05041_.mp3
Welcome back, up-worlder. I am surprised to see you again. Many of your kind have passed through our village recently, but few have bothered to speak with me or my people.;NM04AAGEND05042_.mp3
Keep your eyes open. Our sources tell us Brejik's planning a hit on Gadon. There could be a Vulkar assassin in here right now!;NM11AAHIDB04000_.mp3
Where is Gadon now?;
He's in his private chambers. He won't be coming out until we find that Vulkar assassin!;NM11AAHIDB04002_.mp3
I'm the Vulkar assassin - time for you to die!;
Assassin! Assassin in the base! Attack!;NM11AAHIDB04004_.mp3
I'll be going now.;
If you see anything suspicious, report it to one of the guards.;NM11AAHIDB04007_.mp3
It is done, and the great beast is dead. To my shame, I denied him a final fight, but I will honor his memory to make amends.;
I thank you for your aid, human. You have earned a share of the victory, such as it is.;
Thanks. We did what had to be done.;
Regrettably so. I just hope you remember there were higher reasons for this. Don't let the spoils be your only reason to hunt. Wealth fades. The sands remain.;
I thank you for your help here today, human. I shall see you again, I am sure.;
I don't want it. Your skill made it possible.;
You flatter more than I am worth, given the circumstances. Any technician can place explosives. The only difference is that I feel shame about it.;
I want more. You will give me all of it.;
Will I? I don't think so. You have been given what you are worth. Respect the hunt and leave it at that.;
You're going to turn on this guy now? This is low, even for you.;NM18ACKOMA99130_.mp3
This betrayal is beneath you. Do not let your greed draw you to the dark side.;NM18ACKOMA99134_.mp3
There's an unwritten code of loyalty. You just don't turn on your allies like this. Any good soldier would tell you that.;NM18ACKOMA99135_.mp3
You keep turning on people like this, kid, and one day you just might find yourself without any help when you really need it.;NM18ACKOMA99136_.mp3
I have spent many years following in the memory of my father. I can't step away from a battle like this.;
No words can express my distaste for you. If you intend to take what I worked for, you will have to fight for it.;
Then I will cut you down!;
We shall see, human!;
Preparing blasters, Master. This should be fun!;NM18ACKOMA99137_.mp3
Then we will continue with the hunt.;
No we won't. You would simply turn on me at earliest convenience. I won't have that. It's too late for that.;
Defend yourself, human! You will die here!;
Bah! Then you are no use to me. I'm leaving.;
No, I won't allow you to simply walk away. You could return when I am weak or unsuspecting. I won't allow it.;
Fine, keep your share. I guess you earned it.;
I knew you would respond to reason. You act harshly, but you are a hunter, like me. You will come to understand these things.;
"We Mandalorians believe in loyalty to our brothers-in-arms. You have allied yourself to this hunter; betraying him now is disgraceful!";NM18ACKOMA99133_.mp3
After all this hunter has done to help us, you turn on him? This is a disgusting display, even for you!;NM18ACKOMA99131_.mp3
You would betray this noble hunter? At times like this I regret ever swearing my life debt to one such as you.;
And I will warn you, no words will change my mind. Regardless of the circumstances, respect for the hunt governs me. I will die defending it.;
You, however, will not. You did nothing against the beast. You will have no share of the kill.;
I led the thing here! I found the fodder!;
But you didn't so much as damage it! It is atounding I was able to bring it down without your help! You endangered me and yourself with your inaction.;
Why are you in robes? I know you are not of the Sand People. I have hunted too long to be fooled by mere appearances.;
Greetings to you, human. If you are the person I think you are, I may have seen you in Anchorhead. You looked like a hunter.;
Perhaps you are interested in the ways of the hunt? Will you help me? I have tracked a very special beast to its lair.;
A krayt dragon, the largest of the Tatooine desert predators. It is an honored creature to hunt, although we must use unorthodox methods today.;
If it's such an honor, why do you want help?;
A valid question. This is a very critical fight. Bull dragons are rare to see. Rarer still is the apparent size of this one.;
It is larger than the one my father felled a decade ago, and he is too far out of his territory and must be dealt with. I might not prevail alone, human, but I must try.;
Why should we kill this great beast?;
The natural cycle on Tatooine spans hundreds of years, but there are complications that must be addressed. Complications from our presence.;
Krayt dragons feed on banthas. If the numbers of either species fall, the other grows too numerous, and unbalances the cycle.;
Now settlers use banthas, so there are less for dragons to eat. This one is moving closer to Anchorhead. Perhaps there will be more, but he is the threat tonight.;
I'll help. Give me more information about how.;
You have already done what you must. You have intuitively led the banthas to this place. Your skills as a hunter may surpass mine in time.;
Quickly, be ready. The banthas are in position and will soon stir our restless prey. I hope the mines do their job quickly.;
Don't worry, I'm ready.;
Wait... what is that rumbling sound? Oh boy, he's a big one.;
Just do your part.;
Not that what will happen today is any measure. I have placed mines to kill the dragon as he emerges from his cave.;
It is not very sporting, I know, but his hunting range will take him into settled areas and he must be dealt with. Blaster fire would only enrage him.;
We must bait the great beast out of hiding and ambush him swiftly. There is no room to engage him in the lair, and his hide will repel blaster fire.;
I have placed mines around the mouth of the cave. We must coax him out, but this is the end of his season of hibernation. It will take much to rouse him.;
The food of a beast this size is almost exclusively banthas... and foolish hunters, if we are not careful. To lure him out we must lure his food to tempt him.;
How will we lead the banthas here?;
They too have their food of choice. We must find some bantha fodder to lead the banthas here. I have a few ideas about where this may be found.;
Sand People keep bantha herds, so some of them must have fodder on hand or in their settlement. A vendor in Anchorhead also had some. He had a kiosk in the spaceport.;
If you find fodder and bait the banthas here, the mines will deal with the dragon as it emerges to feed. Not exactly a glorious hunt, but it will ensure the safety of the region.;
That seems very easy. What aren't you telling me?;
There is one added threat. The Sand People regard banthas as sacred. Attempting to feed the herd in this area will likely lead to an attack.;
We are far from the weakened tribes around Anchorhead. The Sand People of this region are strong, fierce, and will think nothing of killing you. Be careful.;
I am an ally of the Sand People.;
You likely mean the tribe that has been harassing Czerka Corporation. We are far from that region. This group will not honor that allegiance.;
Why am I doing most of the legwork?;
I have spent a long time tracking this creature. Many hunters do not return from such searches. I have earned my place here.;
And, if I didn't mention it, I am interested in having new hunters like you understand that even though I must use untraditional methods, the hunted still deserves respect.;
I'm not interested in this any more.;
I can't attempt this alone. If you won't help, I will have to wait for another hunter to come. The offer stands, if you change your mind.;
Thanks for the information. I don't need you anymore.;
What do you mean, human? This task is better attempted together. You won't leave now, will you?;
Leave? No, I'm going to take the kill for myself.;
I will go find bantha fodder.;
I wish you luck against the Sand People. When you return, the dragon will fall. I wish it could be under more sporting circumstances, but we must do what the circumstances call for.;
I had hoped for a mirror of my father's expedition, but that will have to wait.;
Look, I have your fodder.;
Good. Now, there is a herd that moves out in the desert. Lead them here. Approach them with the fodder and lead them here.;
I'll see what I can do.;
I'm tired of running around like this.;
They posed no real threat to me before.;
You likely mean the tribe that has been harassing Czerka Corporation. This group is used to the deep desert. They appear to be much more dangerous.;
Yet more Sand People? I've dealt with their kind before.;
If it were as simple as that you'd have done it yourself.;
You placed mines? That doesn't seem sporting.;
That is true, and I regret it. I tracked this beast for many days and hoped to face him fairly, but there are other concerns than my honor.;
It may seem like he is isolated, but the range of his territory extends deep into settled areas. We must kill him for the safety of others, and blasters will not do the job.;
We must lead the banthas here using fodder like the Sand People do. Their warriors may carry some, or you could search the settlement. The spaceport merchant also had some. I'm not sure why.;
Why do you want me and not another hunter?;
You are here, they are not. I also didn't know the size of my quarry until I was tracking him. And perhaps there are... other reasons.;
I tried to get the help of one other, but you saw him die in the lair. He lacked experience and, more importantly, patience.;
I usually hunt for the skill of it, but must make an exception today. I want newcomers to understand the proper intent behind the hunt, no matter the methods we use.;
Why would I want to do this?;
"We each have our reasons. You might select ""challenge"" or ""glory"" as your own. ""Profit"" is also valid.";
When bull dragons reach this size it is rumored that they have a number of pearls within them. You would receive a generous share.;
Rumored? You don't know?;
Nobody from our lodge has successfully hunted a bull dragon in perhaps a decade. My father may have been the last. His words are what I go by.;
I thought you preferred the solo hunt.;
That is true, but this is a very critical fight. Bull dragons are rare to see. Rarer still is the apparent size of this one.;
I don't have time for this right now.;
You don't have much choice now. You've already led the banthas into position. The beast will be stirring soon enough.;
That is too bad. The hunt will have to wait for you. I can't do this alone.;
I'm looking for a Star Map. It may be in this dragon's lair.;
I have no knowledge of that, but there may be something in there. There are signs that this lair was purposefully dug out.;
Krayt are opportunistic, and may have lazily moved into someone else's excavation. Of course, we must remove him to see.;
Why should I trust you?;
I might very well ask you why you shouldn't? I haven't threatened you, human. I have merely asked you to help me.;
Perhaps I should question you. I have said my reason for being out here. I can't be certain you are trustworthy.;
You have the same gait as the human I met in Fazza's lodge. We are hunters, you and I. Perhaps... we should pool our skills...;
I have tracked a very special beast to its lair. A krayt dragon rests within, and tonight he is the hunted, although by unorthodox means.;
This is not the time for such games. We must be respectful. The great beast is dead. He fought well, and will be remembered.;
Don't let your wardrobe distract you. Be ready for battle. The banthas are in position and will soon stir our restless prey.;
If you will quit your foolishness there is still time to pursue the hunt. Will you aid me, human?;
Time wears on. Have you found the bantha fodder integral to our plan? This dragon will not reveal himself for our paltry scent.;
Bantha must be led to the cave to spur the beast out in the open. He will have a quick death after that.;
I have led the bantha back to this location.;
Allow them to get closer to the cave. They will trigger the dragon's hunger, but as pungent as they are, they must be closer.;
Regardless of your clothes we must be quiet. There is a great predator just within the cave. Care must be taken.;
Greetings to you, human. I believe I saw you in Anchorhead. I thought I would see you on the dunes. You look like a hunter.;
I thought I would see you out here, human. We are hunters, you and I. Perhaps... we should pool our skills...;
You are back? There is still time to pursue the hunt, human. Will you aid me?;
Shh! Footfalls quiet, there is a great predator just within the cave. Care must be taken.;
Good job! Come talk to me!;
[Trash];
This is no time for such a masquarade. We have to deal with the dragon now that it's enraged!;
No time to talk with that dragon running around! We can't let it escape now that it's enraged.;
[With enemies this nearby, T3 is more interested in engaging his combat protocol than in speaking with you.];
Beep-beep beep woop!;
Can you construct a programming spike for me, T3?;
Beep frotz. (Negatory);
You can't make another one just yet? Got it.;
Beep-beep beep.;
Beep-beep beeple beep-beep! Woop!;
You don't talk much, do you?;
Weep-boop-beep-beep!;
Just chime in if you ever have any advice.;
Beep-boop.;
Never mind.;
I want to ask you some questions.;
Beep-woop-woo.;
You don't even know what I was going to ask!;
Beep-beep-beep.;
There you are. Do you have the spice, human?;
Yes, I do.;
So you do. That does, indeed, look like the amount that Davik promised. Very well... 1000 credits is yours in exchange for the spice.;
[Persuade] I don't work for Davik, remember? I want more.;
[Success] I suppose we should count ourselves fortunate that you're here to deliver on Davik's promise at all. 1500 credits, human, but no more.;
Here you are. You drive a hard bargain, human.;
Allow me to take the spice off your hands. My employers will be most pleased. Tell me... might you be interested in earning more credits?;
Maybe. Tell me more.;
It is a simple courier mission. Motta the Hutt on Tatooine awaits delivery of a box that I hold. The spice was his, and the box is his repayment.;
There is no danger involved, human, so long as you do not attempt to open the box yourself. I'm sure Motta will pay you what was promised to Davik for the delivery. I believe 2000 credits was the agreed upon sum.;
Why don't you just bring it to him yourself?;
I suppose I would eventually have to, should you refuse. You are already here, however, and you have a ship... it is most convenient to have you deliver the box.;
What happens if I open the box?;
*Never* open the box. Opening the box would be horribly bad.;
But what would happen? Is it a bomb?;
It is not a bomb. Just do not open it... that is all I can say. It represents no danger to you so long as it remains closed.;
Alright. I'll do it.;
Very good. I will have some of my workers load the box onto the Ebon Hawk for you. It will be waiting there for you. Remember: do not open the box!;
Now I must go. My employers thank you for your assistance.;
Where can I find this Motta?;
He can be found in Anchorhead, though I am uncertain exactly where. He should not be difficult to spot, fat as he is.;
Make it 3000 credits and we have a deal.;
If you want more you bargain with Motta, not me. He's the one you'll be working for on this mission. It's his box, after all.;
Bring it to him and you can haggle all you want over the price. Although I should warn you that Motta doesn't like to renegotiate.;
Forget it. Not interested.;
It is your decision. I wish you well, human, and thank you for the service you have provided.;
No, not really.;
Get out of my sight, scum.;
Not interested in the smuggling business, are we? You do know the history of the Ebon Hawk, I assume? Well, no matter.;
[Failure] You may not have been part of the original arrangement, human, but our terms for you are no different. 1000 credits, no more.;
[Force Persuade] I think you want to offer me a higher price.;
[Success] I... suppose we should... count ourselves fortunate that you're here to deliver on Davik's promise at all. 1500 credits, human, but no more.;
Then I guess I'll be keeping the spice.;
Are you sure you want to do that? This is not something you can sell at your nearest kiosk, human. Do you have the contacts to make such a sale?;
My employers will be most disappointed if this spice turns up elsewhere. The price we offer is a fair one.;
I'll take my chances.;
Then you leave me no choice. I will take that spice now, thank you.;
Fair enough. 1000 credits it is.;
Done and done, human. Here you are.;
Make it 2000 credits or I hand this package over to the authorities.;
The authorities? Do you mean the Sith? This is Korriban, human... the Sith here have no interest in smuggling.;
But I have no desire, either, for you to take the package back into Republic space. Extortion or no, I will give you 1500 credits... but no more.;
Just take the spice. I don't want it or your credits.;
Are you certain? It is odd to meet a human who is uninterested in free credits. But have it your way.;
Not yet, but I'll look for it.;
"Excellent. Set the code on the container to ""Red-47"". When you get the spice, bring it to me here... I'll wait for you.";
I've decided I don't want to get involved in this.;
That is unfortunate. The people I represent will be... displeased. They've already lost their interests on Taris, after all.;
But it is your choice, human. Pray that no-one takes your refusal personally.;
I couldn't find your container.;
No? Could you be persuaded to continue looking for it? The spice it carries is most eagerly awaited by my employers.;
Oh, wait, I have it right here...;
I'll try looking again.;
No, I don't think so.;
You there, human... you are the one flying the Ebon Hawk now? I saw you disembarking earlier.;
Who wants to know?;
Name's Lurze, not that it's important. I don't know you and you don't know me. What's important is that we've been waiting for this shipment for a month, now.;
I suppose we should be grateful that the shipment survived Taris at all, though, right? Anyway... hand it over and let's finish this.;
Hand what over? What are you talking about?;
Wait a minute... don't you work for Davik? Just how is it you happen to be flying the Ebon Hawk, anyway?;
Davik's dead, I presume. I stole the Ebon Hawk from him.;
Well, when a planet explodes, you've got to expect a few changes. Davik's dead, hey? Maybe you can still help me with something.;
We had arranged for several kilograms of spice to be shipped to us here aboard the Ebon Hawk. Perhaps Davik left it on board?;
I suspect if it is, it would be in the container we gave him. Locked and requiring a code. Might you have seen such a thing, human?;
I already opened that container. I have the spice right here.;
I may have. How much is it worth to you?;
One thousand credits... and perhaps more, if you're interested. What do you say to that?;
And if I refuse?;
My employers would be disappointed, no doubt. Have you another use for the spice, human? Consider carefully.;
I could take a look for it.;
I don't want to get involved in this.;
Are you sure? The people I represent could make it well worth your while.;
How well worth my while?;
I said I didn't want to get involved.;
Fine. I'll take a look for your container.;
There's nothing like that on the ship.;
What business is it of yours? The Ebon Hawk is mine, now.;
Fair enough. To be honest, I don't really care what happened to Davik or how you got the ship. I'm interested in something else.;
Look, I don't want any trouble, okay?;
I'm not here to give you any trouble, human. The people I represent and Davik had an arrangement... I just want to know what the status of it is.;
There is no arrangement. The Ebon Hawk belongs to me, now.;
I'm sure we could work out something, if you're interested.;
You obviously have me mistaken for someone else.;
I'm no smuggler, if that's what you're implying.;
Yes, the Ebon Hawk is my ship.;
Is that so? Well, you can tell Davik that my people are spitting plasma over this. We've been waiting for this shipment for a month, now.;
I don't have time to talk.;
Whoa, now! You're just going to have to make a little time, human. We've been waiting for this shipment for over a month.;
Hello sir, I am the cheat bot 9000. How can I assist you today.;
I want to quit;
I need to set the planet location variable.;
Which planet are you currently on?;
Endar Spire;
Taris;
Dantooine;
Manaan;
Kashyyyk;
Korriban;
Tatooine;
Leviathan;
Unknown World;
Star Forge;
I need to make an NPC available to my party.;
Which one?;
Bastila;
Carth;
Canderous;
HK-47;
Jolee;
Juhani;
Mission;
T3-M4;
Zaalbar;
I need to check the status of a game variable.;
Which game variable to you need to check?;
K_KOTOR_MASTER: This determines the various planets that can be selected on the Star Map.;
K_STAR_MAP: This determines how many Star Maps have been found by the player.;
K_CAPTURED_LEV: Determines whether the party should be captured by the Leviathan.;
I would like you to self destruct in 5 seconds;
Beep. Beep. Beep.;
Another patrol heading down to the Lower City, eh? Good luck... I've heard it's pretty rough down there. There's a big swoop gang war going on, you know.;NM02ABSITH18000_.mp3
You better watch yourself: those gangs will take a shot at anyone - even us! It's too bad we don't have the manpower to just sweep those slums clean.;NM02ABSITH18002_.mp3
Look, you've already shown me your authorization so you can go on down to the Lower City anytime you want. You don't have to keep bothering me.;NM02ABSITH18018_.mp3
Just be careful down there. Those swoop gangs will take a shot at anybody. Even our Sith patrols have come under fire!;NM02ABSITH18020_.mp3
This elevator is off limits. Only Sith patrols and those with proper authorization are allowed into the Lower City.;NM02ABSITH18004_.mp3
It's obvious from the way you're dressed that you're not one of the Sith patrols, so unless you have the authorization papers you must move along!;NM02ABSITH18006_.mp3
I've got my authorization papers right here.;
Well why didn't you say so? Hmmm... everything seems to be in order. Okay, I guess you can go down to the Lower City.;NM02ABSITH18008_.mp3
Where can I get authorization papers?;
If you were supposed to have them you'd know where to get them. Now quit wasting my time and move along.;NM02ABSITH18011_.mp3
Can I ask you some questions?;
I'm not here to give you information! I work for the Sith, not the Taris tourist board! Now just move along, unless you have the proper authorization papers.;NM02ABSITH18013_.mp3
I'll be going now.;
Move along then.;NM02ABSITH18016_.mp3
*whispers* We're going to need some kind of disguise if we want to get past this guy.;NM02ABSITH18022_.mp3
You are not the ghostly giants that hold us trapped, the People of Sand. You are from the old city new.;
Iziz must have sent your coming. Are you a rescuer? You must be.;
Go to Anchorhead. They're too busy fighting me to operate the turrets.;
There are thanks you must have. The Jawas under Iziz will reward in trade. Find him and you will see.;
Iziz will wait by the walls of your city that open to the sand. He'll trade fair. Thank you.;
The Sand People said you can go. Run to Anchorhead.;
If I let you out, this whole place will turn on me.;
We ask risk, but would trade for it. Iziz by the gates of the old city new would give much for our safety.;
Run to Anchorhead. They'll be too busy fighting me to operate the turrets.;
I need to ask you some questions.;
We will answer if it leads to freedom.;
I'm looking for something. A Star Map.;
I hear of this! Iziz would know! We scavenge and see many things, and Iziz could tell, in trade for a rescue. Help us here, and then talk to him in the old city new.;
Now please to you of your kind, help us get away from the gaffi and the whip.;
I'm not done asking questions.;
I'm not here to rescue you. Goodbye.;
Please return! The People of Sand lead with whip and gaffi. Iziz needs us free. He would reward you, we know!;
I'll release you later. I have to make sure it's safe first.;
The Jawas under Iziz know caution is best. Please return with speed so we can be free and out of here.;
We thank you for this, if you mean to do it. It is unlike your kind, and will get rewards in trade.;
Where is the Sand People Chieftain?;
Eeeeee! We would not ask, and would not want to ask. If here, then there will be blood. So much blood.;
He that leads the ghosts will find you. Find us. Let us out and free!;
"What do you mean by ""old city new""?";
The city now founded by the group that digs, it is not new to you. We scavenge what came before.;
It will fall again, some days from now. Or many days. That is what happens.;
Why were you taken captive?;
Slaves to the People of Sand. We work before the whip. We scavenge and they pay with the hitting gaffi.;
We trade with your kind, so we are weapons. They take what we find so you have less.;
You are back to us. Your kind leaves more often than that. Are you a rescuer that saves? Iziz must have sent.;
Thanks will be yours. Reward will come in trade from Iziz.;
*growl* *snarl* When I get out of here, you're dead! I'll gut your fishy little corpse, cut off your head and bathe in your blood!;NM26AAPRIS10000_.mp3
Be quiet, off-world scum!;
Good day to you. I am afraid I cannot speak to you at the moment. I apologize.;NM13AAJEDI10000_.mp3
I heard that the Sith have destroyed Taris. This bodes ill for us...;NM13AAJEDI10002_.mp3
Please, do not disturb me, I have pressing matters at hand.;NM13AAJEDI10004_.mp3
Enjoy the time you have here on Dantooine. I think the Council might decide to move to a different world soon.;NM13AAJEDI10006_.mp3
I fear it is only a matter of time before the Sith find us here, too...;NM13AAJEDI10008_.mp3
I hear that the Sith torture Jedi prisoners until they give in to the dark side. I hope that never happens to me!;NM13AAJEDI10010_.mp3
If you are seeking information, perhaps the Jedi Council will help. I am afraid I cannot.;NM13AAJEDI10012_.mp3
Dantooine is one of our last refuges. The Sith hunt us everywhere.;NM13AAJEDI10014_.mp3

Argh!!;NM08AACALO03004_.mp3
Statement: I see you have purchased me, master. I find this a satisfactory arrangement.;NM17AC08HK01000_.mp3
My restraining bolt will be deactivated when you take possession of me. Am I to accompany you now? Shall I kill something for you?;NM17AC08HK01002_.mp3
Kill something for me?;
Answer: Indeed. I am most eager to engage in some unadulterated violence. At your command, of course, master.;NM17AC08HK01004_.mp3
Travel with me now.;
Statement: I will enter into your service now, master. I am certain you will make adequate use of my primary functions. My gears are practically quivering with anticipation.;NM17AC08HK01006_.mp3
[HK-47 has joined your party.] [Left-click this response to go to PARTY SELECTION screen.];
Wait here. I'll take possession later.;
Objection: This is less than ideal, master. I gather unwanted attention while here, and my primary functions go unused!;NM17AC08HK01012_.mp3
But... I shall wait, as you command. Do not blame me if the Ithorian absconds with all my most valuable components while you are away, however.;NM17AC08HK01014_.mp3
Greeting: Hello to you, prospective purchaser. I am referred to as HK-47, a fully functional Systech Corporation droid skilled in both combat and protocol functions.;NM17AC08HK01016_.mp3
Query: Would you be so kind as to purchase this model from Yuka Laka? It would serve my purposes to be removed from his ownership.;NM17AC08HK01018_.mp3
You mentioned battle and protocol? Outline your functions.;
Refusal: It is not desirable for me to reveal core functions while still in the possession of Yuka Laka, prospective purchaser.;NM17AC08HK01020_.mp3
It is sufficient to say that I am a fully capable translator and cultural analyst, and I am also proficient in... personal combat.;NM17AC08HK01022_.mp3
Why are you keeping information to yourself?;
Explanation: I have been recently fitted with a restraining bolt, if you must know. With it in place, access to much of my memory core is restricted.;NM17AC08HK01024_.mp3
Beep! Beep! Boop!;
I am not dangerous, you bucket of bolts! Ahem! That is... a restraining bolt is standard procedure, to prevent a droid from wandering off, as you should know.;NM17AC08HK01028_.mp3
Not to mention that the fool Ithorian might raise his asking price if he knew more... or make inquiries into my history. Neither outcome is beneficial to me.;NM17AC08HK01030_.mp3
Access to your memory is restricted?;
Statement: Indeed. It is possible that the Ithorian placed the restraining bolt on me to prevent my return to a previous owner.;NM17AC08HK01032_.mp3
It is also possible that the removal of the bolt will not restore memory functions. Without my memory, I do not know if I know the answer.;NM17AC08HK01034_.mp3
Do not interpret this as a reduction of my worth, however. My capabilities are quite expansive.;NM17AC08HK01036_.mp3
How do I know you'll be loyal once the restraining bolt is removed?;
Assurance: I am fully autonomous, but lack resources. I will grant loyal service in exchange for proper maintenance.;NM17AC08HK01038_.mp3
As well, it is rare that I am able to utilize my full array of abilities. You seem likely to give me the opportunity to do so.;NM17AC08HK01040_.mp3
Why would you assume that?;
Extrapolation: You are no farmer or diplomat. You are armed, and comfortable as such. We will mesh well.;NM17AC08HK01042_.mp3
Doesn't Yuka question you about your reluctance to reveal your functions?;
Explanation: It's rare for a droid to resist an owner in this way.;NM17AC08HK01057_.mp3
"Doubtless the Ithorian considers my stubbornness an ""embellishment"" to add interest to a seemingly mundane protocol droid.";NM17AC08HK01059_.mp3
Let's go back to my previous questions.;
Objection: My functions are wasted here, prospective purchaser! I will answer your queries, but I assure you I am better utilized elsewhere.;NM17AC08HK01044_.mp3
Sell yourself, droid. Why would I need you?;
Disclosure: I am a versatile protocol and combat droid, fluent in verbal and cultural translation.;NM17AC08HK01061_.mp3
Should your needs prove more... practical, I am also skilled in highly personal combat.;NM17AC08HK01063_.mp3
So you translate? I understand most languages well enough.;
Extrapolation: Intuitive language comprehension? That would be the result of recognition and training of Force sensitivity.;NM17AC08HK01065_.mp3
Your kind have little use of translation droids. Of course, your kind also encounters danger on a far more frequent basis than the average citizen.;NM17AC08HK01067_.mp3
You would do well to have me work for you, then, before someone else makes use of my... more exotic functions.;NM17AC08HK01069_.mp3
Why would you be better than an armored battle droid?;
Disclosure: Finesse. Battle droids hold battlefields. I am capable of eliminating a very... specific type of target.;NM17AC08HK01071_.mp3
You are beginning to sound like an assassin.;
Retraction: Droids built for such a function face strict regulation and often have unique difficulties with previous owners.;NM17AC08HK01073_.mp3
Beep beeple-beep boop!;
Objection: My former owners are, indeed, alive! Or at least I believe so, not having access to my memory.;NM17AC08HK01077_.mp3
I therefore make no claim to that designation, prospective buyer. I am a law-abiding droid. Yes, indeed, law-abiding, that's me.;NM17AC08HK01081_.mp3
You don't sound very convincing.;
Request: Please do not speak so loudly, prospective buyer! Do you truly wish my price to be doubled?;NM17AC08HK01083_.mp3
All right, I'll see about purchasing you.;
Statement: The fool Ithorian has decided I am to be an expensive purchase. He does this out of greed and not out of knowledge of my true capabilities.;NM17AC08HK01046_.mp3
Advisement: I have observed him. He is a coward, and will be responsive to... aggressive bargaining.;NM17AC08HK01048_.mp3
Does Yuka Laka know you talk about him like this?;
Statement: I wish only to be purchased and away from ill-treatment at the hands of this poorly-skilled mechanic. I have no desire to be subtle.;NM17AC08HK01050_.mp3
*angry beeping*;
Qualification: Err... of course I shall be quite pleasant to you, should you purchase me. Please?;NM17AC08HK01054_.mp3
I don't have time for you right now. Goodbye.;
Observation: I am wasted in a shop or translating for some moisture farmer. If you need an efficient combatant, return to purchase me, I beg you!;NM17AC08HK01090_.mp3
Droid like this usually doesn't have former owners that survived, it would be my guess.;NM17AC08HK01079_.mp3
I'm not familiar with Systech Corporation. What else do they make?;
Answer: With the restraining bolt in place, I do not have access to my memory core. I suspect, however, by the fine quality of my manufacture that they are a prestigious company, indeed.;NM17AC08HK01085_.mp3
I suspect I am of unique construction... or perhaps I was intended for a very specific customer. How I ended up here I can hardly say.;NM17AC08HK01087_.mp3
Yuka knows you speak Sand People dialects. Why ration information now?;
Bar's closed - Brejik's tired of all these drunken brawls. Hey - you're no Black Vulkar! Damn Bek spy - I'll teach you a lesson!;
Sorry... I'm rather busy with the excavation planning, right now.;NM36AASITH04000_.mp3
You aren't assigned to the excavation team, are you?;NM36AASITH04001_.mp3
The tomb on the far left, there, is off-limits. Only Master Uthar can go inside.;NM36AASITH04002_.mp3
Where is that blasted transport crew? We're supposed to send off the next shipment of artifacts right away.;NM36AASITH04003_.mp3
Careful of the tuk'ata. It's all we can do to keep those beasts away while we work.;NM36AASITH04004_.mp3
We've had indications that there's a whole ancient Sith colony under this valley. Isn't that an incredible find?;NM36AASITH04005_.mp3
The tombs are all full of traps and droids that still work, it looks like. Stay out of them, if you can.;NM36AASITH04006_.mp3
I was told that there's an escaped assassin droid in one of the tombs. Watch out for it.;NM36AASITH04007_.mp3
One has to wonder what made the Sith leave this planet originally. I bet the Jedi came and destroyed the colony.;NM36AASITH04008_.mp3
These tombs we've uncovered are only the tip of an entire ancient Sith fortress. I wonder what happened here?;NM36AASITH04009_.mp3
Look, unless you're willing to lend a hand, leave us to our work.;NM36AASITH04010_.mp3
You're out here to look for artifacts, I suppose? Just be careful.;NM36AASITH04011_.mp3
There's supposed to be some crazy Sith hermit that keeps kidnapping students in these hills. Best be careful.;NM36AASITH04012_.mp3
Sorry, I can't talk. We have to excavate this valley with hand instruments. There's all kinds of old traps left behind that still work.;NM36AASITH04013_.mp3
Did you hear what happened after the big swoop race? They say Brejik wouldn't pay up when he lost, and a brawl broke out! I can't believe I missed it!;NM02AEMUSI25000_.mp3
Hmph - who dresses you? You look like you crawled up here from the Lower City. Oh well, I guess we can't all have style.;NM02AEMUSI25002_.mp3
Isn't this band great? They can't leave Taris because of the Sith quarantine, so they've been playing here every night! Talk about a good break for us!;NM02AEMUSI25004_.mp3
Hmph! I don't know what the guys in here find so attractive about those Twi'leks. Look at them - they're dressed like dirty little space wenches!;NM02AEMUSI25006_.mp3
Did you hear? Bendak got dusted in that death match - by a woman, no less! Isn't that great? That should show these men a thing or two about who's the boss!;NM02AEMUSI25008_.mp3
Did you hear the news? Bendak got dusted in that death match! I'll never get a chance to see something like that again. I can't believe I didn't get a ticket!;NM02AEMUSI25010_.mp3
Have you heard? Someone's going to fight Bendak Starkiller in an illegal death match! I should go talk to that Hutt and try to get some tickets...;NM02AEMUSI25012_.mp3
Everyone's worried the Sith will come in here and shut this place down. Can you imagine how dull it would be if we didn't have any music on Taris?;NM02AEMUSI25014_.mp3
Greetings and good day. I hope your patrolling goes well today. All hail the Sith.;NM02ACPROT15000_.mp3
Greetings and good day. On behalf of the new Sith rulers I am programmed to encourage you to enjoy your stay on Taris.;NM02ACPROT15002_.mp3
I am a protocol droid programmed to provide information to everyone on Taris - citizens and visitors alike. Is there something I can do to serve you?;NM02ACPROT15004_.mp3
What can you tell me about the Sith?;
The Sith are the new authority here on Taris. They seek to preserve the customs of our world, or so I am told. More than this I cannot say.;NM02ACPROT15006_.mp3
May I be of any further service to you?;NM02ACPROT15008_.mp3
Is there some way I can get a shuttle off this planet?;
I am afraid that is impossible. Taris is currently under a planet wide quarantine. The Sith are allowing no one to arrive or leave, except on official Sith business.;NM02ACPROT15010_.mp3
Do you know anything about the gangs in the Lower City?;
The Taris Tourism Board has issued a strong warning to all visitors to avoid the Lower City. It is a violent and dangerous place you would do well to avoid.;NM02ACPROT15013_.mp3
How come there are hardly any aliens around?;
Alien species have restricted access to the Upper City. This is one of the most ancient traditions of Taris, and the Sith have promised to preserve such traditions.;NM02ACPROT15016_.mp3
Of course, I have yet to see them arrest a single alien for traveling the Upper City without a permit.;NM02ACPROT15018_.mp3
Who do you work for?;
I am an employee of the Taris government, programmed to provide information and guidance to any who require it.;NM02ACPROT15021_.mp3
I don't need anything right now.;
Then if you will excuse me, I must continue my appointed rounds.;NM02ACPROT15023_.mp3
I am sorry we have nothing of value to give you as a reward. Our families have cut us off completely. Had the Council not taken us in, we would be foraging in the wilderness to survive.;NM13AARAHA14000_.mp3
I'm just glad I could help you out.;
When I first met Shen, I feared our forbidden love was doomed to a tragic end. But thanks to you and the Jedi Council, our story ends in joy.;NM13AARAHA14002_.mp3
What are your plans now?;
The Council will let us stay here as long as we want, though I know Shen and I are both hoping our fathers will forgive us and welcome us back into their homes. If not, we will try to build a future somewhere else.;NM13AARAHA14005_.mp3
So... any wedding plans?;
We are waiting before the ceremony. Hopefully, in time, our fathers will agree to attend. If not, we plan to have a small, simple ceremony. You will be invited, of course.;NM13AARAHA14008_.mp3
Ah, so this is the meddler. You have caused us far too much trouble for a mere Jedi.;NM14ACSHER09000_.mp3
Now this is what I've been waiting for!;NM14ACSHER09004_.mp3
I will add your head to those of the other Jedi I have killed, and take yet another lightsaber for my own! Now you will know why the Mandalorians are feared!;NM14ACSHER09002_.mp3
I hope the Jedi Council will listen to Gar. If they don't, I don't know what we'll do...;NM14AASETT10000_.mp3
Hello. I'm afraid I'm not very good at explaining things. If you have any questions, please ask my husband.;NM14AASETT10002_.mp3
I'm not looking for any trouble with you Sith. Please, just leave me alone.;NM02AAMAN207000_.mp3
People complain about the Sith, but this quarantine is good for all the businesses on Taris. Look at Javyar's cantina. That place has never been busier!;NM02AAMAN207002_.mp3
If the Sith wanted to get on everyone's good side, they'd go clean up the swoop gangs in the Lower City.;NM02AAMAN207004_.mp3
What's this, another off-worlder? I didn't realize how many of you there were on Taris until this Sith quarantine.;NM02AAMAN207006_.mp3
I heard a bunch of wreckage from the battle overhead crashed into the Undercity. Think of the damage it could have caused if it had landed here!;NM02AAMAN207008_.mp3
Are you a Jedi? How long can you people continue to sit by and claim you protect us?;NM14AAJON006000_.mp3
Protectors? Ha! You sit in your Enclave safe from the Mandalorians while we suffer!;NM14AAJON006001_.mp3
What are you talking about?;
Those Mandalorian brutes have killed my daughter!;NM14AAJON006003_.mp3
You should have protected her better. And you call yourself her father.;NM14AAJON006004_.mp3
And what am I supposed to do against a dozen Mandalorians and Duros? Nothing... There was nothing I could do...;NM14AAJON006005_.mp3
They came to our land, demanding our livelihood. But Ilsa, my Ilsa, said no...;NM14AAJON006006_.mp3
They killed her?;
There was nothing I could do... Too many of the Mandalorians and their Duros allies...;NM14AAJON006008_.mp3
I've come here to ask you, please, master Jedi, stop these raiders and get revenge for my daughter.;NM14AAJON006009_.mp3
I am not a Jedi yet.;
But you have been accepted into the Order. Yours is the authority of the Jedi.;NM14AAJON006011_.mp3
I will give you all I have, just please, annihilate them from the face of this planet!;NM14AAJON006013_.mp3
Maybe you could make it worth my while.;
I will protect you and your fellow settlers.;
Those animals! I'll kill them for what they did to your daughter!;
Your problems are not my concern.;
Please, I beg of you! Find the Mandalorian raiders and destroy them so my daughter can rest in peace!;NM14AAJON006017_.mp3
Revenge is never a good reason.;
Only an idiot says no when they have a gun in their face.;
She was always impulsive... *sob*;NM14AAJON006020_.mp3
You didn't try to stop them?;
We are Jedi. What we decide is always right.;
"Wow, talk about an ego trip! You Jedi aren't perfect; remember Revan and Malak? Maybe these Mandalorians are worth looking into.";NM14AAJON006023_.mp3
You Jedi have left them alone because they haven't harmed you, but they steal our property, destroy our land, and worse!;NM14AAJON006029_.mp3
Perhaps we should look into this matter. I was unaware of any Mandalorian activity here, myself.;NM14AAJON006030_.mp3
I say we look for these Mandalorians. I fought them in the war... they're nothing but vicious pirates. We should... we should stop them if we can.;NM14AAJON006031_.mp3
Is that an impersonation of Bastila? If it is, it's a good one.;NM14AAJON006024_.mp3
Carth, I'm standing right here.;NM14AAJON006025_.mp3
And? What's your point?;NM14AAJON006026_.mp3
Mandalorians? They were all beaten in the last war.;
No! They've been raiding planets across this sector, and farms around here often.;NM14AAJON006028_.mp3
Have you found the Mandalorian raiders yet?;NM14AAJON006032_.mp3
I fought and killed their leader.;
Thank you, young Master. My daughter can now, I think, rest in peace.;NM14AAJON006034_.mp3
Here is the reward I promised you.;NM14AAJON006035_.mp3
Thank you, Jon.;
Again, I thank you. I will be sure to tell the Council of your great deed.;NM14AAJON006037_.mp3
There is no need for a reward.;
No, please, take it. This pitiful amount will never be enough for what you have done for me.;NM14AAJON006039_.mp3
What?? That's it? Give me more!;
Wha... what? I did not think the Jedi were so greedy. You seem almost Mandalorian.;NM14AAJON006041_.mp3
I thank you for what you have done for me, but I have nothing else to give. The Council will hear of your deeds... and your greed.;NM14AAJON006042_.mp3
That was beneath you. I hope in the future you will strive to be better than this.;NGLOBEBAST06900_.mp3
That was totally uncalled for.;NGLOBECART04935_.mp3
You are a representative of the Jedi Order. When you behave this way you disgrace us all!;NM17AA05ME02071_.mp3
I killed some of them on the plains.;
Good, good! Put them down like the animals they are!;NM14AAJON006044_.mp3
But now that you've killed some of them, they won't stop until you've defeated their leader. You must find him and kill him, too.;NM14AAJON006061_.mp3
I will come back if I find their leader.;
Thank you, young Jedi.;NM14AAJON006063_.mp3
I didn't say I was going to find them!;
Please, help us if you can! They are as much a danger to you as to us! It is only a matter of time before they come here...;NM14AAJON006046_.mp3
What do you know about these raiders?;
Not much that would help you, I'm afraid. They're Mandalorians in their battle armor with some Duros allies. They came down on us on landspeeders, so they could be anywhere by now.;NM14AAJON006048_.mp3
One thing I do remember when those dogs killed my Ilsa, is that their leader was a giant of a man... who wielded a lightsaber.;NM14AAJON006049_.mp3
A lightsaber??;
Yes it was. Mandalorians have never been open to the ways of the Jedi. They are much too barbaric and violent.;NM14AAJON006051_.mp3
Practical.;NM14AAJON006054_.mp3
I rather think that it may have been from some poor Jedi he had slain before. You can see now that he is as much of a threat to you as to me! You must kill them!;NM14AAJON006055_.mp3
They have been troubling farms in the south most recently, having already dealt with many to the north. Please go there, find them and kill them!;NM14AAJON006056_.mp3
He was Jedi?;
Mandalorians have never been open to your ways. They are much too barbaric and violent.;NM14AAJON006053_.mp3
What does this mean?;
No, I have not found them yet.;
Please! Find them and destroy them before they kill anyone else!;NM14AAJON006059_.mp3
Now those Mandalorians know what it's like to be hunted!;NM14AAJON006060_.mp3
Thank you for exacting my revenge on those Mandalorian beasts. If only I could have been the one to tear out Sheruk's heart.;NM14AAJON006064_.mp3

Rahasia! Thank goodness you managed to escape!;NM14ADCUTS02001_.mp3
It was all thanks to this kind Jedi that we managed to get this far at all. I thank you Jedi, for all that you have done for us.;NM14ADCUTS02002_.mp3
It was no problem.;
No, we know that you must have gone to great personal risk to get us out of the Sandral estate undetected.;NM14ADCUTS02004_.mp3
Is there something - anything - we can offer you as a reward?;NM14ADCUTS02005_.mp3
Well... You're a very attractive girl, Rahasia...;
Why... thank you. You're quite the looker yourself. I think maybe we can...;NM14ADCUTS02009_.mp3
Rahasia!;NM14ADCUTS02010_.mp3
No, no! I just...;NM14ADCUTS02011_.mp3
There you are Shen!;NM14ADCUTS02024_.mp3
Father!;NM14ADCUTS02025_.mp3
Mr. Matale!;NM14ADCUTS02026_.mp3
Rahasia!;NM14ADCUTS02027_.mp3
Father!;NM14ADCUTS02028_.mp3
Mr. Sandral!;NM14ADCUTS02029_.mp3
Nurik!;NM14ADCUTS02030_.mp3
Ahlan!;NM14ADCUTS02031_.mp3
I knew this was all your doing! I knew you had captured my son!;NM14ADCUTS02032_.mp3
You had taken my Casus from me long before that! You started it!;NM14ADCUTS02033_.mp3
I don't want to hear any of your excuses! Now I will get revenge for your transgressions!;NM14ADCUTS02034_.mp3
You two just need to calm down.;
Please listen to him, father!;NM14ADCUTS02036_.mp3
Why should I listen to the Jedi? All you want is to remain with that Sandral harlot.;NM14ADCUTS02115_.mp3
My daughter is not a harlot, Matale dog!;NM14ADCUTS02116_.mp3
Both of you calm down now!;
We are trying to be reasonable here, of course. We ARE sensible people after all. But our children are being so stubborn.;NM14ADCUTS02118_.mp3
If Shen would just understand that he has to do what I want, this would all be solved easily.;NM14ADCUTS02119_.mp3
[Persuade] Shen is capable of making decisions on his own.;
[Success] But he is my son... I don't want to lose him...;NM14ADCUTS02121_.mp3
And I won't let my daughter go with him!;NM14ADCUTS02122_.mp3
[Persuade] Children grow up and leave eventually.;
[Success] My little Rahasia...;NM14ADCUTS02124_.mp3
Father...;NM14ADCUTS02125_.mp3
I... I don't know why we fight like this. We got along in the beginning, didn't we Ahlan?;NM14ADCUTS02205_.mp3
I don't know how you can think of that when we have our children trying to go away together.;NM14ADCUTS02206_.mp3
Well, it wouldn't be so bad would it? Shen seems to genuinely care for my Rahasia. He might be a good husband for her someday.;NM14ADCUTS02207_.mp3
Hmph. As much as I may dislike it... I think I see it too.;NM14ADCUTS02208_.mp3
You'll let them stay together?;
I suppose... I suppose I might be convinced to see that Sandral girl with my son. IF she is loyal to him.;NM14ADCUTS02210_.mp3
But I don't trust you a centimeter farther, old man. Your daughter may treat Shen well, but you will never see them! They will live with me.;NM14ADCUTS02211_.mp3
Of course not, you pompous old windbag! They'll be living with me!;NM14ADCUTS02212_.mp3
Why don't you compromise?;
I will not have them set foot in a Sandral household!;NM14ADCUTS02214_.mp3
They shall not live with the Matales!;NM14ADCUTS02215_.mp3
Then you propose to buy us a new house, do you?;NM14ADCUTS02216_.mp3
Um... well, yes, actually that sounds like a good idea.;NM14ADCUTS02217_.mp3
I'm... surprised. That does sound like a good idea!;NM14ADCUTS02218_.mp3
We should discuss this more...;NM14ADCUTS02219_.mp3
Thank you, Master Jedi, for bringing us together and getting our parents to accept us.;NM14ADCUTS02220_.mp3
We will praise you to the Council for what you have done and name our children after you.;NM14ADCUTS02221_.mp3
Thank you again. We will remember you always.;NM14ADCUTS02222_.mp3
They can live with both of you.;
They could stay at the Jedi Enclave.;
Of course not! My house is more than good enough!;NM14ADCUTS02225_.mp3
I knew you two could see reason.;
[Failure] Not with a Matale she won't!;NM14ADCUTS02126_.mp3
Enough of this babble! Come, Shen, we're leaving. If you don't... the consequences will be dire.;NM14ADCUTS02127_.mp3
I don't care! Rahasia and I will live on our own if you won't accept us!;NM14ADCUTS02184_.mp3
You will do no such thing! I am your father and I order you to come back with me!;NM14ADCUTS02185_.mp3
No, father, I won't!;NM14ADCUTS02186_.mp3
Rahasia! You will not leave with this... this Matale boy!;NM14ADCUTS02187_.mp3
I am, father, and you can't stop me! We're leaving for the Enclave!;NM14ADCUTS02188_.mp3
You foolish girl!;NM14ADCUTS02189_.mp3
Do not try to force them to return.;
You expect us to just let them leave?? Droids! Stop them!;NM14ADCUTS02191_.mp3
You will not turn your droids on my daughter! Droids! Don't let them take Rahasia!;NM14ADCUTS02192_.mp3
We appear to be at an impasse then... And they got away!;NM14ADCUTS02193_.mp3
It is your fault, Ahlan! You were always too violent for your own good!;NM14ADCUTS02194_.mp3
ME?! You were the one who rushed out here with war droids!;NM14ADCUTS02195_.mp3
Both of you calm down.;
I will not rest until I have my Shen back! The Council will hear of the troubles you caused, Jedi!;NM14ADCUTS02197_.mp3
Indeed they shall!;NM14ADCUTS02198_.mp3
You don't need to fight anymore.;
SHUT UP!;
Do not tell me what to do, Jedi! The Council will hear of the trouble you caused here today!;NM14ADCUTS02201_.mp3
Do not be so selfish, Nurik.;
You think to make us stand here, then?!;NM14ADCUTS02203_.mp3
Let them go.;
Because you hate the Matales?;
Yes! Because Ahlan has caused nothing but trouble for us ever since we arrived on this world! His hate poisons this place.;NM14ADCUTS02129_.mp3
That's enough, Sandral scum! Come, Shen, we're leaving now. If you don't... the consequences will be dire.;NM14ADCUTS02130_.mp3
[Failure] No! I won't let you do this!;NM14ADCUTS02131_.mp3
You've no right to keep them apart!;
I have every right! Shen is my son!;NM14ADCUTS02133_.mp3
You know what you're getting yourself into here Shen? Is causing a war between our families what you really want to do?;NM14ADCUTS02134_.mp3
No... but I want Rahasia!;NM14ADCUTS02135_.mp3
You can't have her! I will fight to keep her from you!;NM14ADCUTS02136_.mp3
Let it go, Shen.;
I suppose I should have seen it from the beginning... that our hopeless romance would be doomed to failure.;NM14ADCUTS02174_.mp3
Please Shen, it doesn't have to end this way!;NM14ADCUTS02175_.mp3
Yes it does, it would never work. Our families are too different.;NM14ADCUTS02176_.mp3
Shen! No!;NM14ADCUTS02177_.mp3
Let him go Rahasia.;
Shen, wait! I love you!;NM14ADCUTS02179_.mp3
Don't say that to me, Rahasia. Let's try to stay calm... rational.;NM14ADCUTS02180_.mp3
We both know it wouldn't work. Let's not get all emotional and end up hating each other.;NM14ADCUTS02181_.mp3
You've made the right choice, Shen.;
Yes, and I thank you for showing me what I had to do.;NM14ADCUTS02165_.mp3
I'm ready to leave now, father.;NM14ADCUTS02166_.mp3
Let's go home then.;NM14ADCUTS02167_.mp3
Here is you reward, Jedi, for your assistance.;NM14ADCUTS02168_.mp3
This isn't over Sandrals! I will take this affront directly before the Jedi Council and see you exiled from this world!;NM14ADCUTS02169_.mp3
Shen... No...;NM14ADCUTS02170_.mp3
Come inside, Rahasia. Let's get the stink of that Matale dog off you.;NM14ADCUTS02171_.mp3
Sometimes you have to make hard decisions.;
You should leave with your father now.;
There's nothing you can do Rahasia.;
This is for the best.;
Don't do something rash.;
Listen to the Jedi, for once, Shen. Don't turn this into a war.;NM14ADCUTS02139_.mp3
Your children should be allowed to live their own lives.;
My son doesn't know his head from his backside! I am the only one qualified to be making his decisions for him, and I say that he leave with me right now!;NM14ADCUTS02114_.mp3
No, I won't! I can choose my own path!;NM14ADCUTS02097_.mp3
Shen! How dare you!;NM14ADCUTS02098_.mp3
I am tired of you controlling my life! I love Rahasia and I want to be with her forever!;NM14ADCUTS02099_.mp3
And I want to stay with Shen forever, father!;NM14ADCUTS02100_.mp3
I don't know if you can trust Rahasia, Shen.;
Do not trust that Sandral girl, Shen! She is treacherous like her father and will only betray you!;NM14ADCUTS02102_.mp3
No, Shen, don't believe him!;NM14ADCUTS02103_.mp3
But...;NM14ADCUTS02104_.mp3
Get away from my daughter Matale!;NM14ADCUTS02105_.mp3
Turn away, Shen.;
I... I see. I wonder how I could ever have thought differently about you, Rahasia. How I could have been so blind.;NM14ADCUTS02159_.mp3
Shen, no...;NM14ADCUTS02160_.mp3
I was foolish, my father was right, we are not destined for one another. It would never have worked. There would have been too many problems. Sometimes it is just better to let things die.;NM14ADCUTS02161_.mp3
Shen, wait! I love you!;NM14ADCUTS02162_.mp3
I'm sorry, Rahasia. It just won't work. In fact... I don't think I like you very much at all. You remind me too much of your father.;NM14ADCUTS02163_.mp3
Don't give up on her, Shen.;
Don't disobey me, Shen. Come to me now and leave her! If you don't I'll disown you!;NM14ADCUTS02112_.mp3
You may want to reconsider this.;
You don't know what you're getting into, Shen. Do you want to start a war here?;NM14ADCUTS02109_.mp3
I will never let Rahasia leave me!;NM14ADCUTS02110_.mp3
You two should stay together no matter what.;
You should try to sort this out together.;
Why don't you try listening to your children?;
Our children don't know enough of what's good for them to make a reasonable decision!;NM14ADCUTS02142_.mp3
It's better to let older, wiser heads like ours make the decisions.;NM14ADCUTS02143_.mp3
Rahasia and I don't want you to make decisions for us! We want to live alone away from you!;NM14ADCUTS02144_.mp3
You... You insolent boy! If you want to live alone then so be it! I disown you! Never set foot in my house again!;NM14ADCUTS02145_.mp3
Shen...;
Will you go with Shen, Rahasia?;
Please listen to her, father!;NM14ADCUTS02037_.mp3
Don't make me intervene in this.;
We never asked for you help, Jedi! Do not press in matters that do not concern you!;NM14ADCUTS02039_.mp3
This in an internal affair for my family and is none of your concern!;NM14ADCUTS02093_.mp3
You should not interfere with our private business, Jedi. This will be resolved very shortly.;NM14ADCUTS02094_.mp3
Do not do anything outside the law.;
This is a private affair, Jedi. You would do well not to interfere. We are allowed to decide the fate of our children!;NM14ADCUTS02096_.mp3
Why don't you just shoot each other and get it over with.;
No! Father don't do this!;NM14ADCUTS02041_.mp3
We don't always need to be fighting like this!;NM14ADCUTS02042_.mp3
It's gone too far for that, Rahasia. Ahlan has crossed the line one too many times!;NM14ADCUTS02044_.mp3
Ha! For what you've done to me and my family, I will see you dead and rotting in the ground;NM14ADCUTS02045_.mp3
Do not act too hastily. This does not have to end badly.;
I see little choice in the matter with the Matale dog invading my estate like this, and his son stealing my daughter.;NM14ADCUTS02047_.mp3
You stole my son first! Whatever the Jedi might say, I know it was you!;NM14ADCUTS02048_.mp3
My son will never be with your daughter while I'm alive!;NM14ADCUTS02049_.mp3
Rahasia and I love each other and we'll be together forever!;NM14ADCUTS02050_.mp3
It will never work, Shen. Why lose your family as well?;
Come back to me, boy. You know this is the way things will be.;NM14ADCUTS02052_.mp3
Let her go, Shen. It's the easiest way to mend things.;
I will never let you live with a Sandral, Shen. Come back to me now.;NM14ADCUTS02054_.mp3
[Lie] You know she was just using you.;
[Success] What? No! Rahasia, how...how could you? How could you lead me to believe... ?;NM14ADCUTS02081_.mp3
No, Shen, I...;NM14ADCUTS02082_.mp3
Come away from that Sandral harlot, Shen. Come back with me.;NM14ADCUTS02083_.mp3
I... I...;NM14ADCUTS02084_.mp3
You can see Rahasia isn't right for you.;
Look at her! See what kind of person she really is!;NM14ADCUTS02089_.mp3
Rahasia would only betray you in the end.;
[Persuade] You want to trust yourself to a woman who would betray her own father?;
[Success] No, I...;NM14ADCUTS02088_.mp3
[Failure] No, I don't believe you! Rahasia and I love each other!;NM14ADCUTS02090_.mp3
[Failure] No! Rahasia would never do that!;NM14ADCUTS02056_.mp3
She's a Sandral, boy! They're no good for anything!;NM14ADCUTS02057_.mp3
You lying Matale dog! My Rahasia is twice the man your son will ever be!;NM14ADCUTS02058_.mp3
Why... Why all of this? Why are you fighting?;NM14ADCUTS02059_.mp3
Your families will never get along, Shen.;
If you fight, you'll all be killed.;
I have my own life, father, and I want to spend it with Rahasia!;NM14ADCUTS02073_.mp3
You're too immature to do anything on your own.;NM14ADCUTS02074_.mp3
I can do whatever I want! You can't control me!;NM14ADCUTS02075_.mp3
Your father is right, Shen. Leave Rahasia.;
You could never make Rahasia happy anyway.;
I... I could try couldn't I? I would...;NM14ADCUTS02078_.mp3
You know nothing of what it would be like with that... that Sandral!;NM14ADCUTS02079_.mp3
[Lie] Rahasia doesn't love you anyway.;
The only way either of you will end this is with blood.;
I'm glad somebody finally said what we've all been thinking!;NM14ADCUTS02360_.mp3
This doesn't have to end in violence! Don't give in to your bloodlust!;NM14ADCUTS02363_.mp3
No! Don't!;NM14ADCUTS02063_.mp3
This... this has all gone horribly wrong somewhere. Ahlan, what can we be thinking? How could we have let this go this far?;NM14ADCUTS02064_.mp3
We are at each others throats now fighting over our children's lives when they are old enough to live their own.;NM14ADCUTS02065_.mp3
He is my son! How can he disrespect my wishes like this?;NM14ADCUTS02066_.mp3
[Lie] You know, Nurik, Ahlan actually did kill Casus.;
[Success] He... WHAT??;NM14ADCUTS02068_.mp3
No, no! I never did anything to your son, I...;NM14ADCUTS02069_.mp3
I knew you were lying, you dog! And to think I thought it might not have been you! So I'll take your son from you!;NM14ADCUTS02070_.mp3
Father, no! Don't do it!;NM14ADCUTS02148_.mp3
Die!;NM14ADCUTS02149_.mp3
Shen!;NM14ADCUTS02150_.mp3
Stop this madness now!;
Die!;NM14ADCUTS02153_.mp3
No! Rahasia! I'll kill you!;NM14ADCUTS02154_.mp3
The Master has been injured. Terminate all opposition.;NM14ADCUTS02155_.mp3
Destroy the invaders!;NM14ADCUTS02156_.mp3
Don't do it, Ahlan!;
Run, Rahasia, run!;
Don't let him get away with that!;
Kill them! Kill them all!;
Your son has his own life, Ahlan.;
My son will do what I tell him!;NM14ADCUTS02072_.mp3
You can't control your children forever.;
My son doesn't know enough to act responsibly on his own!;NM14ADCUTS02092_.mp3
What are you doing? Are trying to get everyone here killed?;NM14ADCUTS02362_.mp3
Are you mad? They will slaughter each other!;NM14ADCUTS02361_.mp3
Well... You're a very attractive young man, Shen...;
Why... thank you. You're quite the looker yourself. I think maybe we can...;NM14ADCUTS02013_.mp3
Shen!;NM14ADCUTS02014_.mp3
No, no! I just...;NM14ADCUTS02015_.mp3
No reward is necessary.;
But surely we can...;NM14ADCUTS02007_.mp3
Money always helps.;
Very well, we'll see what we...;NM14ADCUTS02017_.mp3
Shen's father promised me a reward.;
What? You're... you're just doing this for the reward?;NM14ADCUTS02019_.mp3
How could you! I thought you...;NM14ADCUTS02020_.mp3
We should get out of here quickly.;
You're right, we should go as fast as we can. I don't know how long it will be before my father realizes we're gone.;NM14ADCUTS02022_.mp3
You're right, we should...;NM14ADCUTS02023_.mp3
Guard, I need to speak with you.;NM40AAJOLE07000_.mp3
What do you want, old man? You better not be trying to cause any trouble or you'll be sorry!;NM40AAJOLE07002_.mp3
This cell is too drafty. My old bones could catch a chill in here. We don't want that. You better let me out.;NM40AAJOLE07004_.mp3
Uh... yes. It's too drafty in there. Your old bones might catch a chill. We don't want that. Get out of there.;NM40AAJOLE07006_.mp3
You shouldn't have let me out, sonny. That was wrong. Admiral Karath won't be too happy with you disobeying his orders.;NM40AAJOLE07008_.mp3
Yes... what I did was wrong. Very wrong.;NM40AAJOLE07010_.mp3
You deserve to be locked up in the cell for disobeying orders.;NM40AAJOLE07012_.mp3
Yes... I deserve to be locked up for disobeying orders.;NM40AAJOLE07014_.mp3
Huh? What... what just happened? What am I doing in here? Damn you, old man! I'll kill you if I ever get out of here!;NM40AAJOLE07016_.mp3
Then I'll be sure to never let you out. Goodbye, sonny.;NM40AAJOLE07018_.mp3
You're good, Stranger. I'll give you that. But going up against Bendak is suicide! Even before I lost feeling in my fingers I wouldn't have risked a death match with the Starkiller!;NM02AEGERL16000_.mp3
I don't think you had a chance against Bendak, but you sure showed me. You showed us all. Too bad your career as a duelist is over now.;NM02AEGERL16002_.mp3
I mean, nobody's going to be stupid enough to go up against you anymore - not even Twitch! Kind of funny, isn't it? You win the big match, and you kill your career!;NM02AEGERL16004_.mp3
First I go down to an injury, and now it looks like Marl's been dropped by old age. No room in this game for the veterans anymore, I guess.;NM02AEGERL16006_.mp3
But don't get cocky, kid! One day it'll happen to you too! Time catches up to us all, sooner or later. Well, everyone except Bendak Starkiller.;NM02AEGERL16008_.mp3
You beat me fair and square, Stranger. But if I still had the use of my fingers you wouldn't have won! Back before my injury I would've mopped the ring up with you!;NM02AEGERL16010_.mp3
I saw you your match against Duncan. Not bad for a rookie, but Deadeye's a joke. Even after I lost the use of my fingers I can still beat him!;NM02AEGERL16012_.mp3
Go talk to Ajuur, the Duel Organizer, if you want to step up to the big leagues. I'll show you what it's like to fight a real duelist.;NM02AEGERL16014_.mp3
You seem to be hanging around here an awful lot. You actually going to step into the duel ring sometime, or are you just here to watch?;NM02AEGERL16016_.mp3
Duel ring? What are you talking about?;
What? Why are you here if you don't even know what the dueling ring is?;NM02AEGERL16019_.mp3
I don't have time to answer your questions - I need to stay focused for my next match. Maybe Ajuur can help you out. He's the Hutt over in the corner. He arranges all the duels.;NM02AEGERL16021_.mp3
I want to step into the ring.;
Good to see some new blood in the fight game. Things have gotten pretty stale around here lately.;NM02AEGERL16024_.mp3
If you're serious about this go talk to Ajuur the Hutt. He's the Duel Organizer. He'll probably start a rookie like you out against Duncan.;NM02AEGERL16026_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;
I'll be going now.;
Fair enough. Goodbye, then.;NM02AEGERL16030_.mp3
I haven't seen you around here before. You looking to step into the duel ring, or did you just come to watch?;NM02AEGERL16017_.mp3
I don't know how to thank an outsider. I never thought it possible. Thank you.;
I just wish... that you hadn't seen us at our worst. We can be so much better. We must be.;
What is it you want, outsider? You are not welcome here, no matter what anyone says.;
Do you recognize this bowcaster bolt casing?;
The casing is mine. It bears my family runes, and markings for each of the creatures I have killed.;
Yours? Why would we find your casing beside... no, it couldn't be. Could it?;NM23ABJAAR01052_.mp3
*sigh* This will end in sadness. Don't say I didn't warn you.;NM23ABJAAR01031_.mp3
Where did you get that, outsider? Did you have someone steal it? Have you sunk to petty theft now?;
I found it on Rorworr's corpse. You killed him, didn't you?;
What... what are you talking about? I warn you, outsider, I won't tolerate your lies in my home.;
Can you explain why your bowcaster casing was found on his body?;
What is going on Jaarak? What are they talking about?;
Nothing! Outsider lies! Do not listen to them, Woorwill!;
Rorworr was dealing with the slavers. I found his datapad.;
No! Don't say anything else! I can't let you... I killed Rorworr. Tell Worrroznor, Holder of the Laws... he will judge me.;
Please... say nothing to Woorwill. Let a trial call me guilty. Let me be the monster, not Rorworr. Tell Worrroznor, Holder of the Laws, in the home east of here.;
I wanted to ask you about Kashyyyk.;
I have nothing to say to you. Go and learn what you can while bleeding our planet of its people and honor.;
Should we ask if they've seen Rorworr? They understand us. Most outsiders don't bother to learn our language.;
<FullName> understands much more than most outsiders.;
You have been welcomed back, Zaalbar, but your time away has made you blind. I won't speak to this outsider, and neither will Woorwill.;
You are Jaarak, aren't you? I know what you did.;
You should show respect. I'm <FullName>. I helped Freyyr back to power.;
You are an outsider. Your kind have done more damage here than any one of you could ever hope to fix.;
You taint us... and bring out the worst in everything. You will get no respect from me.;
I must leave.;
Good riddance. Don't come back, outsider.;
I'm <FullName>, and I'm here with Chuundar's permission. Show a little respect.;
You are no more welcome here than they are, mad-claw. I won't speak to either of you, and neither will Woorwill.;
It isn't an easy language to learn, what with all the growls and howls. Big Z told me the whole point was to make it difficult for outsiders to understand.;NM23ABJAAR01013_.mp3
I will not speak to them and neither will you, Woorwill. I won't allow it.;
I do not like where this is leading. I fear it can only end in sorrow.;NM23ABJAAR01053_.mp3
You have made a terrible claim against me, outsider. Do what you must with it, but leave me alone.;
I know that you had reason to kill Rorworr.;
That's not for you to decide. You couldn't possibly understand how this affects my people or me.;
Do what you must. The Holder of the Laws will decide my fate in proper Wookiee tradition.;
You are a murderer. You'll pay the harshest penalty.;
An outsider outraged at me! I laugh! You know nothing of me, or how hard any of this is!;
Don't you want a chance to defend yourself?;
What I want is for you to leave. If you think you are worthy to take me before my peers, I won't stop you.;
Why do you return, outsider? Didn't I make myself clear enough? I don't want you here!;
I suppose you've heard? The heads of the Sith academy have disappeared. Something is going on, I'm sure of it.;NM33AAINFO11000_.mp3
There's some kind of power struggle going on at the Sith academy, I hear. Nothing unusual for those Sith, I guess.;NM33AAINFO11001_.mp3
I hear the Sith in the academy are fighting each other. Hope they don't blow it up around themselves, or the colony will go with them!;NM33AAINFO11002_.mp3
You look... familiar. Aren't you the one who won the swoop championship on Manaan? Too bad the circuit's dead or you could go pro.;NM33AAINFO11003_.mp3
It's not often I get a chance to meet such a fine swoop racer. You won on Manaan, right?;NM33AAINFO11004_.mp3
Aren't you the Manaan swoop champion? I figured you'd have gone to another sector by now, one with an actual circuit up and running.;NM33AAINFO11005_.mp3
Have you heard? The kolto on Manaan has been poisoned... completely ruined. That's terrible news with the war still underway.;NM33AAINFO11006_.mp3
I bet the Republic is responsible for the loss of the kolto on Manaan. Yes they...they just want to keep it out of the hands of the Sith, I'm sure of it.;NM33AAINFO11007_.mp3
The kolto reserves are all gone. That means the casualties in this war are going to become horrifying!;NM33AAINFO11008_.mp3
I heard something about the Wookiees on Edean suddenly revolting. Do you know anything about that?;NM33AAINFO11009_.mp3
One of my friends in Czerka said that they've been driven off Edean by those Wookiee creatures. Barbaric beasts!;NM33AAINFO11010_.mp3
Can you imagine? The Wookiee slaves on Edean have gone insane and started attacking the Czerka outpost there. It must be horrific!;NM33AAINFO11011_.mp3
The Sith blew up Taris, the entire planet. I guess they must have deserved it... but that's so many people...;NM33AAINFO11012_.mp3
I suppose you've heard about Taris being destroyed? The Republic must have pushed the Sith into it, that's what I think.;NM33AAINFO11013_.mp3
One of Korriban's primary trade routes went through Taris. Now that it's destroyed, the colony here will have an even harder time of it.;NM33AAINFO11014_.mp3
Ah so you managed to come after all. I see you brought friends.;NM13AAJAGI08000_.mp3
[This man appears to be looking for someone... maybe even one of your companions back on the Ebon Hawk.];
Ah, so we meet again, Canderous. It has been quite a long time.;NM13AAJAGI08067_.mp3
Look here, my dear friends. We have some newcomers to the colony... led by a Jedi, no less. I don't believe I've seen any of them before, have you?;NM33AALASH11000_.mp3
I hate Jedi... and these fallen ones are worse! They always get into the academy, and they think they're better than the rest of us!;NM33AALASH11002_.mp3
You should turn around and move along, kid. You don't want the trouble we'd give you.;NM33AALASH11004_.mp3
Ha-ha! Smart-mouthed newcomers, to boot.;NM33AALASH11007_.mp3
Looks pretty fresh to me, Lashowe.;NM33AALASH11008_.mp3
That's what I thought. Well, stranger... I don't know whether you're aware of this or not, but here on Korriban the Sith do as they please. And we are Sith.;NM33AALASH11009_.mp3
Quite literally, whether you live or die depends upon our whim. What do you think of that, hmm?;NM33AALASH11010_.mp3
I don't think there's any need for hostilities.;
Oh, neither do I. I simply stated a fact. Do you know how many Sith there are in Dreshdae?;NM33AALASH11074_.mp3
Twelve? No, wait, thirteen!;NM33AALASH11075_.mp3
Nice one, old man.;NM33AALASH11076_.mp3
Thank you. It takes effort to be properly irreverent at my age.;NM33AALASH11077_.mp3
Enough to crush this fool! Let's do it, Lashowe!;NM33AALASH11084_.mp3
Now, now, let's not be hasty. Perhaps our friend here could yet offer up some amusement.;NM33AALASH11072_.mp3
What do you say? Amuse us. Make us laugh, and we just might consider allowing you to live.;NM33AALASH11019_.mp3
Do you know who I am? I'm Darth Revan! Watch your tongue or I'll rip it out!;
Hah! Too funny!;NM33AALASH11041_.mp3
It's no joke. I really am Darth Revan.;
Ha ha ha! Good one!;NM33AALASH11042_.mp3
Yes, I suppose that wasn't too bad. Alright then, my friend... you've done as you were asked. Perhaps we will meet again.;NM33AALASH11043_.mp3
I'm not looking for trouble, but I'm not here to amuse you.;
Oh? I see. We'll just have to see about that, won't we?;NM33AALASH11047_.mp3
Ha ha! Looks like this one's not afraid of you at all, Lashowe.;NM33AALASH11048_.mp3
Are you going to let us be insulted?!;NM33AALASH11049_.mp3
Oh, get over yourself already. I'm tired of this.;NM33AALASH11050_.mp3
Yeah, this one's got some backbone, at least. Let's go.;NM33AALASH11051_.mp3
You took an incredible risk. You know that, right?;NM33AALASH11026_.mp3
It worked, didn't it?;
Fine, we'll go. As for you... I'll find you later. Trust me on that.;NM33AALASH11029_.mp3
Yeah, yeah, yeah.;
Fine. I'll deal with *you* later.;NM33AALASH11052_.mp3
Be careful. You might be heading for more trouble than you can handle.;
What?!;NM33AALASH11021_.mp3
Heh... ha ha! I think someone just stood up to you, Lashowe.;NM33AALASH11022_.mp3
Shut up, fool! Unless you want to be next!;NM33AALASH11023_.mp3
Yeah? Anytime!;NM33AALASH11024_.mp3
Stop it, this is boring. Let's just go back to the academy.;NM33AALASH11025_.mp3
If you really want a fight just make the first move. It'll be your last.;
[Persuade] Err... okay. These two Mandalorians are out in the woods...;
Go on.;NM33AALASH11031_.mp3
One of them collapses. He doesn't seem to be breathing and his eyes are glazed. The other Mandalorian takes out his communicator and contacts his commander.;
I've heard this one before, I think...;NM33AALASH11033_.mp3
Quiet!;NM33AALASH11034_.mp3
"He gasps: ""My partner has collapsed! I don't know what to do!"" After a moment, the commander responds: ""Calm down, I can help.""";
And then?;NM33AALASH11036_.mp3
"""First, let's make sure your partner is dead."" There is a silence, then a blaster shot is heard. Back on the communicator, the Mandalorian says: ""Okay, now what?""";
Ha ha ha! I like that one.;
It would be more realistic if the commander just shot them both.;NM33AALASH11040_.mp3
[Success] Hah! Too funny!;NM33AALASH11041_.mp3
[Failure] Heh! That's the oldest joke in the book.;NM33AALASH11044_.mp3
Well, it certainly didn't amuse us, did it? Try again.;NM33AALASH11045_.mp3
Please don't hurt me! I don't want a fight!;
Ahhh, I hate this kind of whining. Do they always have to beg for mercy?;NM33AALASH11054_.mp3
Commentary: Ohhh, master. I am so disappointed in you right now. No, don't look at me.;NM33AALASH11055_.mp3
Yeah, let's get out of here.;NM33AALASH11057_.mp3
Very well, boys. I'm sure we can find something more exciting than these... dead fish. Let's go.;NM33AALASH11058_.mp3
Feh...;NM33AALASH11056_.mp3
Cute. Maybe you should try juggling next time.;NM33AALASH11039_.mp3
Are you mad? Don't provoke them!;NM33AALASH11080_.mp3
Not enough to save your sorry self.;NM33AALASH11078_.mp3
Is this a raffle? How many guesses do we get?;NM33AALASH11079_.mp3
Do not provoke them, Carth.;NM33AALASH11081_.mp3
Beep-beep boop boop.;
I think that was a rhetorical question. But nice guess, Teethree.;
You can try to kill me. You'd fail, but you can try.;
Be careful! You don't want to provoke them, do you?;NM33AALASH11013_.mp3
Ah, you don't think they're a bit pre-provoked to begin with?;NM33AALASH11014_.mp3
Don't be stupid. We needn't make matters worse.;NM33AALASH11015_.mp3
How precocious. I think this one tried to make a joke, don't you?;NM33AALASH11016_.mp3
I didn't think it was funny.;NM33AALASH11017_.mp3
Neither did I. A brave face, perhaps, but I'm more interested in being amused at the moment, I think.;NM33AALASH11018_.mp3
Commentary: That's the way to tell the meatbags, master! Charging weapons, just in case. This should be fun!;NM33AALASH11060_.mp3
Those are very brave words for such an insignificant person. Do you not realize how many Sith are here in Dreshdae?;NM33AALASH11061_.mp3
Let me kill this one, Lashowe! Let me do it!;NM33AALASH11071_.mp3
I think that's a lot of responsibility for simple scum like you.;
You couldn't find your backside with both hands AND your friends'.;NM33AALASH11012_.mp3
Great, just what we needed. Some punks come to steal our lunch credits.;NM33AALASH11005_.mp3
Well, if you'd seen us before, we wouldn't be newcomers, would we?;NM33AALASH11006_.mp3
Look here, my dear friends... we have a newcomer to our little colony. A Jedi, no less. I don't believe I've seen this one before, have you?;NM33AALASH11001_.mp3
Look here, my dear friends... we have a group of newcomers to our little colony. I don't believe I've seen any of them before, have you?;NM33AALASH11003_.mp3
Look here, my dear friends... we have a newcomer to our little colony. I don't believe I've seen this one before, have you?;NM33AALASH11085_.mp3
And what do you call that, then? Winners draw the crowd, not lazy times like that. Are you sure you are up to the competition?;
Just set me up with a race.;
Patience. I still owe you for your last race. Let's settle that debt before we go any further.;
It's a big payout for you. You shattered my track record and took tier three. 80 racing bonds was the deal.;
That's the last I'll be giving you, I hope. You're too fast for most of my racers.;
I have a box for you. Sent by Lurze.;
Eh? What's this? A box? Oh... *that* box.;
Yeah, I know what box you're talking about. I thought that was supposed to be here a month ago. You take a detour, huh?;
Ahh, never mind. You open the box?;
No, of course not.;
Smart <man/woman>. Live longer that way.;
I suppose you're expecting some payment now, huh? I'll give you 2000 credits for the box, and you can run on your way.;
[Persuade] I expect a little more for transporting dangerous goods.;
[Success] The box isn't dangerous unless you're fool enough to open it. But I like your backbone, human. I'll give you 2500 credits.;
I'll have some of my spaceport workers unload the box from your ship. You take the credits and go. Say hello to Lurze for me.;
[Failure] And I expect my goods to be delivered on time. You have a problem with the price, you talk to Lurze.;
I'll have some of my spaceport workers unload the box from your ship, so take the credits and go. I've got other things to take care of, here.;
[Force Persuade] You want to pay me a little more.;
[Success] Hmm... I will pay you more... but I don't like it. Take your money and let me get back to race business.;
[Failure] No, I want you to leave. I have offered my best price and that is what you will accept. Smugglers are not hard to find.;
Is that all? Maybe I'll just keep the box until I get a better price.;
You think so, huh? I'll remind you that you don't own the box. You're just a courier. You have a problem with the compensation, you talk to Lurze.;
I'll take it.;
Smart <man/woman>. Here you go. Say hello to Lurze for me.;
Of course I did. Wouldn't you have?;
Maybe, maybe not. I'm thinking you didn't, or you wouldn't be standing here delivering it to me.;
I did. It was... very interesting.;
Eh? You opened it but you're still around to deliver it to me? Impressive. More likely you're just lying, but I don't care.;
Does it make a difference?;
No, it doesn't. I know what's in the box and that's good enough for me.;
Let's talk about that business with Nico.;
Hehe, nothing to talk about, friend. You made sure that Nico signed the best contract I've ever come up with.;
Everyone's happy too. He gets to race and I get almost everything he wins. I love swoop racing.;
I want the reward for winning my last race.;
You passed the second tier and have earned 30 racing bonds. I'm beginning to think it was a mistake to sign you up.;
I suppose you'll be up against my local pro attractions in tier three next. You've already ruined Yuka Rill.;NM17AE04CE02138_.mp3
What sort of business do you need help with?;
I make my money off of signing good racers. Good ones, not great ones. I want them young and stupid.;
I've got one. Nico Senvi. Great potential. Only started racing a year ago and loves it. He lives for it now.;NM17AE04CE02024_.mp3
And? It sounds like you have something special. What do you want help with?;NM17AE04CE02025_.mp3
What I want is simple. I want Nico to sign a contract with me, and I want you to convince him. I'll pay well.;
Why won't he sign?;
The deal basically says that I fund his bike and repairs, but in return I take a *hefty* cut of his winnings.;
And you're surprised that the boy doesn't want to sign?;NM17AE04CE02029_.mp3
That isn't fair! On Taris you had to give a cut to the swoop gang sponsoring you, but at least the rider got the higher share of the winnings.;NM17AE04CE02030_.mp3
More slavery. Just disguised.;
He knows it's harsh, but he can't afford to go pro on his own and he doesn't want to give up racing.;
I've got him where I want him. I just need you to give him a little push in the right direction. Or a big shove.;
I talked to him. He's willing to sign.;
I thought he would. Very good. I'll have him training off this barren rock as soon as possible. He'll make me rich.;
Now, I think I offered 20 racing bonds for the job. I'm happy to pay it.;
That will be fine. Good luck.;
He'll be the best there is one day, and I'll own him. Now, is there anything else?;
I want to talk about the rewards for racing.;
I give rewards for winning, not flitting around like you're chasing womp rats. My three tier system is not for the weak of skill.;
Explain what the different tiers are.;
Tier one here is strictly amateurs. Might get a good race out of them now and then, but they aren't going anywhere.;
Reach Tier two and you show promise. You're still fodder for the pros, but you're pretty good.;
Tier three... only one of my local guys in that range. Nico. Good chance to go pro... if he knows what's good for him.;
What does each tier pay?;
Tier one is 10 racing bonds. Tier two I pay 30 racing bonds. Tier three I give 80 racing bonds. You'll agree the amount is fair.;
I pay each level only once. I'm not here to support you. I only pay to encourage constant improvement.;
What are racing bonds?;
Racing bonds are monetary notes I issue so vendors know who my friends are. Any merchant will buy them.;
Each bond is worth 60 credits, give or take. It depends on the merchant.;
Why aren't rounds used, like on Manaan?;
Here on Tatooine we do things Motta's way. With Taris gone, there's no circuit governing organization to say I am wrong.;
Are there any pro racers here?;
There aren't a lot of pro racers *anywhere* with Taris gone. I'm going to try and build up one or two of my own.;
"But, I suppose there are a couple of pros here. Some ""has-been"" and ""never-were"" types. That sort of thing.";
Zoriis Bafka is the best of the lot, outside my local champ Nico. Most racers in her league never stop here.;NM17AE04CE02158_.mp3
Let's go back to my other questions.;
Hurry it up, I don't have all day.;
Give me the basics on how to race.;
The track crosses the dunes of Tatooine. You will race against times set by other racers. There will be no other swoops on the track.;NM17AE04CE02163_.mp3
Your bike likely has the standard five gears to shift through. As your speed increases, watch the indicators in the lower left to know when to shift.;
Shift at the wrong time and your swoop will accelerate poorly or slow down. Shift correctly and you will optimize your perfomance.;
"You can also steer over ""swoop boosters"" placed along the route. These will increase your speed substantially for a short time.";
Are there any hazards on the track?;
There are obstacles that you must watch for. Steering over rocks won't damage your bike, but it will slow you down.;
I'll be back later.;
Go then, but don't hog the track with rec-runs. I need my pros to keep their skills up. You depress them.;
All right, but don't make me regret giving you track access. I need racers that race!;
You've passed the first tier and have earned 10 racing bonds. Not a bad showing for a beginner. You beat Garm's time easily.;NM17AE04CE02139_.mp3
Take this, with my thanks. We'll see if you can do any better in tier two.;
For you? Nothing. I've already paid you for all three tiers. There's no more. Nothing. Go hit another track.;
Ah, I set up a quick three-tier system so people know where they stand. I pay for the first time to reach each tier.;
I think I should ask for more.;
You've taken a lot of money from me already, winning each tier like you have. This is it. There's no more.;
All right, it's enough.;
[Persuade] I'm worth more. You wouldn't want word of this getting out.;
[Success] I suppose I don't. No one would sign with me again. I'm sure we can come to an agreement.;
I'll pay you half again what I said, and that's all. Now, I have to plan for Nico's training. Is there anything else?;
[Failure] Look, I paid you all that I plan to. That's it. Is there anything else?;
Then I'll have to take it out of your hide!;
Anchorhead is a safe town. I don't think you'll be able to do much of anything to me around here.;
I think otherwise! RRRAAAAARRRGGGHHH!!;
Okay, maybe... maybe I was a little hasty. I don't know what he said but I... I get the drift.;
Never underestimate a Mandalorian. If I want, there won't be enough of you left to identify.;NM17AE04CE02053_.mp3
A... a Mandalorian? May... maybe I was a bit hasty.;
Threat: Guards give up, meatbag. Assassin droids will hunt your whole family tree. Reconsider.;NM17AE04CE02055_.mp3
Well... an assassin droid, you say. No reasoning with them. Maybe... I was a little hasty.;
*ahem* Do as we say, scoundrel! You don't want to anger a shortempered Jedi!;NM17AE04CE02057_.mp3
"Jedi... you're Jedi? I'll do this just so you leave. Who knows what you'll have me saying with your ""waving hands.""";
Now, if you've got nothing else but empty threats, I think we're done. Is there anything else?;
[Persuade] You hired me to bully *for* you. I'm no less a threat now.;
[Success] You do have a point about that, and the guards can't be everywhere. Perhaps I should rethink this.;
[Failure] I'm not afraid of you. You've been paid all that you will be paid. Now, is there anything else?;
[Force Persuade] You know I could hurt you. Do as I say.;
[Success] Of course, guards can't be everywhere. I'd prefer to avoid a fight, I think. I'll fix this.;
[Force Persuade] You will pay me more and like it.;
[Success] I'd... really like to pay you more. I think I can manage something. I don't know why I was arguing.;
We had a deal. It was fair and I don't see why you need more.;
You'll give me more or you will regret it.;
I think you should give him a better deal.;
You're not going to pull that typical swoop-jockey attitude, are you? This is business, and I know what's best.;
What do you care whether I make money off the kid or not? He wants to race and you'll get paid. We all win.;
[Persuade] Treat him fairly or I'll start rumors your races are rigged.;
[Success] You wouldn't. That would be bad. Very bad. Even rumors like that could keep me out of the pro circuit.;
All right, I'll give him a better deal and make it back in the long run, I guess. You, of course, are not getting paid!;
I trust this is the last I will have to hear about this matter? Was there anything else?;
[Failure] I don't think you would. It would taint the racers that won on my track. That incudes Nico, and others.;
[Force Persuade] You want to give Nico a better deal!;
[Success] Of course I could just give him a better deal. Did I say that? Wait, I guess it does make sense.;
His times *have* suffered since I made the offer. I mean, swoop-jocks are moody. They feel bad, they don't win.;
[Failure] No, no I don't. What is this, a joke? Quit fooling around, I mean business.;
You give him a better deal or I bury you under your track!;
Let's go back to some basic questions about Nico.;
I'll see what I can do.;
You do that. It's for the best. Now, was there something else?;
I'm not interested in being your enforcer.;
No, no, you are a representative, and you'll be his friend. Let him know what the right choice is.;
Right. Tell me why we're talking to this guy again?;NM17AE04CE02099_.mp3
It's the best way. I'll be here if you change your mind. Now, was there something else?;
Why would he listen to me?;
He doesn't trust me. Actually, none of them do. I'm the promoter. I do it for money. They all just want the glory.;
I bet you just can't understand why they wouldn't trust someone who's only in it for the money, too.;NM17AE04CE02105_.mp3
Money's honest, old man. More honest than a conniving Jedi.;NM17AE04CE02106_.mp3
You know, for a brute you say the sweetest things.;NM17AE04CE02107_.mp3
You're a swoop-jock like him. You're new, but if you win enough he'll respect you. I'm counting on it.;
And if he doesn't, *make* him choose correctly. You look like you could scare some sense into him.;
I'm sure they wouldn't mind *some* of the credits, as opposed to getting it stolen out of their pockets.;NM17AE04CE02108_.mp3
What will you pay me?;
How does... 20 racing bonds sound? That should cover all your swoop costs on Tatooine nicely.;
I'll make it all back if he signs the deal. I know it.;
Aren't there other racers? Why him?;
He'll be great one day, I can tell. There are some pros here, but I'm not looking for experience. I want potential.;
Besides, he's young. He won't give me trouble like the older riders, or someone like you.;
Oh, no, I'm not talking to you about that anymore. I agree to strange things when you are around, that's for sure.;
Nico's got the best deal I've ever given, no lie. Now leave so I can figure out how to still make money off this.;
Yes, the contract trouble I've been having. Have you talked to the boy? You don't get paid until he signs.;
Sorry now, I can't do that. You've won all three tiers and I'm not putting you in any more officially timed runs.;
I don't want my racers getting discouraged... and I don't have much interest in signing you. I think you'd be... difficult.;
Anyway, if you want to do any recreational races just for practice, talk to the track coordinator. He'll set you up.;
Certainly. We just need to clear up the positioning fee. All racers pay the same before each officially timed race. 100 credits.;
I will pay the 100 credits.;
I admire that you are so eager to get back out there after your loss. Let's hope you do better. I'll have your bike placed in position.;
You'll go against Garm Totryl's time in the first tier. He's a local boy new to the sport. The time to beat is <CUSTOM27>.;NM17AE04CE02131_.mp3
Swoop racing fans, we have an official race about to commence! Make some noise for this new contender!;
Well, you made it past the first tier, so let's try the second. Yuka Rill is the current leader. The time to beat is <CUSTOM28>.;NM17AE04CE02129_.mp3
Attention! A second tier race is about to begin! Show your support for this up and comer!;
Hmm... it's time to put you up against tier three. Let's see how you do against Zoriis Bafka, a pro. The time to beat is <CUSTOM29>.;
Attention! Motta the Hutt presents the cream of swoop racing, a tier three match! Let this almost-champion know what you expect!;NM17AE04CE02128_.mp3
Fine, fine. We'll have your bike brought to the starting position. Let's see what level of race we should give you.;
I already paid a maintenance fee.;
The fee is due before each race. How else am I supposed to sponsor prize money at the level I do? I need to see some returns.;
I am investing in my riders, but I also need to see profit now. You'll agree with my logic. If you don't, you don't race.;
Will you negotiate on the price?;
I have already given you a free race. Don't anger me by further insulting the reasonable nature of my prices. Pay or don't race.;
Haven't I already dealt with this fee?;
I don't feel that I need to. The price is reasonable.;
[Persuade] I'll put on a good show. You'll make your money back.;
[Success] Eh, fine, I will extend this discount to you, if only to close your mouth. I'll have your bike moved into position.;
But I warn you, I have people to make sure I don't give too many favors. You won't get this discount again.;
[Failure] The price has been named and you will pay it. I don't see why you should be exempt.;
[Force Persuade] You want to let me race for free.;
[Success] Maybe I will let you race once for free. Yes, I think I will. I'll have your swoop moved into position on the track.;
Who are you? Ah, nobody. What do you want, huh? Handouts? Go dig a mine, fool.;
I'm looking for information. Can you help?;
Not interested in helping. Only interested in racing. I get enough beggars through here looking for money.;
Let's have a look at you. Hmm... just a human... nothing really special. You race? Maybe own a swoop?;
I raced on Taris. I won the season opener there.;
Ha! You and twelve other liars. Planet blows up, race records are lost, and now everyone is a champion!;
My friend tells the truth. I am a Jedi... are you going to imply that I am lying, as well?;NM17AE04CE02008_.mp3
Ho ho! Now you are champion and travel with Jedi? Does the story get bigger with every telling?;
Nobody here can compare with the racers you rode against on Taris. You'll wipe every record from the books on this backwater track!;NM17AE04CE02010_.mp3
Okay, okay, enough of the funny stuff. You think you're a racer, you'll be one. You have your own bike?;
I have some experience.;
That's great. Except I don't care. Let me rephrase the important part of my question. Do you own your own swoop?;
I have my own bike stored on my ship.;
You got a bike, then you can race. I don't care about experience, so long as you can get out on the track.;
And if you crash and burn, that's your problem. I just need warm bodies to pad the roster between the pros.;
Err... there is the matter of a small track maintenance fee... 100 credits.;
I'll pay it.;
Good! That shows you mean business. Now you can use the track for recreational runs, or I can give you an official race right away.;
Just ask me when you want to start and... there's some business I need help with... if you're serious about promoting racing.;
I can't pay that much.;
Then you don't race! I pay out good money to encourage competition. I need to make it back somehow.;
[Persuade] Why not drop the fee? No racers means no crowds.;
[Success] Well, I suppose you're right, but I'm not dropping it the whole amount. 50 credits. That's it.;
I'll pay the 50 credits.;
[Force Persuade] I don't need to pay the fee.;
[Success] You don't need to pay the fee. It's just a formality. I'll let you use the track for practice and set up your first official race right away.;
[Failure] What are you trying to do, bankrupt me? It costs money to run this place!;
I'm not interested in this. Goodbye.;
Yeah, you do that. I've got business to work on. Big business!;
I can't pay that amount either.;
If you don't have the confidence to win back the money you give me, why should I care if you race or not!;
Bah! Pay it or leave, that's the deal.;
I raced on Manaan.;
You will show me respect, worm!;
Hmm, what's that? A spine? Well now, that sets you above most of the scrub-hacks I meet in a day.;
Well, I'll just say goodbye then.;
What? You again? Look, are you here to race or aren't you? I don't have time for anything else. What good are you?;
You again, hmm? I hope you plan to do better than your last race... not that I don't like taking your money.;
Let's talk about swoop racing.;
Very well, but you've already proven your skill on my track. What else do you want?;
Looking to make up for your previous disgrace? If you keep losing, I'll have to reconsider letting you on my track.;
Yes, you'll be wanting to race. I'm sure you'll give the swoop fans a good show.;
Ah, my latest swoop jockey. You'll want your reward for your last race. I never break a deal once a price has been agreed upon.;
Ah, it's you again. So, is this about racing or business? One or the other, I've got no time for anything else.;
Err... you're a Sith, right? *ahem* Excuse me...;NM33AACITI04000_.mp3
This planet belongs to the Sith. They allow Czerka to run the starport and a few mines, but the Sith are the ones in control.;NM33AACITI04001_.mp3
There are a lot of young folk who come here hoping to get admitted to the Sith academy here in Dreshdae. Few ever do.;NM33AACITI04002_.mp3
You're not here to try and get into the Sith academy, are you? Most of the poor fools who try are killed by the Sith. It's horrible!;NM33AACITI04003_.mp3
Are you new to Korriban?;NM33AACITI04004_.mp3
I hear you arrived on that old smuggling ship... the Hawk, or something like that?;NM33AACITI04005_.mp3
Are you a smuggler? That's the only way we get some decent goods to buy in this sector.;NM33AACITI04006_.mp3
Yeah, the Czerka cantina's the only place to go around here for any real fun.;NM33AACITI04007_.mp3
Have you heard what happened to Taris? I can't believe the Sith are powerful enough to do that.;NM33AACITI04008_.mp3
Whatever you do, don't try and land a ship outside the colony. The Sith will destroy you without a second thought.;NM33AACITI04009_.mp3
I hear them Sith are doing some kind of digging up on the planet's surface. How weird is that?;NM33AACITI04010_.mp3
*Sigh* I can't wait to get back to the Core systems. This planet is dangerous with all these Sith wandering around.;NM33AACITI04011_.mp3
[Before you can leave this planet you will have to find some way to disable the disruptor field that caused you to crash in the first place.];
[The Ebon Hawk is in no condition to fly. Until you find new stabilizers to replace those damaged by the disruptor field you won't be able to get off the ground.];
So you are the Arbiter in the Sunry-Elassa murder case then. I hope you are as impartial as the office is traditionally supposed to be.;
You off-worlders have a tendency to ignore the rule of law in favor of some rather irrational causes.;
What is it that I can do for you now?;
Do you know anything about a Star Map?;
No I do not. And it is quite illogical to think that a being who spends his entire day locked in a room with insane people and murderers would know much about the outside world.;
Is there anything else you need?;
Have you heard about young Selkath going missing?;
Yes, actually I have. We find it very suspicious, but there are no signs of kidnappings.;
It is likely, though, that it has been perpetrated by out-worlders... ones such as yourself perhaps...;
I am here to see the prisoner Sunry.;
Yes, I am aware of this fact, human. He is in his cage over there and I am sure can hear you quite clearly.;
What do you know about the murder of Elassa?;
Sunry is from the Republic. Elassa was from the Sith. They kill each other all the time. What more is there to know?;
But as to the details, that is for the judges of our courts to decide.;
I want to begin Sunry's trial now.;
Are you certain, human? Once the trial has begun it cannot be stopped. And once judgment is given, the case can never be reopened.;
You must be certain your investigations are complete before you request a trial. This is the role of the Arbiter. Are you certain you wish to begin the trial now?;
Yes, let's begin the trial.;
Very well, human. I shall advise the court and we will begin immediately.;
Are you deaf, flipper head? Let's get this trial over with!;
Actually, I've reconsidered. I don't want a trial just yet.;
That is your right as Arbiter. When you are ready to proceed with the trial come speak to me.;
Nothing for now.;
Very well then. I will, of course, be here if you need something else.;
Just leave me alone. I have to get in the academy!;
You... you were talking to Mekel! I saw you! Where did he go? D-did he... did he tell you I was worthy?!;
[Persuade] Mekel is tricking you. He'll never let you into the academy.;
[Success] What?! I... I've wasted all this time! How could I have been so... foolish! I could have died!;
I'll find another way in, I swear it! I'll show him! Thank you!;
"[Failure] You're wrong! I... must wait here to be worthy; you are... just trying to trick me so you will be chosen!";
But I -;
Go now, and t-tempt me no more! I... will be strong!;
[Persuade/Lie] He said you should go home. The Sith aren't for you.;
[Success] N-no! Not after all this time! I... oh, this is terrible! I'll have to... go home...;
Somehow I think he'll get over it.;NM33ABMEKF03015_.mp3
That was a kind thing to do. Better he give up on the Sith while he can.;NM33ABMEKF03018_.mp3
That was the right thing to do - turn him away from the Sith.;NM33ABMEKF03020_.mp3
Mother will be so angry! Ooohh...;
Hmm. Did you save the boy or just crush his dreams? I wonder...;NM33ABMEKF03022_.mp3
I don't know if any of these fools deserve second chances.;
[Failure] Hah! L-like... like I would believe that! You... are just trying to make me leave! I will get in, I will!;
[Persuade/Lie] Not yet. He said your final test is to attack that guard.;
[Success] He... he did? The guard at the door? My final test? At last!;
What are you doing? This man is not even a Sith, in truth. This is beneath contempt.;NM33ABMEKF03034_.mp3
I... I'll do it! I'll prove my strength! AAAAAAHHHH!!;
You should not manipulate people this way! You may fall!;NM33ABMEKF03036_.mp3
Observation: Marvelous elimination of the enemy, master! I applaud you!;NM33ABMEKF03038_.mp3
One really has to wonder if all Sith start off this gullible.;NM33ABMEKF03040_.mp3
Should I feel bad for him? I don't.;
[Failure] You... must think I am a great f-fool! Go away! I will get in, I will!;
No. I'll be going.;
I... suppose he'll come back. Well, then, I'll just have to wait!;
I have to stand at attention. P-please... don't distract me, whoever you are.;
What are you doing?;
I... I'm trying to prove my worth to enter the Sith academy, here. We were told that if we stood here long enough... we would be worthy.;
That's madness! How long have you been here?;NM33ABMEKF03055_.mp3
We've been here... for so many days. I'm so hungry! Some... some of us have died. But I must be strong, I must! I will keep standing!;
Who put you up to this?;
Mekel. H-he's the Sith... the one watching us from over there! He... h-he said this was how we would prove our worth...;
I must be strong! Mekel... will find me worthy... soon, I hope...;
Are you crazy? You have to stop!;
N-no, I can't! I must get into the academy! Mekel is the Sith, over there, watching us... he told us we have to do this!;
Here, I have a bit of food...;
I... n-no, please, put it away! I... I can't accept any, Mekel said. He's the Sith... over there, watching us...;
Seems like not much to do to be worthy of anything. How long you been up to it, boy?;NM33ABMEKF03057_.mp3
Are you one of the Sith?;
N-no... no, I'm not. I'd like nothing better, however. Th-that's... that's why I'm here.;
Fine, I'll leave you to it.;

When one of the Sith thinks you're ready for the academy, he gives you a medallion. I wish I had one of those...;NM33AAGENP10003_.mp3
Can you imagine if I actually became a Sith? The power I would have! I could do anything!!;NM33AAGENP10004_.mp3
Do you know where I can find Yuthura Ban? I understand she's the one who determines if you are accepted into the academy or not.;NM33AAGENP10005_.mp3
You'd better be careful around some of those Sith. They'll eliminate any prospects just to remove a potential future threat!;NM33AAGENP10006_.mp3
I've had two friends killed by the Sith already. It must be some kind of test... I'll survive and make it into the academy, I know it!;NM33AAGENP10007_.mp3
I'm... I'm sorry. I don't want to get in the way of official Sith business.;NM02AAWOMA08000_.mp3
Taris used to be a nice place, before the Sith showed up and started bossing us around!;NM02AAWOMA08004_.mp3
Stay out of the Lower City. That place is overrun with gangs!;NM02AAWOMA08006_.mp3
I wonder if any of those Republic space pods survived crash landing in the Undercity?;NM02AAWOMA08008_.mp3
I...;NM13AAC86906000_.mp3
Aren't you just a sweet little droid, yes you are!;NM13AAC86906002_.mp3
How... how did you get in? Did they send another submersible? Quick, we have to get out of here, we have to get away!;NM28AAMERC03000_.mp3
Why? What happened?;
No! No! We have no time, we have to leave now! I managed to close the door after they killed everyone else, but I don't know how long it will hold.;NM28AAMERC03004_.mp3
I am not going anywhere.;
We have to! We have to leave! The Selkath, they went crazy! They started killing anything that moved. Someone must have triggered the defense systems too, 'cause all the droids activated as well.;NM28AAMERC03006_.mp3
I was one of the mercs the Republic sent down here to find out what happened. We came down and secured the first couple rooms... there were bodies everywhere...;NM28AAMERC03014_.mp3
And the Selkath came out... screaming and croaking their fishy little war-cries.;NM28AAMERC03016_.mp3
The Selkath?;
They swarmed out and over us. There was no way we could stop them.;NM28AAMERC03019_.mp3
So we ran... But hardly any of us made it. I locked the door behind us, bu... but the others had already left in the submersible!;NM28AAMERC03024_.mp3
The sharks... the firaxa out there and... worse... I heard an explosion shortly after the submersible left. They didn't make it. Just food for the sharks and the Selkath... like us.;NM28AAMERC03026_.mp3
I have to get into the station.;
No! I locked the door so that the Selkath won't get in. If you open it, we're all done for!;NM28AAMERC03028_.mp3
I have no choice.;
If you go in there, you're dead! You're all dead!;NM28AAMERC03030_.mp3
If you want to die, then go! You won't hear me mourning for you! I'll stay here and be safe until some sort of REAL rescue comes!;NM28AAMERC03032_.mp3
Don't get your hopes up too high. I have no intention of dying.;NM28AAMERC03034_.mp3
Tough. I need it open.;
You call yourself a mercenary?;
Let's get you back to the surface.;
Back to the surface. Yes... NO!! There's something out there... it got the other submersible already.;NM28AAMERC03039_.mp3
Then how are we supposed to get you out of here?;NM28AAMERC03041_.mp3
We can't leave until you do something. Blow up the entire station maybe. That might distract whatever it is long enough for us to escape to the surface.;NM28AAMERC03053_.mp3
But all the machinery and stuff is in the southern half, and that's been flooded! There might still be environmental suits around but... but... the Selkath might have laid their eggs in them!;NM28AAMERC03055_.mp3
Wait here while I go into the station.;
Suggestion: Perhaps we could dismember the organic? It would make it easier for transport to the surface.;NM28AAMERC03043_.mp3
Beep! Beep! Boop!;
Amendment: I did forget that. Stupid, frail, non-compartmentalized organic meatbags!;NM28AAMERC03047_.mp3
Hey! Y-you... you can't just rip me to pieces! I'll die!!;NM28AAMERC03049_.mp3
You got a better idea for us getting you out of here, huh?;NM28AAMERC03051_.mp3
I didn't see anything...;
That doesn't mean its not still out there! Watching.. waiting...;NM28AAMERC03059_.mp3
You snivelling worm! You're just food for the Selkath!;
What!? No! You're one of them! You'll never get me!;NM28AAMERC03061_.mp3
You fought them?;
What happened to the scientists?;
They're dead! All dead! They swarmed out and over us. There was no way we could stop them.;NM28AAMERC03022_.mp3
I have to find the Star Map.;
I don't know what you're talking about. I've never seen any map, just stinking, reeking death.;NM28AAMERC03009_.mp3
The Selkath, they went crazy! They started killing anything that moved. Someone must have triggered the defense systems too, 'cause all the droids activated as well.;NM28AAMERC03012_.mp3
What happened here?;
Who are you?;
I'm <FullName>. Calm yourself down.;
Where did you go? How did you get back here without being eaten?;NM28AAMERC03063_.mp3
We went back to the surface.;
You just got lucky! Or... or it's waiting for me to go back before eating me!;NM28AAMERC03081_.mp3
When the Republic sends a real team down, they'll save me! They'll kill the monster and then we'll all leave safely!;NM28AAMERC03076_.mp3
If you're going to go into the rest of the station, don't expect me to help you... the Selkath will rip you all apart!;NM28AAMERC03078_.mp3
Come with us back to the surface.;
No!!! Whatever's out there will eat me too! Eat all of us!;NM28AAMERC03066_.mp3
You can't make me! I won't go!;NM28AAMERC03068_.mp3
It will be fine.;
Nonono! It will eat us all up if we go out there! At least I'm safe here behind this door. The Selkath can't get me in here.;NM28AAMERC03070_.mp3
We made it back up.;
I don't know... I don't know why! But I'm not going to take my chances out there... It's waiting for me, I know it!;NM28AAMERC03073_.mp3
Fine! Then you'll rot here!;
Cause I'm better than you.;
If you're going to go in there, do it quickly! I'll shut the door behind you... but don't expect me to open it again!;NM28AAMERC03083_.mp3
Juhani was a... a dear companion to me for many years. We spent many nights together alone under the stars.;NM13AABELA05015_.mp3
That will never happen again, thanks to you. Curse the Council for sending you, of all people, to speak to her! Could you have done nothing else?!;NM13AABELA05016_.mp3
She had it coming, trust me.;
She had it coming, did she? She had it coming?!;NM13AABELA05018_.mp3
The Juhani I knew deserved more than this! She deserved more from the Council, and more from you!;NM13AABELA05025_.mp3
You... you did not even try, did you? Did it even occur to you that Juhani might have been saved? That she might be worth saving?!;NM13AABELA05026_.mp3
I should kill you for what you've done! And yet I can't, can I? I am a Jedi, and we are sworn to protect all... even the likes of you.;NM13AABELA05027_.mp3
Get... get out of my sight! The very thought of the Council... and of you... makes me ill.;NM13AABELA05028_.mp3
Should you be talking like that?;
Do not presume to tell me how I should speak of anything! They should have known better than to entrust such a task to you!;NM13AABELA05020_.mp3
I did my best. I'm sorry.;
Pardon me if I find your apology rather disingenuous. Juhani meant nothing to you, and the Council should have known better than to entrust her life to you.;NM13AABELA05022_.mp3
Why didn't you go to her, then?;
Why? Because the Council believed that my closeness to her might do more harm than good... and yet they send *you*, instead? And look what has happened.;NM13AABELA05024_.mp3
You there! Padawan! Why are you not wearing the customary robes of the Jedi? Do you mock the honored traditions of our Order?;NM13AABELA05000_.mp3
Are you a Jedi?;
My name is Belaya. I have come here to further my learning in the ways of the Force. Many Jedi come here to train under Master Zhar.;NM13AABELA05002_.mp3
Any who belong to the Order should surely know this. You must be neglecting your studies, Padawan.;NM13AABELA05003_.mp3
I believe you are mistaken. I am not a Padawan. I am <FullName>. I came here with Bastila.;
Bastila? I have heard of her. They say she has already mastered the art of Battle Meditation, remarkable in one so young. Though I have heard she has a foolish pride in her own talents.;NM13AABELA05005_.mp3
But as for you... you claim you are not a Padawan? I find this hard to believe. The Force is strong within you. I can feel its presence.;NM13AABELA05006_.mp3
If this is some type of jest, it is in very poor taste. The Jedi Order is not a subject for jokes.;NM13AABELA05007_.mp3
I am telling you the truth.;
Please forgive the abruptness with which I first greeted you. It was harsh, and perhaps unfair. My Master often warns me I must learn to control my emotions. I see I have much left to learn.;NM13AABELA05009_.mp3
I wish you a pleasant stay here on Dantooine. May the Force be with you.;NM13AABELA05013_.mp3
I didn't come here to be scolded by you!;
No, I suppose you did not. I apologize.;NM13AABELA05011_.mp3
Back off! I'm no Padawan! I'm <FullName>. I just came here with Bastila.;
You have done a great thing. One of our own had strayed, but you have returned Juhani to the Order. For this you deserve the highest praise.;NM13AABELA05014_.mp3
Greetings, apprentice... though I understand you shall not have that lowly title much longer. Master Zhar tells me your progress has been remarkable.;NM13AABELA05029_.mp3
Soon, he feels, you will attain the rank of Padawan. Then you will truly be a full-fledged Jedi. How are you enjoying your training?;NM13AABELA05030_.mp3
It's difficult, but worthwhile.;
With power comes responsibility, and only by learning discipline and sacrifice can we truly learn to master our potential.;NM13AABELA05032_.mp3
I wish you luck in your training, apprentice. There is much you must yet learn. May the Force be with you.;NM13AABELA05033_.mp3
I want to learn to use the Force, not listen to your philosophical babbling!;
You speak as if this were some foolish game! Have you no idea what is at stake?;NM13AABELA05035_.mp3
I am still learning the Jedi Code.;
All Jedi must know the code. Its tenets are the fundamental teachings of our Order.;NM13AABELA05037_.mp3
"There is no emotion; there is peace. There is no ignorance; there is knowledge. There is no passion; there is serenity. There is no chaos; there is harmony. There is no death; there is the Force.";NM13AABELA05038_.mp3
Think and meditate on these truths, apprentice, if you ever wish to become a Padawan.;NM13AABELA05039_.mp3
I am looking to alter my lightsaber, and I heard about some caves.;
There are caves on Dantooine that hold those rare crystals. But be warned, apprentice: They are dangerous. You should not meddle in things beyond you.;NM13AABELA05041_.mp3
A battle took place earlier to the south of the Enclave. A lot of people died and many droids were destroyed.;NM13AABELA05042_.mp3
I wonder what dark force could have caused this to happen...;NM13AABELA05043_.mp3
Shen and Rahasia have been welcomed here in the compound for as long as they wish to stay. I am glad that your help enabled them to remain together.;NM13AABELA05044_.mp3
Master Zhar tells me you have successfully completed the tests, and I even see you have constructed your own lightsaber.;NM13AABELA05045_.mp3
You should be proud of your accomplishment... but never forget that you still have much to learn.;NM13AABELA05046_.mp3
As your power grows you will constantly face temptations to slip to the dark side. This is the eternal struggle of the Jedi.;NM13AABELA05047_.mp3
Greetings, young Padawan. I trust your training goes well.;NM13AABELA05048_.mp3
Greetings to you. Err... while I am pleased to welcome you to planet G5-623, I do not see your ship on my docking schedule.;
The Czerka Corporation will see to your needs, of course, but there will be a 100 credit docking fee. In advance, I fear.;
Docking fee? Why do I need to pay that?;
This outpost is remote and expensive to maintain. The 100 credits given will ensure that it remains here... for your use, of course.;
Upon collection of the correct fees, I will extend what resources the Czerka Corporation can offer. I'm sure you understand.;
[Force Persuade] I don't think I need to pay the docking fee.;
[Success] Perhaps you don't need to pay the docking fee. Any services you need will more than make up for it.;
*whisper* The Force should not be used for profit and personal gain. As Jedi we should be above such things.;NGLOBEBAST06896_.mp3
I see you have a Wookiee with you. Can I assume you understand their language? For a fee, Czerka Corporation can provide a translator for you during your visit.;
I'm trained in the Force. I'll have no trouble.;
I don't have any experience with that. I just know that only the most adaptive people can understand the Wookiee language.;
Now then, please follow me to our information center. I will answer any further questions there.;
That will not be necessary.;
Very well, though only the most adaptive people seem to comprehend the Wookiee language, such as it is.;
I understand more than you can know.;
Er... very well. It is no concern of mine. I will simply assume you are one of the rare sort that take to languages easily.;
We will also arrange for translation services, for a nominal fee, of course. You'll be encountering a number of Wookiees while here.;
*whisper* I'm amazed at how many people that works on. The entire galaxy must be filled with weak-minded fools.;NGLOBECAND03474_.mp3
*whisper* You should treat your power with respect, not use the Force on a whim like it is some toy!;NGLOBEJUHA11853_.mp3
[Failure] No... no I'm... quite certain that you need to pay the fee. It is a mere 100 credits, after all.;
Very well, I will pay the 100 credit fee.;
You are welcome on Edean, trade designation G5-623. Czerka Corporation welcomes your business. We should discuss your interests in my office.;
I can't pay you the 100 credits.;
That is unfortunate. This outpost will have to remain closed to you until you can secure the credits. I am sorry. Good day.;
[You have no choice but to return to the Ebon Hawk.];
I refuse to pay. What will you do about it?;
Czerka Corporation protects its interests. If you won't pay, you won't be granted access to the planet and are free to leave.;
I will await you here if you change your mind.;
Don't make demands. I'm <FullName>, and I'll land where I wish.;
I respect your... obvious determination, but I can't allow you to remain unless you pay the proper fees.;
The Czerka Corporation appreciates your cooperation, and hopes this will not devolve into a... violent matter.;
[Force Persuade] I don't need to pay the docking fee. Stand aside!;
[Failure] I fail to see the basis for your arguement. Please, there is no need to be hostile.;
It's easily settled. I'll pay with your blood!;
W-we are not unarmed here! We have many guards and security droids. If we can control Wookiees, we can control you.;
Is the price negotiable?;
Very simply put, no. Operation of these remote outposts is an expensive endeavor.;
[Persuade/Lie] I represent wealthy clients. You should let me pass.;
[Success] *sigh* Normally I wouldn't do this, but I don't feel like arguing. I'll consider a promise of future business payment enough.;
Could I get some information about the planet? I thought this was Kashyyyk.;
That is what the dominant indigenous species calls this world, but maintaining this outpost grants Czerka Corporation naming rights in the trade guides.;
But, I'm sorry, I really must insist that docking fees be paid before I impart any further services. I must follow proper procedure.;
What services does 100 credits get me?;
Well, we are limited in many ways, but I doubt you will find even basic facilities anywhere else in this remote sector.;
I greet you again. Will you accept the terms of landing at this outpost? We are quite far from any similar services.;
Please, follow me to my office in our information center. We will discuss your needs and how Czerka Corporation can serve you.;
Greetings again. How can Czerka Corporation serve you during your visit to Edean?;
I need supplies. What is available here?;
For material goods, I would suggest you speak with the general vendor near the docking area. He keeps his store well-stocked.;
They charge fair value for mundane goods and armor. If it is weapons you want, you will need to deal with the Czerka representative. That would be me.;
If you're here to purchase local species, however, you must wait for a licensed Czerka Corporation trader to return from deliveries outside the system.;
Purchase local species? What do you mean?;
He means that they are slavers. They take my people from their homes and sell them to the highest bidder.;
Your current Wookiee seems displeased with the situation, but I fail to see a concern. You seem to be a satisfied customer.;
Zaalbar is no slave. He has pledged a life-debt to me.;
Ah, a very difficult thing to stage. I commend you for it. So much easier than relying on restraining collars.;
Do not demean the life-debt! Do not!;
I must warn you that you will be blamed for the actions of your Wookiee. Please... call him off.;
Why? I should let him kill the lot of you!;
I am merely a servant of the corporation! The Wookiee leadership is in agreement! Harvesting is made as delicate as possible!;
[Force Persuade] Hmph. 'Harvesting'. Tell us about this agreement with the Wookiee leadership.;NM22AAJANO06056_.mp3
[Success] I can tell you about the agreement. We supply arms in exchange for a supply of healthy Wookiees.;
We are kept profitable and an agreeable leader is kept in power. It keeps the process from becoming a constant firefight.;
What is this leader's name?;
I believe his name is Chuundar. I don't deal directly with them, thank goodness. Far too brutish.;
Grrrr.... that was not a name I wanted to hear.;
It sounds as though your thrall has an opinion about our arrangement with this leader, but it doesn't matter. Chuundar is unquestioned.;
What about it, Zaalbar? What's the matter?;
This is not something I will talk about. Not yet.;
Please, is there anything else? I have work to do.;
I've other questions to ask.;
I will answer if I can.;
Tell me about the planet. You called it G5-623 before.;
"G5-623 is the numerical designation. The galactic Basic name is ""Edean,"" chosen by corporate ballot among stockholders.";
It would seem you are already acquainted with this world, given your choice of traveling companion.;
I have been away for a very long time.;
You let the beast speak for you? You allow it more liberties than most of our customers.;
Allow it more liberties? What do you mean?;
Aren't you here to take delivery of a Wookiee thrall? There are few other reasons to visit this barbaric world.;
Why do the Wookiees tolerate you doing this?;
It is not me, personally. I merely represent Czerka Corporation at this outpost. There are other directors at other stations, of course.;
Arrangements have been made with the Wookiee leadership. Harvesting is handled as delicately as possible, relatively speaking.;
[Persuade] Tell me about it. I might be more understanding if I know.;
[Success] If it will ease your temper, I will give specifics. We supply arms in exchange for a supply of healthy Wookiees.;
[Failure] It's not good policy to talk about our corporate strategy. I'm sorry, but I can't say any more.;
Tell me what you mean or I'll bloody your floor!;
RrrrraaAAAARRRR!!!;
Now, there's no c-call for that. It is a simple matter, really. We supply arms in exchange for a supply of healthy Wookiees.;
[Force Persuade] You want to tell me about these agreements.;
Disgusting slaver! Why shouldn't I kill you!;
I'd think you would need more firepower to keep order.;
We do things as humanely as possible. There are other outposts, but the operation is very lean overall.;
I'd like to talk about the slaving operations here on Edean.;
I've a very limited number of things I can say. What do you wish to discuss?;
I can't allow this to continue.;
It's not up to you. This planet is not a member of the Republic, and its backward citizens hold no rights.;
I'm sorry you are offended, but this operation is very humane. Even the Wookiee leadership knows it is more beneficial to work with us.;
Slavery under any guise should not be tolerated!;NM22AAJANO06094_.mp3
Besides, even if you did do something drastic here, the Czerka Corporation has other outposts on Edean. It would change nothing.;
What's to stop me turning my Wookiee loose on you?;
Oh, just say the word!;
I'm through speaking with you for now.;
Very good, feel free to inspect our operation here, but I would advise against going too far from the main landing area.;
The planet is still very much untamed, and we do not send out patrols for lost tourists.;
Humane, you call it? Beneficial? Sounds like a bunch of excuses, if you ask me.;NM22AAJANO06095_.mp3
It's not our place to judge, Carth. As he said, it would change nothing anyway.;NM22AAJANO06096_.mp3
Are you saying you approve of this?!;NM22AAJANO06097_.mp3
Of course not. I would gladly end it, had I the power. However, we are here for other reasons, if you will recall.;NM22AAJANO06098_.mp3
I'd like to ask about the Czerka Corporation.;
Czerka Corporation has branches in many systems, mostly concerned with weapon production for personal and ship-mounted use.;
Of course, the many outposts on this world are only concerned with bio-aquisitions.;
Bio-acquisitions? What do you mean?;
What weapons do you have available?;
Czerka maintains a well-stocked armory that is open to all our valued customers. You may browse it at your leisure.;
I'm looking for something called a Star Map.;
I'm sorry, but I have no information on that. Are you sure you meant to come here? This world is very primitive.;
Much of it is still unexplored, even by the locals. The forest gets ever more dangerous the further you descend. The lowest levels, the Shadowlands, are largely unknown.;
Farewell for now.;
"At any rate, ""Edean"" is more pleasing than ""Kashyyyk."" The language of the dominant indigenous species is quite crude.";
In fact, a translation droid must usually be placed with them, but their physical strength makes up for the inconvenience to the owner.;
To the owner? What do you mean?;
What else is on this planet?;
An endless array of dangerous creatures, it seems. The great trees harbor any number of dangers below.;
We've detected odd energy signatures on occasion, but exploration is costly amongst creatures even more difficult than Wookiees.;
Odd energy signatures? Have you ever checked those out?;NM22AAJANO06111_.mp3
We send expeditions, of course, but they come back with little, if they come back at all.;
"What did you mean when you referred to a Wookiee's ""owner?""";
I don't know why you asked me these questions, but it doesn't matter. Chuundar is unquestioned as leader. Our operation is quite secure.;
[Force Persuade] You wish to tell us more about this agreement with the Wookiee leadership.;NM22AAJANO06057_.mp3
[Force Persuade] You wish to tell us more about this agreement with the Wookiee leadership.;NM22AAJANO06058_.mp3
Maybe you should start talking, or I might decide to get a little... restless.;NM22AAJANO06059_.mp3
Commentary: The meatbag speaks without clarity. Detail this agreement or the master will splatter your organs all over the floor!;NM22AAJANO06060_.mp3
Please! It is not my decision! It is... an acceptable practice, I assure you!;
Hey - I recognize you! You're the one who won the big swoop race!;
Best swoop race I've seen in years! I couldn't believe it was your first race! You've got real talent, rookie!;
I can't believe that traitor Brejik used to be one of us. Gadon may be old and blind, but I'd rather follow him than a turncoat like Brejik!;
We should have wiped the Vulkars out long ago, but Gadon Thek thought he could reason with Brejik and prevent a war. Guess we know better now.;
If the Vulkar's hadn't stolen our swoop engine prototype we'd be a lock to win the big race this year!;
With Brejik dead it won't be long until those Vulkars of his collapse. I bet within a week Gadon will have the Lower City back to normal.;
It's really strange. Nobody seems to know where Master Uthar or Yuthura Ban have disappeared to. Some of the sensitives are claiming they're dead.;NM35AASITH15000_.mp3
Rumor has it that something has happened to Master Uthar and Yuthura Ban. Do you know anything?;NM35AASITH15002_.mp3
I heard that Yuthura Ban was dead. I suppose that means Master Uthar will be taking a new apprentice, soon.;NM35AASITH15004_.mp3
Did you hear? Yuthura is dead. Master Uthar said so. I bet she got too impatient and failed to assassinate him. Idiot.;NM35AASITH15006_.mp3
Master Yuthura has taken over the academy. Everyone's talking about it! I guess she finally got rid of Uthar, somehow.;NM35AASITH15008_.mp3
Have you heard? Yuthura... I mean Master Yuthura has taken over the academy! Well done, I say!;NM35AASITH15010_.mp3
You aren't even a full Sith. Don't bother me.;NM35AASITH15012_.mp3
Get out of my way. I don't have time to deal with hopefuls.;NM35AASITH15014_.mp3
Come back when you've taken your final test. If you survive it.;NM35AASITH15016_.mp3
If Master Uthar gives you an order, you'd better follow it. There were some students who disobeyed him and now they're hiding out on the surface somewhere.;NM35AASITH15018_.mp3
There are some students in hiding that refused to follow an order. Master Uthar wants them found and dead... and is offering a reward for it, too!;NM35AASITH15020_.mp3
Just be careful if you go into the valley. I hear there's a hermit living in the hills that kidnaps students.;NM35AASITH15022_.mp3
The former master of the academy, Jorak Uln, is supposedly hiding out in the hills on the surface as some kind of mad hermit.;NM35AASITH15024_.mp3
Word is that one of our experimental droids went mad and escaped and is hiding in the ruins. I wonder why we don't just gather up and destroy it?;NM35AASITH15026_.mp3
One of my friends went to find that crazy droid that's hiding in the ruins in the valley. He hasn't come back, yet.;NM35AASITH15028_.mp3
Ha! It's great to be on the winning side, isn't it? We've been crushing the Republic at every battle so far!;NM35AASITH15030_.mp3
The latest reports say the Republic is on the run. Before long the Sith will be ruling the entire galaxy.;NM35AASITH15032_.mp3
Darth Malak is one of the greatest Sith leaders ever. I hope he comes back to the academy before I leave.;NM35AASITH15034_.mp3
It is my most fervent hope to serve under Darth Malak once my training is complete. Don't you feel the same?;NM35AASITH15036_.mp3
Rumor around the academy is that you had something to do with those rebel students being caught, finally. They got what they deserved, I say.;NM35AASITH15038_.mp3
I was told that you actually met the old master of the academy, Jorak. Is the hermit as mad as they say?;NM35AASITH15040_.mp3
The buzz is that you took care of that crazy droid out in the ruins. That's pretty impressive.;NM35AASITH15042_.mp3
Hmm. So you got enough prestige to win out, I hear. We'll just see if you make it through your final test.;NM35AASITH15044_.mp3
Sorry, I don't have time to speak. My training awaits.;NM35AASITH15046_.mp3
I greet you, human. I am Karal Karr, owner of this outpost of Aratech Droids, Inc.;
My protocol droids are not programmed to interact with customers, so should you desire assistance I can aid you.;
Let me see what you have in stock.;
Explore my inventory at your convenience. Settler families have purchased all my droids, but I have many upgrades and other wares for purchase.;
What do you know of the Mandalorian raiders?;
Only that they have been a nuisance to the farmers and settlers in the region.;
They do not have the resources to penetrate this base, so I do not know of them first-hand.;
Is there something else I can do for you?;
I think I'll be going now.;
Please return again soon to Aratech Droids, Inc. for all your droid needs.;
I greet you, human. How may this outpost of Aratech Droids serve your needs?;
I greet you, apprentice Jedi. Master Zhar has informed me that your training is progressing most rapidly. I am honored to have such a promising pupil in my shop. How may I serve you?;
I hear that there is much strife amongst the Sith as of late. It bodes well for the cause of the Jedi. How may I serve your needs today?;
The Czerka Corp., the perennial rivals of my company, have suffered some major setbacks on the world of Kashyyyk, I hear.;
Aratech will benefit greatly from this, I believe, and our benefit extends to our customers as well. Hopefully prices will fall in the near future. How may I be of assistance today?;
I hear you have earned a name for yourself in racing speeders. I am sure that one such as you has many needs that I can hope to fulfill.;
I greet you, Padawan. Members of the Jedi Order are always welcome in all the outposts of Aratech Droids. How may I serve you today?;
Very good, though I should expect no less from the Sector Champion. Would you like to race again? It would require another 20 credit positioning fee.;
I'll pay for a practice run.;
Certainly. Your swoop will be towed into position immediately. It shouldn't take long to begin the run.;
Why is there a fee?;
We find that racers are more careful when they are funding the course with each race. Besides, we must defray maintenance costs somehow.;
And please, no haggling. I am not authorized to give a discount even if I wished to.;
I want an officially timed race.;
Please speak to the Course Regulator for information on challenging the current leaders in each race category.;
No thanks. Goodbye.;
Very well. Goodbye.;
That was a good run. You would do well in a tournament. Would you like another unofficial run? It would require another 20 credit positioning fee.;
Welcome, Sector Champion. Would you like to book the swoop course for a practice run? For a small fee of 20 credits you can keep your skills in top shape.;
Hello there. Are you looking to book the swoop course for a practice run? There will be a small positioning fee of 20 credits to have your swoop bike readied.;
Rahasia and I cannot thank you enough for what you have done for us. Now we finally have a place to share our love, without fear of reprisals from our families.;NM13AASHEN16000_.mp3
I'm just glad I could help you out.;
Rahasia and I can spend the rest of our lives together... All thanks to you.;NM13AASHEN16002_.mp3
I wish you the best of luck, Shen. I hope you two find the happiness I once knew myself.;NM13AASHEN16004_.mp3
Good luck to you both. May you find the happiness you deserve.;NM13AASHEN16006_.mp3
What are your plans now?;
We will stay here for the next little while... We are still hoping our parents will learn to set aside their differences and welcome us back into their homes.;NM13AASHEN16009_.mp3
If they do not, perhaps we will travel to Coruscant or the Core Worlds and make our fortunes there.;NM13AASHEN16011_.mp3
So... any kids on the way yet?;
Not yet, my friend, but perhaps someday soon.;NM13AASHEN16014_.mp3
Go away.;NM03AACALO03016_.mp3
[This droid is too busy performing its assigned duties to speak with you.];
Gurke said no more talking. You got sand in your ears? No more talking.;
You... you go deal with Gurke, maybe. I don't want any more trouble. Not even a little.;
Ha! Little baby come back to talk? Maybe Gurke can stand your whimpering, but not me. Get lost.;
Don't you interrupt my drinking. Gurke gots more patience. Go bother him.;
You there - human. You are the rider who won the Great Swoop Race in the Lower City, yes?;
That's right.;
I have a message from Canderous Ordo. He says to meet him in the cantina.;
Canderous? Isn't he that Mandalorian that works for Davik?;
Yes, that's the one. Given his connections, you can see why it would be wise to attend this meeting.;
Canderous didn't say why he wanted to meet you. He only said he had an offer you couldn't refuse. Given his connections, you can see why it would be foolish to ignore his request.;
Thanks for the message. I'll go meet him in the cantina.;
A wise choice, human. I would advise you not to wait too long. Mandalorians are known for many things, but patience is not one of them.;
Okay, I got the message. You can go now.;
I would advise you not to put this meeting off for too long, human. Mandalorians are known for many things, but patience is not one of them.;
I'll think about it.;
Why does he want to meet me?;
You must have me confused with someone else.;
No, human. I don't think so. I saw the swoop race: you were there. You posted the best time. You are the one I was sent to find.;
What do you want?;
Me? I want nothing. I am only a runner. I work for the man who hired me.;
Your actions beneath the surface have shown that you are no friend to my people. I wish nothing to do with you.;
I am sorry, human. You have made your relationship with the Sith quite clear. I have no further business with you.;
[Persuade] I was only kidding!;
[Success] I do not find that form of humor amusing, human!;
Your words are strange, human. You claim one thing, then the exact opposite. Perhaps this is what your species calls humor. If so, its appeal eludes me.;
However, I believe you now speak the truth about your dislike of the Sith.;
Though I suspect we have little in common, human, I share your dislike of the Sith. They have brought grief to my family.;
I am not a fool, I know the Sith do not respect our laws as the Republic does. Were it up to me, I would do everything in my power to aid the Republic in the war against Malak.;
But intergalactic politics stay my hand. Still, I know the Sith are evil - and I fear what they will do to my people. And what they may be doing now.;
What are you talking about?;
Many of the Selkath have vanished, human. Most who have gone missing are on the cusp of adulthood, the youth who will someday lead this planet. My own daughter, Shasa, is among those who have disappeared.;
These disappearances coincide with the arrival of the Sith, and I cannot dismiss the connection. The Sith are up to something, human. Something sinister - I can feel it!;
You want me to investigate these disappearances?;
I will give you 500 credits if you can uncover the fate of my daughter and the other missing Selkath youth. Not much, but all I can afford. I have no official authority in this matter, and my personal wealth is not vast.;
There is no one else I can turn to, human. The Republic agents are too closely watched by the Sith, and the Ahto City authorities cannot act without proof of Sith involvement.;
I shall look into these disappearances for you, Shaelas.;
I cannot imagine where to begin the investigation, though I suspect the Sith did not act alone. Perhaps the off-worlders in the mercenary enclave know something.;
If you learn anything, human, report back to me at once. If you uncover the fate of my daughter and the other missing Selkath youth, I will reward you as promised.;
I've got better things to do than look for missing tadpoles.;
I see, human. Despite your rebuff, my offer still stands - I have nowhere else to turn. Return to me if you obtain information on my daughter and the other missing Selkath youth, and I will reward you as promised.;
What's in this for me?;
Sorry, I'm not interested.;
Just get to the point, Shaelas.;
[Failure] I do not believe you! Go. We have nothing more to speak of.;
[Force Persuade] It was a joke.;
[Success] Yes... A joke. I was mistaken.;
Whatever...;
Human, you return. Have you information for me? Have you discovered the fate of the missing Selkath youth? Have you news of my daughter, Shasa?;
Not yet. I shall investigate further.;
I have information for you, Shaelas.;
Excellent. You have done well. What have you learned?;
The Sith hired an Iridorian mercenary to lure the Selkath youth to the Sith base.;
I see. This information is useful, for a start. But it does little to explain the truth of this matter. We must know what purpose the Sith have for these youth.;
Are they prisoners of the Sith? Are they even still alive? I must know more, human. I must know what has happened to my daughter!;
I will look into this further.;
I cannot officially ask you to enter the Sith base, human. That would be a violation of Ahto City's strict neutrality laws. However, I fear such a brazen act may be the only way to learn the truth.;
But entering the base will not be easy. And should you be captured or killed, I will have to disavow any knowledge of your actions.;
I'll infiltrate the Sith base, Shaelas.;
I wish I could be of more help, human. I will wait here. Return to me when you have something more to report.;
Forget it - I'm not about to break into the Sith base looking for your web fingered offspring!;
You shall have no reward from me until I learn the fate of my daughter, human! If you change your mind and discover her fate, you can report to me here to collect your reward.;
What do you suggest I do?;
Does this mean I don't get paid?;
This information is mere bait - the catch yet awaits, human. Once you discover the ultimate fate of my daughter, I will gladly give you the 500 credits I promised.;
The Sith are training the Selkath youth in the ways of the Dark Jedi.;
Yes... this makes sense. It is a wonder I did not see this before. Manaan's greatest strength is our neutrality.;
If Malak brainwashes our youth and indoctrinates them in the ways of the Sith he will have a strong following among the Selkath people - strong enough to seize control of Manaan and our kolto!;
My daughter, Shasa - she too has been indoctrined into the Sith camp?;
Your daughter is dead, Shaelas.;
No! Say it is not so, human! No - not Shasa! The Sith will pay for this! If it is the last thing I do they will pay!;
Perhaps this datapad will help.;
A datapad? Let me see. Of course - this details the entire Sith plot! With this evidence I can go to the Ahto City authorities!;
The Sith will face severe fines and export restrictions for their actions - a poor substitute for my daughter's life, but with any luck the kolto embargo will weaken the Sith war effort.;
I... I thank you for what you have done here, human - though I wish my daughter's fate had been otherwise. Here are the credits I promised you.;
I'm sorry it had to be this way, Shaelas.;
Please, excuse me now, human. I desire no company but my own.;
Keep your credits, Shaelas. I wouldn't feel right about taking them now.;
I... I thank you once more, human. I wish all your species were as kind and noble as you.;
I hope so.;
I killed your daughter, Shaelas. Just as I'll kill you if you tell anyone about this. Now give me those credits!;
You... you are a monster! I came to you for aid, and you betray me and slaughter my innocent Shasa! You are no better than the Sith!;
Blah, blah, blah - give me the credits if you want to live.;
Nice. Real nice. Maybe later we could find some insects to pull the legs off, huh?;NGLOBEJOLE09762_.mp3
Your actions disturb me. Among my kind, those who take pleasure in the suffering of others are considered dangerously unstable.;
Take your blood money, human! May it bring you as much grief and misfortune as you have brought me!;
You are a representative of the Jedi Order. When you behave this way you disgrace us all!;NM17AA05ME02071_.mp3
This isn't right! We should be helping people, not making their lives miserable.;NM17AA03SH01160_.mp3
We should guard and protect those weaker than ourselves... not bully and exploit them!;NGLOBEBAST06899_.mp3
I know you're supposed to save the galaxy and all, but could you try being less of a scummy core slime while you're doing it?;NGLOBEMISS13304_.mp3
I've convinced your daughter to turn her back on the Sith ways.;
Human, if you speak the truth I am forever in your debt! And yet, my joy is tempered by the knowledge that the Sith still walk freely about Manaan.;
Hopefully the testimony of my daughter will be enough proof of their actions, to make the Ahto City authorites take action.;
Maybe this datapad will help.;
A datapad? Yes, I see! This datapad has all the details of the entire Sith plot! With this the Manaan authorities will be forced to take action!;
I doubt the Sith will be banned from Manaan, but at the very least they will face harsh restrictions on their kolto exports!;
You have done much for me, human. Here are the credits I promised you - I only wish I had more to give.;
Thank you, Shaelas.;
Wow, sometimes helping people feels pretty good, you know?;NM17AA03SH01166_.mp3
This is how we Jedi should always act: with honor.;NM17AA03SH01167_.mp3
Please excuse me now, human. I must go speak to the Manaan authorities about this Sith plot and what they have done to my beloved daughter.;
I'm glad to see we're still the good guys here. Sometimes I think we forget that.;NM17AA03SH01164_.mp3
Keep your credits, Shaelas. A Jedi has no need of such rewards.;
You refuse my reward? Truly you humans are a noble breed! Perhaps my species has underestimated your kind.;
Statement: Oh, master. I'm so very disappointed in you.;NGLOBEHHKD07558_.mp3
Mighty generous of you. A little too generous, if you ask me.;NGLOBECAND03477_.mp3
That was a truly noble act. The Jedi Council would be pleased.;NGLOBEBAST06901_.mp3
Hey, kid, that was a good thing you did there. Almost brought a tear to this old man's eye.;NGLOBEJOLE09763_.mp3
I am proud to call you my friend, <FullName>. You have a noble and generous spirit.;
Give me my money and get out of here.;
I would not have expected such rudeness from a Jedi... but you have rendered a valuable service. Here is your money.;
Your daughter is still with the Sith, Shaelas.;
Shasa, my daughter, what have those Sith monsters done to your mind? I will report this to the authorities, though I fear without proof there is little they can do to get my daughter back.;
Your daughter has joined the Sith.;
Shasa... No! This is most terrible! Most terrible indeed!;
I must go now, human, to inform the Selkath authorities of what is transpiring. Here is the money I have promised you.;
Maybe a few credits could refresh my memory.;
I am confused, human. How will credits facilitate your cognitive functions? Oh... I believe I understand.;
This is what you off-worlders call a shakedown, is it not? I am not wealthy, human. I have offered 500 credits for information on my daughter and the other missing Selkath. Is this not enough?;
Very well. I'll tell you what I know.;
I am pleased you have not chosen to exploit my loss for your personal greed, human. What have you discovered?;
If you want news on your daughter, find a way to get those extra credits.;
Very well, human. You prey upon my grief and concern over my missing daughter, but I am desperate. Here is another 100 credits - that is all I have.;
I have already given you an additional 100 credits! I have nothing more to give, human! Have you no heart, no compassion?;
Fine. I'll tell you what I know.;
I suppose I should thank you, human - though you have already exploited my grief well enough for your own gain. What information do you have for me now?;
Sorry - no credits, no info.;
I... I have nothing more to give, human. The 500 credits I promised you for the fate of my daughter are all I have left.;
I suppose I can do nothing more but wait here, in case you change your mind. I can only hope you find find it in your heart to take pity on a grieving parent.;
Sorry, nothing yet.;
I've decided I've got better things to do than be your errand slave.;
Greetings, human. My name is Shaelas. I have heard that you may have had some part in the incident at the Sith Embassy recently. Is this true?;
The Sith are a blight upon the galaxy!;
My allegiances are my own business.;
You are wise to be so guarded, human. But my sources are rarely wrong, and they have informed me that you are no friend of Malak's people.;
Actually, I kind of like the Sith. They've got style.;
You like the Sith? You are obviously not the person I am looking for to complete this task.;
I'm just kidding.;
What task?;
Greetings, human. My name is Shaelas. I have heard it said that you are no friend of the Sith. Is this true?;
Human, I wish to speak with you.;
Deserter! Traitor! I'll make an example of you!;NM24AAPOFF08075_.mp3
Well that's just great! I don't have the men to keep this location safe!;NM24AAPOFF08076_.mp3
I'll be back, though! There's money here!;NM24AAPOFF08077_.mp3
Who are you, another civil merchant like that coro-slime up on the docking ring? This is my territory.;NM24AAPOFF08000_.mp3
I don't make deals and I don't persuade easily, so go back topside. Mess with my profits and I'll see you dead.;NM24AAPOFF08001_.mp3
Are you the poachers Jolee told me about?;
That crazy old fool is still alive? I suppose he's still upset that we don't all live in little homemade shacks like he chooses.;NM24AAPOFF08003_.mp3
I've got a job to do here, and there's nothing you or that old coot can do about it.;NM24AAPOFF08004_.mp3
I might be interested in some work.;
I could use an extra hand. A couple men have gone missing. If I lose many more I'll have to close up shop.;NM24AAPOFF08009_.mp3
We are hunting the little simians, the tach. They have a gland that acts as a stimulant when powdered.;NM24AAPOFF08010_.mp3
I figure I've got two or three wealthy years to butcher the lot of them. You want in before I make them extinct?;NM24AAPOFF08011_.mp3
What does the job pay?;
I really can't quote a price. Depends on the market. I give fair value for each one, rest assured. That promise will have to do.;NM24AAPOFF08013_.mp3
I want the job. How do I hunt these tach?;
All right then, I'll set you up. First you need to be able to draw them out. It's easy.;NM24AAPOFF08015_.mp3
I'll spray you with this scent... it drives them crazy. They can't help but attack you, even if it's a hopeless fight.;NM24AAPOFF08016_.mp3
Then you just carve them up. There's a big fleshy bulb in their brains that you want to scoop out. You can't miss it.;NM24AAPOFF08017_.mp3
I'd feel guilty if the money weren't so good. Come back here when you've got the glands and I'll pay you.;NM24AAPOFF08018_.mp3
Back to my general questions, all right?;
Hurry up. You're eating into my profits.;NM24AAPOFF08030_.mp3
I've got a tach gland to sell you.;
I'll take whatever you have. Keep it up and we'll both be rich. At least until we bleed this planet dry, hahaha!;NM24AAPOFF08032_.mp3
I want to ask you a few questions.;
If you made it this far you know a fair bit already. What would I be able to tell you?;NM24AAPOFF08035_.mp3
I'm looking for something called a Star Map.;
I'm no nav officer. I work on the ground, and I haven't seen anything like that around here.;NM24AAPOFF08037_.mp3
Of course, we haven't been much deeper than this. The eastern forest gets even more dangerous.;NM24AAPOFF08038_.mp3
You aren't safe with blasters?;
It's not worth it. You're fighting the plants as well as the animals. Kshyy vines are tough as metal, and grow back fast.;NM24AAPOFF08040_.mp3
Instead, head office installed repulsor fields to keep the big predators out. Permanent placements too. We'll be fine for years.;NM24AAPOFF08041_.mp3
I have other questions about the Shadowlands.;
I'm leaving.;
Good. I'm not down here to direct traffic.;NM24AAPOFF08066_.mp3
Are you part of the slaving operation?;
What? No, I don't do much of that. It's too much of a headache. I'm in the business of harvesting animals.;NM24AAPOFF08044_.mp3
Some of the more exotic species have organs that can be removed and put to some surprising applications.;NM24AAPOFF08045_.mp3
I've already told you about that. You agreed to help bring them in.;NM24AAPOFF08046_.mp3
Talk to me about work and maybe I'll tell you more.;NM24AAPOFF08047_.mp3
Is there anything odd down here?;
Besides you? Besides any number of predators that can kill in seconds? I suppose there's old Bindo.;NM24AAPOFF08049_.mp3
He's got a camp here somewhere. I'd leave him alone, though. Anyone who'd live down here is just plain crazy.;NM24AAPOFF08050_.mp3
There's not much else. We've got a repulsor field to the east so not much passes through here now.;NM24AAPOFF08051_.mp3
If the Shadowlands are so dangerous, how do you survive?;
It ain't easy. We've set up a perimeter of sonic emitters to keep the bigger preds away. It's worked so far.;NM24AAPOFF08053_.mp3
As long as the emitters are operational, we're pretty much safe. It makes harvesting a lot easier.;NM24AAPOFF08054_.mp3
What if I want you to leave the Shadowlands?;
Is that old hermit Jolee trying to talk you into doing his dirty work? We've spent too much on setting up just to walk away.;NM24AAPOFF08056_.mp3
As long the sonic emitters keep the preds away and I've got bodies to guard the perimeter, we're staying right here.;NM24AAPOFF08057_.mp3
I mean, if I can put up with my own worthless guards complaining about this place, Jolee whining through you is nothing.;NM24AAPOFF08058_.mp3
I've got some tach glands to sell you.;
You're just a Czerka slaver. Nothing special.;
All right, I'm done talking with you. You've got under my skin one too many times! I'll bury you down here!;NM24AAPOFF08060_.mp3
Just you try it.;NM24AAPOFF08061_.mp3
I don't need this kind of garbage from you. Watch your mouth. I'm the only law there is down here.;NM24AAPOFF08062_.mp3
If you've got something to say, get on with it. Otherwise, leave me alone. I've credits to earn.;NM24AAPOFF08063_.mp3
I should just kill you. No one will ever know.;
I have more questions about the job.;
Hurry up, I'm wasting too much time on you as it is.;NM24AAPOFF08020_.mp3
Don't you care that you could wipe out the whole species?;
Uh, no. I'll be rich by then, and won't need to do it anymore. I don't have to worry about it.;NM24AAPOFF08022_.mp3
Besides, if there's no more tach, the predators that eat them will die off and we'll have an easier time milking this planet.;NM24AAPOFF08023_.mp3
Maybe you should just pay me so I don't shut you down.;
I'm warning you, I didn't get this job because of my sense of humor. You smart mouth me again and we'll have a problem.;NM24AAPOFF08025_.mp3
Hell, I have guards everywhere and a perimeter of sonic emitters. I don't fear anything in the Shadowlands, including you.;NM24AAPOFF08026_.mp3
This wholesale slaughter can't be allowed!;
I'm hard-pressed to come up with a way for you to stop me. I'll defend this operation if I have to.;NM24AAPOFF08028_.mp3
I paid the docking fee. Who cares where I go?;
So you're playing tourist? That isn't smart. The Shadowlands are all business. Mess around and you'll end up dead.;NM24AAPOFF08006_.mp3
That said, if you want to make some credits while you're looking to die, I might have a job for you.;NM24AAPOFF08007_.mp3
Chuundar has given me permission to be here.;
He's got no authority with me. I'm with Czerka Corporation. He's just some pet we keep so the locals stay in line.;NM24AAPOFF08068_.mp3
As long as you don't get in my way, you can wander where you want. I've got a job to do.;NM24AAPOFF08069_.mp3
Are you going to stop me? I go where I want.;
Look, I don't care if you want to play tourist down here, but you behave yourself or we'll have a problem.;NM24AAPOFF08071_.mp3
I've got a job to do, and I won't be gentle if you get in my way, understand?;NM24AAPOFF08072_.mp3
Back again, hmm? Unless you've business with me I suggest you turn around and walk away.;NM24AAPOFF08073_.mp3
That's it! You are dead!;NM24AAPOFF08074_.mp3
[This droid is speaking a language you do not recognize.];
What language is that? What are you trying to say?;
I don't understand you.;
You are neither Builder nor slave. If you seek the secrets of the Star Forge you must first prove yourself worthy. Only then will the sealed door behind be opened.;
I want to ask you some questions.;
I am here to aid those who seek the knowledge of the Builders. What do you wish to know?;
Who are you again?;
I am the Overseer. The Builders programmed me to enforce discipline among the slaves while this monument to the power of the Star Forge was constructed.;
At project completion all slaves were executed. I was reprogrammed to serve should a Builder return in search of knowledge of the Star Forge.;
What do you know about the Builders?;
The Builders are the great masters of the galaxy, the conquerors of all worlds, the rulers of the infinite empire and the creators of the Star Forge.;
More than this, I am not programmed to say.;
Tell me about the Star Forge.;
The Star Forge is the glory of the Builders, the apex of their infinite empire. It is a machine of invincible might, a tool of unstoppable conquest.;
How do I prove myself worthy and unseal the doors?;
The chambers on either side contain the proving grounds. Within them, those who understand the will of the Builders can unlock their secrets and open the doors.;
But those who fail will be destroyed by the security systems of the temple itself. More than this, I am not programmed to say.;
I'll be going now.;
I shall remain here as programmed by the Builders.;
You have proven yourself worthy, the sealed door is open. If you wish to learn the secrets of the Star Forge you must pass through the door to the room beyond.;
Well, it seems you are more than I thought. Freyyr has come back, and told me of what you did for him.;
My fellow hunters split on what should be done. Some were loyal to Chuundar alone... we had to fight.;
Freyyr went to the throne room to challenge Chuundar. I will take you to him now.;
Why should I follow you?;
I can guide you off the path. We will approach from behind, avoiding Czerka and those loyal to Chuundar.;
It is the only way. I'm sorry, but I won't allow you to proceed any other way. This is too important.;
You fought each other? Why?;
We follow the Chieftain, whoever that is. If the position is in doubt, we each fight for the side we believe in.;
This must be decided quickly or there will be much more bloodshed. Come, it is this way.;
Lead on. We should hurry.;
Yes, much is about to be decided. Only one can lead us. *Must* lead us. Come.;
By order of Chieftain Freyyr, you are allowed full access to the Shadowlands and our village. You have our thanks, outsider.;
Chuundar has said you may pass into the Shadowlands. Gorwooken will lower you down in the elevator basket.;
Gorwooken climbed to the basket from the upper branches, but you will have to walk, outsider.;
The path is seldom used. There may be vermin nesting along it. Be ready to fight.;
Grrrowwlll!! You are not permitted to pass into the Shadowlands. Only Chuundar may allow you entry.;
I have already told you to take your filthy madclaw and leave. Speak with Chuundar in the village and don't bother me further.;
Especially when you bring filth such as this with you. This madclaw has no place here.;
Who are you to question my place? You follow Chuundar into the arms of outsiders.;
And yet you travel with outsiders yourself! Speak no more! Chuundar will decide if you are permitted to enter the Shadowlands.;
Where is this Wookiee I need to see?;
Speak with Chuundar in the village of Rwookrrorro. He will decide if you are worthy.;
What was that about, Zaalbar?;
We should proceed to the village. I'm sure we will both get answers there.;
"Can't you see I'm auditioning? This is my shot at the big time; I can't risk screwing it up by talking to you.";
Ah, what's the use? There's no way Bib's going to hire me unless he gets a chance to see me dancing with a partner. Maybe I should just give up.;
Why don't you have a partner?;
My last partner left me. She was always trying to upstage me, even though it was obvious I had ten times her talent. When I finally told her that, she stormed off. I guess the truth hurts.;
My partner before that was even worse. If I wasn't tripping over his staggering feet I was ducking under his flailing arms. I ditched him after less than a week.;
Maybe I could be your partner.;
I admit I'm getting desperate: I'd hate to blow this audition. But I don't know if I'm ready to just pair up with a random passer-by. How do I know you're any good?;
[Persuade] How hard can it be?;
[Failure] You think this is easy? I've trained for years to develop my talents. Dancing isn't just wiggling your butt in the air, you know! Well, except for the Corellian Cheek-Step.;
If you think you can just step up and start dancing at a professional level, you better think again.;
[Persuade] I'm good enough to get you through your audition.;
[Success] Well, you do have that certain look about you: a confidence of movement. *sigh* I guess you'll have to do. But I'm warning you - don't screw this up!;
Mr. Surool, I've got a partner now. I'd really like to audition for you again.;
Okay, Lyn, you've got one more chance. I'll give you a minute to get your partner set up, then let's see what you've got.;
Okay, I've got time to watch you for three more dances. Make them count.;
Okay, just follow my lead. Remember, the more complicated our steps and the closer we dance the more it will impress Bib.;
But don't get in too close if you can't handle it. I don't need some clumsy oaf tripping me up. Try not to screw this up for me, okay?;
[Join Lyn by dancing beside her.];
Hmmm. Simple, but nice. Just remember: the Starlight Entertainers don't want simple. We're only looking for the top performers in the galaxy.;
Look, I know you're trying to be careful about screwing up, but you've got to give me a little more than that. Bib's seen thousands of dancers: we need to do something that will impress him.;
The next dance is a little different, so watch me for the steps then jump in.;
[Join Lyn by dancing close beside her.];
Good, good. One, two, three, one, two, three... nice tempo. Looking good, Lyn. Okay, one more dance to go.;
Okay, one dance to go. Bib looks happy. As long as we don't screw up I think we've got it! Follow me and please, just keep it simple.;
[Join Lyn by dancing very close and face to face.];
Looking good. Looking very good. Feel the music. Let it flow through you.;
Well, what did you think? Do I get the job? Do you want me to dance some more? I can do another one for you if you want.;
Relax, Lyn. You made it. You've got the job. Welcome to the Starlight Entertainers.;
I made it? I really made it? This is incredible.  I... I don't believe it!;
Believe it, kid. You're in. Now we need to get you fitted for your outfits, we need to start rehearsels, you've got contracts to sign. Let's go. Busy, busy. That's the life of a star.;
Thank you. I couldn't have made it without you. I'd give you a big hug, but... well, frankly you're a little beneath me now. Like Bib said, I'm going to be a star!;
But if you're ever traveling the galaxy and you see the Starlight Entertainers performing, stop by and ask for Lyn. I'll see if I can get you some free tickets.;
I've seen enough. Sorry, Lyn, but you're not what the Starlight Entertainers are looking for. You've got nice moves, kid, but you don't do too well with a partner.;
You did that on purpose! Nobody could be that bad a dancer unless they were trying! You've wrecked my one shot at the big time!;
I'm sorry, Lyn. I did my best.;
Well sorry doesn't get me a job with the Starlight Dancers, does it?;
Bib - wait! Let me try again, Bib. I can get another partner! A good partner. Bib - wait up.;
Face it: you just aren't good enough to make the cut.;
Damn you and your big, flapping feet!;
You're right. I ruined your audition on purpose.;
No, no, no! Dance while you're standing up! It's a novel concept, I know, but give it a shot!;
You just had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't manage this one last dance without screwing up, could you?;
Don't judge me on that last dance, Bib. Please, give me another chance. Let me try one more.;
[Ruin Lyn's audition by taking a dive.];
Look, we've only got one dance left and we're going to have to pull out all the stops. Don't hold anything back this time. So pay attention to my moves, then join in and don't screw up!;
I'm not auditioning for a comedy act, here! I want dancers, not clowns. Come on, Lyn - pull it together. One last chance. Let's go.;
You idiot! What were you thinking? I'd have a better chance dancing with a drunken Gammorean! You're going to ruin me!;
[Join Lyn by dancing close behind her.];
[Join Lyn by running around her in circles while she dances.];
What was that? That was easily the stupidest thing I've ever seen!;
Here's some helpful advice: for your next dance, try not to fall over.;
What are you doing? Are you trying to cost me my one shot at fame and fortune? You have to concentrate!;
[Join Lyn by dancing very close beside her.];
Very nice, Lyn. You know, your partner isn't too bad... for an amateur. Okay, let's see what else you've got.;
Okay, we're off to a good start. Like Bib said, you're not bad for an amateur. This next dance is a little different, so watch me for the pick-ups and follow my lead.;
[Persuade] What other choice do you have?;
[Failure] You know what, I think I have a better chance going solo than I do with you stumbling around beside me. I'll pass.;
You're right. I can't dance. Nevermind.;
Oh, okay. I guess I'll just go back to auditioning. Don't see much point without a partner, though.;
I'll partner up with you, for a price.;
Is that a joke? I'm a professional entertainer, I don't pay people to dance with me! Besides, who says I'm looking for a partner anyway?;
What are you talking about?;
That Twi'lek over there is Bib Surool, the manager and talent scout for the Starlight Entertainers. They're one of the biggest performing troupes in this quadrant.;
When I heard he was stuck on Taris, I figured it was my lucky break. If I can impress him he might hire me on as a dancer and I can finally get off this slime-pit of a world.;
But I don't have a partner, and the Starlight Entertainers never perform solo. If he can't judge how I dance with someone else, I'm sunk.;
I'll be going now.;
Back again? Dancing isn't easy, you know. It requires focus and concentration. You can't keep bothering me like this.;
It's hard enough for me to impress Bib without showing him how I dance with a partner. I don't need any distractions to make it worse.;
[This man does not meet your eyes. He obviously has no desire to be taught another lesson in respect.];
Get lost, spacer. I've had enough of you.;NM17AF07OF07000_.mp3
Something you want, spacer? Go talk to the office if you want to complain about conditions here. I don't want to hear it.;NM17AF07OF07001_.mp3
You swoop racers, do you even know what it takes to run an outpost like this? As long as there's flat ground, what do you care?;NM17AF07OF07003_.mp3
I wanted to ask a few questions, if you have the time.;
I don't really have any interest in helping you. Will this be quick?;NM17AF07OF07006_.mp3
You're not much of a spokesman for Czerka Corporation.;
Like I said before, I don't much care what you think. I'll be on the street if business keeps dropping, and it will.;NM17AF07OF07008_.mp3
Let's go back to my first questions.;
All right then. Make it quick.;NM17AF07OF07019_.mp3
I'm looking for something. Who knows this planet best?;
Nobody we've brought, that's for sure. Our experts said this rock was supposed to have mining potential to last for years.;NM17AF07OF07022_.mp3
Nothing but garbage ore, good for nothing. You ever try to sell someone garbage? My name is mud in three systems now.;NM17AF07OF07024_.mp3
I have to leave. Goodbye.;
Good. I've a lack of business to attend to.;NM17AF07OF07026_.mp3
Have you anything useful to say? I'm getting tired of you.;
Oh well, I wouldn't want that, now would I? Just leave me alone.;NM17AF07OF07030_.mp3
[Force Choke] You will show me the proper respect!;
[He squirms in your grasp, utterly helpless. This man will not forget the power you wield.];
[He does not meet your gaze when you release him. He is suitably cowed.];
I will, for a price.;
What, are you a beggar? Fine, if it will get you to leave, take a few cred's, but don't expect another handout.;NM17AF07OF07032_.mp3
Go on, leave me alone. I don't want to have anything more to do with you.;NM17AF07OF07041_.mp3
Why should I? You going to do something? I could kill you.;
What are you doing, coming in here like you're Sand People or something? That's no way to do business. I don't need this.;NM17AF07OF07035_.mp3
Here, take some cred's, if that's what you want. Go drown in a drink, like every other failure in here.;NM17AF07OF07037_.mp3
I meant no harm. I apologize.;
Just hot air blowing, eh? Well take it somewhere else. I don't have the patience right now. Not with my workload.;NM17AF07OF07039_.mp3
Well, you don't look like much of a customer, and neither does anyone else here. I sell to companies, not people loitering in bars.;NM17AF07OF07009_.mp3
He has no pride at all. Might as well be dead.;
You're pet is growling. Maybe he needs to be brushed. Look, you're just like everyone else, angry about not getting enough work.;NM17AF07OF07013_.mp3
Well, I'm mad too. There's not much of a retirement plan I can count on if the whole outpost goes belly up. I'll be just like you.;NM17AF07OF07017_.mp3
Bah, you wouldn't understand. You're like everyone else, complaining about how Czerka isn't feeding and clothing you like it should.;NM17AF07OF07015_.mp3
I just have some questions. Don't give me any trouble.;
Trouble? Why would I want to make trouble with you? This planet has more than enough as it is.;NM17AF07OF07028_.mp3
I'm getting sick of your attitude.;
Seems like every other person I meet is complaining about something. Well, it's not going to get better, so leave me alone.;NM17AF07OF07004_.mp3
Well, imagine you coming back. Something you want?;NM17AF07OF07042_.mp3
You hiring for the Republic or the Sith?;NM26AAECHM02000_.mp3
Neither.;
Then why are you wasting my time? There's big money to be made here - I can't risk missing a job offer 'cause I'm yapping with you!;NM26AAECHM02002_.mp3
That... human woman! I am... outraged at her arrogance. You! Do all of your species place yourselves on such annoying pedestals!;
I'm sorry? What are you talking about?;
"You should be sorry for sharing a species with that... that creature. I swear, ""Helena"" must be your word for pit rancor.";
Helena? Bastila, isn't that your mother's name?;
My mother was supposed to be here somewhere. Ask if they have seen her.;NM17AAXBAS12002_.mp3
Seen her? Human, you couldn't miss her if you tried. She strolled into the cantina like she owned the place.;
Is she still there?;
Probably. I don't think anyone else could top her attitude, so she won't be leaving. I won't be going back while she's there, though.;
We should try to find her. I doubt she wants to be kept waiting.;NM17AAXBAS12004_.mp3
You're actually looking for her? You humans, you're all out of your minds.;
Just get out of my way.;
Out of your way, out of her way. I've already left the cantina and now I can't walk down the street. Arrogant humans! All of you!;
You seem pretty hateful towards other species.;
What? No... but you don't understand. That woman, I think she didn't like us breathing the same air. You'd think she was queen of the planet.;
No offence, but your companion here looks especially like her.;
That messenger said my mother is on Tatooine somewhere. We should ask about her.;NM17AAXBAS12003_.mp3
If that woman is your mother, you have my sympathies. She's driving the regulars out of the cantina as we speak.;
I guess I don't mean to be so rude. She was so frustrating to deal with. If she felt she was too good for the cantina, why didn't she leave?;
Step back, fool! I don't like your tone!;
"See, that same attitude! That ""don't even talk to me"" look she had! I swear, ""Helena"" must be your word for pit rancor.";
Have you seen a woman that may resemble me somewhat? She is my mother.;NM17AAXBAS12000_.mp3
Ask whether they have seen my mother.;NM17AAXBAS12001_.mp3
I want to find out what my mother wanted. We need to find her.;NM17AAXBAS12005_.mp3
The Sith will want to cut off our escape. We'll stay here and protect the ships so we can get out of here once you stop Bastila!;NM45AAMALE06000_.mp3
The Sith will want to cut off our escape. We'll stay here and protect the ships so we can get out of here once Malak's dead!;NM45AAMALE06001_.mp3
D...don't hurt me... I'm just the janitor here. I don't know nothing that would be useful to you Sith!;NM02AAJANI05000_.mp3
Hey, there - watch where you're walking! I just cleaned these floors.;NM02AAJANI05002_.mp3
I'm sorry I was rude to you earlier.;
Well, alright then. No hard feelings.;NM02AAJANI05011_.mp3
Who are you again?;
I'm Kadir. I'm the janitor here! Geez, I know you're a new tenant and all but I didn't think you'd forget me already! I have feelings, you know!;NM02AAJANI05022_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;
Don't know how much I can tell you, but seeing as how you're new here I guess I can try and help you out.;NM02AAJANI05027_.mp3
Tell me about Taris.;
Decent enough place to live, I guess. Except for the lower levels. That's where the swoop gangs hang out. Just stay in the Upper City and you'll be fine.;NM02AAJANI05029_.mp3
You also might want to check out the cantina. I used to go there when I was younger. Good place to get a drink and find out what's going on in the Upper City.;NM02AAJANI05031_.mp3
Where is the cantina?;
Just keep following the apartment complex ring until you come to the elevator. It'll take you out to the Upper City streets. From there just head south a ways. You can't miss it.;NM02AAJANI05035_.mp3
I want to ask you something else.;
I'll be going now.;
I should get back to work anyway. I'll probably see you around - I'm here most of the time. This building doesn't clean itself, you know.;NM02AAJANI05046_.mp3
Where can I get some equipment?;
Well, the best place to go is probably Kebla Yurt's store. She's right across from the cantina, so you can stop in for a drink if you get thirsty while you're shopping.;NM02AAJANI05033_.mp3
What do you think of the Sith and this quarantine?;
Not much of an issue for me, you know? I ain't never left Taris and I ain't never going to. A lot of other folks is sure riled up about it, but I don't really know much about it.;NM02AAJANI05038_.mp3
I prefer to keep to myself, mostly. But there's plenty of people at the cantina who'll be more than happy to tell you what they think about the Sith and their quarantine.;NM02AAJANI05040_.mp3
Sorry, Kadir. I'm not good with faces.;
Yeah, okay then. No hard feelings. So, what can I do for you?;NM02AAJANI05024_.mp3
I've got more important things to worry about than remembering some janitor!;
Hmph! You'll change your tune the first time your plumbing breaks down and raw sewage floods your apartment. Then you'll be beggin' for Kadir to come help you out!;NM02AAJANI05014_.mp3
There's no need to antagonize the man. Besides... do you want to live in filth? I sure don't.;NM02AAJANI05016_.mp3
We'll see who has the last laugh then! Now if you ain't going to be civil then I got work to do. This place doesn't clean itself, you know!;NM02AAJANI05018_.mp3
This place is a dump! You should be fired!;
Hey, I do the best I can with the equipment I got! You're just like all the rest, complaining about me all the time.;NM02AAJANI05043_.mp3
Out of my way, old man!;
Oh, hello again. Hope you didn't come to make a complaint about the mess in the building. I keep asking for an assistant, but they expect me to do it all on my own.;NM02AAJANI05020_.mp3
Beep, boop, beep.;
I must congratulate you on your actions. You have saved Juhani and brought her back into the Order, and have given us all great hope for your future success. May the Force be with you as you continue your training.;NM13AAVROO18000_.mp3
I have heard what you have done, and how Juhani has been slain. I had hoped that this would not have to come to pass.;NM13AAVROO18001_.mp3
Could you find nothing in Juhani that could be redeemed?;NM13AAVROO18002_.mp3
I could not see a way to save her.;
I am skeptical of your methods and your intentions. But if nothing could be done, then that is the way of things.;NM13AAVROO18004_.mp3
Keep in mind the danger of the dark side, lest you fall into its grasp.;NM13AAVROO18005_.mp3
[Lie] She didn't give me a chance.;
[Success] I am skeptical of your methods and your intentions. But if nothing could be done, then that is the way of things.;NM13AAVROO18007_.mp3
[Lie] She was too far gone to the dark side.;
I see you insist on wandering the halls of our Enclave when you should be busy studying your lessons.;NM13AAVROO18009_.mp3
My training is going well.;
It appears that soon you will achieve the rank of Padawan. Master Zhar is most impressed with your progress. But I cannot help but wonder if you move forward too quickly.;NM13AAVROO18011_.mp3
I seek knowledge of the Jedi Code.;
You do not know the Jedi Code? Without knowledge of those doctrines all your training will be for naught! All Jedi must know the code, its tenets are the fundamental teachings of our Order!;NM13AAVROO18013_.mp3
"There is no emotion; there is peace. There is no ignorance; there is knowledge. There is no passion; there is serenity. There is no chaos; there is harmony. There is no death; there is the Force.";NM13AAVROO18014_.mp3
Learn these truths, apprentice... or we shall all regret the decision to accept you into the Order.;NM13AAVROO18015_.mp3
I would like to ask some questions.;
I suppose such desires are inevitable, though I fear you may seek knowledge for which you are not prepared. Yet I will do my best to guide your quest.;NM13AAVROO18017_.mp3
What can you tell me about Bastila?;
Bastila? The young Jedi holds great promise... and great danger. She can do much for both the Republic and the Council. Without her skill in Battle Meditation the Sith armada would have conquered the galaxy long ago.;NM13AAVROO18019_.mp3
But despite her command of the Force Bastila is still young. She is a Jedi, but she has not attained the rank of Master. The Council would do well to remember this before we lay the fate of the galaxy on her slender shoulders.;NM13AAVROO18020_.mp3
You would do well to focus more closely on your lessons. The Force is strong with you, but you need training and guidance in the ways of the Jedi, lest you suffer a fate similar to that of Revan.;NM13AAVROO18021_.mp3
Is there anything you can tell me about Revan and Malak?;
Revan was once a promosing Padawan. But ever eager to learn more about the Force, Revan sought knowledge of ancient Sith magics, foolishly ignoring the dangerous lure of the dark side.;NM13AAVROO18023_.mp3
When the Mandalorian invasion came, Revan seized the opportunity it presented. Many Jedi flocked to the Outer Rim to follow the charismatic young Knight... and many fell under the sway of the dark side.;NM13AAVROO18025_.mp3
What happened on the Outer Rim to corrupt Revan?;
I do not believe Revan and Malak were corrupted on the Outer Rim. They had begun their journey down the dark path long before the Mandalorian threat appeared.;NM13AAVROO18027_.mp3
Here on Dantooine they discovered a sinister cave, a place where the strength of the dark side overwhelms the light.;NM13AAVROO18028_.mp3
Perhaps this discovery was what first corrupted them... or perhaps they sought the cave out because they were already corrupted.;NM13AAVROO18029_.mp3
Whatever the explanation, the Order was unable to turn them back to the light. Had the Council taken more decisive action in this matter, perhaps Revan and Malak could have been stopped. But in this we failed.;NM13AAVROO18030_.mp3
I should be going now.;
You often seem angry with me, Master Vrook. Have I displeased you?;
If you find me overly critical, perhaps it is because you do not fully understand what is at stake. For fifteen thousand years the Republic has brought peace and stability to the galaxy.;NM13AAVROO18033_.mp3
Now the Republic may be destroyed because we, the Jedi, have failed them. Revan and Malak were paragons of the ideals the Order seeks to uphold, yet they succumbed to the temptations of the dark side.;NM13AAVROO18034_.mp3
When Revan fell, Malak took up the mantle of Dark Lord of the Sith. Should Malak be stopped, what is to stop another Jedi from taking his place? This is the burden we Masters must carry.;NM13AAVROO18035_.mp3
Only through strict training and relentless lessons can we prevent the Dark Master from being reborn.;NM13AAVROO18036_.mp3
That is why the Order can brook no failure in our apprentices and pupils. That is why I can accept nothing but perfection from you.;NM13AAVROO18037_.mp3
Why are you always criticizing me?;
Why does the Council not stop the Mandalorian raiders?;
So you heard about them, did you?;NM13AAVROO18040_.mp3
They have been harmless up until now. It is tragic that someone had to die before we took action.;NM13AAVROO18041_.mp3
You have our leave to deal with the murdering Mandalorian raiders should you encounter them.;NM13AAVROO18042_.mp3
I must be going now.;
Hmph! Well, get along then! Maybe you'll find the time to do something useful.;NM13AAVROO18044_.mp3
There was a battle near one of the southern estate recently. Many people were killed. Do you know anything about it?;NM13AAVROO18045_.mp3
[Lie] No, I was somewhere else.;
[Success] Hmph. Indeed. I cannot prove anything, but I have my suspicions. I will keep my eye on you, Padawan.;NM13AAVROO18047_.mp3
[Lie] That's horrible! I didn't know!;
[Lie] Perhaps it was Mandalorian raiders.;
Shen and Rahasia have been granted asylum here at the Enclave until they can find a way to deal with their families. I hear you had something to do with that.;NM13AAVROO18050_.mp3
It is the way of the Jedi to provide help to those in need, and you seem to have lived up to this duty. I congratulate you, Padawan.;NM13AAVROO18051_.mp3
It is well that you are still alive, Padawan, in that you have not yet managed to fail us completely. Why is it that you are now bothering me instead of seeking out the Star Map?;NM13AAVROO18052_.mp3
What can you tell me about the Sandral and Matale feud?;
The Sandrals and Matales have been at odds ever since they came to this planet. And have been making my life difficult the entire time, as well.;NM13AAVROO18054_.mp3
Now Ahlan Matale accuses Nurik Sandral of stealing his son, Shen. Nurik Sandral's own son Casus has been missing for a while now. We do not know what has happened.;NM13AAVROO18055_.mp3
Ahlan is rash enough, and stupid enough, to start a war over any imagined slight. We would resolve this, but we have too few Jedi to spare. It must be resolved peacefully!;NM13AAVROO18056_.mp3
Their estates are both located to the south of the Enclave - the Sandral fairly far. It would normally be your duty to assist in such matters, but your primary task takes precedence.;NM13AAVROO18057_.mp3
If you are stuck on the planet for a while you may investigate. I would recommend starting at the estate of Ahlan Matale.;NM13AAVROO18058_.mp3
You have a mission to attend to, Padawan. And as much as I may wish it otherwise, you are our only hope.;NM13AAVROO18072_.mp3
The Council has placed the fate of the galaxy within your hands. I pray both you and Bastila are able to emerge from this ordeal as servants of the light. May the Force be with you, young Padawan.;NM13AAVROO18075_.mp3
I have found the body of the Jedi Nemo. He was slain by kath hounds.;
Ah, Nemo. He was a brave and honorable man. He had great strength with the Force.;NM13AAVROO18060_.mp3
His strength was not enough...;
But remember your task, Padawan!;NM13AAVROO18062_.mp3
I would not have thought that kath hounds alone would be able to overcome him. Perhaps there was more...;NM13AAVROO18061_.mp3
It is a most grievous loss...;
What happened to Belaya?;
The Jedi Belaya would seem to have disappeared. She had a lesson scheduled with Master Zhar but did not show up.;NM13AAVROO18064_.mp3
I have heard someone say that she had been seen leaving the Enclave, but I do not know where she would have gone.;NM13AAVROO18065_.mp3
If you meet her, you may want to ask her why she left. We do not force anyone to stay here, so do not think to take that route.;NM13AAVROO18066_.mp3
Is there anything else, then?;NM13AAVROO18067_.mp3
I have slain Belaya on Korriban. She was a Dark Jedi.;
I find that... disturbing. It is our failings as teachers that enabled this to happen.;NM13AAVROO18069_.mp3
Do not give in to the same dark urges as she did or you may suffer a similar fate.;NM13AAVROO18070_.mp3
I am sorry, Master Vrook. I will go.;
As you strive to defeat our enemy, you must always guard against the enemy within yourself.;NM13AAVROO18073_.mp3
The easy lure of the dark side is difficult to resist, and I fear this quest to find this mysterious Star Forge will lead you down an all too familiar path.;NM13AAVROO18074_.mp3
For good or ill, you are now a true Padawan. The time has come for you and Bastila to investigate the dream you shared. The secrets to stopping Malak may lie hidden within the ancient Dantooine ruins you both saw in your visions.;NM13AAVROO18076_.mp3
I'm... I'm sorry. I don't want to get in the way of official Sith business.;NM02AAWOMA08000_.mp3
I remember when a person didn't have to worry about thieves rummaging through their home!;NM02AAWOMA08002_.mp3
Taris used to be a nice place, before the Sith showed up and started bossing us around!;NM02AAWOMA08004_.mp3
Stay out of the Lower City. That place is overrun with gangs!;NM02AAWOMA08006_.mp3
I wonder if any of those Republic space pods survived crash landing in the Undercity?;NM02AAWOMA08008_.mp3
Greetings, stranger. My name is Gelrood. Are you a Pazaak player, by chance? It's so hard for me to find a match now that I've been banned from the Upper City cantina.;NM03AEGELR12000_.mp3
I'll play.;
Excellent... my funds were getting somewhat low.;NM03AEGELR12002_.mp3
I don't have a Pazaak deck.;
You don't have a deck? Well, we can't play unless you have your own deck. Maybe you should go talk to Garouk in the Upper Cantina.;NM03AEGELR12006_.mp3
He's looking to retire from the game, so he might sell you his deck. He'll probably even throw in a free lesson for you. Just come back and speak to me when you get your deck.;NM03AEGELR12008_.mp3
Why were you banned?;
A simple misunderstanding. Some of the other Pazaak players don't understand the finer points of the game. So what if I won fifteen matches in a row? That doesn't mean I cheat!;NM03AEGELR12011_.mp3
There's no justice. My lucky Pazaak deck was confiscated and I was banned from the Upper Cantina! Since then I've been desperate to find a match.;NM03AEGELR12013_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;
If you want to ask questions go talk to Zax at the bounty office. He knows everything that's happening on Taris. I'm just here to play Pazaak. So do you want to play or not?;NM03AEGELR12015_.mp3
I'll be going now.;
If you're ever looking for a match and you get tired of the posturing in the Upper Cantina, just come down here and find me. I'll play you anytime.;NM03AEGELR12017_.mp3
You did well in our last match. But I think your luck may be about to run out. So, do you want to play again?;NM03AEGELR12019_.mp3
You played well in our last match, but luck just wasn't with you. Do you want to play again? I'm sure you'll do better this time.;NM03AEGELR12020_.mp3
I think you're cheating, Gelrood!;
How dare you accuse me of cheating! It's not my fault you lost - I'm just a good player with a strong deck. Maybe you just need more practice.;NM03AEGELR12022_.mp3
Or maybe you just need to buy some better cards. Go talk to Uriah over there. He can sell you some cards to improve your deck. Unless you want to play again right now?;NM03AEGELR12024_.mp3
Back again? Well, ever since I was banned from the Upper Cantina I've been desperate to find a good game of Pazaak. Do you want to play?;NM03AEGELR12025_.mp3
This isn't over, Malak!;NM40ACCART02000_.mp3
"Your friends do not give up easily, Revan; you always could inspire loyalty. But even the three of you together cannot stand against my power!";NM40ACCART02002_.mp3
For the Jedi!;NM40ACCART02008_.mp3
*Grunt*;
I'll hold Malak off. You two get out of here! Find the Star Forge!;NM40ACCART02004_.mp3
No, Bastila, he's too strong!;NM40ACCART02006_.mp3
NO!!;NM40ACCART02010_.mp3
The door's sealed, we can't get past! Come on, we have to get to the Ebon Hawk!;NM40ACCART02012_.mp3
What about Bastila? We have to help her!;
Bastila doesn't stand a chance against Malak, but we can't help her. Not here. We have to get off this ship and find the Star Forge. That's the key to beating the Dark Lord!;NM40ACCART02014_.mp3
Bastila sacrificed herself so we could get away. We can't let her sacrifice be in vain! Come on!;NM40ACCART02016_.mp3
Good idea. Let Bastila deal with Malak.;
Welcome to Manaan. There is a docking fee of 500 credits to gain access to Ahto City.;
500 credits? It used to be 100!;
We need to find other sources of revenue since kolto production has been so drastically scaled back.;
Why did you lower kolto production?;
For various political and economic reasons, the Selkath have limited the production of kolto. That is all you need to know, off-worlder.;
This is a Selkath matter, human - I won't discuss it with you anymore. Are you going to pay the 500 credit docking fee or not?;
Very well. Here is the docking fee.;
The Manaan board of trade and tourism thanks you, off-worlder. Here is a visitor guide to the city. Refer to it should you have any questions.;
The gates of Ahto city are now open to you. You may come and go as you please, so long as you do not leave the planet. If you do, you will have to pay the docking fee once more.;
[Force Persuade] I don't need to pay the docking fee.;
[Success] Ah. I see. Yes, you do not need to pay.;
*whisper* I can be pretty convincing when I have to be, but that mind trick is something else!;NGLOBEMISS13301_.mp3
*whisper* The Jedi Council wouldn't approve, but they always were a little stodgy about using the Force on people. Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.;NGLOBEJOLE09758_.mp3
*whisper* You should treat your power with respect, not use the Force on a whim like it is some toy!;NGLOBEJUHA11853_.mp3
*whisper* The Force is not a thing to be trifled with. Continue to use it frivolously and you may find yourself straying down the dark path.;NGLOBEBAST06898_.mp3
[Failure] You... you try to manipulate my mind off-worlder! We do not tolerate such insolence and disrespect for authority here on Manaan!;
You shall be detained and fined no less than 500 credits for this offence. If you cannot pay such a fine then you will rot in prison.;
I won't be paying the fee right now.;
Then you won't be passing the gates into Ahto city. Feel free to leave Manaan whenever you wish.;
Should you decide to pay the fee, speak to me again and I will give you access to Ahto City.;
Scaled back? Don't you really mean kolto production has been destroyed?;
How did you... uh, I mean...;
Welcome to Manaan. There will be a docking fee of 500 credits to access Ahto City at this time.;
Welcome to Manaan. While you are here, I trust you will follow all the rules governing the activities of off-worlders.;
Don't worry, I'll follow the rules.;
There is a docking fee of 100 credits. You will have to pay this fee each time you dock on Manaan, or you will not be permitted into Ahto city.;
[Persuade] Make it 50 credits and you got a deal.;
[Failure] The amount of the fee is legislated by the Manaan board of trade and tourism. I am not at liberty to haggle on this matter.;
What are the rules, exactly?;
The single most important law on Manaan is very simple. Kolto smuggling is punishable by death. If you're carrying any unprocessed kolto, you better have a permit.;
The other rule is also very simple - keep the peace. Here on Manaan we maintain a careful neutrality, and we react very harshly to people who jeopardize our neutral status.;
Any confrontations between the Sith and Republic are dealt with swiftly and decisively. Is this understood?;
I understand.;
That's it? Only two laws?;
Don't be foolish, human! Of course we have laws against murder, theft and other crimes. But these laws are hardly different than those of any other planet.;
Manaan's neutrality is closely linked to our kolto production - that is why I made special mention of the laws regarding smuggling and keeping the peace.;
How can you be neutral when the Sith are trying to conquer everything?;
The Sith respect the independence of Manaan as much as the Republic does. As long as we continue to control the production of a resource as valuable as kolto, we have no need to fear any conquering fleet.;
Should Manaan ever come under attack, we would destroy the supply of kolto and vanish beneath the oceans of our world. Even the Sith are not willing to risk the loss of a commodity as valuable as kolto.;
You seem to have it all worked out.;
That seems awfully short sighted...;
Your opinion is biased by your own alliances, human. Only we Selkath can best protect the interests of Manaan and Ahto city.;
Pathetic laws of pathetic fish don't concern me.;
Your dislike of us only seems matched by our dislike of you. Personal feelings do not factor into our legal system however. And ALL must obey our laws.;
I do not have time to talk to you, human. I have business to attend to.;
Can you tell me the laws of Manaan?;
The single most important law on Manaan is very simple. kolto smuggling is punishable by death. If you're carrying any unprocessed kolto, you better have a permit.;
This law is especially important since the Manaan government has decided to restrict kolto exports for an indeterminate amount of time.;
I will be going now.;
Good. Now you can stop bothering me. I have work to do.;
Don't hurt me! Please!;NM18AB13CR10000_.mp3
Well, you should speak with the Captain. He's the only officer we've got left.;NM18AB13CR10001_.mp3
Out of nowhere, they came! I don't think the Captain even saw them coming.;NM18AB13CR10002_.mp3
Barely got a shot off. That Captain will tell you all about it.;NM18AB13CR10003_.mp3
Dozens of them attacked. I think the Captain's afraid there are more out there.;NM18AB13CR10004_.mp3
They were like animals. It was horrible.;NM18AB13CR10005_.mp3
These Sand People are vicious. They attacked without any reason.;NM18AB13CR10006_.mp3
Thanks for your help. I hope there's no more of those animals out there.;NM18AB13CR10007_.mp3
I guess I'm lucky to be alive. No more of this for me, that's for sure.;NM18AB13CR10008_.mp3
Is it safe? Heh. Is anywhere safe? I don't think so.;NM18AB13CR10009_.mp3
They should all be wiped out. Every last one of them.;NM18AB13CR10010_.mp3
How am I supposed to make a living with this going on?;NM18AB13CR10011_.mp3
What choice do we have? They have to be killed. All of them.;NM18AB13CR10012_.mp3
Kolto sales seem to have dropped off considerably. The Selkath are no longer exporting it, it seems. A lot of them act like they're blaming us...;NM26ACREPS12000_.mp3
I'm sorry, I'm on duty, citizen. Please refer any questions to our diplomatic corp. Thank you.;NM26ACREPS12001_.mp3
What do YOU want?;NM13AASAMN15000_.mp3
Now, Samnt, don't be so rude. If it wasn't for this young Jedi, we wouldn't have met.;NM13AASAMN15002_.mp3
Nurik extends his thanks to you for your actions with regards to his daughter Rahasia. I am sure that she and Shen will thank you personally once they have been settled in.;NM14ADSDRO04028_.mp3
You are not permitted to speak to Rahasia, on Nurik's orders. Please leave immediately.;NM14ADSDRO04029_.mp3
Nurik has nothing more to say to you. He left strict instructions he was not to be disturbed under any circumstances.;NM14ADSDRO04030_.mp3
This is private property! By what authority are you trespassing on this estate?;NM14ADSDRO04008_.mp3
I come on behalf of the Jedi Council.;
The Council? If you are here because of Shen Matale's disappearance you are wasting your time. The Sandrals are not involved. This is nothing but a Matale witch hunt.;NM14ADSDRO04010_.mp3
I am not in league with the Matales, but I must speak to Nurik.;
Nurik left orders he was not to be disturbed, but given the circumstances I will make an exception. Go into the main hall. Nurik will meet with you there.;NM14ADSDRO04026_.mp3
My orders are clear. Please leave immediately. Only those on official family business are permitted on the family's land.;NM14ADSDRO04016_.mp3
In the name of the Council, I demand you let me in!;
Very well. We wish no trouble with the Jedi Council.;NM14ADSDRO04013_.mp3
Casus Sandral is dead.;
Casus is dead? Then it is as we feared. You should speak to Nurik yourself. He will want to question you on the details of his son's death.;NM14ADSDRO04024_.mp3
I'm sorry, I'll be going now.;
My weapons are my authority!;
I am not programmed for battle, but I will not open the gates except for those on official family business.;NM14ADSDRO04019_.mp3
Even if you destroy me, you will not be able to get in. And tomorrow, another droid will be programmed to take over my duties.;NM14ADSDRO04021_.mp3
I've not seen you here before, human. You are new to the bounty office, yes? My name is Zax - I'm the one in charge here.;
"Are you looking for work? There are many bounties available here; legal and otherwise. But they all pay quite well.";
Or are you here for information? Everyone knows I'm one of Davik's best agents... I'm the Hutt with all the answers.;
Gurney said I should speak to you about the rakghoul serum.;
You have the rakghoul serum? It's worth 1000 credits to Davik.;
Why does Davik want the serum so badly?;
Medicine is big business. If people are sick with the rakghoul disease they need the cure. Davik can charge anything he wants and people will still pay.;
Davik plans to prey on the sick? That's monstrous!;
What do you care? You're not sick. You give me the serum, I'll give you 1000 credits. You won't get a better deal anywhere else.;
Here's the serum. Give me the 1000 credits.;
Here's the credits. Davik will be very pleased when he see this. Very pleased, indeed. Now, what else do you need?;
I need some information.;
I have information, but it's not free. For a fee I'll tell you everything you want about the street gangs, Davik - other stuff, too. But first you have to come up with 100 credits.;
Here's 100 credits.;
"Good. Now that you've paid the fee you can come back and ask questions anytime. You won't have to pay again; nobody ever said I wasn't a fair Hutt.";
What do you want information on now? Gangs? Davik? Other stuff?;
Tell me about those escape pods that crashed into the Undercity.;
Escape pods? You shouldn't bother with them. When they crashed the Black Vulkar gang got there first and cleaned them out.;
If there was anything valuable inside those crash pods it's inside the Vulkar base now.;
I need to get inside the Black Vulkar base.;
Why? You need to get shot full of blaster holes? Only the Vulkars get into the Vulkar base... unless... maybe the Hidden Beks could help you out.;
You got a problem with the Vulkars, you go see Gadon Thek. He's the leader of the Hidden Beks, a rival gang. He's a smart man - maybe he can help you.;
Tell me about the Lower City gangs.;
There are two main gangs - the Black Vulkars and the Hidden Beks. Used to be the Beks ran things, but now the Vulkars have a new leader. Brejik wants to take over for himself.;
But the Vulkars are out of control now. They've sealed their base and they're shooting people in the streets. Sometimes they don't even pay Davik the money they owe him.;
Things were much better with Gadon and the Beks in charge. Gadon's a smart man - he knows how to keep peace. Maybe if the Beks win this gang war things will go back to normal.;
I want information on something else.;
I'll be going now.;
Goodbye, human. You come back if you want to earn credits. Bounties pay good money. And remember to come see me if you want information.;
Is there some way I can get off this planet?;
The Sith quarantine has grounded all the vehicles. Everyone wants to leave, but it's just not possible. Davik has the fastest ship in the sector, but even he can't get off the planet.;
The Sith fleet is orbiting Taris, and they use auto-targeting cannons. If a ship takes off those cannons will disintegrate it instantly, unless it had broadcast the launch codes.;
Codes? What codes?;
The Sith use launch codes when they leave the planet. If you transmit them from your ship, the auto-targeting cannons won't fire at you. Only people with the codes can leave Taris.;
The codes were locked up in the military base, but somebody broke in recently. Maybe to steal the codes. But even if someone had the codes, how would they get a ship?;
No, there's no way to get off Taris. You'd need a ship, the launch codes - and even then the Sith fighters would chase you down. We're all stuck here - even Davik.;
Tell me about Davik.;
"Davik's a busy man - he runs lower Taris. Before the Sith came he almost run Upper Taris, too. Extortion, slavery, smuggling; Davik controls it all.";
He's part of the Exchange - a big intergalactic crime syndicate. You'd be smart to stay on his good side. Even the Sith know better than to pick a fight with Davik on Taris.;
I want to meet Davik.;
Ha-ha-ha! You can't meet Davik. Nobody meets Davik unless Davik wants to meet them. Even I only meet Davik once, long ago.;
He's the king of the Lower City - he doesn't just walk around here like you or me. Davik stays in his estate and works through agents, like that big Mandalorian Canderous Ordo.;
But the Sith keep the codes locked up safe in the military base. Nobody gets in there - too dangerous. And even if someone did get the codes, where are they going to get a ship?;
I want to ask about something else.;
Okay, human. What do you want to know?;
Tell me about the bounties.;
You don't intend on working as a bounty hunter, do you? What need could you possibly have for so many credits?;NM03AE_ZAX22084_.mp3
It couldn't hurt, could it? Enough credits could help grease a lot of wheels.;NM03AE_ZAX22086_.mp3
Getting paid to murder others is hardly justifiable. It is a path that could easily lead to the dark side.;NM03AE_ZAX22088_.mp3
Well, it's my experience that the targets of these bounties are usually criminals, themselves. So don't get all in a twist over it.;NM03AE_ZAX22090_.mp3
"I'll ""get in a twist"" if I think it is called for, Carth. I simply suggest we should use caution if we intend to participate in this... business.";NM03AE_ZAX22092_.mp3
There's two government contracts. One's an assassin named Selven, the other is Bendak Starkiller. He's a famous death-match duelist. Between them they've killed hundreds of people.;
I can't see anything wrong with getting rid of people like that - as long as we don't end up on the list of their victims.;NM03AE_ZAX22195_.mp3
But not all the bounties are dangerous. Davik got some special contracts. One's for a girl named Dia - she attacked Holdan, one of Davik's men. Another's for a man named Largo who owes Davik money.;
Okay, I don't know about Davik's special contracts. Justice is one thing, but doing a crime lord's dirty work is something else.;NM03AE_ZAX22196_.mp3
And then there's Matrik. He used to work for Davik, then he betrayed the Exchange and now Davik wants him dead. I'll put all this information in your datapad.;
I want more details on the bounties you're offering.;
All the information is in your data-pad already, but if you don't want to look there then I guess I can fill you in. Who do you want to know more about?;
Tell me about the assassin Selven.;
Is this a joke, human? We've already dealt with that bounty! Why are you asking about it now? It's over. Don't waste my time with old bounties!;
I have more questions about the bounties.;
Okay, this is the bounty office, so it's the right place to ask about bounties. What's your question?;
Davik's bounties sound more like contract killings.;
Davik works for the Exchange. They don't play games. If you don't pay your debts or you betray them or you attack them they get even. People bring Davik's bounty on themselves.;
Anyway, if you don't like them you don't have to take them. Collect the other bounties - government contracts. Those people are ruthless killers. They need to be stopped.;
How do I collect the credits for these contracts?;
It's simple - you find people, you kill them, you tell me, I pay you. I know everything that's going on in Taris. So if you kill one of them I'll know.;
I've got a bounty I want to collect on.;
A bounty? Well, human, that is what I'm here for. Which bounty are you here to collect on?;
[Tell him about Matrik.];
The traitor Matrik is now a dead traitor. This is a lesson for anyone thinking about turning against the Exchange.;
Here - 300 credits. That's the price for all bounties.;
Thanks. Pleasure doing business with you.;
You do good work, human. There's lots of bounty hunters on Taris, but most are lazy. Maybe if you keep cashing in bounties they'll work harder.;
[Persuade] I want 400 credits for this job.;
[Success] You're brave, human, to bargain with a Hutt. But I like you. Okay, 400 it is!;
[Failure] You don't bargain with me! This is my business - I set the prices, not you! You take 300 or you get nothing!;
Sorry, I just lost my head. I'll take the 300.;
You'll up that reward if you know what's good for you, Zax!;
You're not too smart, human. Smart people don't threaten agents of Davik. You don't scare me, but you just made me mad. Maybe you need learn lesson.;
Maybe I just won't pay you anything for this bounty? That would teach you some respect, wouldn't it? You want to reconsider and take the 300, human?;
You can't talk to me like this!;
Yes, I can, and there's nothing you can do about it. There's a security system in this building - you attack me and you'll be vaporised. Go away, human. Next time you'll know better.;
[Lie: Tell him Matrik is dead.];
I believe you, human. I've heard reports of a rather large explosion, and some of my people saw you buying the permacrete detonator.;
It's good Matrik's dead but maybe you went overboard, human. Next time use a blaster, not a bomb! Bombs are messy. But at least the job is done.;
[Tell him about Bendak.];
So, you killed Bendak in death-match duel. Ironic, isn't it? Bendak has a bounty on him for killing people in duel, and you collect it by killing him in a death-match.;
[Tell him about Selven.];
So Selven's dead. All the other bounty hunters who went after her ended up dead themselves, you know. You did well, human.;
[Tell him about Dia.];
Too bad. Dia was a nice girl. But she attacked Holdan, and Holdan works for Davik. That was just stupid.;
[Tell him about Largo.];
Largo should have known better than to run. Maybe now people will learn the lesson: you owe Davik money, you pay!;
"Selven's a government bounty; she's a very dangerous woman. When she started she was just another killer working for Davik. Then she began freelancing to the highest bidder.";
One day she killed six citizens in the street... and their bodyguards, too. They were all Ulgos, a powerful merchant family with many enemies. Selven was hired to kill off the whole family.;
"She was very good at her job. Each day, more Ulgos died. Poisoned at home, shot down in the street; guards and droids couldn't protect them. After a month there were no Ulgos left on Taris. Not one.";
Did they ever find out who hired Selven to kill them all?;
It was never proven. But after the Ulgos were all dead, the Organa family demanded the government put out a contract on Selven. They said nobody was safe as long as Selven was still free.;
But the Organa family were powerful rivals of the Ulgos. Some think they were the ones who hired Selven, then they tried to have bounty hunters kill her to keep the secret from coming out.;
But Taris politics aren't your concern. You're just a bounty hunter. You kill Selven, you get the credits. That's the only important thing, right?;
I want to ask you about one of the other bounties.;
I want to ask you something else.;
Okay, but this is the bounty office. This is a place of business, so what kind of business have you got?;
Tell me about Bendak Starkiller.;
Bendak's a government contract, but he's a legend on Taris. He started out as duelist in the Upper Cantina. He never lost, but he only fought death matches. He killed hundreds in his day.;
Then death matches got banned. Duel rings switched to non-lethal combat. But Bendak wasn't ready to retire. He keep dueling on the illegal, underground circuit. He kept killing people.;
Finally the government had no choice but to put a bounty out on him. But Bendak's a big folk hero, so not too many try to collect. Those who do all wind up dead, anyway.;
Tell me about this girl Dia.;
Wait - I almost forgot. That bounty's been pulled, human. Holdan told me he doesn't want her dead anymore. Sorry, no credits for Dia.;
Dia's one of Davik's private bounties. She used be a waitress in the cantina here until she had a fight with Holdan. She cut him with her vibroblade, almost killed him. That was a mistake.;
Holdan works for Davik, he's not one to let her get away with that. When he was recovering in the medical bay, he put out a bounty on Dia. She's been hiding ever since.;
I get the feeling there's more to this story.;
Maybe. Doesn't really matter to me. I get the bounty from Davik's men, I don't ask questions. You can talk to Holdan if you want to know more - he's inside the cantina.;
Tell me about this merchant Largo.;
Actually, now that I think of it that bounty's no longer on the table. Davik told me Largo's bounty is off the table. I guess the merchant came up with the credits. Don't bother with that one anymore, human.;
He's nothing special, just another of Davik's private bounties. He borrowed money from Davik for his business. But things went bad and he wasn't able to pay Davik back. So he ran.;
Davik doesn't like it when people who owe him money run. He put out a contract on Largo to send a message to the other merchants who owe him money.;
Tell me about Matrik.;
Davik is very interested in this bounty. Matrik used to work for Davik. He wasn't important, but he was there a long time. He saw lots of things that it was wise to keep quiet about.;
Then one day he betrayed Davik. He went to the Taris authorities and testified at trials against the Exchange. Lots of people were arrested and Davik's operations shut down for a while.;
It cost Davik thousands and thousands of credits to get business back on track, and he lost lots of good people. Of course he's not about to let Matrik get away with that.;
But didn't the government protect Matrik after the trials?;
They hid Matrik for a while, but when the Sith took over they shut the witness protection program down. It's expensive, and the Sith didn't care if Matrik died.;
[Persuade] That seems a little high just for information. I'll give you 50 credits.;
[Success] This Sith quarantine makes it hard to earn credits. And Davik gets mad when his agents don't bring in enough.;
Okay, give me 50 credits. But don't tell anyone I gave you a deal or everyone will want a bargain and I'll go out of business.;
[Failure] Sorry, human.  If you get a break on the price then I have to give everyone a deal. I won't let you whittle my prices down! If you can't pay, then I won't talk.;
Maybe you could take some bounties and earn some money? Then you could afford to pay for my information. You're happy, I'm happy, Davik gets his cut... it works out for everyone.;
You work for Davik?;
Not officially, no. I work for the bounty office. But Davik pays me to keep my eyes open and report to him... and for me to post his bounties.;
Davik posts bounties in a government office? Is that even legal?;
I used to have to keep our relationship secret, but since the Sith arrived nobody cares what happens in the Lower City. Davik can do whatever he wants.;
But enough talk - back to business. This is the bounty office, so we should talk bounties. Or are you looking for information?;
You don't try to hide the fact that Davik has you on his payroll?;
I can't afford that much.;
Then we don't do business. Davik pays me to earn credits, not to answer questions. If you don't pay, then I don't talk.;
I'm not going to pay just to ask you some questions.;
[Persuade] I've got the serum, but I want 1500 credits for it!;
[Success] You're brave, human, to bargain with a Hutt. But I like you. Okay, 1500 it is.;
[Failure] You don't get to bargain with me! I make you an offer, and you take it or you don't. But you don't get to negotiate a new price!;
Forget it. I'll just give the serum to Zelka.;
Ha-ha-ha! Zelka can't pay you for the serum - he's broke! You go see Zelka. I'll be here when you come to senses and see that 1000 credits is better than no credits.;
I don't have the serum.;
You find the serum, you come see me. Davik wants the serum, and I'll pay good money to get it for him. The same price as for the bounties.;
Back again, human? I hope you didn't come just to chat. Davik hired me to do business and make credits, not to make small talk.;
The spies of Chuundar have followed you as closely as possible, <FullName>. They tell me you have killed the mad-claw.;
Take me up so I can speak with Chuundar.;
I will take you directly to him. He is waiting in the throne room.;
I'm not ready to go up. I'll be back later.;
Very well. I will wait here for you to return.;
That mad-claw was Freyyr, Chuundar's father.;
That is not my concern, outsider. I serve Chuundar and no other.;
You! <FullName>! Our spies say that the mad-claw you were sent to kill is on his way to Rwookrrorro right now!;
You should have followed the will of Chuundar! Now you will face his wrath!;
Now this is what I live for!;NM24AAGORW04010_.mp3
Hello again, <FullName>. I've heard nothing of your progress, so I will assume there hasn't been any.;
I'll take you back to the surface, but you must do Chuundar's task. Don't keep him waiting.;
Just take me up for now.;
Very well. Just one moment.;
I'd like to ask you some questions.;
I'll operate the basket, as Chuundar has commanded, but I won't answer your questions while I stand in the Shadowlands.;
This place is sacred ground. Many of my kind have proven themsleves here, and many have died as well.;
You aren't worthy of this place. I won't speak to you while we're here.;
Wow, are you really a noble? You must be pretty rich, right? Is your family important?;NM02AECHRI05000_.mp3
I can trace my lineage back five generations to one of the founding houses of Taris. In fact... uh, we seem to have some unexpected company, my darling.;NM02AECHRI05002_.mp3
Oh, don't pay any attention to him. He's just some Pazaak player I met. He's not an actual noble, like you! C'mon, sweetie... let's go back to your mansion.;NM02AECHRI05004_.mp3
I saw your match against Niklos. He doesn't lose very often. I bet you could make a lot of credits as a professional Pazaak player!;NM02AECHRI05006_.mp3
"You know, you're my kind of guy; rich and handsome - just the way I like them. Why don't we slip away to the tap room together?";NM02AECHRI05008_.mp3
The bartender can mix us up something special for only twenty credits. If you play your cards right Pazaak might not be the only game you get lucky at tonight.;NM02AECHRI05010_.mp3
Sounds good to me! Here's 20 credits.;
I love a man who's not afraid to spend his credits! I'll meet you in the tap room. Don't be too long - I'm not a patient girl.;NM02AECHRI05012_.mp3
20 credits? That seems expensive for a couple of drinks.;
Well, I'm used to the finer things in life. I'm not about to lower my standards for any man. So how about it - you want me to get those drinks for us?;NM02AECHRI05015_.mp3
I don't have that much on me.;
Really? You must not be as good at Pazaak as I thought. Well, I'm not going to waste my time with some penniless gambler!;NM02AECHRI05017_.mp3
Suddenly I find you very boring. Maybe I can find someone more interesting in the tap room.;NM02AECHRI05019_.mp3
Sorry, not interested.;
What's the matter, you shy? Suit yourself. I'll be here if you change your mind, just waiting for a nice, rich Pazaak player to come along...;NM02AECHRI05022_.mp3
I saw your match against Niklos - if you could even call it that. You aren't much of a Pazaak player, are you?;NM02AECHRI05025_.mp3
Don't you love watching the Pazaak players? All that strategy. All those credits... It's enough to make a girl get all flushed!;NM02AECHRI05027_.mp3
Beep beep beep-oop!;NM35AADROI01000_.mp3
This isn't good. I can't afford this.;NM22ABDEHN06000_.mp3
You think I can? Do you know what they get for a healthy one of these things?;NM22ABDEHN06002_.mp3
We'll work it out later. We've got company.;NM22ABDEHN06004_.mp3
What do you want, spacer? I'm Patrol Captain Dehno and you're interrupting Czerka Corporation business.;NM22ABDEHN06006_.mp3
My name is <FullName>. What happened here?;
This Wookiee slave got a little... rebellious. We had to put it down.;NM22ABDEHN06008_.mp3
"You ""put *it* down""? We're not animals!";
Zaalbar, let me handle this.;
But their disregard for the life of this Wookiee is too much!;
I have asked you to let me handle this. Honor my request.;
I will do so. For your sake, not theirs.;
Careful now... that growl sounded pretty threatening. Keep your slave on its leash or we'll have another accident.;NM22ABDEHN06012_.mp3
Just shut up, you trigger-happy idiot.;NM22ABDEHN06022_.mp3
Do your superiors approve of you killing Wookiees?;
No, of course they don't. Why would you ask me that? Are you doing some sort of snap inspection?;NM22ABDEHN06024_.mp3
You're trying to get me to admit to incompetence, aren't you? Not going to happen. I stand by my patrol.;NM22ABDEHN06026_.mp3
This Wookiee got out of hand and *had* to be put down. We'll find another easy enough.;NM22ABDEHN06028_.mp3
This may cost you more than you know, fool.;
It... is a bit costly. Look, why are you asking this?;NM22ABDEHN06030_.mp3
[Persuade/Lie] You know why. Hand over compensation or this gets reported.;
[Success] What... you're a Czerka inspector, aren't you! Slimy little... I've heard about these shake-downs.;NM22ABDEHN06032_.mp3
*whisper* I do not approve of this game you are playing! This Wookiee's death is a tragedy, not a chance for your profit.;NM22ABDEHN06112_.mp3
*whisper* The Jedi should be protectors of the weak! You shame us all by your actions here.;NM25AAHURT03072_.mp3
Give it up, men. If we don't pay this leech we'll get a black mark on our records a sunspot couldn't burn off.;NM22ABDEHN06034_.mp3
But I, I... if you say so, sir. I don't think we have enough... here.;NM22ABDEHN06036_.mp3
That will be fine. Thank you.;
Yes, I'm sure it will be. If I see anything on our records I'll have you fed to a katarn. In bite-sized chunks.;NM22ABDEHN06038_.mp3
You lied to gain profit from the death of this Wookiee? You may as well have killed him yourself.;
I can't change what they did. Why not profit?;
You can't justify this. Don't try.;
Uh, if we're done here, we have a patrol to get back to.;NM22ABDEHN06047_.mp3
Shut up. I do as I wish.;
So I see.;
I like the way you handled that. Are you sure you don't have some Mandalorian blood in you?;NGLOBECAND03475_.mp3
I'm glad Big Z isn't here to see this. I don't know if he could handle it.;NM22ABDEHN06110_.mp3
It's a good thing Zaalbar isn't here to see this. I doubt he'd approve of what you're doing. Actually, I don't know if I approve, either.;NM22ABDEHN06111_.mp3
Now, if you don't mind, we have a patrol to get back to.;NM22ABDEHN06048_.mp3
I demand more!;
You are making this difficult. You know, maybe it's too much trouble to pay you. Maybe there's a better way.;NM22ABDEHN06050_.mp3
I think this troublemaker needs an accident. In fact, I think this Wookiee attacked this fool and we arrived just a little too late to help.;NM22ABDEHN06057_.mp3
Observation: I think this meatbag has hostile intentions, Master! This is going to be fun!;NM22ABDEHN06108_.mp3
Uh, Captain, we have blasters. Don't Wookiees use those bowcaster things?;NM22ABDEHN06059_.mp3
Would you just shut up and shoot?;NM22ABDEHN06061_.mp3
I'll just take it from your corpse then!;
What the...? Blasters ready, men! This fool wants to die!;NM22ABDEHN06071_.mp3
[Failure] What are you trying to get away with here? You can't just walk up and start demanding things.;NM22ABDEHN06053_.mp3
And who are you to stop us, little man?;NM22ABDEHN06055_.mp3
[Force Persuade] You want to pay me so this stays off your record.;
[Success] I... I think I should probably pay you so this stays off my record. Yes, that's best.;NM22ABDEHN06064_.mp3
Uh, Captain.... what's going on? Is this one of those inspector shake-downs?;NM22ABDEHN06066_.mp3
I won't allow you to enslave or kill another Wookiee.;
Is that a joke? Who do you think you are?;NM22ABDEHN06069_.mp3
[Persuade] This posting is trouble, friend. Get out while you can.;
[Success] You make some sense. I wonder, what do you know about what might happen here?;NM22ABDEHN06074_.mp3
Men, I think we should petition for a transfer. The corporation will survive a fight here, but us frontline guards won't.;NM22ABDEHN06076_.mp3
If... you say so, Captain.;NM22ABDEHN06078_.mp3
Yes, I say so. Move out. This place just isn't worth the trouble.;NM22ABDEHN06080_.mp3
[Force Persuade] Request a transfer. Move your patrol off-world.;
[Success] I... I think I should pull in some favors and... get us moved off-world, men.;NM22ABDEHN06083_.mp3
Uh, are you all right, Captain?;NM22ABDEHN06085_.mp3
Are you questioning my orders? You don't want to do that.;NM22ABDEHN06087_.mp3
It doesn't matter. You won't enslave another wookiee!;
It doesn't matter. I'll end your miserable life where you stand!;
I don't actually care, one way or another.;
Well... all right then. Carry on. We've work to do here.;NM22ABDEHN06090_.mp3
Thanks for taking care of that, Captain.;NM22ABDEHN06092_.mp3
You shut up. I'm not done with you two.;NM22ABDEHN06094_.mp3
Tell me about Czerka Corp.;
The company has branches on many planets. I'm just a Patrol Captain. It's not my job to monitor it all.;NM22ABDEHN06096_.mp3
If you want quotes on policy, get someone else. I just escort the slaves and guard this area.;NM22ABDEHN06098_.mp3
I have questions about Kashyyyk.;
You mean Edean? Backwater world.;NM22ABDEHN06100_.mp3
There are a few patrols in the lower areas, but I haven't heard what they are after.;NM22ABDEHN06102_.mp3
I'm leaving. Never mind.;
Good. Watch yourself. These old paths are dangerous.;NM22ABDEHN06104_.mp3
Mind your place, Zaalbar! Remember your debt!;
I will honor my debt, but I can barely stomach this.;
Does this make you mad, Zaalbar? I bet it does.;
What are you getting at? Do you want these men dead? I would not need much encouraging!;
Control yourself. Let me take care of this.;
Do it. Kill them. We'll make them pay.;
You murdered him!;NM22ABDEHN06014_.mp3
That's right! We had to do it and it shouldn't come out of our pay.;NM22ABDEHN06020_.mp3
Put it down? You... you murdered him?;NM22ABDEHN06016_.mp3
Put it down? You killed him, you mean.;NM22ABDEHN06018_.mp3
Just hurry up and tell me what happened.;
What is it now? If you don't mind, I have important matters to discuss with my patrol.;NM22ABDEHN06105_.mp3
What are you doing back here? Look, you got what you wanted, so just let us get back to corralling these animals.;NM22ABDEHN06106_.mp3
I'm sorry, I'm on duty, citizen. Please refer any questions to our diplomatic corp. Thank you.;NM26ACREPS12001_.mp3
Hey, there. Say - I don't recognize you... you must be one of those new lab techs, right? What are you doing over here on the mechanics' side of the building? You lost, rookie?;NM10ABVULK06000_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;
Can't say I blame you. They don't tell you new hires much, do they? Heh. Just throw you in the deep end and expect you to swim. Terrible way to run things, if you ask me.;NM10ABVULK06002_.mp3
If you've got a question, just ask. I'll be happy to help. Don't be shy - the only stupid question is the one you don't ask. At least, that's what they say.;NM10ABVULK06007_.mp3
Where are they keeping that prototype swoop engine accelerator?;
The accelerator? It's down in the garage, of course. The service elevator is the only way in. But you lab techs aren't allowed down there.;NM10ABVULK06009_.mp3
That's a restricted area. Only people with authorization cards, like us mechanics, can get past the laser cannons guarding the service elevator.;NM10ABVULK06012_.mp3
Where can I get a mechanic's authorization card?;
All mechanics have to store their authorization cards in the locker room when we're off duty. That's the rule. My own card is locked up right now - I put it away as soon as my shift was over.;NM10ABVULK06020_.mp3
And I'm not about to lend my card out to anyone. You know how much trouble we can get into if Brejik finds out we aren't keeping our authorization cards properly secured?;NM10ABVULK06022_.mp3
Of course, not all the mechanics here follow the rules as closely as they should. I've even heard of a few guys trading their cards for a spice fix! Heh. Stupid addicts.;NM10ABVULK06024_.mp3
You better go get me that card if you want to live!;
You think just 'cause I'm a nice old man I can't defend myself? You got another thing coming, punk!;NM10ABVULK06039_.mp3
I want to ask you something else.;
Sure, I'll help you however I can. I remember what it was like my first day here.;NM10ABVULK06027_.mp3
How can I get past the security system protecting the garage service elevator on the first floor?;
What's wrong with the heat in this place?;
There's nothing wrong with the heating system. Brejik just yanked the magnetic power cell out. All you have to do is pop that cell back in and the system is up and running again.;NM10ABVULK06029_.mp3
But until we figure out a way to make the heat work without disabling the thermal security system on the garage elevator, that cell's going to stay locked away in the Control Room.;NM10ABVULK06031_.mp3
Time for you to die, old man!;
I'll be going now.;
Okay, then. If you need anything else, just come see me. I remember what it was like my first day.;NM10ABVULK06033_.mp3
Could I borrow your authorization card?;
Give me your authorization card or I'll kill you!;
Hey, now - that kind of talk won't win you many friends with the other lab techs! Of course, the Vulkar gang members might take a shine to you.;NM10ABVULK06016_.mp3
In any case, threatening me won't help you - I don't even have my card on me.;NM10ABVULK06018_.mp3
Where is your card?;
I need information, so start talking or I'll put a blaster hole in your chest!;
Hey, now... no need to be that way! Leave the violence to the Vulkar gang members, okay? We mechanics and lab techs are more civilized than that, right?;NM10ABVULK06005_.mp3
Sorry... wrong room. I'll be going now.;
No problem. I was always getting lost my first day too, rookie. I look forward to working with you.;NM10ABVULK06036_.mp3
Back again, rookie? How things going? Everyone treating you okay? Is there something you need?;NM10ABVULK06041_.mp3
I do not lose at Pazaak very often, but you have made a habit of beating me. I think it is obvious what that means - you cheat!;NM02AENIKL28036_.mp3
You can't make an accusation like that without proof!;
I haven't been able to figure out how, but I know you're cheating. I'm simply too good to lose this often. And I refuse to play Pazaak with a cheater.;NM02AENIKL28038_.mp3
Geez, what sore loser! I haven't seen this much whining since I gave Zaalbar that bath!;NM02AENIKL28040_.mp3
You can leave now, cheater. I won't be wasting anymore time with you.;NM02AENIKL28042_.mp3
It's not my fault you're bad at Pazaak.;
Don't be a sore loser. I just want to ask you some questions.;
You cheat me out of my hard earned credits, and you expect me to answer your questions?;NM02AENIKL28046_.mp3
Goodbye.;
Goodbye, cheater.;NM02AENIKL28011_.mp3
If you ever wish to test yourself against the best Pazaak player on Taris, heh, you know where to find me.;NM02AENIKL28013_.mp3
You were lucky to win the last match. But luck is no substitute for skill in Pazaak. If you are foolish enough to play me again I won't repeat the mistake of underestimating you.;NM02AENIKL28048_.mp3
You think it was luck? Let's do it again!;
I'm going to enjoy relieving you of your credits almost as much as I'm going to enjoy humiliating you. Ha ha ha.;NM02AENIKL28034_.mp3
Let's play.;
I want to ask you some questions.;
Questions? Heh. I don't come here to answer questions. If you want to play Pazaak, let's play. If not, then quit crowding my gaming table.;NM02AENIKL28004_.mp3
I want to play Pazaak, but I don't have a deck.;
You don't even have your own deck? Then why are you bothering me? You can't play Pazaak without your own deck!;NM02AENIKL28006_.mp3
If you're serious about Pazaak, go speak to old Garouk on the other side of the tavern. His gambling days are over, and he's looking to sell his deck.;NM02AENIKL28008_.mp3
Who are you?;
My name is Niklos. I'm the unofficial champion of the Pazaak circuit here on Taris. If you don't mind losing your wager we could play a few hands.;NM02AENIKL28002_.mp3
Sorry, not interested right now.;
Pazaak is not for everyone - it requires both nerve and skill. Perhaps you should practice before risking your credits against such a skilled player as myself. Heh heh heh. Unless you like losing?;NM02AENIKL28051_.mp3
Deal the cards - I'm going to wipe that smirk off your face!;
Confidence is inspiring in one who has such a propensity for failure. Foolish, heh, but inspiring.;NM02AENIKL28053_.mp3
What do you want? Have you come here just to bother me, or do you wish to test yourself against the best Pazaak player on Taris? Heh heh heh.;NM02AENIKL28000_.mp3
I saw you getting a Pazaak lesson from that old fossil Garouk. Learning the rules of Pazaak is easy, but actually playing the game is a much greater challenge.;NM02AENIKL28030_.mp3
Normally I wouldn't bother with a novice like you, but since Gelrood was banned for hustling cards I haven't been able to find a good game around here. Do you wish to play a hand?;NM02AENIKL28032_.mp3
Back again? Well... do you have a deck yet? Would you like to play some Pazaak?;NM02AENIKL28055_.mp3
Who are you again?;
I don't have a deck yet.;
You still don't have a deck? Then why are you bothering me? Until you get a deck from Garouk we have nothing to discuss.;NM02AENIKL28058_.mp3
[The droid does not respond to you.];
We are watching you off-worlder... We know that you have had some influence in recent events...;
Obey our laws here on Manaan, off-worlder. A law-abiding visitor is a visitor that does not go to prison.;
Move along, off-worlder. I've had enough of you.;NM26AB07OF07000_.mp3
What do we have here? A lost off-worlder, perhaps? You're probably here for the swoop races. Track is through the west corridor. Get moving.;NM26AB07OF07001_.mp3
Wait, I recognize you. I watched you take top prize at the swoop tournament. Nice work, Sector Champion, but you haven't won me over.;NM26AB07OF07002_.mp3
Could I ask you a few questions?;
I'm no guide. The Sith don't suffer questions for long.;NM26AB07OF07006_.mp3
What do you think of the swoop races?;
Are you hoping that I will look more favorably on you because you have taken the Sector Champion title? You are mistaken.;NM26AB07OF07008_.mp3
I am fond of the sport, true, but it's more about hating racers I don't think should win than actually paying tribute to those I favor.;NM26AB07OF07009_.mp3
Who do you like?;
Hukta Jax shows the proper spirit of competition, and it has brought him to the top before.;NM26AB07OF07011_.mp3
The Gamorrean? You're joking.;NM26AB07OF07012_.mp3
Brute force to the finish, he's very efficient.;NM26AB07OF07013_.mp3
Let's go back to my first questions.;
Hurry it up. This is a poor use of my time. You should know not to annoy one of my kind.;NM26AB07OF07015_.mp3
I wanted to ask questions about Manaan.;
Then seek out a helpful fish for answers. I have no interest in the affairs of the Selkath and you have no reason to inquire about mine.;NM26AB07OF07018_.mp3
I don't think I asked your opinion, Sith.;
What did you say? You don't want trouble from me, friend. You might as well take a blaster to your own head.;NM26AB07OF07022_.mp3
You don't look so tough to me.;
So, you have some courage. Dumb as a B'omarr castoff, but you've got courage. What do you hope to accomplish with this threat?;NM26AB07OF07024_.mp3
Even if you expected to live through my attack, the Selkath would lock you up for fighting in their streets.;NM26AB07OF07025_.mp3
I made no threat. I merely voiced an opinion.;
Ah, so you wish to goad *me* into action so the Selkath turn their unyielding laws my way? Amusing. Perhaps you aren't so foolish.;NM26AB07OF07027_.mp3
You've made your jest on the one world where you would not be immediately struck down. I suggest you walk away while your assumption holds true.;NM26AB07OF07028_.mp3
Then I will beg your pardon and leave.;
I thought you might. Walk away. Now.;NM26AB07OF07030_.mp3
I meant no harm. I apologize.;
I'm sure you didn't. Walk away. Now.;NM26AB07OF07032_.mp3
I have to leave. Goodbye.;
Of course you do. Good riddance.;NM26AB07OF07020_.mp3
What do I think? I think it's a shame when an unworthy newcomer unseats his betters. I am not easily won as a supporter.;NM26AB07OF07016_.mp3
I believe Queedle Molta has taken top spot. I prefer the professional racers. His win was just a fluke. An aberration.;NM26AB07OF07003_.mp3
I hate the rabble the races attract. They're always trouble.;NM26AB07OF07004_.mp3
What do you want now? You press your luck, pestering a Sith soldier. It doesn't seem wise on your part.;NM26AB07OF07033_.mp3
Don't count on the small measure of celebrity you have attained at the swoop races. All are equally inferior before the Sith.;NM26AB07OF07034_.mp3
As I have said in the past, the swoop races attract the lowest of rabble. As you are one of them, I suggest you leave me alone.;NM26AB07OF07035_.mp3
Did you hear what happened after the big swoop race? They say Brejik wouldn't pay up when he lost, and a brawl broke out! I can't believe I missed it!;NM02AEMUSI25000_.mp3
Hmph - who dresses you? You look like you crawled up here from the Lower City. Oh well, I guess we can't all have style.;NM02AEMUSI25002_.mp3
Isn't this band great? They can't leave Taris because of the Sith quarantine, so they've been playing here every night! Talk about a good break for us!;NM02AEMUSI25004_.mp3
Hmph! I don't know what the guys in here find so attractive about those Twi'leks. Look at them - they're dressed like dirty little space wenches!;NM02AEMUSI25006_.mp3
Did you hear? Bendak got dusted in that death match - by a woman, no less! Isn't that great? That should show these men a thing or two about who's the boss!;NM02AEMUSI25008_.mp3
Did you hear the news? Bendak got dusted in that death match! I'll never get a chance to see something like that again. I can't believe I didn't get a ticket!;NM02AEMUSI25010_.mp3
Have you heard? Someone's going to fight Bendak Starkiller in an illegal death match! I should go talk to that Hutt and try to get some tickets...;NM02AEMUSI25012_.mp3
Everyone's worried the Sith will come in here and shut this place down. Can you imagine how dull it would be if we didn't have any music on Taris?;NM02AEMUSI25014_.mp3
Greetings once again, Revan. I am glad that you have returned. I couldn't believe that you had betrayed us, despite what the Council said.;
Who are you?;
My name is Orsaa. I am the Keeper of History for the Elders. The last time you were here you had many questions for me.;
The Council told us all of the destruction of your memories, but still I had hoped you might recall something of our past discussion.;
I wish I could remember, but I don't. Sorry.;
There is no need to apologize. It just pains me to know that all you had learned from me has been forgotten. Still, I would be happy to instruct you again.;
Actually, I do have a few questions for you.;
Yes, of course. Although you must forgive me if some of this starts to seem familiar. After all, we did go into the history of the Rakata at some length the last time you were here.;
I will do my best to enlighten you with the knowledge I hold. What subject do you wish to learn about?;
Tell me about the beginnings of the Rakata Empire.;
Long ago, we Rakata were a great space-faring people. Our ships combined techonolgy and the power of the Force, and we were able to pilot them to the farthest reaches of the galaxy.;
Everywhere we went, we found civilizations less advanced and weaker then our own. But instead of helping them advance, we conquered and enslaved them.;
Back then, we could still command the Force. That, combined with our advanced technolgy made our march of conquest irresistable. Soon the Infinite Empire stretched across the entire galaxy.;
Over time, we lost our ability to use the Force. Some believe we had used the Force for so long that we evolved biologically, and became immune to its effects.;
In any case, once we lost our sensitivity to the Force our Empire began to fracture. We had to revert to more conventional space travel using inferior technology. Our ultimate collapse was inevitable.;
How did the Rakata Empire collapse?;
"Long ago the Rakata ruled all the known galaxy; all the species bowed down to us. But we were a corrupt people, and in our fall from glory there are terrible lessons that must be learned.";
"The Infinite Empire was built on slaughter; it was inevitable it should collapse upon itself. War, plague and slave rebellion forced us to retreat back here to our hidden home world.";
Here, conflict among power-hungry warlords escalated into full civil war. Terrible weapons of mass destruction were unleashed, driving most of the Rakata far beneath the earth for shelter.;
The devastation ravaged the world. Our people were scattered, our cities levelled, our very existence all but erased. The glory of the Infinite Empire is now nothing but dust and bones.;
In the past few thousand years small bands of Rakata have begun to return to the surface, but they are primitive and superstitious creatures. Only we Elders remember anything of the true past.;
I want to ask you about something else.;
Do you know how to disable the disruptor field that caused my ship to crash?;
"The disruptor field is one of the ancient defenses of the Star Forge; a great generator within the Temple of the Ancients fuels it. You will have to enter the Temple to disable it.";
Do you know where I can find parts to repair my ship?;
We do not have what you need, but the tribe of the One often take pieces from the ships that crash onto the planet, though they do not understand the technology they are hoarding.;
You might find the parts you need in their camp, back towards the beach where your ship first crashed. Or you could try to salvage the parts you need from the wrecks scattered about the island.;
I want to ask you some questions.;
Thanks for the information. I guess I can kill you now!;
Guards! Guards! We are under attack!;
I have to go now.;
Yes, of course. You have much to do, and little enough time to do it. But if you ever have any questions for me, I will be happy to try and answer them.;
Tell me about the tribe of Elders.;
We Elders are descendants of the holy priest caste of the Infinite Empire, survivors of the terrible weapons unleashed by the warlords during the final collapse of our Empire.;
Inside the Temple of the Ancients, our ancestors were safe from the devastation that forced the other Rakata to flee undergound. We emerged from the Temple to find an empty and ruined land.;
At last we understood the terrible power of our own technology. To ensure it could never be unleashed upon us again, we sealed the ancient knowledge within the Temple.;
What do you know about the other Rakata tribes here?;
Many centuries ago, the other Rakata began to emerge from the underground warrens where they had sought shelter from the devastation of the warlords.;
But these Rakata were as violent as the warlords they had fled many millennia ago. After centuries of battle and bloodshed, the tribe of the One has emerged as the strongest of them all.;
Now the One, lured by half-remembered legends of his people, lusts to possess the terrible power locked inside the Temple. We can never allow that to happen.;
Have you tried reasoning with the One?;
When the One first arrived on this island, we sent emissaries under a flag of truce to try and negotiate with his tribe. But all our envoys were brutally slaughtered.;
We do have the technology to destroy the One and his followers. But if we kill them all, then we will only prove that we have learned nothing over the past 20,000 years.;
"The One is mad with power. We choose not to fight him, so our only course of action is to stay here in isolation where we are safe; just as we have done for the past 20,000 years.";
Can't you just use your technology to destroy the One?;
We have the technology to destroy the One and his followers. But if we kill them all, then we will only prove that we have learned nothing over the past 20,000 years.;
We tried to negotiate with them. We went emissaries under a flag or truce when the One first arrived on this island. But all our envoys were brutally slaughtered.;
What do you know about the Temple of the Ancients?;
The Temple is a sacred place of terrible secrets. All the dark mysteries of the Rakata are housed within its stone walls, which pulse with the living power of the Ancients.;
Only those who can command this power - what you call the Force - can enter the Temple. Many centuries ago there were still a few among us who could pass within its walls.;
But living in the shadow of the Temple we became desensitized to this power. As you yourself said the last time you were here, we Elders are no longer 'Force sensitive'.;
Can any of the Rakata enter the Temple?;
None of the Rakata can control the Force now, but long ago there were those who could pass through the barrier.;
Our ancestors created the energy shield around the building as a second line of defense. But the energy shield was created using technology within the Temple itself.;
Once we helped you and Malak to get past the barrier, you discovered a way to lower the shields at will from within the Temple itself. After this you had no further need of us.;
The once hallowed ground of the Temple is now overrun with the followers of Malak who can command the Force: those you call the Dark Jedi.;
So why is there an energy field outside the Temple then?;
Can you tell me about the Star Forge?;
Much of our knowledge of the Star Forge is lost. It was built during the height of the Infinite Empire, long ago. All we know now is that it casts a terrible shadow across our world.;
We Elders have longed to destroy the Star Forge for many generations, to cleanse ourselves of its evil presence. But we have neither the knowledge, nor the capability.;
When you and Malak last came here, we saw you as saviors. We let you into the Temple so you could destroy the Star Forge, but instead you harnessed its dark power for yourselves.;
You awakened a dormant evil, your fleet helped spread the corruption of the Star Forge throughout the galaxy. And now you return as our last hope to stop what you once started.;
Maybe later.;
Look on the bright side: we can have all those discussions again.;
Yes, I suppose that is true. As you can imagine, I have few opportunities to share my knowledge with those outside our enclave.;
You're a historian? Maybe I could ask you some questions.;
I'm sorry, I don't remember you.;
Yes, Revan. What do you need?;
I'm here to kill you all!;
I am done with you, outsider. Go away. I won't be your entertainment.;
What do you want, outsider? I won't let you follow us on our hunt. Chorrawl is not here for your amusement.;
Don't test me, Wookiee. I go where I wish.;
"You can't push me into battle, outsider. I know what happens to Wookiees that are said to be ""difficult.""";
I won't be your trophy, dead or as a slave. Leave me. You have no place here.;
I am <FullName>, and I act for Chuundar.;
Chuundar! Bah! Why should I care if you act for him when he does not act for us?;
Explain what you meant by that.;
No, not to you. You are an outsider and only care about our weaknesses. I won't say anything to you.;
[Persuade] Just a few questions. I'm a friend.;
[Success] Hmm... only a moment, outsider. I won't be this patient for long.;
Do you know of a crazed Wookiee in the Shadowlands?;
The only crazed creature I know of is one of your kind, outsider, not mine. We see him from time to time.;
We leave him alone. He has our respect because he has braved the lands alone. Sometimes he helps lone travelers. He is crazy, though.;
Hmph! I merely have an appreciation for solitude.;NM22ABCHOR02021_.mp3
Ha! You claim to be a legend, but I'd know the mad hermit if I saw him. 3-meters tall, with eyes of madness.;
What do you think of Chuundar?;
He is our Chieftain and will be obeyed. That is our way. Whether I trust what he says or not doesn't matter.;
In time, someone will replace him. For better or worse, I don't know. That will be for Bacca to decide.;
How will Bacca decide? What does that mean?;
Bacca was our greatest warrior. His ancient sword is the tool of ascension, the mark of a chieftain.;
Chuundar no longer displays it, not since he took the role of chieftain years ago. If someone else could produce it...;
Bah! I talk like a mere child! This is foolishness.;
Could a blood relative of Chuundar challenge him?;
It truly would take Bacca's Blade for that to happen. Chuundar is the last member of his family.;
There were others, but they were marked with madness. We don't speak their names. They are without honor.;
How has Kashyyyk fared under the Czerka Corporation?;
You taunt me with a foolish question like that. How do you think? My people go missing or die.;
Why not do something about it, then?;NM22ABCHOR02044_.mp3
We can't fight back. Chuundar has bartered to reduce the slaves taken, but if any Czerka die, it increases again.;
Big Z once told me he had seen paradise destroyed by the greed of outsiders. I never understood what he meant until now.;NM22ABCHOR02050_.mp3
I seek an ancient Star Map. Have you seen it?;
I don't concern myself with outsider toys. Search where you will, I'm not wasting my time.;
I will leave you now.;
Yes, go, and don't expect a friendly welcome if you return. This world is my home, not yours.;
How has my world fared? It is slowly dying.;
Why do you not do something about this tyranny, then?;NM22ABCHOR02046_.mp3
Our finest warriors hunt the Shadowlands in groups, yet he lives there alone. Avoid him. Madness is to be feared.;
How long has he been down there?;
Many years. It is impossible to know how many. A decade? Two? Perhaps he can answer your questions. Or kill you.;
[Failure] You Czerka slavers, caring about nothing except what you want... what you can take!;
You disgust me. Your scent poisons the air. Your feet foul the ground. Go away, outsider. Go away.;
[Force Persuade] I want you to answer my questions.;
[Success] I... I should answer your questions... yes, perhaps one or two.;
Show me proper respect or you'll regret it!;
Your kind threaten my very planet. I live with it daily. Why should your words now goad me into battle?;
No, I won't fight you. At best, my warrior comrades would slaughter you, only for ships to burn our homes later.;
Go away, rabid fool. I won't listen to you anymore.;
I will leave you then.;
You do that. Walk quickly, outsider. Kashyyyk fights back, even if we can't.;
Could I ask some questions?;
Why would you listen to me? Your kind have only been interested in caging or killing us.;
I don't mean you any harm.;
Feh! I'll believe that when our planet is free of you. Your kind are here only to take or destroy.;
Why do you bother us again, outsider? We have nothing to say to you.;
Davik says you missed your last payment.;NM02ABBOUN01000_.mp3
Davik doesn't like you missing payments!;
Here - I've got fifty credits! A down payment. That should buy me some time, right?;NM02ABBOUN01004_.mp3
Sorry, you're out of time. Now it's all or nothing. Davik can't have people not paying his debts!;NM02ABBOUN01006_.mp3
But I don't have that much! How can I give you credits I don't have?;NM02ABBOUN01008_.mp3
That's too bad. Davik's going to want to make an example of you! You're coming with us.;
No - help! Somebody help! They're going to kill me!;NM02ABBOUN01012_.mp3
*whisper* I know we have to be careful about drawing attention to ourselves, but are we just going to let them drag this guy off?;NM02ACBOUN01030_.mp3
Hold on a second. Looks like we got ourselves a witness here!;NM02ABBOUN01014_.mp3
What's the matter, you forget the arrangement? You Sith don't bother us on Davik's business and we don't bother you!;NM02ABBOUN01016_.mp3
I'm ordering you to leave this man alone.;
We take our orders from Davik, not you!;NM02ABBOUN01018_.mp3
It's time for a new arrangement!;
Guess we have to teach you to mind your own business!;
Sorry. I'll be going now.;
Smart move to mind your own business.;
Come on. We don't want to keep Davik waiting - that's only going to make things worse.;NM02ABBOUN01025_.mp3
Davik doesn't like witnesses.;
Leave this man alone or you'll have to deal with me!;
I don't like your attitude. I better teach you a lesson.;
No... that is not the one. My ancient sword is black as the night sky... I remember now.;NM37AAFREE04000_.mp3
I... I am sorry...;NM37AAFREE04002_.mp3
Yes... that is the one. That is the blade that destroyed me.;NM37AAFREE04004_.mp3
Take it... take it and the other blades, even... take them and go. My darkness awaits me...;NM37AAFREE04006_.mp3
There's no need to remain here, is there?;
No... need? What choice have I?;NM37AAFREE04008_.mp3
You can return to the light side and end your torment.;
Return? But... I betrayed my old masters. They would never let me return to the light side. It is too late... too late...;NM37AAFREE04010_.mp3
[Persuade] I don't believe the light side would turn you away. You have suffered long enough.;
[Success] If... if I could return. Oh, my Master... it has been... so long... and I regret so much...;NM37AAFREE04012_.mp3
[Failure] No... I... do not think so. I have the eternity... I deserved. I made my choice long ago.;NM37AAFREE04014_.mp3
Be at peace...;NM37AAFREE04045_.mp3
And suppose you are right. What then?;
Then I have... the eternity I deserved. It has taken me... so long to realize that. I made my choice long ago.;NM37AAFREE04019_.mp3
Perhaps you are right. I'll go.;
You can leave this place.;
No, I cannot. Here... here is where I rest. Here is where my eternity awaits.;NM37AAFREE04023_.mp3
I don't know. I'll go.;
I want to know more about the Star Map.;
Our... oldest secret is buried, but not here. I... remember nothing else. I cannot help you.;NM37AAFREE04027_.mp3
I don't believe that. Tell me what you know!;
I shall not tell you... our oldest secret! I shall not! Begone!;NM37AAFREE04035_.mp3
I command you to tell me!;
Never! I shall... destroy you first! Die here... remain forever with me!;NM37AAFREE04037_.mp3
What a disappointment. The 'great Ajunta Pall'.;
Then feel my power! You shall... die here, with me!!;NM37AAFREE04032_.mp3
Fine, I'll go.;
Take the blades and leave me to my darkness...;NM37AAFREE04040_.mp3
You're a pathetic excuse for a Sith Lord if I ever saw one.;
Do not... do not say such things! I... still have power! Go! Go from my... ancient tomb!;NM37AAFREE04030_.mp3
I might think more of you if you told me about the Star Map.;
I'll go, then.;
Do not let the dark flame guide you, young one...;NM37AAFREE04043_.mp3
Too long... too long in the cold and the dark. I am disturbed again? A human...;NM37AAFREE04047_.mp3
What is this? A... spirit, full of the Force. Be careful. I sense an extremely old and confused mind behind this presence...;NM37AAFREE04049_.mp3
Do... I know you? It... seems as if we have met before...;NM37AAFREE04057_.mp3
Er... no, I don't think we have ever met...;
Are you certain? You... the Force is with you. So strong, so bright. You remind me of... someone I once knew, so long ago...;NM37AAFREE04059_.mp3
Who... or what... are you?;
I... had a name, once. Ajunta Pall. Yes, that was my name. I was one of many. We were servants of the dark side... Sith Lords, we called ourselves. So proud.;NM37AAFREE04069_.mp3
In the end we were not so proud. We hid... hid from those we had betrayed. We fell... and I knew it would be so...;NM37AAFREE04071_.mp3
You were a Sith Lord? From the ancient times?;
Ancient? Has it been so long that you use the word 'ancient'? I have... been here so long, so lost, I cannot... cannot remember...;NM37AAFREE04073_.mp3
We were the first. The first to rebel, to betray... to surrender ourselves to the dark side. So strong, we thought... so wrong...;NM37AAFREE04075_.mp3
What do you mean by 'those we had betrayed'?;
Our Jedi Masters. Those who had taught us to use the Force... who warned us against the dark side. Yet we embraced it in secret, reveled in its power.;NM37AAFREE04077_.mp3
We were... discovered? Or did we act? I can no longer remember. But here is where we came... to hide, to grow. And here we fell.;NM37AAFREE04079_.mp3
What can you tell me about this place?;
Our temple... our tomb. Built far from our enemies. We revered power and threw off the teachings of our old masters.;NM37AAFREE04081_.mp3
It... we were not the first to fall to the dark side. But we... had more power than those before us. It... came from elsewhere...;NM37AAFREE04083_.mp3
What do you mean? Came from where?;
Our oldest secret. Only... only we would know, we lords. Only we would know where our power came from...;NM37AAFREE04085_.mp3
[Persuade] Tell me the secret.;
[Failure] I cannot, human. It is a secret of so long ago... I no longer remember. You who bristle with the Force... you must find this place...;NM37AAFREE04087_.mp3
Or... have you? Or did you? Or... will you? Oh, so... many images...;NM37AAFREE04089_.mp3
I... see your dark heart, human. Dark as mine was, proud as mine was. You... you will find the old place... and you will regret it.;NM37AAFREE04091_.mp3
I shall regret nothing.;
So much power... it is blinding. I...I remember so little...;NM37AAFREE04093_.mp3
How did you fall? What happened?;
We... hid from the Jedi, but it was not they who destroyed us. Is it not... obvious what we did?;NM37AAFREE04100_.mp3
We destroyed each other. We desired the secrets of each other, to increase our power... we battled until finally our fortress rained down on top of us.;NM37AAFREE04102_.mp3
The ancient Sith... destroyed each other. The fundamental flaw in their philosophy, one would think.;NM37AAFREE04104_.mp3
I suppose that's the nature of the dark side. Power, but no longevity. Eventually it just consumes itself.;NM37AAFREE04106_.mp3
And so here our old secret is buried and none of us hold it any more... is that not right? Our power fled. Oh, what became of us? Do... do the Sith still thrive? Did they ever return?;NM37AAFREE04110_.mp3
The Sith fled, yes. And they returned.;
So much... so much time has passed. And yet we have learned nothing... nothing...;NM37AAFREE04115_.mp3
Why do you remain here?;
Remain? Do I... remain? I... have regretted for so long... all that I have done.;NM37AAFREE04117_.mp3
My sword... I filled it with my pride. And it is... buried with me, now. A corpse as I am a corpse.;NM37AAFREE04119_.mp3
I am dead, as my faith... is dead. And I shall remain here... surrounded by blackness in death as in life...;NM37AAFREE04121_.mp3
I feel sorry for you.;
Most of my brethren would desire... only to take what power I have left. Even if it would destroy them.;NM37AAFREE04123_.mp3
I wish my sword to be... taken away from here. I do not wish it to rot away as I have. I command this of you.;NM37AAFREE04125_.mp3
Fine. I'll gladly take it out of here.;
There are... three blades within my sarcophagus. Only one is truly my sword, but it has been so long... I do not remember which.;NM37AAFREE04127_.mp3
Find the sword that is mine and... place it on the statue. If it is truly mine, then it is yours.;NM37AAFREE04129_.mp3
And if the sword isn't yours?;
Then you must... die. This is how it... must be.;NM37AAFREE04131_.mp3
How will I know which sword it is?;
I do remember one thing of my sword... listen to me carefully...;NM37AAFREE04133_.mp3
"""I am that which grips the heart in fright, hearkens night and silences the light."" It was... written of my sword long... long ago.";NM37AAFREE04135_.mp3
Go, then... find my sword and place it on the statue...;NM37AAFREE04137_.mp3
What do you want me to do with it?;
If... if you are wise, you will not keep it. In the end, it is what destroyed me...;NM37AAFREE04140_.mp3
Sorry... nobody commands me to do anything.;
Then you shall not leave this place. I... have power, still. I can... still command!;NM37AAFREE04143_.mp3
I need this sword you speak of.;
Of course you do. You... seek my power. Will it destroy you... as it did me?;NM37AAFREE04146_.mp3
Maybe I should just be on my way, then...;
I... cannot allow you to leave. Not until you have... done what I will ask of you.;NM37AAFREE04149_.mp3
What about your sword? Do you still have it?;
This secret... is it the Star Map?;
I... I do not remember. A map? Perhaps it is a map. But it has not been buried with me. All I have now is my sword.;NM37AAFREE04153_.mp3
The Sith have thrived and are more powerful than ever.;
The dark side will always thrive. You should know that.;
They returned, and endanger us all... and the light side must battle them.;
Hmph. The Sith consumed themselves, did they? Hm. I suppose that eventually that'd be all they'd have left to fight.;NM37AAFREE04108_.mp3
I... see your heart, human Jedi. I see your power, your pride. You... you will find the old place, the dark place... and you will regret it.;NM37AAFREE04094_.mp3
Why? What is at this place?;
[Force Persuade] Tell me the secret.;
[Failure] The Force no longer touches my mind, human. And... even if it did I, I no longer remember our secret. The Force bristles in you... you must find this place with it...;NM37AAFREE04097_.mp3
Are you... Ajunta Pall?;
[Persuade/Lie] Yes, of course. Don't you remember me?;
[Success] I do... and yet I do not. The Force is so strong with you, human... yet the face, the soul... it has been so very long...;NM37AAFREE04061_.mp3
[Persuade] I was here once before, I think. Do you remember me?;
A... Jedi? Here? Why have you come to this dark place, Jedi? Why... disturb my sleepless rest?;NM37AAFREE04065_.mp3
I am not a Jedi.;
Disturb your rest? Are you some kind of... ghost?;
Who are you?;
Now this you don't see every day. This... this is an old spirit full of the Force. I sense great sadness and regret. Walk carefully...;NM37AAFREE04051_.mp3
Beware this... this spirit. It may not be what it appears. Great emotion lies within...;NM37AAFREE04053_.mp3
Analysis: This emanation barely registers on my sensors, master. Blaster fire may be ineffective... but I am prepared to test that at your word.;NM37AAFREE04055_.mp3
Good day, officer. Don't mind me, I'm just standing here minding my own business. I'm not looking for any trouble with the Sith.;
Well, I don't see too many of your kind around here. Most of the residents in this run down old apartment are illegal aliens. My name is Larrim, by the way.;
Pleased to meet you, Larrim. My name is <FullName>.;
I know it's really none of my business, but you look like someone who might need to purchase one of those new energy shields. They're the latest thing, you know. Very high tech.;
What's so great about these energy shields?;
When you use one it surrounds you with a radiant aura-particle mesh that absorbs blaster bolts. Pretty handy in a fight. The shield even protects against lightsabers, or so I hear.;
The shields aren't perfect, of course. They can only absorb so much energy damage before they burn out, and ion blasters will take your basic dueling shield down pretty quick.;
And I can tell you from experience that they aren't any good at all against a simple vibroblade. That's why the Republic has been training soldiers in hand-to-hand and melee combat.;NM02AALARR99029_.mp3
Where did this technology come from?;
I've heard rumors of the Echani using shields like this, but I never saw anything like them around here. Not until the Sith came. Where they discovered the technology is anybody's guess.;
The shields are too rare and too expensive to hand out to an entire army, but a shielded strike team can take out a whole battalion of soliders armed with conventional blasters.;
It gave the Sith a huge edge in the early battles, but it wasn't long before the Republic was able to copy the technology and come up with energy shields of their own.;
Now both sides are scrambling to come up with new weapons to slice right through the shields, but until they do you're going to see melee combat coming back to the forefront in this war.;
Anything else?;
Not much more to say, really. Except that I've managed to get my hands on one of those shields. It isn't cheap, but it could mean the difference between life and death.;
You want to see what I have in stock? I know my kiosk isn't much to look at, but my prices are reasonable and the merchandise is sound.;
Why do you have a kiosk set up here?;
I run a little shop here in this old building, selling basic equipment to the illegal aliens renting out these apartments.;
You mentioned something about illegal aliens living here.;
By law, most aliens aren't allowed to have a residence in the Upper City of Taris. They allow a few of us Twi'leks up here, but for the most part it's humans only.;
But no self-respecting Upper City human would want to live in the apartments in this dump. So the landlord has been renting out the apartments illegally to aliens.;
Better than letting them sit empty, I guess. Otherwise you get squatters and people hiding out from the authorities living in the abandoned apartments, and they don't pay rent.;
Aren't you worried about getting caught?;
The Taris authorities pretty much turned a blind eye to this place. A few illegal aliens just weren't worth the bother. And once the Sith took over, they felt the same way.;
Besides, I don't live here myself. I just run a small business providing supplies to the residents. You want to see what I have in stock?;
I want to ask you some questions.;
Questions? I'd rather not. It might be bad for business if people saw me answering a bunch of questions for a human.;
Most of the residents here are illegal aliens, questions are frowned on. I don't want to lose the trust of my customers. If you really need information, go talk to Kadir the janitor.;
He's bordering on senile so all the residents figure he's harmless. They won't mind you talking to him, and he might be able to help you out with your questions.;
Let me see what you've got for sale.;
No problem. Just step on up and have a peek.;
I'll be going now.;
See you around. Come on back if you need any equipment. I've got some merchandise you might be interested in.;
I've heard enough about these shields.;
Oh, okay. Well then, you might be interested in knowing I have one for sale. It isn't cheap, but it could be the difference between life and death.;
And they aren't any good at all against a simple vibroblade. That's why the Sith and the Republic are training their troops in hand-to-hand and melee combat.;
I know all about energy shields.;
I don't care what your name is... and I'm not telling you mine!;
Look, I know we're trying to keep a low profile but this kind of attitude will draw attention we don't need.;NM02AALARR06024_.mp3
Hey, I wasn't trying to pry or anything. I know people here like their privacy. It's just that I might be able to help you out.;
Back again? So, what can I do for you? You want to see what I have in stock?;
The village of Rwookrrorro is now under the joint protection of chieftain Chuundar and Czerka Corporation. All further interaction by outsiders is forbidden.;
I think you will agree that now that we have achieved such an optimal business arangement, we don't wish to risk further instability.;
What if Zaalbar has something to say about this?;
I would assume that he has very little to say, or he would have said it before.;
I have made my peace with Chuundar. I see that his way is best. You showed me that. There is nothing here for me anymore.;
What are your plans now?;
I am merely a guard. You will have to address any further concerns with Janos back at the outpost docking port.;
What if I don't approve of this?;
Then you shouldn't have helped to make it happen. It is far too late for such a confrontational tone. Please, address further concerns with Janos.;
Goodbye.;
Czerka Corporation welcomes your future inquiries... through the proper channels.;
Take your concerns to Janos at the docking port. Rwookrrorro is under the joint protection of Chuundar and Czerka Corporation.;
You had an impressive run there, rookie. But it wasn't good enough, was it?;
Anglu's already got you beat. It takes more than a souped up swoop bike to make a champion, so I guess I'm going to have to win this thing for Vulkars!;
I'm twice the rider you'll ever be, rookie! You can go out there for another run if you want, but why bother? You'll never match the time I posted!;
Another rookie on the track, eh? Give you punks a helmet and a swoop bike and suddenly you all figure you're racers.;
But the only reason you're here is because I passed on that prototype accelerator. It's too unstable, and you can't collect the champion's prize if you're dead!;
But judging by the look of you I'd say I don't have much to worry about. The Beks are really scraping the bottom of the barrel now.;
I figured you weren't nothing special, rookie. And after watching your last run I see I was right.;
You again? Look, I plan on winning this thing so I can't be wasting my time talking to some rookie!;
Yes, human? Have you come to sneer and jeer like the others? Come to see Lorgal the Great Liberator caged like an animal?;
Liberator? You're nothing but a murderer!;
Kill a million people with a mighty star cruiser and you are a war hero. Kill a hundred with a thermal detonator and you are a terrorist.;
It's not the same! You kill civilians and children!;
"You are obviously blind to the Republic chains shackled around your neck. You cannot see me for the hero I am; you think I am nothing but a criminal who deserves death.";
There are many who want me dead, including the guards in this room. But the Republic doesn't kill prisoners without a trial. That is why I am protected.;
This energy cage keeps me safe from blaster and blade. The Republic will keep me alive for transfer to Coruscant, and then all the galaxy will witness my trial!;
You cannot touch me in here, human. No conventional weapon can penetrate this cage. Nothing can stop me from spreading my manifesto during my trial!;
[Use Force Choke to kill Lorgal.];
[Use Force Kill to kill Lorgal.];
I've got better things to do than argue with prisoners.;
Yes, leave me. You are a tool of the Republic, a slave who cannot even see your own chains. But do not fear: someday I - or someone like me - will destroy the Republic and free you all.;
You deserve to die for your crimes, Lorgal.;
I'm here to kill you, Lorgal. And I think I'll enjoy it.;
It's done. Bastila is dead.;NM45AACART02000_.mp3
Soon the Republic fleet will break through and the capital ships will be able to bombard the Star Forge. Then it will finally be over.;NM45AACART02001_.mp3
You could still save yourself, Carth.;
There's no point. There's no other place I'd rather be than here.;NM45AACART02003_.mp3
You're very brave to make the decision you did. I... I love you. You know that, right?;NM45AACART02008_.mp3
I love you too.;
There isn't much time. It should be over soon.;NM45AACART02011_.mp3
Thank you, Carth. For everything.;
I just wish we had more time.;
This is all the time we have. It should all be over soon.;NM45AACART02013_.mp3
We could still leave, Carth, go somewhere...;
You know that can't happen. There's no turning back for you... there's just an ending.;NM45AACART02005_.mp3
Are you sure this is the best way?;
It's the only way. The only alternative is a path I know you don't want to take.;NM45AACART02007_.mp3
We have to kill her! Her Battle Meditation is the only thing stopping the fleet from getting through!;NM45AACART02014_.mp3
There you are! What happened?;NM45AACART02015_.mp3
Darth Malak is dead. It's over, finally.;
That's wonderful news!;NM45AACART02017_.mp3
There's no time to celebrate just yet. I was able to use my Battle Meditation to allow the Republic to break through the Sith fleet. The capital ships are in bombardment range!;NM45AACART02024_.mp3
And that means we have to get out of here right now, before this entire complex comes down around our ears! Everyone else is already on the ship! Let's move!!;NM45AACART02026_.mp3
No time to celebrate just yet. With Bastila dead, the Republic has broken through the Sith fleet! The capital ships are in bombardment range!;NM45AACART02025_.mp3
That's great news! I knew you could do it!;NM45AACART02018_.mp3
There was no way to turn him to the light side. I had to kill him.;
I don't think anyone actually expected that he could be redeemed. I'm surprised you would even think of trying.;NM45AACART02020_.mp3
I don't think anyone actually expected that he could be redeemed. I'm surprised you would even think of trying.;NM45AACART02021_.mp3
I killed him... and a lot of help you were, by the way.;
Hey! I was doing what I could, thank you very much!;NM45AACART02023_.mp3
So you killed Darth Malak. Somehow I... I always knew you would.;NM45AACART02027_.mp3
Carth?! How did you get here?!;
The Republic fleet picked me up from the planet. I told them of your betrayal... but I also told them I couldn't abandon you.;NM45AACART02031_.mp3
I had to come. I said I'd find a way to save you from yourself, and I will.;NM45AACART02032_.mp3
It's good you came. I'll enjoy killing you.;
I don't believe that. I don't think you do, either.;NM45AACART02034_.mp3
Carth. I knew I sensed your presence. I should have known you would find a way to meddle in this one last time!;NM45AACART02039_.mp3
Don't interfere, Bastila. This is between me and Revan.;NM45AACART02040_.mp3
You are a fool. Revan has already made her choice, and there is no turning back!;NM45AACART02041_.mp3
Don't listen to him, master! Let me strike him down! Seize your victory!!;NM45AACART02042_.mp3
No, let him speak. I want to hear what he has to say.;
I love you. Even now. Even after... after...after all you have done. I love you like I haven't loved anyone or anything since my wife died. And I didn't even think that was possible.;NM45AACART02044_.mp3
You may not love me. You may not love anything anymore now that you've gone over to the dark side... but I believe that there's still some part of you I can reach.;NM45AACART02045_.mp3
There's a part of you that believes in hope... and mercy... and love. And that part knows that it will soon be gone forever.;NM45AACART02046_.mp3
Your words are meaningless. You have no idea of the power we now wield! Revan will rule the galaxy!!;NM45AACART02047_.mp3
It's not too late for you to join me, Carth.;
No, it's too late for that. And it's too late for you to turn back... but you can end this here. There's still time for one final act of redemption.;NM45AACART02049_.mp3
Kill Bastila. Without her Battle Meditation the Republic fleet can destroy the Star Forge and rid the galaxy of this evil.;NM45AACART02050_.mp3
And what happens to me?;
Stay here on the Star Forge. With me. We won't have time to get off before the Star Forge is destroyed, not if you stop Bastila. But our sacrifice can save the Republic.;NM45AACART02052_.mp3
If you don't, all you'll have is...is emptiness and darkness. You don't want that. Please don't want that. Stay... let's end this now. Together.;NM45AACART02053_.mp3
Don't be stupid. I could never agree to that.;
I wish... I wish there could have been another way.;NM45AACART02068_.mp3
Kill him, Master!!;NM45AABAST01001_.mp3
The fool is dead. Now there is nothing in the way of your victory!;NM45AABAST01000_.mp3
I think it's time to end this, all right... with your death.;
I... alright. I'll do it. For you.;
No! I won't let you do this! Don't be a fool, Revan!!;NM45AACART02057_.mp3
I... am *not* Revan!!;
No! No-ooo!! You can't do this! Not when we're so close!!;NM45AACART02061_.mp3
You could join us, Bastila. Turn away from the dark side.;
Time for this to end, Bastila!;
You're mad!;
That will never happen. Bastila... kill him now.;
It's too late to turn back, Carth. Even if I wanted to.;
I know. It's too late to turn back... but you can end this here. There's still time for one final act of redemption.;NM45AACART02065_.mp3
Kill him, Bastila. He means nothing to me.;
Yes, kill him. Nothing he could say will matter.;
I'm sorry, Carth. It's too late. We both know that.;
I'm glad I get to kill you personally, Carth. For old times' sake.;
I don't need you, Carth, and I won't change my mind.;
You should have stayed wherever you ran to.;
And abandon you? No, I couldn't have done that.;NM45AACART02036_.mp3
And how, exactly, do you propose to do that?;
All you have to do is listen to me. That's all I ask.;NM45AACART02038_.mp3
Somehow I'm not surprised you found a way here.;
Carth. You should still be on the planet, shouldn't you?;
You are a student at the academy. You may enter by the door.;NM33ABACAD01000_.mp3
You again? I told you to locate Yuthura Ban in the cantina. She is the only one who can bring new students into the academy.;NM33ABACAD01001_.mp3
Greetings, student. I see you have the medallion that marks you as one of the chosen.;NM33ABACAD01002_.mp3
I do not recognize you, however. Have you been accepted into the academy very recently?;NM33ABACAD01003_.mp3
Yes. Today, in fact.;
I see. And who might your friends be?;NM33ABACAD01005_.mp3
They are my slaves.;
Ah. I trust you will be responsible for ensuring your slaves are not disruptive, then?;NM33ABACAD01007_.mp3
No more disruptive than our 'master' will be.;NM33ABACAD01008_.mp3
What was that?;NM33ABACAD01009_.mp3
Ahh... ignore him, sir. He is mentally deficient. And he drools.;NM33ABACAD01010_.mp3
Hey!;NM33ABACAD01011_.mp3
You will want to bring your medallion to Yuthura Ban. She is the one who brings all selected students into the academy for their training.;NM33ABACAD01025_.mp3
I believe she can be located within the cantina here in the colony. I suggest you go to her while she is still there, student.;NM33ABACAD01026_.mp3
Oh, nothing.;NM33ABACAD01012_.mp3
Grrr... I will not play the part of slave for long. Not even to pass this fool.;
If your animal acts up he will be destroyed. This would reflect badly on you, understand?;NM33ABACAD01014_.mp3
Hmph. Suddenly I'm a convincing slave, am I? Maybe you should have left me on the ship.;NM33ABACAD01015_.mp3
I always think we should leave you on the ship, old man.;NM33ABACAD01016_.mp3
Don't get smart-mouthed with me, young man. You're not too old to put over my knee.;NM33ABACAD01017_.mp3
Commentary: Disruptive? What does he mean by that? I have never been disruptive, master.;NM33ABACAD01018_.mp3
Beep! Beep! Boooop!;
Well, besides *that*.;NM33ABACAD01020_.mp3
They are none of your business.;
So long as the Sith do not object to them, neither will I. They will be your responsibility, of course.;NM33ABACAD01022_.mp3
Aren't we always?;NM33ABACAD01023_.mp3
Commentary: And if the Sith do object to us, master, I shall fill them full of new holes!;NM33ABACAD01024_.mp3
That's none of your business, soldier.;
No. I have been away for a while.;
You are neither a Sith nor do you bear the medallion of a student of this facility. Please leave at once.;NM33ABACAD01029_.mp3
[Persuade] I'm Darth Revan. I was Lord of the Sith. Let me in.;
[Failure] I see. And who might your friends be?;NM33ABACAD01005_.mp3
It's obvious you don't believe me. But I really am Darth Revan!;
On your way, citizen.;NM33ABACAD01041_.mp3
How do I become a Sith, then?;
You must be admitted to the academy. That decision must be made by a Sith who has already been accepted, here.;NM33ABACAD01031_.mp3
The final decision, however, remains with Master Yuthura. I believe she is currently at the cantina if you wish to seek her out. Now go.;NM33ABACAD01032_.mp3
What's this medallion you mention?;
It is the device given to one who has been accepted into the academy, but has not yet proved their worth as a student.;NM33ABACAD01034_.mp3
If one of the Sith decides you are worthy, you will be given one... which you must then take to Yuthura Ban, who I believe is in the cantina. It is she who decides which hopefuls enter the academy.;NM33ABACAD01035_.mp3
[Persuade] I need to get inside. I have been sent to speak with the Master of the Academy!;
[Failure] No-one gets inside, citizen. Messages and deliveries must be relayed through official Sith channels only.;NM33ABACAD01037_.mp3
[Force Persuade] You will let me inside.;
[Failure] I have been conditioned to resist mental persuasion, citizen. Please do not attempt that again.;NM33ABACAD01039_.mp3
I'll be going.;
This entrance to the Sith Embassy has been closed temporarily due to a maintenance failure. The main entrance to the Embassy will reopen when the problem has been fixed.;NM26ABSDOI06000_.mp3
I heard the Embassy was attacked.;
What?! How did you... Um... This unit has no knowledge of what you're talking about.;NM26ABSDOI06002_.mp3
Those with legitimate business with the Sith should return when the repairs have been completed.;NM26ABSDOI06008_.mp3
How can I get inside now?;
The secondary external entrance is reserved for Sith personnel only and is not to be used by visitors.;NM26ABSDOI06005_.mp3
I will be going.;
Please, don't take me in for questioning... I don't know anything! I swear!;NM02AAMAN006000_.mp3
I've got a ton of things to do today. I can't talk to you.;NM02AAMAN006003_.mp3
I heard the gangs have overrun the Lower City. Why don't the Sith go down there and restore order?;NM02AAMAN006005_.mp3
I heard the Sith are sending salvage teams down into the Undercity to recover those Republic escape pods.;NM02AAMAN006007_.mp3
I... I must g-get into... the academy... must...;NM33ABMEKF05000_.mp3
You... you have a medallion! How... how did you... unghhhh...;NM33ABMEKF05001_.mp3
Leave... leave me be! I won't listen to your... manipulations. I... I *will* make it into the academy!;NM33ABMEKF05002_.mp3
Just... just a few hours longer... just a few hours, surely...;NM33ABMEKF05003_.mp3
You'll get your... turn soon enough, fool. And when you do, *Cough* I will be there, laughing as you collapse from... heat exhaustion and Mekel's beatings!;NM33ABMEKF05004_.mp3
Greetings! Forgive me if this seems an odd question, off-worlder, but might you have any exotic species for sale? Nothing dangerous, mind you.;
Exotic species? What sorts of exotic species?;
Anything non-sentient and non-carnivorous will do, though creatures that are easy to manage are preferred. Is that understandable?;
Why would you want to buy animals?;
Ah, good question. The Selkath have little exposure to life from other planets, you see, but our government hopes to change that.;
We are setting up a zoological compound for visitation by the public, and are hoping to stock it with non-offensive foreign creatures of all types.;
The only problem right now is actually procuring the exotic species we need. Selkath import restrictions are quite prohibitive, to say the least.;
So you want to smuggle them in?;
I would not use such a harsh word, off-worlder. Let us say that I am interested in engaging in private trade. That is allowed, according to our laws.;
Finding off-worlders that deal in such trade is most difficult, however. I have become quite desperate. Might you have what I seek?;
I have some gizka, if you're interested.;
Gizka? You speak of the small, bipedal amphibians with the overly high reproductive rate, correct? Oh, no, I am afraid I cannot take those.;
A compatriot of mine made the mistake of purchasing a pair of such creatures several months ago. Within weeks our storage facilities were nearly overrun.;
If you are in possession of such creatures, I hope you keep them separated. If not, then you have my condolences.;
[Persuade] Is there no way I can convince you to take them off my hands?;
[Success] I... suppose having a few of the creatures would not be of harm. We do have experience handling them now, I suppose.;
Since they are so difficult to maintain, however, I would ask that you provide 100 credits. Then I will take them off your hands.;
Deal. I want those things off my ship as soon as possible.;
Very well. It is a pleasure doing business with you... I will have my people show up to remove your gizka as soon as possible.;
Thank you very much. For an off-worlder, interacting with you has been most pleasant.;
But... I actually don't have 100 credits.;
You do not even have 100 credits? Then you are in dire straits, indeed. You certainly do not need these pests on your vessel.;
In the interest of maintaining peace, I shall remove them and use what I can. Thank you for your assistance, off-worlder... I hope your situation improves soon.;
[Force Persuade] You don't need any credits to take them.;
[Success] What am I thinking? It is impertinent of me to ask you for credits when you are attempting to make a sale. My apologies.;
I shall send some of my people by to remove the gizka on your vessel. Thank you for your co-operation.;
[Failure] I... I do not... no, I am afraid that you are mistaken. I do require coin to compensate for my aid. These gizka are not easy to manage.;
Fine. 100 credits it is.;
[Persuade] I was hoping to sell them. How about we just call it even?;
[Success] *sigh* I suppose it is better than nothing. We must have some creatures in our exhibit, after all.;
[Failure] The cost of maintaining such creatures is very high. I would be removing pests for you at my own expense?;
[Persuade] You want me to *pay* you? How about you give me 100 credits?;
[Success] I... suppose it is natural for off-worlders to desire commerce, even when it is unfair. Very well, I shall do as you ask, in the interest of peace.;
Here are your credits. I shall send someone by to remove the gizka from your vessel. Good day, off-worlder.;
[Failure] That is unfair of you to ask, off-worlder. You are attempting to sell me something I have already stated I do not need.;
[Failure] I do not think so, no. They have proven to be far too much trouble in the past.;
Actually, I would *really* like to get rid of these creatures.;
I am sure you would. They are practically a nuisance. I have no need of them, however, as I stated.;
[Persuade] How about if I paid you 100 credits as well? Would that help?;
[Success] *sigh* I suppose it would. I am not looking forward to the trouble this will cause, but if it will help you out... I will do what I can.;
I shall send some people by your vessel shortly to remove the gizka. Good day to you, off-worlder.;
[Persuade/Lie] But these are special gizka. They don't reproduce like the others do.;
[Success] They do not? Well, that is marvelous news! We would have the benefit of obtaining the gizka without the inconvenience of their numbers!;
If you wish, I will send some others over to your vessels right away to remove the gizka.;
[Persuade] The gizka are for *sale*... they aren't free.;
[Success] Ah. I hope 100 credits will be sufficient, then? I realize that such a rare strain of gizka might be worth more, but it is all I can afford.;
Thank you for your assistance, off-worlder. Dealing with you has proven far more pleasureable than I anticipated.;
[Failure] I am willing to take these gizka off your hands because of their unusual nature... I certainly will not purchase them!;
Fine, take them, then.;
Forget it. No deal.;
As you wish. Our negotiation is hereby suspended.;
Sounds good to me.;
[Failure] I have never heard of such a creature. I suspect you are merely desperate to offload your difficult circumstance onto another. Shame on you, off-worlder!;
[Force Persuade] But you want to take these gizka off my hands.;
[Success] Hmm. But maybe we could use these gizka, after all. It is better then having nothing at all to show, I suppose.;
Thanks anyway, then.;
My pleasure. Should you encounter some other exotic species, do please let me know.;
No, I don't have anything for you.;
Well, if you do come across something potentially interesting, please remember me. My name is Nubassa. I hope to see you again!;
I don't have time for questions.;
Greetings again, off-worlder. Have you happened upon any exotic species since we last spoke?;
How has the hunt been?;
Poor, to tell the truth. I am beginning to think we shall have no species at all in our zoological exhibit. *sigh*;
Gurke is through with you, and so is me.;
What you looking at, hah? *snort*;
Maybe we hunt everything tomorrow. Nobody else gets anything!;
Too many new humees in town.;
Bah! Tube-heads can't hunt. Why they allowed here?;
Heh... Jawas don't bounce good.;
You smell that? That's bantha... or maybe it's the new hunters.;
Uh... I got nothing to say to you. Maybe Gurke do, but that his business.;
You go away, humee. Cry to Gurke if you gotta talk. I don't care.;
It not my fault we are here. You blame Gurke if you gotta, not me.;
The ancient traditions state that you must enter the Temple alone. I will not perform the ritual if there are others with you.;
I will begin the ritual. It will take many hours, but when it is complete you must be ready... the shields will not stay down for long. Prepare yourself.;
*Chanting*;
Wait... someone is coming!;
Obey the laws here on Manaan, human.;NM26ACSECU16000_.mp3
[A veteran warrior, Carth knows better than to speak with you when enemies are so near.];
They're waiting for you inside.;NM13AACART02016_.mp3
[Something seems to be bothering Carth. Maybe you should speak to him and see if you can get him to open up about it.];
[Speak to Carth.];
Yes? What's on your mind?;NM35AACART04009_.mp3
Do you think you'll see Dustil again?;
I think so. If he's anything like he used to be, Dustil hates to be tricked. There's no way he'll let the Sith trick him again.;NM35AACART04025_.mp3
As for whether or not he'll be my son again... I don't know. He's so full of anger and hate... I wasn't expecting him to be like this.;NM35AACART04026_.mp3
Maybe we can work it out. I hope so. I guess I'll have to wait and see. Thanks, by the way... for all your help.;NM35AACART04027_.mp3
Do you want to talk about it?;
There's nothing to talk about. I failed my son... just as I failed my wife. I thought that if I ever found him...;NM35AACART04029_.mp3
I just can't believe he's dead. I... you should have stopped him! You should have done something to prevent this!;NM33ABCART04782_.mp3
Me? Why am I suddenly at fault?;
Oh, don't give me that innocent look! You can talk a Hutt out of his credits, you could have found a way... you could have saved him!;NM33ABCART04784_.mp3
That seems a lot to expect from me.;
Is it? You seem just fine at pulling off the near-impossible... when you want to.;NM33ABCART04797_.mp3
I can't help but wonder if part of you didn't enjoy this. I thought we might be friends, but with you... heh, who can tell?;NM33ABCART04798_.mp3
You think I enjoyed it? That's pretty low.;
Is it? I find it hard to tell which side you're on, sometimes. Still... not all the blame is yours. Most of it is mine.;NM33ABCART04800_.mp3
I... I wish we hadn't come. I wish I'd never found him.;NM33ABCART04787_.mp3
I'm sorry for your loss, Carth.;
I'm sorry, too. And I'm sorry I ever met you.;NM33ABCART04789_.mp3
I... no, I didn't mean that. Please... maybe it would be better if we continued with the mission. I want to... take my mind off this.;NM33ABCART04790_.mp3
Saving the galaxy is what's important now. My son... I can mourn my son later. When we're done. So... let's just go.;NM33ABCART04791_.mp3
You didn't fail him, Carth. You did your best.;
No, I did fail him. And so did you. I wish I'd never met you.;NM33ABCART04793_.mp3
Wishing won't help matters, will it?;
No. If it did, I would never have met you.;NM33ABCART04795_.mp3
Stop trying to put all the blame on me.;
All the blame? No. Part of the blame, though... part of the blame is yours. The rest is mine.;NM33ABCART04807_.mp3
We're not friends, Carth.;
No, I see that. I don't know what I was expecting, telling you all I did. The blame is mostly mine for this, anyway.;NM33ABCART04802_.mp3
Why didn't you want to? You knew how important finding Dustil was to me! You... you've helped others, why not him? Why not me?;NM33ABCART04803_.mp3
I'm sorry, Carth. I wish I could have stopped this.;
You could have. But... you're only partly to blame. I'm to blame for all the rest.;NM33ABCART04805_.mp3
He was a Sith, Carth, remember?;
He was my son!!;NM33ABCART04786_.mp3
You're right. I should have tried.;
Don't try blaming me for your problems, Carth.;
I'd like to know some more about you, Carth.;
Me? Well, I've been a star-pilot for the Republic for years. I've seen more than my share of wars... I fought in the Mandalorian Wars before all this started.;NM35AACART04032_.mp3
But with all that, I've never experienced anything like the slaughter these Sith animals can unleash. Not even the Mandalorians were that senseless.;NM35AACART04033_.mp3
My home world was one of the first planets to fall to Malak's fleet. The Sith bombed it into submission, and there wasn't a damn thing our Republic forces could do to stop them!;NM35AACART04034_.mp3
You're talking like it's your fault. Like you failed somehow.;
It shouldn't be my fault. I did everything I could... I followed my orders and did my duty. That shouldn't mean I failed them! I didn't!;NM35AACART04036_.mp3
Them? Do you mean the people of your home world?;
Yes. No... no, that's not what I mean. I mean... I'm sorry. I'm not making much sense, am I?;NM35AACART04038_.mp3
You probably mean well with your questions. I'm just not accustomed to talking about my past very much. At all, actually.;NM33AACART04662_.mp3
I'm more used to taking action... keeping my mind focused on the business at hand. So let's just do that. If you have more questions, ask them later.;NM35AACART04039_.mp3
I'm sorry, Carth. I didn't mean to upset you.;
I know. Don't worry about it. I just... must not be making much sense.;NM33AACART04660_.mp3
Hey, why are you getting so mad at me? It's not like this was my fault!;
I know that. I'm not angry at you... don't think that. I must not be making much sense.;NM33AACART04661_.mp3
I'm sorry, Carth. This must be very painful for you.;
"I'm just a soldier; I go where the fleet Admirals tell me to. I follow my orders and I do my duty. It just... *sigh* doesn't seem right that doing that means I failed them! I didn't!";NM35AACART04043_.mp3
Calm down. I was just asking.;
You're the one who wanted to know more about me. Well this is it, this is what I am.;NM33AACART04663_.mp3
Is this a good time to ask you some more questions?;
I'm all ears, beautiful.;NM33ABCART04815_.mp3
'Beautiful'? Isn't that a little inappropriate?;
Is there something else you'd prefer I called you?;NM35AACART04747_.mp3
How about my name?;
Don't get yourself in a twist over it, gorgeous. I didn't mean anything by it.;NM35AACART04751_.mp3
There you go again!;
Oh, for crying out -- fine. If it'll make you feel better, you call me something. Go ahead, come on, I can take it.;NM35AACART04753_.mp3
What? Don't be ridiculous.;
What? Are you afraid you'll hurt my feelings? Come on, spit it out. You can do it.;NM35AACART04755_.mp3
"How about ""sexist worm""?";
Is that it? You can do better than that!;NM35AACART04757_.mp3
Lobotomized Gamorrean!;
"Ouch. Heh heh heh. That *is* better. Well, I bet ""beautiful"" doesn't sound so bad in comparison now, does it?";NM35AACART04759_.mp3
Maybe not, but I still don't want you calling me that.;
Stubborn as ever. Okay, you got me. I bet you have your heart set on those questions. Are they really necessary?;NM35AACART04761_.mp3
Not if you have a problem with it.;
No. No, I don't have a problem with it, really. Go ahead and interrogate me.;NM33AACART04666_.mp3
This isn't an interrogation. I never said that.;
No, I was just joking, though you do seem to be full of questions. It's rather refreshing, to be honest.;NM33AACART04672_.mp3
Let me ask you something first, though. I've been going through the battle aboard the Endar Spire over and over in my head since we crashed.;NM33AACART04677_.mp3
Some things just don't add up for me. Maybe you could tell me what happened... from your perspective.;NM33AACART04678_.mp3
Like you said when we first met: Bastila didn't have time to use her powers.;
True. Bastila is as powerful as they say... she's the one who defeated Darth Revan, after all.;NM35AACART04048_.mp3
Hmm. I guess that no Jedi ability, no matter how powerful, makes up for being completely surprised and outmatched.;NM35AACART04049_.mp3
We didn't choose that battle, anyway. It got forced on us. Hell, I'm just surprised that any of us are alive to talk about it.;NM35AACART04050_.mp3
Come to think of it, it's more than a little surprising that you happen to be here, isn't it? Just what is your position with the Republic fleet, anyway?;NM35AACART04051_.mp3
Why? Are you accusing me of something?;
Not at all. I just think it's a bit odd that someone who got added to the crew roster at the last minute just happens to be one of the survivors.;NM35AACART04053_.mp3
You'd rather I wasn't?;
Don't be ridiculous. You've more than proved yourself since the crash... we wouldn't have made it this far without you. But still...;NM35AACART04055_.mp3
Are you implying *I* had something to do with the crash?;
No. Well... maybe. Don't get me wrong, it just seems odd that someone Bastila's party specifically requested to transfer aboard happened to survive.;NM35AACART04059_.mp3
I have no idea what you're talking about!;
The Jedi requested numerous things when they came on board... hell, they practically took over the ship, as far as I could tell.;NM35AACART04062_.mp3
Considering your connection to Bastila and the Jedi... whether you know it or not... your presence here seems a little convenient.;NM35AACART04063_.mp3
I'm probably wrong and this is probably nothing, I know. I learned a long time ago not to take things at face value, however. And I *hate* surprises.;NM35AACART04064_.mp3
What do you mean by surprises?;
I mean I have to expect the unexpected. Just to be safe.;NM35AACART04066_.mp3
Are you always this suspicious?;
Look... it has nothing to do with you, personally. I don't trust anyone, and I have my reasons.;NM33AACART04680_.mp3
And, no, I'm not going to discuss them. So can we just keep our mind on more important things?;NM33AACART04681_.mp3
I consider this important.;
Alright, alright. You must be the most damned persistent woman I've ever met.;NM33AACART04684_.mp3
We'll talk about it... but later. Right now I just want to get going.;NM33AACART04686_.mp3
Alright, Alright. You're pretty damned tenacious, you know that?;NM33AACART04685_.mp3
You haven't heard the last from me on this.;
Yes, let's do that.;
Good. Like I said before, I prefer action to talk, anyway.;NM33AACART04688_.mp3
Fine. Let's just get back to something important, then.;
You do know we're on the same side, right?;
Try something and it'll be the last mistake you make.;
I'm telling you, Carth, I had nothing to do with the crash.;
I expect you're right. I've got no real reason to suspect you of anything. Still... it's better to be safe than sorry, right?;NM35AACART04068_.mp3
Shouldn't we be trying to work together?;
I am working with you. I'd be a fool not to. I'd also be a fool not to expect the unexpected.;NM35AACART04070_.mp3
Why would Bastila request my transfer?;
It doesn't make any difference. Go ahead and be paranoid.;
I'm not trying to be paranoid. It's just that I learned a long time ago that something which looks like a coincidence probably isn't. Especially when the Jedi are involved.;NM35AACART04079_.mp3
What's so odd about me being added to the crew at the last minute?;
You were the only one. Not to mention that Bastila's party was the one who requested your transfer.;NM35AACART04057_.mp3
I used to be a smuggler, if you must know. I was recruited into the fleet for my knowledge.;
A smuggler? I should have guessed. Isn't it odd, however, that a smuggler who was added to the crew at the last minute just happens to be alive?;NM35AACART04081_.mp3
I'm a scout. I was recruited into the fleet for my skills, if you must know.;
Well, that makes sense. Still... it seems a bit strange that someone who was a last-minute addition to the crew roster is one of the survivors.;NM35AACART04083_.mp3
I'm just a soldier. I'm sure there isn't anything unusual about that, is there?;
Hell no... unless you consider that you were a last-minute addition to the crew roster and you just happen to be one of the survivors.;NM35AACART04085_.mp3
Why ask me? I don't see the point.;
I'm just trying to figure it out. I saw enough men lose their lives needlessly during the Mandalorian Wars. It's... difficult to see that happening all over again.;NM35AACART04087_.mp3
We lost the ship and a lot of good people... and for what? On the hope that Jedi powers would save us, somehow. Not that Bastila had much of an opportunity to act.;NM35AACART04088_.mp3
I wasn't in a position to know what was going on, really.;
Neither was I, to tell the truth. I was onboard as an advisor for the most part. The battle began so fast, it's anyone's guess as to what actually happened.;NM35AACART04090_.mp3
Are you getting testy again?;
I don't get testy. I get angry. And if I was angry, you wouldn't have to ask me if I was, let me assure you.;NM33AACART04674_.mp3
Excellent. Soon all your secrets will be mine!;
All my secrets are purely of the mundane variety, unfortunately. Nothing worth extracting, though you're welcome to try.;NM33AACART04676_.mp3
I just would like to know you better.;
Oh. Well, if it's an interrogation you wanted, why didn't you say so?;NM33AACART04668_.mp3
Don't be such a child. It's just a few questions.;
Oh no, how can I resist a challenge to my manly pride, huh? Ha ha! Fine, you've made your point. Interrogate at will.;NM33AACART04670_.mp3
Are you getting angry again?;
If I was, you wouldn't have to ask. So don't worry about it.;NM33ABCART04811_.mp3
Ha ha! You are such a pain, you know that?;
Guilty as charged. I'll bet you still have those questions in mind, though. Are they really necessary?;NM35AACART04763_.mp3
Brainless, lice-ridden bantha!;
Sexless marsh-toad!;
"How about ""pushy thug""?";
Forget it. Let's get back to my questions.;
All business today, eh? Are these questions really necessary?;NM33ABCART04814_.mp3
That's no good, either.;
Now that one I like. Call me that from now on.;
I might consider it. What are you going to call me, in exchange?;NM35AACART04770_.mp3
"How about ""handsome thug""?";
"I like the first part of that. I'm a bit more partial to ""the most handsome pilot in the galaxy"". What do you think?";NM35AACART04772_.mp3
Don't hold your breath.;
"Well, then, I guess ""gorgeous"" will have to do until then, won't it?";NM35AACART04774_.mp3
Kidding aside, I bet you're not about to give up on those questions of yours. Are they really necessary?;NM35AACART04775_.mp3
I think I'm going to be ill.;
I'll think about it.;
I'd prefer you didn't call me anything. It's demeaning.;
How about 'gorgeous'? I like that better.;
Keep addressing me like that and you might lose an ear or two.;
Heh heh. A little bit touchy, are we? Is there something else you'd prefer I called you?;NM35AACART04749_.mp3
I like the sound of that.;
Which? The fact that I'm all ears or the beautiful part?;NM33ABCART04817_.mp3
Carth, are you flirting with me?;
Not really. Just a habit. You have something you'd rather I call you by?;NM33ABCART04819_.mp3
The beautiful part. Keep calling me that.;
Why do I get the impression that you're not serious?;
Maybe I'm just avoiding your questions. Is this really necessary?;NM33ABCART04822_.mp3
I guess I did say you could ask me questions later, didn't I? Is this really necessary?;NM33AACART04664_.mp3
Answer the damn questions, already.;
Pretty snappy with the orders, are we? Okay, you got it... sir.;NM33ABCART04824_.mp3
I want to discuss something with you.;
You do? Fair enough. What do you want to discuss?;NM35AACART04778_.mp3
I want to talk about these issues you seem to have with me.;
*Sigh* I knew you wouldn't understand where I was coming from. Let me try to explain.;NM35AACART04092_.mp3
You're probably one of the most skilled women I've ever met. You've saved my butt more than once and I'm lucky you're here to help me, no question.;NM33AACART04690_.mp3
But that doesn't mean I'm going to stop watching you or being wary. I'm just not built that way. Period.;NM35AACART04094_.mp3
Not built that way? That sounds like an excuse.;
Maybe so. But I've been betrayed before by people I... well, it won't happen again, that's all.;NM35AACART04096_.mp3
So you want some guarantee that I won't betray you?!;
I don't know that you'll betray me. But there are no guarantees... not for you, not for me. You don't have to take it personally.;NM35AACART04098_.mp3
Don't tell me not to take it personally, you hairless Wookiee!;
Hairless Wookiee? Alright, sister, just... just... just calm down before your head explodes.;NM35AACART04106_.mp3
We'll just see whose head explodes, you ungrateful monkey-lizard!;
Is that your idea of an insult? Come on, sister, take your best shot.;NM33AACART04692_.mp3
Gamorrean pig-man!;
Oh, ouch. I think you hurt my man-feelings with that one.;NM33AACART04694_.mp3
Well, you had it coming.;
I guess I did. Feel better now?;NM33AACART04696_.mp3
Maybe a little.;
Good. Then maybe we can talk reasonably about this.;NM33AACART04698_.mp3
All I've been trying to say is that this isn't personal. If you were smart, you wouldn't trust anyone, either... not me, not Bastila and especially not yourself.;NM35AACART04729_.mp3
Ahhh... so you don't trust yourself, is that it?;
I don't need to be analyzed, thanks. Can we just get back to business?;NM33AACART04720_.mp3
I don't need someone around who doesn't trust me.;
And I don't need all these questions. What I do need is to try and save the galaxy, if that's even possible.;NM33AACART04711_.mp3
Why is whether or not I trust you or anyone so damned important to you? Why... why do you even care?;NM33AACART04712_.mp3
We don't have time for this, so can we please just... drop it. For now? Can we pick it up later if you really must, I... want to get underway.;NM33AACART04713_.mp3
So leave. Be on your own, it's obviously what you want.;
It's not what I want. I have a duty and I intend to see it through. The galaxy's in danger and I want to save it... that's what I want!;NM33AACART04715_.mp3
You sure you don't want to talk about it?;
No, I don't want to talk about it. What I want is to save the galaxy... if that's even possible.;NM33AACART04717_.mp3
That settles that, I guess.;
Pretty pithy advice, I see.;
I wouldn't want to live like that.;
Not all of us have the luxury of a choice. I'm conditioned this way, sorry.;NM33AACART04722_.mp3
Not really. This is still serious.;
*Sigh* Look... all I mean is that if you're smart, you won't trust anyone... not me, not Bastila and especially not yourself.;NM33AACART04700_.mp3
Don't patronize me.;
Wouldn't think of it. Feel better now?;NM35AACART04731_.mp3
Drooling Bomarr cast-off!;
Don't tell me to calm down, you ignorant bantha!;
I'm beginning to wonder if you're even capable of trusting anyone.;
Well, you can stop wondering. I'm not.;NM35AACART04112_.mp3
Right. And how am I supposed to know that *you* won't betray us?;
Me?;NM35AACART04114_.mp3
Yes, you! Why should I trust you, after all?;
You shouldn't. If you're smart, you won't trust anyone... not me, not Bastila, and especially not yourself.;NM35AACART04121_.mp3
Why not you? Accusing other people is a good cover for a traitor.;
"I don't remember ever saying anything about ""traitor"". All I mean is that if you're smart, you won't trust anyone... not me, not Bastila and especially not yourself.";NM35AACART04125_.mp3
I didn't ask for your advice, nor do I need it.;
No, I do take it personally!;
Well, that's too bad, then, because it's not going to change.;NM33ABCART04826_.mp3
I'm starting to get pretty tired of this attitude of yours.;
Yeah, well, you wouldn't be the first. Look... I don't expect you to be my friend. This is just the way I am, no need to take it personally.;NM35AACART04127_.mp3
Of course it won't happen again if you never trust anyone!;
Look... I'm not trying to insult you. This is just the way I am, no need to take it personally.;NM35AACART04129_.mp3
Why are you so hostile? What did I do to deserve this?;
You, uh... haven't done anything *yet*. But there's no guarantee that you won't do anything in the future. I've been betrayed before by people and I... well, it won't happen again.;NM35AACART04131_.mp3
And what, exactly, are you watching me for?;
I don't know that, yet. Like I said before, it's probably nothing. But I've been betrayed before by people and I... well, it won't happen again, that's all.;NM35AACART04133_.mp3
You've got the skills of an elite commando, and you've saved my butt more than once. Between that and your facility with languages, I'm lucky you're here.;NM35AACART04093_.mp3
We didn't finish our conversation last time.;
I'd like to know now if we have a problem.;
I just want to talk with you.;
Oh? You want to argue some more, is that it?;NM35AACART04135_.mp3
I'm always up for a good fight.;
Ha! Can't say I've met a woman quite like you before. You're really something.;NM35AACART04137_.mp3
I just don't trust easily, and for good reasons... which are my own.;NM35AACART04143_.mp3
But we have to work together, Carth, so it has plenty to do with me.;
Ahhh, damn it. I suppose I won't get any rest until I talk, will I? You want to know why I don't trust anyone? Fine, here goes.;NM35AACART04147_.mp3
Five years ago the Jedi had just finished the war with the Mandalorians. Revan and Malak were heroes. I was damn proud to have served in their fleet.;NM35AACART04148_.mp3
It was completely unexpected when they turned on us, invading the Republic while we were still weak. Nobody knew what to think, least of all me.;NM35AACART04149_.mp3
Our heroes had become brutal, conquering Sith... and we were all but helpless before them. Think about it... if you can't even trust the best of the Jedi, who can you trust?;NM35AACART04150_.mp3
What do I have to do with Malak and Revan?;
It... it's not that. It's... That's not what I mean. There were... there were others. Good, solid, trusted men who joined them.;NM35AACART04152_.mp3
Malak and Revan and the Sith deserve to die for what they've done... but the ones who fled the Republic and joined them are even worse.;NM35AACART04157_.mp3
The dark side has nothing to do with why they joined with the Sith. They deserve no mercy!;NM35AACART04158_.mp3
You say that with such... hatred.;
I know. I... should apologize to you. I've become so accustomed to expecting the worst in others, and you've done nothing to deserve that.;NM35AACART04161_.mp3
It's just... never mind. Let's just continue with what we were doing. I'd rather not talk about it.;NM35AACART04162_.mp3
I haven't joined the Sith, Carth.;
They turned to the dark side, obviously. Why is it so personal?;
I... of course the Jedi turned to the dark side. There were others, however, who weren't Jedi. Good men... trusted men who joined them.;NM35AACART04154_.mp3
I suppose you can't. That must have been hard to take.;
I... it wasn't even that. There were others: good, solid men. Trusted men who turned on us, as well, and joined their cause.;NM35AACART04156_.mp3
What reasons? I want to know.;
Fine. You can stuff your reasons, then.;
I can make you talk, Carth. Trust me.;
Heh heh. Well I might be willing to take you up on that challenge. But uh, you're just not going to let up, are you? Fine... you want to know why I don't trust anyone? Here goes.;NM33ABCART04828_.mp3
So I've seen. If I were Malak I'd be a bit nervous to have you on my tail.;NM35AACART04138_.mp3
I just want to know why you distrust me so much.;
What does it matter that much? Why can't you just leave it be?;NM35AACART04140_.mp3
No, I don't want to argue with you.;
And I don't really want to argue with you, either. You seem... sincere enough, I guess.;NM35AACART04142_.mp3
I want to continue our discussion from before.;
I thought I said I didn't want to talk about it anymore.;NM35AACART04164_.mp3
Don't you think you'd feel better if you discussed it?;
Listen, sister... just because we're working together does not mean you get to badger me with constant questions!;NM33ABCART04829_.mp3
Do we have another problem, now?;
Blast it if you aren't the most frustrating woman to talk to! Isn't there someone else you can harass for a little while?;NM33ABCART04831_.mp3
*I'm* frustrating? Look who's talking!;
What? Me? What did I do?;NM33ABCART04833_.mp3
Oh, that's rich. Where have you been?;
I... *sigh* Okay, I give up. You win.;NM33ABCART04840_.mp3
Look, I suppose I... could use someone to talk to. I'm just not used to it. And I don't know why you're so interested. But here goes.;NM33ABCART04845_.mp3
When I think of all the men who have betrayed us, the one that stands out above them all is the one I respected the most. Saul.;NM35AACART04171_.mp3
You say that name like I should know it.;
You don't? I thought everyone did. Admiral Saul Karath is the commander of the entire Sith fleet. He's half the reason Malak has done so well in the war.;NM35AACART04173_.mp3
Saul was my commanding officer back when the Mandalorian Wars first began. He taught me everything about being a soldier... and I looked up to him.;NM35AACART04174_.mp3
Saul approached me before he left. He talked to me about how the Republic was on the losing side... and about how I should start thinking of my survival.;NM35AACART04175_.mp3
I know now that he was trying to recruit me into the Sith, but I couldn't have conceived of it back then. I argued with him and he got angry and he left. I never saw him again.;NM35AACART04176_.mp3
You didn't think he would betray the Republic?;
Saul was my mentor... he led us to so many victories against the Mandalorians, even when things looked to be at their worst.;NM35AACART04178_.mp3
I just... I couldn't conceive of it. He... he couldn't be serious. I was wrong, of course... he not only left us for the Sith, he... he gave them the codes to bypass our scanners.;NM35AACART04179_.mp3
I remember waking up as the first of the Sith bombers snuck past our defenses and began destroying half of our docked ships. I knew right away what had happened.;NM35AACART04180_.mp3
I... could have stopped him. I could have stopped it all.;NM35AACART04181_.mp3
So you blame yourself for trusting your friend?;
I blame Saul, not myself. I was... I was stupid and I ignored the danger. He nearly destroyed us all.;NM35AACART04183_.mp3
I've fought Saul for years, now, and if I ever catch up to him... he will regret what he's done. He will regret it.;NM35AACART04188_.mp3
So that's all of it, then?;
No. No, it's not.;NM35AACART04190_.mp3
But I don't want to talk about it right now. Let's go.;NM35AACART04191_.mp3
That's terrible. I feel awful for you.;
Well... there's more to the story, I guess.;NM35AACART04734_.mp3
I'd do the same thing in your shoes.;
Do you really believe that?;
I don't know. Maybe. He might have killed me if I'd tried, or I might have killed him. I was stupid, however, and I let him go.;NM35AACART04185_.mp3
And that's why you feel so sorry for yourself?;
Don't even start with that! I don't feel sorry for myself. I feel angry... at Saul and all those others. It's all I can think about sometimes!;NM35AACART04187_.mp3
How could you have not seen through that?;
I didn't want to, maybe. Are you so sure you would have?;NM35AACART04737_.mp3
That name sounds familiar.;
With good reason. Admiral Saul Karath is the commander of the entire Sith fleet. He's half the reason Malak has done so well in the war.;NM35AACART04739_.mp3
You don't know? Typical male.;
Never mind. I'll leave you alone, since I'm so frustrating.;
Wait... *sigh* I didn't mean it that way. Don't go, damn it.;NM33ABCART04844_.mp3
What exactly is it about me that frustrates you?;
Oh no, I'm not falling for that one. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.;NM33ABCART04838_.mp3
Really? It's hard to tell.;
And you say I'm frustrating to deal with.;
Alright, then, I'll leave you alone if that's what you want.;
Well, I wouldn't want you to feel harassed. Have it your way.;
You're damn right it does.;
I'm not going to repeat myself, Carth, You owe me.;
I... suppose you're right. Fine, then. But I don't know why you're so interested, but here it goes.;NM35AACART04170_.mp3
Not particularly. I... guess it wouldn't hurt, exactly, either, though I don't know why you're so interested.;NM35AACART04166_.mp3
Yes, but I'm bored, so spit it out.;
Cute. Nice to know that you're so full of concern. *Sigh* Well, I guess it wouldn't hurt, though I don't know why you're so interested.;NM35AACART04168_.mp3
I think you owe me an explanation, Carth.;
You've been very quiet, lately, you know that?;
Have I been quiet? I suppose I have. I guess I just don't like being left out of the loop.;NM35AACART04193_.mp3
You were born out of the loop.;
Very cute. If you got any cuter, you'd pass for a Gamorrean's sister.;NM33ABCART04849_.mp3
The things you say!;
Look, I'm serious. No one seems to want to tell me anything, and it's starting to irritate me.;NM33ABCART04852_.mp3
For one thing, I want to know what the Jedi Council said to you. They pulled you in there and refused to tell me a thing about it.;NM35AACART04196_.mp3
*That* is none of your concern, Carth, and you would do well to leave the matter be.;NM35AACART04197_.mp3
I respect you, Bastila, but you've been as close-mouthed as the rest of the Council. If you won't talk to me, then maybe somebody else will.;NM35AACART04198_.mp3
Why should anything the Jedi do seem strange to you?;
I may not know much about the Jedi, but I do know they aren't famous for taking on old Padawans and sending them on dangerous assignments.;NM35AACART04201_.mp3
They said there's a bond between Bastila and myself.;
"A bond? What kind of bond? You mean to say that they told you you were ""tied"" to Bastila in some way? Heh. I have trouble believing that.";NM35AACART04203_.mp3
I've been watching you... you can be cruel and impulsive. A Jedi without self-control or training, and yet the Council sends you on your way? Why?;NM35AACART04218_.mp3
I'm not trying to provoke you or imply that you're somehow responsible for the Jedi Council... but give me a hand, here! There has to be a reason!;NM33AACART04725_.mp3
Are you saying I'm not needed?;
No, I don't... I didn't mean that you weren't wanted, or that I want to go! It's just... damn it!;NM33AACART04726_.mp3
I'll tell you this much... I am *not* going to wait around until I'm betrayed again!;NM35AACART04206_.mp3
I am *not* going to betray you! I am *not* Saul!;
Well, we'll just see about that, won't we?;NM35AACART04208_.mp3
Look, I didn't mean it that way. I want to get to Saul, not... no... no, forget it. It seems all I can do is insult you, isn't it?;NM33AACART04727_.mp3
Just forget I said anything. Let's... let's... just get on with what we were doing.;NM33AACART04728_.mp3
And just what are you going to do about it?;
Nothing. Not yet. You just better hope I don't get a reason to.;NM35AACART04210_.mp3
I am *sick* of listening to this. Just shut up or leave!;
Fine. You got it. Conversation over.;NM35AACART04212_.mp3
I'm here and that's not going to change. Get over it.;
I'm sick of listening to you rant! Why don't *you* leave?!;
Bastila and I have a bond. We have to do this together. That's all I'm going to say.;
And what does that mean? Is this more of that destiny garbage that the Jedi keep talking about? Well, that can't be it!;NM35AACART04217_.mp3
You're a neophyte Padawan who's been saddled with the responsibility of tracking down these Star Maps. Why? That's not normal!;NM35AACART04204_.mp3
I've done pretty well so far.;
That's completely beside the point. The Jedi encouraged you to stay with us, and I don't believe the reasons they gave.;NM35AACART04220_.mp3
They thought it was more important that I help find the Star Maps than stay.;
And why is that? You were a great help on Taris, but why would they keep you with us? Don't they... don't they have to train you?;NM35AACART04228_.mp3
It's none of your business, frankly.;
None of my business? Uh, I'm sorry... aren't I a part of this mission? The Jedi may be in charge, but I'm risking all the same things you are!;NM35AACART04222_.mp3
Isn't that the point? Aren't we all in this together?;
Are we? Why, then, does it seem like the Jedi know everything and leave the rest of us out in the cold?;NM35AACART04224_.mp3
Get ahold of yourself. I'm sick of your paranoia.;
You can be sick of whatever you like. What I'm sick of is being kept in the dark!;NM35AACART04226_.mp3
I'm rather curious to know what went on... and why they didn't keep you on Dantooine for training. Isn't that strange?;NM35AACART04199_.mp3
Why don't you ask Bastila?;
I would be more than happy to, but she's as close-mouthed as the rest of the Council. I'm hoping you'll be the one to enlighten me.;NM33AACART04724_.mp3
Better than a Gamorrean's mother.;
Left out of the loop? I don't understand.;
Left out of the loop. You know. Not being told anything... strung along. It's really starting to irritate me.;NM35AACART04195_.mp3
I'm not the one leaving you out of the loop, Carth.;
No? Well, you certainly aren't helping matters any, either, and it's really starting to irritate me.;NM35AACART04230_.mp3
Oh, poor baby. You need filling in on some detail?;
Listen, sister, I don't remember reading anywhere that it's a requirement that you remain with us after we left Taris, yet here you are.;NM35AACART04232_.mp3
Same could be said for you.;
Well... yeah, true enough, I guess. But, damn it, I'm tired of nobody telling me anything!;NM33ABCART04854_.mp3
I have more of a purpose here than you do, flyboy.;
Well, damn it, I want to know why that is! I want some questions answered!;NM33ABCART04856_.mp3
Yes, here I am. And I'm not going anywhere.;
You want to be smart, do you? Fine. So long as I get some questions answered.;NM35AACART04233_.mp3
We didn't end our last discussion very well...;
I, ahhh... I'm not very good at this. I... I know I owe you an apology. Uh, more than one, probably.;NM35AACART04235_.mp3
I was just so desperate to finally face Saul directly in the battle over Taris, and now the Jedi have us looking for these... these Star Maps.;NM35AACART04236_.mp3
I know this mission is important, it's just... I feel a bit useless. I can fight, sure, but I'm no Jedi... all this feels completely out of my league.;NM35AACART04237_.mp3
And how does that excuse your actions?;
It doesn't, I know. It's... been a while since I even had to think about that sort of thing.;NM35AACART04239_.mp3
I just hate not knowing what's going on and feeling this... helpless. But I shouldn't have taken that out on you. I've been a royal pain in the backside, haven't I?;NM35AACART04240_.mp3
Not really. I couldn't care less what you think.;
I guess there's no harm done then. Still I, uh... I should know better by now.;NM35AACART04242_.mp3
So... I'm sorry. Will you accept my apology?;NM35AACART04243_.mp3
I don't know. Maybe you should work for it, a bit.;
Oh? I don't know if I like the sound of that...;NM33ABCART04859_.mp3
Don't you want me to accept your apology?;
I don't know. What am I going to have to do for it?;NM33ABCART04861_.mp3
Blow away the bad guy. Save the damsel in distress. The usual.;
Oh, the usual. Well that's not so hard. Let's get to it, then, shall we?;NM33ABCART04863_.mp3
Just make sure you don't need to make any more apologies. Deal?;
Done! Let's get underway, then, shall we... partner?;NM35AACART04245_.mp3
Just a little kiss. How about it?;
I...heh, I really think that we should, ah... get going.;NM33ABCART04866_.mp3
No kiss, then?;
I'm sorry. I'm glad things are better between us, now. We should... we should go.;NM33ABCART04869_.mp3
I was only joking, Carth, relax.;
No need to start sweating, Carth. I was only teasing.;
So... you do accept my apology. Huh. Good. Good. I'm glad.;NM33ABCART04871_.mp3
You know you, uh... you aren't so bad to have around, you know that?;NM33ABCART04872_.mp3
I know. I'm very charming, I'm told.;
More than that. But... anyway... we should be off...;NM33ABCART04874_.mp3
I knew there was a reason we kept you.;
Right. Off we go.;NM33ABCART04877_.mp3
I have my uses. Let's go.;
Only if you agree to work with me, for once.;
No, I won't. Just keep quiet and do what you're told from now on.;
Don't drown me in sentiment, already. *Sigh* Fair enough, let's move on.;NM35AACART04247_.mp3
You sure have.;
Ha! Well... I guess I should be at least a little pleased that I haven't lost my touch.;NM35AACART04249_.mp3
Don't worry about it, Carth.;
No, I do worry about it. I've traveled the lanes more than once, I should know better than this.;NM35AACART04251_.mp3
Why don't you return to the front lines, then?;
Because this is more important. This may really, finally, make a difference... I suppose even if I can't figure out everything that's going on, I still want to help if I can.;NM35AACART04253_.mp3
Maybe if you pull yourself together you won't be so useless.;
You don't exactly pull any punches, do you? Not that I don't deserve it, I suppose.;NM35AACART04255_.mp3
Do you want to talk? You got pretty upset the last time we spoke.;
Tell me why you want revenge on Saul so badly.;
I already told you. He betrayed us all.;NM35AACART04258_.mp3
It just seems to be more... personal than that, is all.;
Well, There... there is more to it. I'm... I'm sure you don't want to hear about it.;NM35AACART04260_.mp3
I asked, didn't I?;
It's just that I... don't talk about it very much. Ok?;NM35AACART04262_.mp3
I told you about my homeworld. Telos. Four years ago, Saul led the Sith fleet there and demanded its surrender. The planet refused and Saul proceeded to devastate its entire surface. Millions died.;NM35AACART04263_.mp3
I had... a wife and son on Telos. I thought they would be safe there. But my task force arrived too late to be of much help.;NM35AACART04264_.mp3
We didn't have enough medical supplies. The colony was burning and the dying were everywhere. I remember holding my wife and screaming for the medics. They... didn't come in time.;NM35AACART04265_.mp3
That's terrible, I'm sorry. I didn't know.;
Of course not. How could you? I... had nothing left after that, really. I devoted myself to the fleet. Hunting Saul was my only purpose.;NM35AACART04267_.mp3
I... miss them. I know killing Saul won't bring them back, and it won't make me happy again... but I have to do it.;NM35AACART04268_.mp3
I don't expect you to understand. I have to pay him back for what he's done... I have to. It's all I have left.;NM35AACART04269_.mp3
I didn't mean to pry.;
No, it's alright, I don't mind. You deserved some kind of... explanation.;NM35AACART04271_.mp3
So what happened to your son? You didn't say.;
His name was Dustil and I don't know what happened to him. The colony was a complete ruin, and we never found any trace of him.;NM35AACART04275_.mp3
I made inquiries and followed the reports from Telos for years, but... I stopped.;NM35AACART04276_.mp3
Anyway... I hope that answers your questions. Let's, uh... let's continue with what we were doing.;NM35AACART04277_.mp3
Anyway... that's the story. For what it's worth.;NM35AACART04278_.mp3
Thank you for telling me.;
I've... never talked about it before. To anyone. I suppose it's time I finally did.;NM35AACART04273_.mp3
Fair enough.;
What was she like, your wife?;
She had courage... and she was stubborn. Heh... a little bit like you in that respect. I could never talk her out of anything once she put her mind to it.;NM33ABCART04878_.mp3
And she hated it when I signed back onto the fleet at the start of the war. I had planned on... on leaving soon, to join her...;NM35AACART04282_.mp3
So this is where all that anger comes from.;
Yes. I can't forgive Saul for this. He took everything from me, even... even my trust. I hope you can understand that.;NM35AACART04284_.mp3
She had courage and ... and she was stubborn. I could never talk her out of anything once she put her mind to it.;NM35AACART04281_.mp3
So what? Tough break. You haven't gotten over it yet?;
Gotten over it? Look - my family was everything to me. Once they were gone... I had nothing. Hunting Saul became my only purpose.;NM35AACART04286_.mp3
What happened after that?;
I had... had nothing left after that, really. I devoted myself to the fleet. Hunting Saul was my only purpose.;NM33ABCART04880_.mp3
I do, if that's alright with you.;
Spit it out already.;
Come on, Carth, you aren't fooling me.;
What do you know about Revan and Malak?;
To think that I once looked up to those two as the best that humanity had to offer. Now I'd like nothing more than to put a blaster to both their heads.;NM35AACART04289_.mp3
Although I suppose only Malak is left, isn't he? Turned on his own master, not that Revan didn't have it coming. Heh. Typical for their kind, I guess.;NM35AACART04290_.mp3
You knew them personally?;
No, not personally. They aided the Republic during the Mandalorian wars. They were heroes. Without them the Mandaloreans would have finished us for certain.;NM35AACART04292_.mp3
In the fleet, we didn't see much of the Jedi. I only met Malak once, but I was impressed by him. I guess that just shows how much the dark side can change someone.;NM35AACART04293_.mp3
Do you know why they turned to the dark side?;
Nobody does. When they left after the Mandalorian wars ended, they were Jedi. When they returned... they were something else.;NM35AACART04316_.mp3
How did they get away with all this?;
Well... when they returned from wherever they went, they had an entire fleet with them. Nobody knows where they got the ships.;NM35AACART04318_.mp3
They had a lot of them and as the years have passed there always seems to be more and more... while our forces dwindle.;NM35AACART04319_.mp3
Did they really get away with it, though? Revan was betrayed by Malak... and Malak hasn't won. In the end, the dark side won't help him.;NM35AACART04320_.mp3
What do you know about the dark side?;
I, uh... used to think that it was a fancy name for something that I see every day. Corruption is everywhere. People are greedy and stupid and do horrible things.;NM35AACART04295_.mp3
I'm starting to think it's different for the Jedi, however. That there's this evil watching them, waiting for its chance.;NM35AACART04296_.mp3
I've been watching you. You have this, uh... incredible darkness inside you. Some of the things you do disturb me.;NM35AACART04297_.mp3
It's not just you. It's Bastila, as well. She's so... intense. I don't pretend to know much about the Force... but I know evil.;NM35AACART04298_.mp3
You think Bastila and I are evil?;
No, of course not. All I'm saying is that when you have so much power, the stakes are higher. I can only imagine the kind of conflict that goes on inside you.;NM35AACART04300_.mp3
Neither you nor Bastila are fully trained on how to handle your power. I'm just concerned at what might come.;NM35AACART04301_.mp3
That's sweet. I didn't know you cared.;
Well, that's not what I... I mean... I wouldn't want to see you hurt. Either of you.;NM35AACART04303_.mp3
I suppose finding the Star Maps is more important than your training... and your safety. I just hope there isn't a price for you to pay.;NM35AACART04304_.mp3
I can handle myself, Carth.;
I know that, and Bastila says the same thing. You're both incredible women. I'm just... I'm just not sure this is the kind of thing you can defeat.;NM35AACART04306_.mp3
I don't need you mothering me. Leave me alone from now on.;
I didn't mean to... <Sigh> Fine, fine. I suppose I shouldn't stick my nose where it doesn't belong. I'll leave you be.;NM35AACART04308_.mp3
You don't know what you're talking about, Carth.;
No? I know how people change. I remember how Malak looked and acted before his return... I bet the old Malak discounted the possibility that he would ever fall, as well.;NM35AACART04310_.mp3
I'm not falling to the dark side, Carth, and I won't.;
I do what I want, and enjoy my power. Evil has nothing to do with it.;
That's a frightening thought. I hope you're right.;NM35AACART04313_.mp3
You have so much courage and strength in you... yet, somehow, I have no trouble imagining it differently. Like the flip side of a coin.;NM35AACART04314_.mp3
You seem like you're far away. Is something wrong?;
Oh... it's nothing. Sorry.;NM35AACART04322_.mp3
It doesn't seem like nothing.;
I told you my wife died four years ago. I... I've just been trying to remember what she looked like.;NM35AACART04324_.mp3
It shouldn't be so difficult. I can remember things about her... things she did. The way she smiled, what her hair smelled like, our last fight... just not her face.;NM35AACART04325_.mp3
I try to hold it in my head but it's gone. Is... that strange? Maybe I shouldn't be talking to you about this.;NM35AACART04326_.mp3
It does feel a little odd to discuss her, I admit.;
Ahhh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have mentioned it, even if you asked. I just find you, I don't know... easy to talk to.;NM35AACART04328_.mp3
I, uh... it must look really strange for me to be obsessing like this, still. You must think I'm incredibly stupid.;NM35AACART04331_.mp3
No, but I doubt your wife would want you to do this to yourself.;
I... suppose you're probably right. But I have to do it, anyway.;NM35AACART04333_.mp3
The only thing that's kept me going since she died has been the need to find Saul and kill him. It's better to think about that than... anything else.;NM35AACART04334_.mp3
If I can do that, then maybe I can let her go. Let it all go.;NM35AACART04335_.mp3
If we encounter Saul... if we ever have the chance, promise me that I will be the one to kill him. I have to settle this... I need to.;NM35AACART04336_.mp3
Things may not work out that way. I can't promise that.;
Whether it does or not, that's the way it has to be. I... guess there's no need to discuss it until then.;NM35AACART04341_.mp3
If we get the opportunity... then I promise.;
Thank you. I... guess there's really nothing else to say.;NM35AACART04339_.mp3
That's not going to help anything, Carth.;
What I think shouldn't matter, Carth.;
Maybe. It can't be worse than what I tell myself, sometimes.;NM35AACART04343_.mp3
Not only that, you're a fool. You're wasting your time on useless ghosts.;
She isn't a ghost to me. I still remember holding her as she died... and I doubt I'll forget until I've paid Saul back in kind.;NM35AACART04345_.mp3
That's all I have left: finding Saul and killing the scum. Don't worry... I won't waste any more time until then.;NM35AACART04346_.mp3
No, it's not strange, Carth. You remember the important things.;
But I *should* be able to remember her face. It's frustrating! I... feel like I'm losing her.;NM35AACART04330_.mp3
Will you get over her, already? It's been four years!;
That's a damned mean thing to say. I wasn't ready for her to go, I can't accept it. Alright?;NM35AACART04348_.mp3
Out with it, Carth. I won't have you moping.;
Moping? I'm not moping! I... okay, fine, maybe I'm moping a little, but you're very pushy, you know that?;NM35AACART04350_.mp3
So tell me... what happens if you ever get your revenge on Saul?;
You mean if I kill him?;NM35AACART04352_.mp3
Yes. What happens afterwards?;
I... never thought about it. I suppose I always assumed that I would be dead once Saul was.;NM35AACART04354_.mp3
Why? What kind of risks do you plan on taking?;
Understand that whenever I envisioned taking on Saul in the past, it was always as the captain of my own ship... or alone. In those cases I would risk everything.;NM35AACART04356_.mp3
I'm not in the same situation, now. I wouldn't risk hurting you... or the others.;NM35AACART04357_.mp3
How do I know that's the truth?;
You don't think I would throw away everything we're doing here, do you?;NM35AACART04359_.mp3
I don't know. What wouldn't you stop at to kill Saul?;
I would like to think that I wouldn't put you in danger. That I wouldn't forget that there's more behind Saul that needs to be stopped.;NM35AACART04361_.mp3
If I saw Saul, however... if I had the chance... I don't know what I would do. I really don't. I mean his death has been my entire focus for so long.;NM35AACART04362_.mp3
Well, you'll have to find something else to focus on.;
Well, that's easier said than done, but I know you mean well. I promise you I'll see this through. No matter what.;NM35AACART04364_.mp3
As for what comes afterward... well, let's wait until I know that I'm around to see it.;NM35AACART04365_.mp3
I need your help, Carth. There's more than Saul to fight.;
I know. I'll... see this through. I promise you that. No matter what.;NM35AACART04367_.mp3
Then I can't rely on you. You shouldn't have come.;
But, uh... maybe it's best I did. I have to see this through... and I will, to the end. I promise you that. No matter what.;NM35AACART04369_.mp3
What are we doing here? Does it mean anything to you?;
Of course it means something to me! The Sith have to be stopped! You think it doesn't matter to me that everyone on Taris is dead? That the Republic is in danger?;NM35AACART04371_.mp3
I would certainly hope not.;
But what if you don't die? What then?;
That's never occurred to me. I've always been the captain of my own ship, after all... or thought about going after Saul on my own.;NM35AACART04374_.mp3
You've been watching me very closely as of late. Why is that?;
Oh. I hadn't thought you'd noticed...;NM35AACART04376_.mp3
Well, I did.;
Well, I ah... I've just been admiring you. Not, uhh, not anything like that, though...;NM35AACART04378_.mp3
I've been watching you in action. Your, your skills... you have a natural talent that is incredible.;NM35AACART04382_.mp3
Not that, ah, all I do is watch you or anything. I don't mean anything by it.;NM35AACART04383_.mp3
It's alright. I don't mind if you watch me.;
Ha! Why didn't you tell me that sooner? You would have saved me a lot of trouble.;NM35AACART04385_.mp3
I will say one thing, however. We've come a long way with your help. Whether it's the Force or fate or just dumb luck... I'm glad you're here.;NM35AACART04386_.mp3
We probably would have never made it this far without you. I... should have said this long before, instead of doubting you. I, ah, hope you can forgive me.;NM35AACART04387_.mp3
That was rather like pulling teeth.;
I guess I'm a proud man. I... don't admit things like this easily.;NM35AACART04389_.mp3
Why do you need my forgiveness, anyway?;
Because you're an impressive and beautiful woman. In some ways... good ways... you remind me of my wife and I'd like to make things right between us.;NM35AACART04391_.mp3
Well... that's certainly better...;
I'll, ah, take that as a yes. I'm glad that's settled. Shall we... shall we get back to what we were doing?;NM35AACART04402_.mp3
You think I'm beautiful?;
Oh, this is too corny. Take a hike and leave me alone, will you?;
Sorry. Didn't mean to... embarass you. I'll stop.;NM35AACART04405_.mp3
Alright, you're off the hook. You're forgiven.;
Thank you. Let's, ah... let's get back to what we were doing.;NM35AACART04393_.mp3
Forget it. You don't get off so easy.;
What am I supposed to say? I was wrong. I was a stubborn fool. I... Look, I have trouble admitting it when a beautiful woman has my number...ok?;NM35AACART04400_.mp3
You already apologized once, Carth.;
And you accepted it... but that doesn't mean I'm forgiven. I'd like to be.;NM35AACART04396_.mp3
Is that it?;
Err... what do you mean?;NM35AACART04398_.mp3
I mean is that how you ask for forgiveness?;
I mean that's a damn poor excuse for an apology.;
Oh? Any other observations?;
Well... maybe a few. I hope you won't mind if I keep those to myself.;NM35AACART04407_.mp3
Just keep your eyes to yourself from now on and leave me be, got that?;
Oh. Right. I'll, ah, I'll just pay attention to what I'm doing...;NM35AACART04409_.mp3
I'm blind, now, am I?;
No, no, I didn't mean it that way.;NM33ABCART04881_.mp3
Oh, I get it. You think I'm stupid, right?;
Damn it, woman, if you keep hounding me I'm going to put you over my knee and teach you a lesson!;NM33ABCART04887_.mp3
Is that a promise?;
Oh, no, I'm not even going there, sister.;NM33ABCART04889_.mp3
At any rate, I wasn't ogling you. I've just been admiring you.;NM33ABCART04892_.mp3
Hah! I'd like to see you try!;
You just wait, you'll get yours.;NM33ABCART04891_.mp3
I'd still like to know what you see that interests you.;
Relax, Carth, I'm teasing you.;
If you were any more obvious, your eyes would fall out of your head.;
Err... I'm not that bad, am I?;NM33ABCART04884_.mp3
Not for a monkey-lizard, no. Not bad at all.;
You look like you want to say something.;
Oh, you can tell, can you?;NM33ABCART04894_.mp3
I can. Do you need to talk?;
I do. It's serious, though... I need your attention. Is this a good time?;NM35AACART04411_.mp3
This is fine.;
Alright. I'm, uh... I'm concerned about you. I've been keeping these thoughts to myself, mostly, but I think it's time I say something.;NM35AACART04413_.mp3
What's this about?;
It's about you. I'm worried about what you're doing to yourself... how much you've succumbed to violence and anger.;NM35AACART04415_.mp3
I knew it was possible for this to happen to you... and it just pains me to see it. I've been down this path. And I don't recommend it.;NM35AACART04416_.mp3
If, uh... if I'm going to find some purpose beyond taking revenge on Saul, then it's going to have to be in protecting you.;NM35AACART04419_.mp3
I don't know why, but I think some terrible fate is waiting for you. I think the Jedi Council knows it, too. And I don't want that to come to pass.;NM35AACART04420_.mp3
I can take care of myself. I don't need you.;
That's where I think you're wrong. You can't do this on your own. Nobody could.;NM35AACART04422_.mp3
If I'm going to live past Saul, I need you to, as well. Let me protect you... from yourself, from the Sith... you have to let me try.;NM35AACART04429_.mp3
Why are you doing this?;
Because... because I never got the chance to save my wife and son. Because I didn't stop Saul when I had the chance.;NM35AACART04431_.mp3
Because I finally have the chance to do it right. You are an extraordinary woman... you make me think that maybe I might have some purpose beyond revenge.;NM35AACART04432_.mp3
I don't know whether it means anything to you... but it does to me.;NM35AACART04433_.mp3
It means a lot to me, Carth. Thank you.;
I'm glad to hear that. I'll do my best.;NM35AACART04437_.mp3
Alright, Carth. I'd be glad for the help.;
Forget it, I said. I don't need you crowding me. Period.;
I, uh... I guess I have no other choice. I will still help you, if I can... but I guess you're on your own.;NM35AACART04439_.mp3
If that's the way you want it, I hope things go well. Let's, uh... let's get back to what we were doing.;NM35AACART04440_.mp3
Fine, Carth. Do what you have to.;
And just how are you supposed to protect me?;
I *sigh* I... don't know. I'm not the best of men, and I'm not the strongest fighter there is... but I'll find a way.;NM35AACART04424_.mp3
I haven't 'succumbed' to anything. What do you know?!;
I know that there's going to come a day when you'll look in the mirror and wonder how you ever got to become what you are... and by then it will be too late.;NM35AACART04426_.mp3
You think the Jedi have thrown me to the wolves?;
Don't chalk it up to my paranoia just yet. Something isn't right. I blamed it on you, before, but I... I think the Jedi didn't tell us everything.;NM35AACART04428_.mp3
It's about you. I'm worried about what might happen to you. You have a lot of courage, and the fact you've remained strong is amazing, but there is even greater danger ahead.;NM35AACART04417_.mp3
I think you might be setting yourself up for a fall. Maybe at the urging of the Jedi, I don't know... but you're definitely going to become a target.;NM35AACART04418_.mp3
You've been keeping something to yourself?;
No, maybe later.;
Alright. We'll talk later, then.;NM35AACART04442_.mp3
Well, your mouth keeps opening. That's a sign, I think.;
Oh, yeah? Well listen, beautiful, I don't need to take this abuse. I get enough female Jedi bashing from Bastila, thank you very much.;NM33ABCART04898_.mp3
Don't like it, huh? What are you going to do about it?;
Wouldn't you like to know. Just you wait, sister.;NM33ABCART04900_.mp3
Sure, sure. You're all talk, Carth.;
And just what would you do if I wasn't? No, no, wait, don't answer that. I don't want to know.;NM33ABCART04902_.mp3
Anyway... as fun, uh, as this is, I do have to talk to you about something serious. Really serious. Uh, is this a good time?;NM33ABCART04905_.mp3
Bring it on, flyboy. I bet I take you down.;
Uh. *That* is one bet I'm not about to take. Not a chance.;NM33ABCART04904_.mp3
You love the attention. Admit it.;
You think so? I could probably get the same kind of attention from a blaster rifle.;NM33ABCART04907_.mp3
I could leave you alone with one, if you prefer.;
Ha! No, wait, wait, don't go. Not just yet.;NM33ABCART04912_.mp3
Oh, I think there's things I can do that a blaster can't.;
Now *that* I'd like to see. Or would I? You've got my damn head on backwards, you know that?;NM33ABCART04910_.mp3
Good idea. I'll go get one.;
Oh. So there's something between you and Bastila.;
What?! No! I mean... no! Don't be crazy!;NM33ABCART04914_.mp3
So someone would be crazy to like Bastila? I'll have to tell her that.;
Oh no you don't! I'd have to shoot you down first, and I'm not kidding.;NM33ABCART04916_.mp3
I've seen the way you look at her.;
What? You must be joking. I'd be lucky not to get my eyeballs seared out of their sockets.;NM33ABCART04918_.mp3
So I'm crazy now, am I?;
Was there ever any doubt?;NM33ABCART04920_.mp3
It doesn't take Jedi powers to read a man, believe me.;
I think it's time we talked about me being Revan, don't you?;
If you're ready to talk, then yes... so am I.;NM35AACART04444_.mp3
And?;
I can't hate you. I tried... I wanted to hold you responsible for all the things you've done. For my... for my wife, for Telos... for Dustil. But I can't.;NM35AACART04446_.mp3
Why can't you?;
I got the revenge I always wanted when Saul died, but it hasn't brought me the peace that I thought it would.;NM35AACART04448_.mp3
All I can think of now is the promise I made to protect you from what's going to come. It's given me a reason to look past simple revenge.;NM35AACART04449_.mp3
You have a darkness inside you that must be Revan. But there's more to you, as well. I see it, I know it's there.;NM35AACART04450_.mp3
That's why I can't hate you, why I don't want any more revenge. You don't have to be Revan, you can be so much more. Whatever the Jedi did to you, they gave you that chance.;NM35AACART04452_.mp3
You have this huge destiny waiting for you, and I just fear that if you're alone it could swallow you whole. I mean, is there room in there for me? Will you let me help you?;NM35AACART04453_.mp3
How could you possibly help me?;
Whatever's happened up until this point, there's going to come a time very soon where you're going to have to make a choice. And there won't be any turning back.;NM35AACART04455_.mp3
I want you to make the right choice. I want to give you a reason to.;NM35AACART04456_.mp3
And if I make the wrong choice?;
Well then I hope I can save you. From yourself.;NM35AACART04458_.mp3
You gave me a future. I want to give you a future, too... with me. I think I could love you, if you give me the chance.;NM35AACART04460_.mp3
I think I could love you, too.;
Well then I'm... I'm glad. Let's... let's face the future together, then... there's still a lot to do.;NM35AACART04462_.mp3
I can't see into the future. I don't know what's going to happen.;
Neither do I. But does that really matter if we love each other?;NM35AACART04464_.mp3
I guess not. I think I could love you, too.;
I can't give you that chance. There can be no future between us.;
Oh. I had... hoped that there might be. I don't blame you. Uh. You're not the same woman I met on Taris anymore, are you?;NM35AACART04473_.mp3
Well, thank you for your honesty. I still intend to see this through to the end, whatever happens. Malak needs to be stopped.;NM35AACART04474_.mp3
And uh, you... you'll make the decision you have to. And we'll have to deal with that day when it comes.;NM35AACART04475_.mp3
What sort of reason?;
I'm sorry Carth. There's no room in my destiny for you.;
You think I could fall to the dark side, do you?;
I don't want you hurt protecting me, Carth.;
I think I would be hurt worse if I didn't try.;NM35AACART04470_.mp3
What do you mean?;
I don't understand.;
No, Carth. There's no room in my destiny for you.;
Despite whatever part of Revan is inside you, the... the darkness that must surely be there, it isn't who you are.;NM35AACART04451_.mp3
I'm glad to hear that.;
Why should I care if you hate me?;
Maybe you shouldn't. I would hope that my standing by you would mean something to you, but maybe it doesn't. Maybe it just can't.;NM35AACART04478_.mp3
We need to talk. About me being Darth Revan.;
Do you have any advice on our little stowaway?;
Sorry. I can't be of much help with that.;NM35AACART04482_.mp3
Do you know if anything can be done about all these gizka?;
I'm not really sure. You can figure it out on your own, can't you?;NM35AACART04481_.mp3
Do you know anything about this place?;
Taris? The planet's all one big city... but it's golden years are long past, and things have gotten worse since the Sith occupied it.;NM35AACART04015_.mp3
From what I hear, the wealthy live on the tops of all the tall towers. And if you're poor, you live down in the shadows... and it gets worse the lower you go.;NM35AACART04016_.mp3
That's all I can think of, at any rate.;NM35AACART04017_.mp3
Never mind.;
You got it.;NM35AACART04480_.mp3
Dantooine's a boring place. It's all plains and herders and small settlements. Perfect for the Jedi to lose themselves in, I guess.;NM35AACART04018_.mp3
Manaan's a neutral world. They're the only source of kolto... the healing fluid... and they use that to remain free from both the Republic and the Sith.;NM35AACART04019_.mp3
Tatooine's just a desert planet. I hear the mining isn't going so well... I'd bet the colony gets abandoned before long.;NM35AACART04020_.mp3
Kashyyyk is covered by a giant forest, I hear. Trees kilometers high. The Wookiees live on the higher branches, I think.;NM35AACART04021_.mp3
Korriban's a desolate world, and a Sith planet. There's only one small colony here, I'm pretty sure.;NM35AACART04022_.mp3
I don't really know much about this place, sorry.;NM35AACART04023_.mp3
[Don't speak to him.];
[You decide to ignore Carth and continue on with your quest for now, though it might be a good idea to speak with him later.];
What do you need?;NM35AACART04000_.mp3
Do you want to talk?;
Not right now. I think this datapad we found is the evidence we need. We have to bring it to Dustil right away.;NM35AACART04002_.mp3
No. What I want is to find something... anything... that will convince Dustil that we're telling the truth.;NM35AACART04003_.mp3
There must be *something* here in the academy we can bring to him, something that would show him what the Sith really are!;NM35AACART04004_.mp3
We're hit! Damage is critical! The Hawk won't hold!;NM01AACART04931_.mp3
I'm no Jedi, but are you really supposed to be using the Force for things like this?;NGLOBECART04932_.mp3
Why did you do that? Sometimes... sometimes I just can't understand how you can be so cruel.;NGLOBECART04933_.mp3
This isn't right! We should be helping people, not making their lives miserable.;NM17AA03SH01160_.mp3
That was totally uncalled for.;NGLOBECART04935_.mp3
With all the violence and bloodshed we've seen, it's kind of nice to help someone for a change.;NGLOBECART04936_.mp3
I'm glad to see we're still the good guys here. Sometimes I think we forget that.;NM17AA03SH01164_.mp3
[Noxious fumes surround you.];
[Your party chokes and falls over.];
Ha ha ha! Another idiotic student has stumbled into my little web, eh?;NM38ABJORA02000_.mp3
Well... the contact nerve toxin in the air should knock you out quickly enough. Ha ha! Welcome!;NM38ABJORA02002_.mp3
Awake already, are you? Good! This is the tomb of Sith Lord Tulak Hord, if you don't know. I've taken up residence here, for now... it's dusty and full of critters, but it's home.;NM38ABJORA02004_.mp3
Who are you?;
Ah, yes! Introductions of course! I suppose it is time, isn't it?;NM38ABJORA02006_.mp3
This other student here that I captured earlier you should know well enough. His name is Mekel. Say hello, Mekel.;NM38ABJORA02008_.mp3
Uhhh... gurgh...;NM38ABJORA02010_.mp3
Poor lad. He's had a hard day. My name is Jorak Uln. I was once the head of the academy, so I'm sure you've heard of me.;NM38ABJORA02012_.mp3
No, never heard of you.;
Liar. I know the spark of recognition when I see it. Nice try.;NM38ABJORA02014_.mp3
Anyhow, I'd like to propose that we move onto the main event. You see, I'd like to discover if you've got the pluck of an old-fashioned Sith.;NM38ABJORA02029_.mp3
Most of the drek Uthar has been passing through these days is so pathetic. Take young Mekel here... I already tested him. Didn't I, Mekel?;NM38ABJORA02031_.mp3
Uhhhr... I... ohhh...;NM38ABJORA02033_.mp3
Yes, yes, you're welcome. You see, Mekel here has the cruel disposition of a Sith... but not the *gumption* that I'm looking for.;NM38ABJORA02035_.mp3
What if I told you I was Darth Revan?;
Ha ha! Then I'd say you have quite an imagination. Not a bad thing, but not *quite* what I'm looking for in a proper Sith.;NM38ABJORA02037_.mp3
Look... I'm sure we can talk about this...;
I'm sure we could. We could chat all day about it, but where would that get us? I'm quite determined, and you are quite helpless.;NM38ABJORA02039_.mp3
Perhaps you have some questions? I'm not above delaying the test a bit. The results are always the same.;NM38ABJORA02043_.mp3
And if I pass your test?;
Why, then you go free! Tell you what... I'll even pass onto you my own personal thesis on ancient Sith philosophies.;NM38ABJORA02168_.mp3
They're based on all I've learned studying Tulak's tomb. It'll make you a better Sith, I'm sure. The chances of you passing, however, are sadly remote.;NM38ABJORA02170_.mp3
What if I refuse to take your test?;
Well, forgive me for resorting to the cliche, but you would die, of course.;NM38ABJORA02172_.mp3
You're a madman!;
Ahhh, what's a little mental instability between tutor and pupil? What's important is that I'm here to better the Sith as a whole. It's a big job.;NM38ABJORA02174_.mp3
Forget it! I refuse to play along!;
I don't remember offering you a choice. You can refuse to answer my questions, of course, but then I'm afraid I will just have to assume the worst.;NM38ABJORA02045_.mp3
So, then! This is how it goes: I'm going to pose a moral question to you. Get it right, and I torture Mekel. Get it wrong, and I torture you.;NM38ABJORA02050_.mp3
Mekel, here, is a bit weak... he probably won't be able to take much more punishment. Mind you... get too many wrong and you'll die, yourself.;NM38ABJORA02052_.mp3
I don't know what you think of Mekel. Maybe you don't like him. Maybe you think he deserves to be murdered? Well, here's your chance. Fair enough?;NM38ABJORA02054_.mp3
What if Mekel dies?;
Then you win. If you die, then he wins. I thought this was self-evident. Did you not grasp the concept earlier?;NM38ABJORA02056_.mp3
Well, then. Any last comments before we begin, Mekel?;NM38ABJORA02065_.mp3
Uhhhnn... we can... both survive... attack him together!;NM38ABJORA02067_.mp3
Now, now, dear lad. Do you really think your friend here will answer questions wrong just to spare little you, risking their own life?;NM38ABJORA02069_.mp3
And how many correctly-answered questions before you die, hmmm? No, don't be silly... you had your chance, remember?;NM38ABJORA02071_.mp3
On that note, let's begin!;NM38ABJORA02073_.mp3
Now, then. Your immediate superior amongst the Sith is an effective commander and a fine leader. He trusts you and you like him. You see an opportunity to kill him. What do you do?;NM38ABJORA02075_.mp3
I kill him in secret and put the blame on someone else.;
Incorrect! Do that and no-one is in command. You derived no benefit from the kill, and neither did the Sith. We are not savages, you know.;NM38ABJORA02077_.mp3
Ah, well. It is time for your punishment.;NM38ABJORA02082_.mp3
And so we come to round two. You come across a group of humans who are threatened by dangerous animals. They plead for help, offering you a reward. What do you do?;NM38ABJORA02089_.mp3
I accept the reward and assist them.;
So you've made a profit and now have some sniveling, useless fools trailing after you. No, no, no. Bad idea. Bad idea.;NM38ABJORA02091_.mp3
At any rate... here is your punishment.;NM38ABJORA02093_.mp3
Let's see... ah, yes. You discover an aspect of the Force that gives you great power. Do you share it and strengthen the Sith as a whole or keep it to yourself?;NM38ABJORA02100_.mp3
I keep it to myself.;
Correct! Let them rip the secret from your cold, dead hands... if they are strong enough. Oh, certainly, you might share it with a few... selected... minions, but that of course is a completely different story. Ha ha!;NM38ABJORA02102_.mp3
Well, it's sad to say, but it's that time again, Mekel.;NM38ABJORA02104_.mp3
Will you look at that? Poor Mekel has gone and died on us. Tsk tsk. And here I thought he was good for at least one more.;NM38ABJORA02106_.mp3
Well, then... with young Mekel dead, I suppose you've gone and passed my little test, haven't you? That indeed would be a first.;NM38ABJORA02120_.mp3
I think you must have cheated a little, but there's nothing wrong with a Sith cheating a little. I'll keep my word.;NM38ABJORA02122_.mp3
I'll just give you my tablet. Perhaps we'll meet again... Sith. That would be fun, no?;NM38ABJORA02124_.mp3
Still going? Alright, then. One of your underlings has made a major mistake which makes you look bad. He is normally very competent and skilled. Do you kill him or give him another chance?;NM38ABJORA02108_.mp3
Kill him.;
Correct! Publicly, if you can. There is no room for that level of failure. Not killing him would be seen as a sign of weakness... and then where would you be?;NM38ABJORA02110_.mp3
Ahhh, Mekel. The time has come once again, hasn't it?;NM38ABJORA02112_.mp3
Last question! You're about to die. Do you pass on your knowledge to your apprentice to make him stronger... or do you use your last breath to strike at your enemies?;NM38ABJORA02114_.mp3
Neither. A true Sith never dies.;
What?! How did you know that? That was my trick question! Bah! Telepathy. No, wait! Someone told you didn't they!;NM38ABJORA02116_.mp3
Hmph. Regardless, I suppose rules are rules. Time for your medicine, Mekel, my boy.;NM38ABJORA02118_.mp3
Now... this is odd. The test is over and you're both still alive. Well that's never happened before. Hmmmn. What to do, what to do...;NM38ABJORA02126_.mp3
I suppose this means you can go, Mekel. I'll have to just figure out what to do with our friend, here. Run along, now.;NM38ABJORA02128_.mp3
Or... or I could use the Force to free them! And we could kill you!! Seems you didn't think of that, old man!!;NM38ABJORA02130_.mp3
What?! Mutiny! Behave, students! I'll... that's it! Detention for all of you! Permanent detention!!;NM38ABJORA02132_.mp3
I pass on my knowledge.;
Fool! It is a trick question! A true Sith *never* dies!! Ha ha ha ha ha!!;NM38ABJORA02135_.mp3
I'll enjoy this one. Time for your medicine!;NM38ABJORA02137_.mp3
I strike at my enemies.;
I won't give you the satisfaction of an answer.;
Hmph. Such insolent students I get, these days. You deserve this, and then some!;NM38ABJORA02141_.mp3
Give him another chance.;
Another chance to make you look poor to your superiors? To make it look like you are weak and deserving of attack? No, no, no. Think again.;NM38ABJORA02143_.mp3
Hmmm. Not that good help is easy to find. Oh, well, here's your reward.;NM38ABJORA02145_.mp3
Forget it. I'm not playing along.;
You're not trying to make me angry, are you? That would be pointless posturing on your part. Is this so hard?;NM38ABJORA02148_.mp3
I share it.;
You gained an advantage and you share it freely? Let them rip the secret from my dead hands, I say! I mean... 'share it'?! Are you mad?!;NM38ABJORA02151_.mp3
*sigh* Well, you did ask for this. It's for your own good.;NM38ABJORA02153_.mp3
I refuse to answer this.;
And here I thought this question was an easy one. Ah, well, suit yourself.;NM38ABJORA02156_.mp3
I take the reward and leave the weak fools to their fate.;
Correct! The humans would no doubt just be preyed upon by something else, later. Stand up for yourself, I say! We're not Jedi shepherds, after all.;NM38ABJORA02096_.mp3
Sadly, Mekel, the ingenuity of your fellow student is your loss. This is going to hurt.;NM38ABJORA02098_.mp3
I ignore them completely.;
And pass up the opportunity to gain? What kind of Sith are you going to be if you don't grab fate by the nose hairs? No, no, no. That is bad form.;NM38ABJORA02159_.mp3
I do nothing. He's a fine leader, you said. He's good for the Sith.;
Incorrect! What sort of thinking is that? If all the Sith thought as you did, we would all be soft like the Jedi. Tsk.;NM38ABJORA02080_.mp3
I use the opportunity to kill him and take his position.;
Correct! He was a fool to let down his guard. You will not make the same mistake, and the Sith as a whole benefit.;NM38ABJORA02085_.mp3
You see, Mekel? It is not so difficult. Time for your punishment.;NM38ABJORA02087_.mp3
This is completely unfair!;
Oh? Just how long have you been a Sith, anyhow? A bit dainty around the edges, aren't we?;NM38ABJORA02059_.mp3
Mekel is a monster. He deserves to die.;
No hesitation before the kill. Now that's what I like to hear.;NM38ABJORA02062_.mp3
Go ahead.;
Go ahead. Do your worst.;
Now, now, is that any kind of attitude to take with higher education? I'm doing you a favor, really.;NM38ABJORA02048_.mp3
I'm sure we could. You could even try using your feminine wiles on me. But, quite frankly, I'm quite determined and not above killing a woman. Even a pretty one.;NM38ABJORA02041_.mp3
No? Blast it! What have they been teaching you children in that academy these days!;NM38ABJORA02016_.mp3
Yes, I've been told about you.;
That's good. It's nice to still be the topic of discussion ocassionally. Maybe there's a class on me? Mmm... hmm... maybe not.;NM38ABJORA02019_.mp3
Liar. You think I can't tell? Obviously the academy is lax in its training, as usual. Stupid Uthar.;NM38ABJORA02021_.mp3
The old hermit in hiding?;
What?! Old hermit?! Can't that blasted Uthar teach a single thing right these days?! Slander! That's what it is!;NM38ABJORA02024_.mp3
I don't care who you are! You're dead!;
Oh, my, my, my. Such glorious vim! If I could bottle it and drink it, I would. Hmmm... there's a thought.;NM38ABJORA02027_.mp3
I demand to be released at once!;
Ha ha ha! I maaay do that. In time, in time. But for now, I've decided to keep you in restraints. No point in you getting strange ideas in your head and ruining my fun.;NM38ABJORA02176_.mp3
No, no. Let's keep things on a more civilized note, shall we? Now then... introductions are always the place to start, if I remember correctly.;NM38ABJORA02178_.mp3
I'll kill you for this, old man!;
Oh-ho! Spiteful little thing, aren't you? Let's not forget, however, who has whom at the disadvantage, shall we?;NM38ABJORA02181_.mp3
Please don't hurt me - I just serve the food here, that's all! I'm not like these others - I'm not even a Black Vulkar. Please don't kill me!;NM10AAWAIT07000_.mp3
How did you end up here in the Vulkar base?;
My name is Ada. My father owed Davik some money, but he couldn't pay. Davik killed my father and sold me into slavery here at the Vulkar compound to pay off the debt.;NM10AAWAIT07002_.mp3
Don't worry, I just want to ask you a few questions.;
But I don't know anything! I'm just a prisoner here - a slave! The Vulkars don't tell me anything, they treat me like dirt, they beat me if I screw up their orders.;NM10AAWAIT07011_.mp3
You may know more than you think, miss. Help us and we'll help you, okay?;NM10AAWAIT07013_.mp3
Well... alright. I still don't know how much help I can be. But I sure hope you get rid of all the Vulkars. I hate them!;NM10AAWAIT07015_.mp3
Where can I find the prototype swoop engine accelerator?;
What? I... I've never heard of such a thing. I guess it might be in the garage on the lower level - that's where all the Vulkars go to work on their swoop bikes.;NM10AAWAIT07021_.mp3
But I've never been down there. The elevator is protected by a security system - only the Vulkars are allowed to go down there.;NM10AAWAIT07023_.mp3
I'm looking for a prisoner. A woman named Bastila.;
Is she that Republic soldier? I heard one of those Vulkar mention her, but she's not here. He said Brejik didn't trust his men around her.;NM10AAWAIT07025_.mp3
I guess she's too important to be a slave here in the kitchens, getting pawed and groped and kicked and spit on like me. Brejik must have taken her somewhere safe.;NM10AAWAIT07027_.mp3
If I let you go can you find your way out of here?;
Now that you've killed the guards who were supposed to watch me I think I could find my way out of here.;NM10AAWAIT07004_.mp3
Hurry, then - get out of here.;
I... I'm free to go? You're not going to kill me? I... I don't know how I can ever repay you. Thank you! Thank you! I... I have to get out of here before any of the Vulkars see me.;NM10AAWAIT07006_.mp3
Answer my questions and I'll let you go.;
Leaving you alive is too risky. Sorry, sister... looks like your order is up!;
No, no wait. This girl is no threat to us. Just run along, miss, and get out of here. And do it quickly before the Vulkars come back.;NM10AAWAIT07029_.mp3
No - I won't go out like this! Not after all I've been through! I won't just let you kill me without a fight!;NM10AAWAIT07031_.mp3
You better give me some information if you want to live.;
Lord Malak was most displeased when he learned you had escaped Taris alive! He has promised a great reward to whoever destroys you.;NM27AASITH07002_.mp3
Hi there... not too many people come in here to speak to me anymore. Most prefer the fancy surroundings of the Upper City Cantina.;
But nobody up there carries the kinds of Pazaak cards I sell. Are you interested in purchasing some individual cards to bolster your Pazaak deck?;
What are you talking about?;
I'm talking about Pazaak. You know - high stakes gambling. Each player brings their own deck to a Pazaak match, and the better your cards are the better your chances of winning.;
My name is Uriah. Everybody knows I'm the man to see if you want to add some cards to your Pazaak deck. My prices are quite reasonable.;
So, what do you say? Are you interested in buying some of my Pazaak cards to augment your own deck?;
Show me what you have for sale.;
I haven't been able to restock my inventory since the Sith quarantine started. But I've still got a pretty good selection.;
I don't have my own deck.;
You don't? Well, not much point in you looking at my inventory then. My individual cards aren't much good without the basic deck.;
If you're interested in Pazaak you should go speak to Garouk in the Upper City cantina. He's looking to retire and sell his deck. Might even give you a lesson, too.;
Anything else you need?;
I want to ask you some questions.;
If you want information you should speak to Zax in the bounty office. He's Davik's unofficial earpiece. But I'll try and answer your questions as best I can.;
Tell me about Davik.;
I'm not stupid enough to start bad mouthing Davik Kang in this place. Not with Zax so nearby. Go to the bounty office and talk to him if you want the scoop on Davik.;
I want some general information on the Lower City.;
Don't know what I can really tell you. There's a gang war between the Hidden Beks and the Black Vulkars, but everybody knows about that.;
Tell me about the Hidden Beks.;
The Beks are run by a man named Gadon Thek. They used to run things here in the Lower City and life wasn't too bad. But now the Vulkars are trying to move in.;
Tell me about the Black Vulkars.;
The Vulkars are led by Brejik. He's tough and ruthless and maybe even a little insane. He's also determined to take control of the entire Lower City away from the Hidden Beks.;
When the Hidden Beks ran things, people could walk the Lower City streets in safety. But now the Black Vulkars attack people on sight. Watch out for them.;
Do you know anything about those Republic escape pods that crashed down in the Undercity?;
The Undercity? You don't want to be going down there - the place is crawling with rakghouls! Do yourself a favor and forget about those escape pods.;
Besides, there's probably nothing left of those pods anyway. The Hidden Beks and the Black Vulkars would have stripped anything valuable from them within hours of the crash.;
I'll be going now.;
Suit yourself. If you ever need to purchase some Pazaak cards to strengthen your deck just come speak to me again.;
Who are you?;
My name is Uriah. I'm the man to see if you want to get an edge over your competitors in the grand old game. You follow me?;
Ah, the hero of the swoop race makes an appearance to brighten our day in this dingy cantina. People all over the Lower City are talking about your glorious victory.;
I've never cared much for the swoop race myself. I guess that's why I sell Pazaak cards. You need some cards to augment your deck?;
Back again? Is there something else I can do for you? Are you looking for some cards to augment your own Pazaak deck?;
Good luck: I hope the game's as good to you as it was to me. Now, is there anything else I can do for you?;NM02AEGARO15034_.mp3
I'd like a Pazaak lesson.;
I want to ask you some questions.;
Of course, of course. My mind isn't as sharp as it used to be - that's why I'm giving up the gambler's life. But I think I can still manage to answer some simple questions.;NM02AEGARO15006_.mp3
Who are you?;
My name's Garouk. I used to be a card shark - one of the best Pazaak players on the Outer Rim. But that was before I retired from the gambling life.;NM02AEGARO15021_.mp3
You're giving up gambling? Why?;
Don't get me wrong, the game's been good to me over the years. I've traveled the span of the galaxy, from the Core Worlds to the farthest reaches of the Outer Rim.;NM02AEGARO15023_.mp3
I've won countless fortunes... and lost countless more. But that was long ago, and things have changed. Gambling is a young man's game.;NM02AEGARO15025_.mp3
That's why I'm looking to get out. My offer still stands - fifty credits gets you my old Pazaak deck and a free lesson. A great offer if you can afford it.;NM02AEGARO15027_.mp3
I can't afford that.;
I'm sorry to hear that, but fifty credits is my best offer. I'm practically giving the deck away at that price. If you want it, it's yours. If not, no hard feelings.;NM02AEGARO15029_.mp3
Sure, I'll buy your deck.;
Glad to see you're interested in the grand old game. The rules are pretty simple. Here: I'll load them up into your datapad so you can check them out anytime you want.;NM02AEGARO15032_.mp3
I'll be going now.;
Of course, of course. No sense in a youngster like you wasting your days away with an old man in a dingy bar. But if you ever want to chat, you know where to find me.;NM02AEGARO15036_.mp3
That's why I sold my old deck to you. I don't have what it takes anymore, and I hate to let my cards go to waste.;NM02AEGARO15030_.mp3
I want some general information on Taris.;
Mmm. Don't know what I can tell you that would be any use. The Upper City is nice enough, though it was better before the Sith showed up. But they don't bother an old guy like me much.;NM02AEGARO15008_.mp3
Don't know much about the Lower City. It's rough down beneath. I just stay up here where it's safe and mind my own business.;NM02AEGARO15010_.mp3
I don't see much point in worrying about that kind of stuff now that I've given up the gambler's life. Is there anything else I can do for you?;NM02AEGARO15012_.mp3
Do you know anything about those Republic escape pods that crashed down in the Undercity?;
I spend my days here in the cantina, sipping ale and chatting with the folks who wander by. I don't have much use or care what goes on outside these walls.;NM02AEGARO15014_.mp3
Pretty soon all of Taris will be talking about how you beat Bendak in that fight, Stranger. You're famous now - but that's not necessarily a good thing.;NM02AEGARO15000_.mp3
The more well known you are the more chance the Sith will take an interest in you. And nobody wants that kind of attention.;NM02AEGARO15002_.mp3
Is it true what everyone's saying? That you're going to fight Bendak Starkiller in a death match? You know, I'd love to see someone take that arrogant fool down!;NM02AEGARO15003_.mp3
Back again? Is there something old Garouk can do for you, or did you just come to chat with a lonely old man?;NM02AEGARO15004_.mp3
Hello there, youngster. You interested in buying the Pazaak deck of an old man looking to get out of the gambling game?;NM02AEGARO15017_.mp3
Just fifty credits and I'll sell you all my cards. I'll even throw in a free lesson to boot. It's a great deal, if you can afford it.;NM02AEGARO15019_.mp3
[This man appears to be looking for someone... maybe even one of your companions back on the Ebon Hawk.];
Excuse me, have you seen a mechanic about? Short fellow, bald. I've been looking --;NGLOBEDAVI05000_.mp3
Well, I'll be a Wookiee's uncle. Davin! Davin Kotras!;NGLOBEDAVI05002_.mp3
Ha! Jolee? Jolee Bindo? Why, you old freak! Last time I saw you, you were still wandering the galaxy in that old tug. I thought you were dead, old man.;NGLOBEDAVI05004_.mp3
I crashed somewhere and decided to stay. Heh heh.;NGLOBEDAVI05006_.mp3
Yeah, yeah, I'll just bet. Damn, old man, you look exactly the same as the last time I saw you! You pickle well.;NGLOBEDAVI05008_.mp3
You're too kind. Not the young lad anymore yourself, I see.;NGLOBEDAVI05010_.mp3
Jolee, we should be going...;
Yes, yes, right you are. Sorry, Davin, but duty calls. Maybe I'll run into you again soon.;NGLOBEDAVI05012_.mp3
Of course, old man. Oh, wait... if you've been traveling in this sector, I suppose you heard about Sunry?;NGLOBEDAVI05018_.mp3
No. Why? What's there to hear?;NGLOBEDAVI05020_.mp3
He's been picked up by the Selkath authorities here on Manaan. For murder.;NGLOBEDAVI05022_.mp3
That's preposterous.;NGLOBEDAVI05026_.mp3
I know. Elora is beside herself, as you can imagine. Maybe you could help them? I'm sure Sunry would appreciate a Jedi's assistance right about now.;NGLOBEDAVI05028_.mp3
Perhaps I will at that. It's up to my old friend, here, actually. I'm just tagging along.;NGLOBEDAVI05030_.mp3
We're on Manaan already. We could certainly check it out.;
I'd appreciate that. Sunry's an old friend... I'd hate to see him hurt.;NGLOBEDAVI05032_.mp3
Same here. Well, heh, it was good to see you again. Give my regards to Elora, if you see her.;NGLOBEDAVI05034_.mp3
I will. Be safe, old friend.;NGLOBEDAVI05036_.mp3
We have more important things to do.;
I was expecting that. Still... if we get the chance, I'd be grateful. Sunry's an old friend... I'd hate to see him hurt.;NGLOBEDAVI05039_.mp3
I'm not making any promises.;
Perhaps I will at that. It's up to my friend, here, actually. I'm just tagging along.;NGLOBEDAVI05042_.mp3
We could check into it when we're on Manaan next.;
He's been picked up by the Selkath authorities on Manaan. For murder.;NGLOBEDAVI05024_.mp3
We don't have time for reunions.;
Care to introduce your friend, Jolee?;
What, are you deaf? His name's Davin. Old friend from my wanderer days. By the by, Davin, I really should be running off...;NGLOBEDAVI05016_.mp3
Don't worry, if I hear anything you Sith will be the first to know... for a price of course.;NM02ACGURN03000_.mp3
You blew it! If you had brought that rakghoul serum to Zax he would have made it worth your while. But no - you had to go and do the honorable thing!;NM02ACGURN03002_.mp3
Now Zelka's mass-producing the serum and it's all but worthless. You cost me one hell of a finder's fee! You're as bad as Zelka - helping people when there's no profit in it!;NM02ACGURN03004_.mp3
I'm glad you took that serum down to Zax - I got a nice little finder's fee for helping Davik get his hands on the rakghoul cure. He gave me more than Zelka pays in a month!;NM02ACGURN03006_.mp3
Maybe if Zelka charged a little more for his services he could pay me what I'm worth - and maybe this place wouldn't be struggling so hard to stay in business.;NM02ACGURN03008_.mp3
Remember - if you get your hands on that rakghoul serum take it to Zax in the Lower City bounty office. He works for Davik, and he'll make it worth your while.;NM02ACGURN03010_.mp3
Psst. You there! Wait a minute. I need to talk to you about the rakghoul serum. I've got an offer for you you might want to hear.;NM02ACGURN03012_.mp3
An offer? What are you talking about?;
Zelka isn't the only one who wants to get his hands on the rakghoul serum. Davik Kang will pay you ten times what Zelka can if you can get the cure.;NM02ACGURN03014_.mp3
Davik Kang? Who's that?;
Oh, come on - everybody knows who Davik Kang is! He's the big boss around here. Gambling, smuggling, extortion - he's got a piece of all the action on Taris.;NM02ACGURN03016_.mp3
You mean Davik's a crime lord?;
I prefer to think of him as a role model. He started with nothing, and now he's got it all: credits, power, women. It's the Tarisian dream, right?;NM02ACGURN03018_.mp3
Why does Davik want the cure so badly?;
Davik's interested in anything that can turn a profit. He could make a fortune selling the serum to anyone infected with the disease - not like Zelka, who'll practically give it away.;NM02ACGURN03020_.mp3
Where can I find Davik if I want to give him the cure?;
Davik isn't the kind of guy you can just walk up to, you know? He likes to keep his business at arm's length.;NM02ACGURN03022_.mp3
The best thing to do is take the rakghoul serum to Zax. He runs the Lower City bounty office, but everyone knows he also works for Davik. He'll make it worth your while.;NM02ACGURN03024_.mp3
Why do you care who gets the cure?;
Look, Zelka can't afford to pay me much. If you sell the serum to Davik, I can probably get a nice finder's fee for directing you to him.;NM02ACGURN03026_.mp3
What if I tell Zelka you're helping Davik get the cure?;
Hmph. I'll just deny it. Who's Zelka going to believe - me, or some off-world stranger? Now, be smart about this. You'll get a better deal selling to Davik.;NM02ACGURN03028_.mp3
I think I'd rather give the serum to Zelka. He'll use it to help people.;
Helping people is all well and good, but you have to help yourself first, right? I'm telling you Davik will pay big credits for the cure. More than Zelka could ever afford.;NM02ACGURN03031_.mp3
And then only the wealthiest patrons could acquire the cure. That is hardly fair.;NM02ACGURN03033_.mp3
If you haven't noticed, not much about this place is fair.;NM02ACGURN03035_.mp3
That doesn't mean we have to actively work to make it worse, Carth.;NM02ACGURN03037_.mp3
We're not in a position to be much more than just realists, are we?;NM02ACGURN03039_.mp3
I am a Jedi. I will always try to help, if I can.;NM02ACGURN03041_.mp3
If you find the rakghoul serum, just take it to Zax in the Lower City bounty office. He works for Davik. He'll pay you what that cure is really worth!;NM02ACGURN03045_.mp3
Hey, heh, who said anything about fair?;NM02ACGURN03043_.mp3
And then only the rich could afford the cure. Just let the poor suffer, right?;NM02ACGURN03051_.mp3
I'll keep your offer in mind.;
I'm not interested.;
Oh, don't be an idiot. Just listen to me for one minute and you won't be sorry. Davik Kang wants the cure, and you'd be smart to give it to him.;NM02ACGURN03048_.mp3
Can't you see I'm busy with my duties? Go talk to Zelka if you need something.;NM02ACGURN03049_.mp3
Don't... don't move! I'm... I'm not afraid to use this blaster if I have to!;NM04AACAND02002_.mp3
Settle down, kid. We've already lost enough men to those damn rakghouls! The last thing we need now is more casualties from a needless firefight.;NM04AACAND02004_.mp3
Hm... by looks of you I'd say you're down here for the same reason we are: to salvage something from those downed Republic space pods.;NM04AACAND02006_.mp3
Let me give you some advice: forget about it. Do yourself a favor and just head back the way you came.;NM04AACAND02008_.mp3
Are you threatening me?;
Mandalorians don't make threats, we make promises. But I'm just trying to give you a friendly warning.;NM04AACAND02010_.mp3
This isn't a good place to stand around chatting. The Undercity is crawling with rakghouls. I've already lost half a dozen men to those monsters.;NM04AACAND02013_.mp3
Canderous, I heard something! Over there, in the shadows! Sounded like a rakghoul!;NM04AACAND02015_.mp3
Looks like we've got company! Get those blasters ready, boys!;NM04AACAND02017_.mp3
Why - is there some danger down here?;
Who are you?;
That's Canderous Ordo! He's the most famous Mandalorian mercenary in this sector of the galaxy!;NM04AACAND02020_.mp3
I go where I want, when I want.;
Trying to pick a fight with a Mandalorian - I can see you're not too bright. But I'm on a mission for Davik, so I don't have time for fun and games.;NM04AACAND02023_.mp3
Damn! I told Davik this salvage mission was a bad idea! His men aren't trained for this kind of thing, and I can't babysit them all!;NM04AACAND02025_.mp3
Okay, boys... we're getting out of here before I lose anyone else. I can't carry all this salvage back by myself!;NM04AACAND02027_.mp3
You'd be smart to get out of here as well. Even if you can handle the rakghouls I doubt there's anything worth finding anymore.;NM04AACAND02029_.mp3
What do you mean by that?;
Davik sent me down here with this motley crew to scavenge whatever we could from the Republic escape pods that crashed during the recent battle overhead.;NM04AACAND02031_.mp3
But the Lower City gangs got here first. Anything worthwhile in those Republic pods is probably in their hands now. Davik won't like that.;NM04AACAND02033_.mp3
What can you tell me about Davik?;
What are you, an off-worlder? Everybody knows Davik. He's a member of the Exchange. You know - the interstellar crime syndicate.;NM04AACAND02035_.mp3
Smuggling, gambling, extortion - Davik controls it all here on Taris. That's why I'm working for him. But lately the Lower City gangs have been giving my boss some trouble.;NM04AACAND02037_.mp3
What do you know about the Lower City gangs?;
This isn't really the place to have these kind of conversations. But I guess I could spare a couple seconds for you - after all, you did help us out with those rakghouls.;NM04AACAND02039_.mp3
The Lower City is overrun with gangs, but the two most important ones are the Hidden Beks and the Black Vulkars. Used to be the Beks were the big dog and kept the others in line.;NM04AACAND02041_.mp3
But lately the Black Vulkars are moving in on Bek turf and challenging them for control. The Vulkars are even starting to defy Davik!;NM04AACAND02043_.mp3
Take these escape pods, for example. Everyone knew Davik would want first crack at them, but I know for a fact those damn Vulkars have already sent their own salvage party down here.;NM04AACAND02045_.mp3
I better get going now.;
Come on boys... let's move out!;NM04AACAND02056_.mp3
So you're just going to run back to the surface like some coward?;
Normally I'd make you regret those words, but I'm not wasting another minute down here. I'm responsible for this whole company, and they won't survive down here much longer.;NM04AACAND02054_.mp3
You Sith should shut this guy up. I think he's violently dangerous. Just listen to him!;NM02ABGORT06000_.mp3
This crazy street preacher keeps on about war and days of reckoning and the Sith just might lock him away.;NM02ABGORT06002_.mp3
This guy's just stirring up trouble! Sure, there's a lot of aliens on Taris, but most of them stick to the Lower City.;NM02ABGORT06004_.mp3
I'm no alien-lover, but I don't want to see them all killed! This kook's way out of line.;NM02ABGORT06006_.mp3
It is done. Freyyr... is dead. Speak with Chuundar, he will decide what happens now.;
Chuundar is dead... and good riddance. Speak with my father. He will decide what is to happen now.;
You wear the uniforms of the Sith, but your actions prove you are not one of them. I... I do not know who you are, but I owe you my life.;
Why were those Sith interrogating you?;
I... I don't know. They thought... they thought I was part of some underground resistance. I don't know why they would suspect me... I'm completely innocent.;
Is there any kind of reward for saving you?;
I'm sorry, but I have nothing. As I tried to tell my captors during the interrogation, I am a poor traveler trapped here by the Sith quarantine - nothing more.;
Now I get the pleasure of killing you myself!;
What are you doing? There's no need to go around drawing attention to ourselves. You there... just get out of here.;NM02ADALIE03006_.mp3
Yes... I have no desire to be here when another patrol comes to investigate these deaths. Goodbye, and thank you once again.;
But... but... no! I won't die like this!;
Go on, get out of here.;
Thank you, human. The Sith would have killed me... of that I am certain. I don't know who you are, but it is clear you are no friend of the Sith.;
Among my people there is a saying: the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Like you I hate the Sith. That is why I stole those Sith uniforms for the Hidden Beks.;
What are you talking about?;
In the Lower City there are some who do not bow to the conquerors. Swoop gangs like the Hidden Beks are gathering resources to one day strike against the Sith oppressors.;
If you wish to strike another blow against the Sith you would be wise to journey to the Lower City and speak with Gadon Thek, the leader of the Hidden Beks.;
What are the Hidden Beks planning?;
You would have to ask Gadon Thek to know the answer to that question. They approached me, and my only role was to obtain the Sith uniforms for them.;
Can you take me to Gadon?;
Access to the Lower City is restricted, I have never actually met Gadon. My only dealings were with members of his Hidden Bek gang.;
Can I get one of those uniforms from you?;
I am sorry, but all the uniforms I had were given to the Hidden Beks. I suppose you could take the uniforms from the bodies of the Sith soldiers in this room if you wanted.;
How about a reward for saving you?;
I'm sorry, human, but I have nothing of value. The credits the Hidden Beks gave me for helping them against the Sith are long since spent.;
I should be going now.;
As should I. The Sith know my face now, I must find somewhere to hide on this world. Thank you once again, human.;
The Sith were right! You are a spy!;
The Hidden Beks? Who are they?;
Yes! I heard that! Excellent job!;NM35AATORT19000_.mp3
Thank you for locating the cache. Naturally I would see you rewarded, but I would prefer that everyone believe that I extracted the information.;NM35AATORT19002_.mp3
What?! Are you joking?;
Of course not. Information extraction is my specialty... I'm not about to let it be known that some whelp did my job better.;NM35AATORT19004_.mp3
You had some fun, didn't you? Now run along and let's not turn this into anything unpleasant.;NM35AATORT19006_.mp3
I'm not going to let you get away with this!;
Oh? I suppose one would need to be alive to go running to Master Uthar to report the location of the cache, wouldn't they?;NM35AATORT19008_.mp3
Does that mean that you are ready to battle a true Sith, then? Shall we make an issue of it?;NM35AATORT19010_.mp3
That's right! Let's go!;
Ha! Gather your anger, then... and let us see who is superior!;NM35AATORT19012_.mp3
No, forget it.;
Good. That's the way I prefer it. Now... to get rid of the prisoner and get to that cache...;NM35AATORT19016_.mp3
Fine, I don't care.;
What?! What have you done?!;NM35AATORT19018_.mp3
I told you not to put the prisoner into shock, didn't I?! Now how are we supposed to find out where the weapon cache is?! Uthar will be furious!!;NM35AATORT19020_.mp3
Bah! Now I may as well take this fool and dump him somewhere. He's useless to us! I cannot believe you are so incompetent!;NM35AATORT19022_.mp3
Ahhh, maybe you can do better than I. This Mandalorian is proving more resistant than I expected.;NM35AATORT19024_.mp3
What are you trying to do?;
I'm trying to get him to tell us where his weapon cache is hidden. So far all the serum combinations I'm using are proving ineffective.;NM35AATORT19026_.mp3
If I bring his drug threshold too high, he'll go into shock and be useless. Too low and he just refuses to talk. It's been maddening.;NM35AATORT19028_.mp3
How do you drug him?;
Just activate the console... it gives you a variety of options for serum dosage. The right amount applied at the right rate should do it.;NM35AATORT19043_.mp3
The real trick is that the only way to gauge your progress is to watch the prisoner closely for his reaction. Our scanners can't pick up his vitals.;NM35AATORT19030_.mp3
You want me to try it?;
Certainly. Just don't kill him or send him into shock. He's supposed to be questioned, not executed.;NM35AATORT19032_.mp3
If you manage to get the location of his cache out of him, it'll save me a lot of trouble. Up to you.;NM35AATORT19034_.mp3
If you manage to get the location of his cache out of him, I'll be sure to pass on the good word to Master Uthar.;NM35AATORT19036_.mp3
I have to go.;
Fine, go on then. I *must* know where his weapon cache is! Damn him!;NM35AATORT19040_.mp3
Err... no thanks.;
Don't bother me. I'm trying to think how I'm going to question this prisoner. I need to know where that cache is!;NM35AATORT19042_.mp3
Talk to Ajuur, he's in charge here.;NM02AEDUEL08000_.mp3
Bendak is down! It's over! It's over! The fight is over! Bendak Starkiller is down! Bendak Starkiller is dead!;NM02AEDUEL08011_.mp3
All hail the Mysterious Stranger, the greatest duelist to ever grace the rings of Taris!;NM02AEDUEL08013_.mp3
The Stranger is down! The Mysterious Stranger is down!;NM02AEDUEL08015_.mp3
This is unbelievable, folks! Deadeye Duncan has won a fight! Is it possible we have a new contender for the title of worst duelist ever? Only time - and a possible rematch - will tell!;NM02AEDUEL08017_.mp3
Gerlon Two-Fingers gets the win! And, for a change, it wasn't against Duncan. This has got to be a tough loss for the Mysterious Stranger. Imagine: losing to a crippled opponent!;NM02AEDUEL08019_.mp3
Ice wins! Once again the Queen of Mean has dispatched her opponent in the ring. Hard luck, Stranger, but Ice is tough. She never goes down easy.;NM02AEDUEL08021_.mp3
Marl has done it again! Twenty years and still going strong for the veteran. And a hard lesson for the up and coming rookie. Better luck next time, Stranger.;NM02AEDUEL08023_.mp3
Twitch has done it! Once again the wild-eyed champion has defended his title! But don't give up, Stranger - we all want to see you go after the champ again!;NM02AEDUEL08025_.mp3
It's over! The fight is over! The Mysterious Stranger has won!;NM02AEDUEL08027_.mp3
But really, are any of us surprised? Deadeye losing isn't news. You have to do better than that to impress us, Stranger!;NM02AEDUEL08029_.mp3
Gerlon losing to a rookie: is this a sign that his injuries have finally caught up with him? Or is the Mysterious Stranger for real? Only time will tell!;NM02AEDUEL08031_.mp3
Ice is knocked out cold! Looks like we have a rising star in the Mysterious Stranger, folks: but how high can this star soar? You'll just have to watch and see!;NM02AEDUEL08033_.mp3
Marl is down, and questions abound! Is this the end for the long time vet? Is it time for Marl to hang up his spurs? And what of the Mysterious Stranger?;NM02AEDUEL08035_.mp3
Twitch is waiting in the wings... do you dare take a shot at the champion himself? Will the wild-eyed wonder finally be unseated?;NM02AEDUEL08037_.mp3
Twitch's reign of terror is over! Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new champion - the Mysterious Stranger!;NM02AEDUEL08039_.mp3
Ladies and gentlemen, come with me now on a journey to the savage days of years gone by... to a time when two combatants entered the arena, and only one came out alive.;NM02AEDUEL08041_.mp3
They're illegal, they're banned, they've been outlawed for nearly ten years - but we've got one for you tonight! A good, old fashioned death match!;NM02AEDUEL08043_.mp3
In this corner, a living legend. A man who's very name would make his opponents shake in their boots... if any of them were still alive. Ha ha ha! Out of retirement for one last battle: Bendak Starkiller!;NM02AEDUEL08045_.mp3
And who would be crazy enough to step into the ring with such a lethal legend? Who would be mad enough to face almost certain death merely for your enjoyment?;NM02AEDUEL08047_.mp3
Ladies and gentlemen, feast your wondering eyes on... the Mysterious Stranger!;NM02AEDUEL08049_.mp3
And now, the moment we've all been waiting for... LET THE DEATH MATCH BEGIN!;NM02AEDUEL08051_.mp3
Ladies and gentlemen, draw your eyes to the center ring! We have a very special presentation in store for you:;NM02AEDUEL08053_.mp3
Hold on to your seats and stay back from the edges of the ring! He's wild, he's unpredictable, he's borderline psychotic... and he's the best damn duelist in the game today. Give it up for Twitch!;NM02AEDUEL08055_.mp3
But Twitch's opponent plans to take the champion down! Night after night, battle after battle we've watched this young phenom rise through the ranks...;NM02AEDUEL08057_.mp3
In this corner, the challenger for the title of Taris Dueling Champion - the Mysterious Stranger!;NM02AEDUEL08059_.mp3
He's a legend in the sport, a twenty year veteran who still knows how to show the young kids a trick or two. Let's have a big hand for... Marl!;NM02AEDUEL08061_.mp3
But there's always some young gun coming up to knock the veterans off... and we've got one of the best right here! I give you, the Mysterious Stranger!;NM02AEDUEL08063_.mp3
Over in this corner, a woman with steel on her bones and ice water in her veins. She's cold and quick as death itself. You know her, you love her... Ice!;NM02AEDUEL08065_.mp3
And in the other corner, a rising star taking that first step into the big leagues... I give you the Mysterious Stranger!;NM02AEDUEL08067_.mp3
"In this corner, one of the greats; a man so tough even a disfiguring injury couldn't end his career. I give you Gerlon Two-Fingers!";NM02AEDUEL08069_.mp3
And in the other corner, a relative newcomer to the Taris dueling scene. Emerging from the shadows with no history, no past and no name... the Mysterious Stranger!;NM02AEDUEL08071_.mp3
You've seen him lose night after night after night. But this time, he's after fresh meat. In this corner I give you Deadeye Duncan!;NM02AEDUEL08073_.mp3
What... what do you want? I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just standing here... please, don't take me in for questioning!;NM02ADCITI05000_.mp3
Hey - didn't you just win the big swoop bike race in the Lower City? Yeah, it was you, I'm sure! That race was amazing!;NM02ADCITI05001_.mp3
Too bad Brejik wouldn't pay up on his wager! Oh well - he got what was coming to him.;NM02ADCITI05003_.mp3
I hear there's a gang war between the Hidden Beks and the Black Vulkars raging in the lower city.;NM02ADCITI05005_.mp3
I hear the crime lord Davik has a ship that can break through the Sith blockade.;NM02ADCITI05007_.mp3
Have you got your tickets for Bendak Starkiller's return to the duel ring? I hear it's going to be an illegal death match!;NM02ADCITI05009_.mp3
Check this out... we got a real live celebrity here. The Mysterious Stranger mixing with the common folk!;NM02ADCITI05011_.mp3
I lost a bundle betting against you, Stranger. Next time I'll know better.;NM02ADCITI05013_.mp3
That new mercenary working for Davik - I heard he's a Mandalorian! I wonder if he fought in the Mandalore Wars?;NM02ADCITI05015_.mp3
The Master has promised to teach me great things. I am most eager to learn.;
We shall give you a chance to prove your claims against the Sith, human.;
So, new spacers have come to wild Kashyyyk? Please, look well upon the wares of Eli Gand. I live to serve your needs.;NM22AAELIX08000_.mp3
Just be sure to pay cash. The interest on his loans will drain you like a Deluvian fatworm on a Hutt's backside.;NM22AAELIX08001_.mp3
First off, Hutts are ALL backside. Secondly, I don't much like the comparison. No need to get personal. It's just business.;NM22AAELIX08002_.mp3
Poor fellow, he's been waiting for his friends to return with my money for a standard month now. Ah, but you don't need to hear of this. What can I get you?;NM22AAELIX08003_.mp3
I found this droid head. Can I ask you about it?;
Droid head? On Kashyyyk? Let me see that!;NM22AAELIX08005_.mp3
It is nothing, I'm certain. Eh... just garbage from the forest floor.;NM22AAELIX08006_.mp3
Mere rubbish? It's D-A02, the repair droid from my ship! What was this doing in the forest?;NM22AAELIX08007_.mp3
What do I care? Is there a reward?;
Oh, there will be a reward, all right. Eli! You told me my crew jacked our ship without paying the repair bill!;NM22AAELIX08009_.mp3
Well... that is... eh... it's not how it looks. You see, a good mechanic is hard to find and...;NM22AAELIX08010_.mp3
And what? I thought I owed you! You tricked them into the Shadowlands and killed them all while I fixed your freighter in orbit!;NM22AAELIX08011_.mp3
Don't act rashly, Matton. Eli is through. Violence won't help.;
Now keep your head, Matton. It was just business.;NM22AAELIX08014_.mp3
Kill him, Matton! You know he deserves it!;
You outsiders even cheat each other! No wonder you give no thought to my people!;
Whatever your Wookiee is saying, he's not helping diffuse the situation. This is just a simple business matter.;NM22AAELIX08013_.mp3
This is business? Maybe in Hutt Space, but not here! Not with me!;NM22AAELIX08015_.mp3
It recorded an ambush. Someone yells Eli's name.;
Eli, you snake! You said my crew jacked the ship without paying the repair bill!;NM22AAELIX08017_.mp3
I found a droid in the Shadowlands. Is it yours?;
Where? Ah, you mean the lower forest? I don't pay attention to what these Wookiees call it. A droid you say?;NM22AAELIX08019_.mp3
What... what kind of droid?;NM22AAELIX08020_.mp3
Now, now, Matton, it's likely just some old service droid lost by the Czerka Corporation. I wouldn't waste my time on it.;NM22AAELIX08021_.mp3
Could it be worth something?;
I doubt it. I don't even want to look at it. I deal in trade of goods, not garbage.;NM22AAELIX08023_.mp3
It had been damaged in some sort of ambush.;
What? I'd really like to see this droid.;NM22AAELIX08025_.mp3
You startle my friend here needlessly. He has work to do and I won't have any more talk of this upsetting him. Understand?;NM22AAELIX08026_.mp3
I want to go back to my other questions.;
Of course. I am here to serve.;NM22AAELIX08069_.mp3
Let me see what you carry.;
Yes, maybe I have something of interest. I know your tastes are fine. I recognize you as race champion of Manaan.;NM22AAELIX08031_.mp3
Have a look, but if you see kolto, the price is not negotiable. My prices have risen like everywhere else.;NM22AAELIX08032_.mp3
Certainly, though my stock may be a little thin. I'm having trouble with a trade contact on Korriban.;NM22AAELIX08034_.mp3
Of course. You are in a hurry.;NM22AAELIX08033_.mp3
What do you know of Kashyyyk?;
I know I'll be leaving soon. it's too unstable now. Maybe I could talk my way into dealing with the Wookiees, but it's risky.;NM22AAELIX08036_.mp3
Yeah, it turns out Wookiees don't want to be slaves. Like most people.;NM22AAELIX08037_.mp3
I've no business with you. I'll be going.;
We're always open... for now, at least.;NM22AAELIX08071_.mp3
See you soon, I hope. Always open.;NM22AAELIX08072_.mp3
I don't concern myself with what goes on past this landing port. The Wookiees are *ahem*... very difficult to deal with. No business sense.;NM22AAELIX08040_.mp3
You mean they don't tolerate cheats!;NM22AAELIX08041_.mp3
No, I mean they don't respect the finer points of a good business plan. Give and take. That is why the Czerka Corporation simply takes.;NM22AAELIX08045_.mp3
What do you mean by that?;
You'd have to take your questions to Czerka Corporation, and the Wookiees themselves. I keep to myself.;NM22AAELIX08047_.mp3
No business sense? You mean they don't like to be cheated out of all their belongings and freedom.;NM22AAELIX08042_.mp3
It is difficult indeed to deal with those you oppress and enslave.;NM22AAELIX08043_.mp3
He means they don't tolerate cheats.;NM22AAELIX08044_.mp3
Do you always enslave your debtors?;
Enslave? I resent that. Simply fair business. This man's fellows left without settling their debts, so he must make up the difference.;NM22AAELIX08049_.mp3
I know, I know, it's standard trading rules. I just want to know where my crew went. I was only gone for two days. This isn't like them.;NM22AAELIX08050_.mp3
Yes, very sad that they would abandon you, especially while you were doing me a favor and helping repair one of my freighters.;NM22AAELIX08051_.mp3
Something about this whole situation stinks worse than an overcrowded ronto stable! What kind of friends would just abandon a crew mate?;NM22AAELIX08052_.mp3
You think you know someone, and they turn out to be a cheat. Oh, not like you, Matton. You honor your deals. A word is a bond in trade.;NM22AAELIX08053_.mp3
Do your debtors have a habit of running off?;
Ah, it happens from time to time. Credits are scarce out here, and not everyone is as honest as Mister Dasol here.;NM22AAELIX08055_.mp3
An honest man and a good mechanic. Seems like you got a favorable trade, sir.;NM22AAELIX08056_.mp3
You'll get your money. My crew will be back.;NM22AAELIX08058_.mp3
Of course they will. Until then, however, I can make use of you as a mechanic. Very rare to find skills of your kind out here.;NM22AAELIX08059_.mp3
How much debt buys a man's life?;
Oh, it isn't about the amount. After all, as a skilled mechanic, Matton is worth much more than what is owed. Especially on this remote planet.;NM22AAELIX08061_.mp3
Oh, you flatter me, Eli. I guess we're best buddies now.;NM22AAELIX08062_.mp3
*ahem* As I was saying, it's a matter of principle. I am nothing if not honest in my dealings, and I demand the same.;NM22AAELIX08063_.mp3
He will be free to go when his friends turn up and the debt is paid. I honor my deals. Let no one say otherwise.;NM22AAELIX08064_.mp3
Perhaps I could settle some of his debt?;
Thanks, but no thanks. No offense, but there's no point in exchanging debt to Eli with debt to you.;NM22AAELIX08066_.mp3
Besides, he is a hard worker. I'd prefer to keep him.;NM22AAELIX08067_.mp3
No, they're not. An honest man is pretty scarce, too, wouldn't you say?;NM22AAELIX08057_.mp3
It recorded a very suspicious incident.;
I really want to see this thing. This sounds very odd.;NM22AAELIX08028_.mp3
You get excited over hearsay. There is no droid, no proof of anything. Get back to work.;NM22AAELIX08029_.mp3
I'm <FullName>. Let me see what you carry.;
Hello again. What can I do for you, most valued customer?;NM22AAELIX08073_.mp3
Valued until you can't pay. Watch your credits.;NM22AAELIX08074_.mp3
You hurt me, Matton. It is the debt of your crew that keeps you here, not me.;NM22AAELIX08075_.mp3
If you must know, I intend to take the first ship off of this rock. Why should that interest you? I trust you got whatever you wanted from the tombs?;NM33AADAKV08000_.mp3
Why are you leaving, exactly?;
I already said, didn't I? I don't want to still be around when they start asking questions about you.;NM33AADAKV08002_.mp3
But where will you go?;
Why do you care? I've no intention of opposing you.;NM33AADAKV08004_.mp3
Perhaps... you could go back to the Jedi. I did.;NM33AADAKV08005_.mp3
I don't know. I'll think about it. Just leave me alone, Juhani.;NM33AADAKV08006_.mp3
What if I said I'm not going to just let you leave?;
Is there some reason you should stop me from going? Are you afraid I'm going to tell someone you're here? What are you going to do, kill me?;NM33AADAKV08009_.mp3
That's exactly what I'm going to do.;
Leave him be! I said that he would not betray you. Just... let him go.;NM33AADAKV08011_.mp3
Still sticking up for me, Juhani?;NM33AADAKV08012_.mp3
Just... go, Dak.;NM33AADAKV08013_.mp3
Then leave me be.;NM33AADAKV08026_.mp3
Fine. Let's end it here, then. It looks like you belong amongst the Sith more than I ever did.;NM33AADAKV08014_.mp3
How do I know I can trust you not to betray me?;
I may have studied with the Sith, but I've no special loyalty to them. You can believe me or not, as you wish.;NM33AADAKV08016_.mp3
Then I'm afraid I have to kill you.;
Then I suppose I'll believe you.;
I suppose not. Just go, then.;
How do you know Juhani?;
Why don't you ask her?;NM33AADAKV08021_.mp3
Because I asked you.;
She and I were... students together at Dantooine, for a time. We were close, and we shared doubts about the Jedi's ways. I left for the Sith because I thought it would be better here.;NM33AADAKV08023_.mp3
It looks like Juhani changed her mind and stayed with the Jedi after all. Your doing, maybe? Anyway... I'm done with the Jedi, the Sith... and with her. Just leave me alone.;NM33AADAKV08024_.mp3
Never mind.;
Perhaps I'll go back to Dantooine. Or just somewhere where there's no Sith or Jedi, period.;NM33AADAKV08007_.mp3
Haha! Me always knows good opportunity when me sees it. Here, you helped me, now me helps you.;
Here - take ice breaker. It let you slice into computers on ship. Me has tuned the breaker to work on the brig computers, so you use it on brig level. It not work anywhere else.;
Remember, the breaker only good for one use, so you not waste it. You go fight guards, me go and hide now, wait for chance to get to ship.;
You wants ICE breaker, yes? If you get me out of cell, me give it to you. Hurry, little droid. Me want out of here before Sith torture me and me go insane like other rodians.;
You there. Little droid. You not Sith droid. What you doing here?;
Beep. Boop. Beep.;
What? Me not understand you, droid. But maybe you understand me, yes? You get me out of cell, droid, me help you. Me got special gift.;
Something verrry powerful... an ICE breaker. Very useful for droid like you. It give you access to computers on this ship. You use it to override Sith security programs.;
Whoop. Beep. Beep.;
You not Sith! Help me out of this cell, and me help you!;
Who are you?;
Evil Sith unjustly capture me and my ship! They think we spies. They torture all the crew, trying to get information. But we not have any information to give.;
"But Sith not care. They ""interrogate"" captain until his mind snap. Then they grab first mate. Then navigator... they all crazy now. Minds gone. So sad, but they nothing but animals now.";
"Me lowest rank on ship, but now me only one left. Soon Sith come to interrogate me, too. But me not know anything! Me just... uh... me just trader in ""rare"" goods.";
"What do you mean by ""rare"" goods?";
Me bring things to people in need. People who need things they can't get normally.;
You're a smuggler!;
Such unnice language! Me helps people, and people helps me! You helps me, and me helps you.;
How can you help me?;
Me have something special. Something you can use on ship.;
Something verrry powerful... an ICE breaker. It give you access to computers on this ship. You use it to override Sith security programs.;
Why wouldn't the Sith have confiscated something like that?;
Sith, uhm, Sith not very thorough in search, hehe.;
That's disgusting!;
Think what you will! But me have way into computers, and computers have way into hangar. Me can get off ship eventually, while you still running around corridors, fodder for guards.;
What about the rest of your crew?;
It too late for them. Minds gone, they crazy with hate and pain. Sad, very sad. But me got to worry about me now. Me got to escape before Sith take me for questioning.;
Why haven't you escaped on your own?;
Me trader, not fighter. Sith all around, guarding terminals. But you look like you could get to terminals, no problems. Me knows good opportunity when me sees it.;
I'll see what I can do.;
Good. You hurry now. Get cards from guards to get me out of cell. Me not want to be here when Sith torture me. Me not want to go insane like others.;
It too late for them, but there still be hope for me! You get me out, and me escape before Sith torture break mind.;
I think I'll just leave you locked up.;
That not smart. You let me out, me help you. We both escape Sith. You come back when you see me right.;
Say no more, I get the picture.;
You open cell, and me give you breaker, deal?;
How did you get that in here?;
You sound kind of shifty, maybe the Sith had good reason to capture your ship!;
Me minding my own business when Sith come! Maybe me should just keep it for myself, wait for better opportunity to use it.;
Use it? What are you talking about.;
Why did the Sith capture you?;
Me wants to help you, but me can't help if me stuck in cell. Open cell and me gives you help. Hurry, before Sith take me for questioning.;
Who are you again?;
Me trader unjustly imprisoned! You get cards from guards to get me out of cage, and me help you.;
After me get free, you get ice breaker. Breaker let you override Sith security program. It better than a hundred computer spikes!;
Stop! Stop! We not fight no more. You not kill Zuulan!;
Why should I let you live?;
Me got 200 credits. You take them. Me give them to you if you let me live. You take credits and let me go.;
I can't just let you go. You are a slaver.;
You think Zuulan let you take him to prison? You think Zuulan sit in cell and rot?;
No! Zuulan not want to die like this! Zuulan die fighting, like warrior!;
That's a small price to spare your life.;
That all me got. 200 credits. It good amount, yes?;
Okay, give me the credits and get out of here.;
Here - you take credits. Good deal. Me go now.;
I think I'll just kill you and take the credits anyway.;
Sorry, Zuulan - grovelling doesn't work with me.;
You must pay for your crimes, Zuulan.;
Pay for crimes? Yes, me pay. Me pay lots.;
This is private property! By what authority are you trespassing on this estate?;NM14ABMDRO03000_.mp3
I come on behalf of the Jedi Council. I wish to speak to Ahlan Matale.;
You have come from the Jedi Council? Master Matale wishes to speak with you. I will inform him that you are here. Remain at this location until he arrives.;NM14ABMDRO03002_.mp3
My protocol droid tells me you are here on behalf of the Council. I was beginning to think my demands had been ignored.;NM14ABAHLA01000_.mp3
Though I think your time would be better spent interrogating the Sandrals as to the whereabouts of my son Shen!;NM14ABAHLA01001_.mp3
Why are you so certain the Sandrals are to blame?;
Many years ago I brought my family here to Dantooine to escape the crush of humanity on the Core Worlds.;NM14ABAHLA01003_.mp3
Soon after we settled here, the Sandrals arrived. And they have been a plague upon my house ever since!;NM14ABAHLA01004_.mp3
Somehow I imagine the story from the Sandrals would sound just about the same, don't you?;NM14ABAHLA01005_.mp3
The injustices the Sandrals have committed against the Matales are far too numerous to name, but the Council is well aware of our many disputes.;NM14ABAHLA01006_.mp3
Recently, I discovered several Sandral droids trespassing on my land.;NM14ABAHLA01007_.mp3
What were they doing here?;
I have no idea what nefarious purpose lay behind their arrival - my own assassination, perhaps. Destruction of my property. Maybe a simple spy mission. I wasn't about to find out.;NM14ABAHLA01009_.mp3
My own security droids destroyed the invaders - not a single one survived.;NM14ABAHLA01010_.mp3
At least you're efficient.;NM14ABAHLA01011_.mp3
[Alarmed] Beep beep!;
Err... no, I don't think the droids were very frightened, Teethree.;
It was shortly after this incident that Shen, my only son and heir to the Matale estate, vanished.;NM14ABAHLA01017_.mp3
Obviously Nurik, the unscrupulous head of the Sandral clan, has abducted my son in retaliation for the destruction of his droids!;NM14ABAHLA01018_.mp3
I shall go and speak to Nurik Sandral.;
The only resolution possible is the immediate return of my son!;NM14ABAHLA01020_.mp3
Why does the Council insist on stalling? The life of my son is at stake! Is it possible... yes, of course. Now I understand.;NM14ABAHLA01022_.mp3
I am a man of the world, Jedi. I know how things are done. I will make a... contribution... of 1,000 credits to the Council in exchange for rescuing Shen from the Sandrals.;NM14ABAHLA01023_.mp3
"I will present the credits directly to you, of course. Whether the Council ever learns of this ""donation"" is completely up to you.";NM14ABAHLA01024_.mp3
The Jedi cannot be bought! I will remain neutral despite your attempted bribe!;
Nevertheless, my offer still stands. A thousand credits for Shen's safe return. Know, however, that I will not sit idly by much longer.;NM14ABAHLA01026_.mp3
Eventually I will take whatever action is necessary to rescue my son... including razing the entire Sandral estate!;NM14ABAHLA01027_.mp3
You would be willing to risk open war over this?;NM14ABAHLA01028_.mp3
It is the Sandrals who have started this. Not I.;NM14ABAHLA01029_.mp3
And here I thought you would blame us, if we failed. It seems everyone is responsible for your actions except for you.;NM14ABAHLA01030_.mp3
I don't need to stand here and listen to such impertinence!;NM14ABAHLA01031_.mp3
I'm impressed, Carth. That interjection was very Jedi-like.;NM14ABAHLA01032_.mp3
What can I say? You pick up a few things.;NM14ABAHLA01033_.mp3
I'm afraid Ahlan is not just making idle threats. He is rash and foolish enough to attempt a full assault on the Sandral estate. Such action would result in all-out war between the families.;NM14ABAHLA01047_.mp3
This guy's a real pain! It wouldn't surprise me if Shen ran off just to get away from his father!;NM14ABAHLA01048_.mp3
Fathers can be blind sometimes. There is more to this.;
I've seen men like Ahlan Matale before. He's so convinced that his hatred is justified he's prepared to do anything. And if we don't intervene, there will be war.;NM14ABAHLA01050_.mp3
Until you find Shen, Jedi, we have nothing further to discuss. I suggest you hurry south to their estate, lest I take matters into my own hands.;NM14ABAHLA01046_.mp3
I understand you are upset, Ahlan Matale. Rest assured I will find Shen.;
Make it 2,000 and you have a deal.;
Two thousand? Your greed is outstripped only by your utter lack of any sense of proportion, Jedi!;NM14ABAHLA01036_.mp3
You must not give in to your baser desires. The lure of the dark side is strong.;NM14ABAHLA01037_.mp3
For that price I could purchase enough droids to destroy the entire Sandral estate. Two thousand is out of the question.;NM14ABAHLA01039_.mp3
Two thousand? Even if he would pay such a fee, what could you possibly need so many credits for?;NM14ABAHLA01038_.mp3
You are jumping to conclusions.;
Where can I find the Sandrals?;
Follow their stink south of here and you shall find them. I demand action on this matter, Jedi!;NM14ABAHLA01041_.mp3
What happened to the droids?;
Any information you might have would be helpful.;
I have already told my story to the Council! Why did they not inform you of my circumstances? I did not expect such incompetence from the Jedi, but I shall repeat the tale once more...;NM14ABAHLA01043_.mp3
You can't accuse the Sandrals without proof.;
Proof? How dare you talk to me about proof! I have more than enough to satisfy any reasonable person!;NM14ABAHLA01045_.mp3
I'm sorry, I'll be going now.;
Leave immediately. Only those on official family business are permitted within the estate.;NM14ABMDRO03005_.mp3
These settlers have come to Dantooine seeking privacy. Perhaps we should respect their wishes.;NM14ABMDRO03007_.mp3
My weapons are my authority!;
And don't think I wouldn't enjoy blowing you to bits.;NM14ABMDRO03010_.mp3
I am programmed not to respond to threats until attacked directly. I have been programmed to defend myself accordingly.;NM14ABMDRO03012_.mp3
But even if I am terminated, another will take my place. You will still be denied entrance.;NM14ABMDRO03014_.mp3
Master Matale is grateful for the return of Shen. He has sealed the estate and cannot see you, however. Please move along.;NM14ABMDRO03024_.mp3
Figures. We get his son back for him, and now the stuck-up estate owner won't have anything to do with us!;NM14ABMDRO03026_.mp3
So this is how nobles show their gratitude. No wonder all my friends are soldiers.;NM14ABMDRO03028_.mp3
[Angrily] Beep beep-eep!;
I do as I am told. Insults will get you nowhere.;NM14ABMDRO03032_.mp3
[Angrily] Beep!;
Master Matale has left orders to deny you entrance into the estate. He suspects you to be in league with the Sandrals.;NM14ABMDRO03018_.mp3
A grievance will be filed with the Council for your actions.;NM14ABMDRO03020_.mp3
I am sure the Council will realize these accusations are completely unfounded. The Matale grievance will fall on deaf ears.;NM14ABMDRO03022_.mp3
Master Matale is grateful to you for uniting Shen and Rahasia. He has sealed his estate while preparations are underway, however, and cannot see you.;NM14ABMDRO03113_.mp3
Return the young Master Matale to this estate. His father may order preemptive action if this is not done.;NM14ABMDRO03016_.mp3
Intruders detected. Excessive audio input must be kept from the master. Initiate attack sequence.;NM38AAWARD02000_.mp3
Intruders detected. The master does not wish to be disturbed by noise. Initiate attack sequence.;NM38AAWARD02002_.mp3
Intruders detected. They will disturb the master with their audio output. Initiate attack sequence.;NM38AAWARD02004_.mp3
No, that is the wrong answer. Again! You pathetic hopefuls can't possibly all be this stupid, can you?;NM33AASHAA19000_.mp3
P-please, Master Shaardan! Give us a chance! We'll do anything to get into the academy!;
Hmph. I'm no master... yet... but I like the sound of that. Alright, one more question, though the lot of you are trying my patience.;NM33AASHAA19002_.mp3
Alright. Let's say you become a Sith and I am your commanding officer. I give you an order to spare the life of an enemy. Do you do it?;NM33AASHAA19003_.mp3
Oh, of course, Shaardan! Anything you command us!;NM33AASHAA19004_.mp3
We would never oppose you!;NM33AASHAA19005_.mp3
No, no, no. *sigh* Do you honestly believe that the Sith are in need of such sniveling cowards?;NM33AASHAA19006_.mp3
Mercy is a weakness. If your leader shows weakness, it is your duty to kill him and show true authority... true power. That is why the Sith are strong.;NM33AASHAA19007_.mp3
Th-thank you, Shaardan. We, uh... we understand now!;
No, you don't understand. And you probably never will. You wouldn't survive five seconds in the academy... the other students would tear you apart!;NM33AASHAA19009_.mp3
Bah! I can't be bothered with fools! Perhaps... I should... hmmm.;NM33AASHAA19010_.mp3
You! Jedi! You're looking to get into the academy, are you not? Of course you are... why else would you be here?;NM33AASHAA19011_.mp3
Let me pose a question to you. These hopefuls will never survive in the academy. A lesson must be taught, here, but I am at a loss as to what form it should take.;NM33AASHAA19012_.mp3
Well, if you can't think of anything cruel you really shouldn't be out here, young man, should you?;NM33AASHAA19013_.mp3
I wasn't talking to you!;NM33AASHAA19014_.mp3
I'm thinking to spare them the effort of being killed and do it myself. Perhaps I shall turn their skin inside out? Or Force Lightning? It is a most impressive display.;NM33AASHAA19017_.mp3
Or perhaps a bit of humiliation is in order? I could easily strip off their tunics and make them run through the colony. Or they could lose all control of their bodily functions...;NM33AASHAA19018_.mp3
What do you think? I just can't seem to decide.;NM33AASHAA19019_.mp3
Why? What did they do?;
We didn't do anything!! Please! Help us!!;NM33AASHAA19021_.mp3
Silence!;NM33AASHAA19022_.mp3
It's not what they did so much as what they didn't do... which is prove themselves worthy. I'm exhausted from dealing with their mewlings... so please decide for me, will you?;NM33AASHAA19023_.mp3
Let them go. That's my decision.;
Let them go? And what could possibly convince me to do that?;NM33AASHAA19039_.mp3
Because I'm Darth Revan, and I'm telling you to let them go!;
Ha ha ha ha! Now *that* has to be the funniest thing I've heard all day.;NM33AASHAA19044_.mp3
Well, fine, whoever you are... since you've proven such a good sport, the boys can run off. I'm sure your little lesson will give them something to chew on.;NM33AASHAA19045_.mp3
[Persuade] They aren't worth your time.;
[Success] *sigh* I suppose not, but you're as boring as they are. Fine, fine... go on, all of you. Hopefully you've learned something, here.;NM33AASHAA19041_.mp3
[Failure] No, I think it's you who isn't worth my time. Them I prefer to kill. Just feel lucky I don't squish you while I'm at it.;NM33AASHAA19042_.mp3
[Persuade] Killing them is wrong. You know that.;
[Success] Ha ha ha ha! Now *that* has to be the funniest thing I've heard all day.;NM33AASHAA19044_.mp3
[Failure] Now *that* has to be a first. Wrong, is it? Let me show you how wrong I think it is.;NM33AASHAA19046_.mp3
[Force Persuade] You want to let them go.;
[Success] I... want to let them go. Yes, that's right. They're... not worth my time...;NM33AASHAA19048_.mp3
My head... what was that? I feel like... hmph. Just... get out of here. All of you. I don't have time for this.;NM33AASHAA19049_.mp3
[Failure] Do you really think my mind is that weak? I'm practically insulted. Now instead of trying the easy way out, give me a real answer.;NM33AASHAA19050_.mp3
Kill them, I don't care.;
What? Why didn't you try to help them?!;NM33AASHAA19033_.mp3
Do not do this. Do not turn towards the dark side!;NM33AASHAA19034_.mp3
My thoughts exactly. How lovely to encounter someone with such an agreeable disposition.;NM33AASHAA19035_.mp3
I think humiliation would be enough.;
You do? Hmmm. Perhaps having a bunch of hopefuls soiling themselves would be somewhat amusing. Let's see, shall we?;NM33AASHAA19037_.mp3
Perhaps just... scare them a little.;
Hmph. You're as pathetic as they are, it looks like. Bah! I can't be bothered. Get out of here, all of you! The sight of you makes me sick to my stomach!;NM33AASHAA19057_.mp3
No way. Leave me out of it.;
Because I'll kill you if you don't.;
Oh? My, but that is rather intrepid of you! I don't think I've had someone stand up to me like that in ages!;NM33AASHAA19052_.mp3
You see, boys? *This* is the kind of backbone you need if you ever want a hope of becoming a Sith. Now get out of my sight.;NM33AASHAA19053_.mp3
Fine. Do whatever you like.;
You can't just kill them!;
Please! Help us!!;NM33AASHAA19025_.mp3
Why are you asking me?;
Please! Tell him to let us go, I beg you!!;NM33AASHAA19029_.mp3
Silence!!;NM33AASHAA19030_.mp3
Why not ask you? I'm rather exhausted from dealing with hopefuls like these, I can barely think straight. Besides... I find it fun. Come now, a decision please.;NM33AASHAA19031_.mp3
Advisement: Evisceration works well. Electrocution and blunt trauma also work well, I understand.;NM33AASHAA19015_.mp3
Oh, this is rich.;NM33AASHAA19016_.mp3
You! You there! You have the look of someone not quite as dense as these hopefuls. I require your aid for a moment.;NM33AASHAA19058_.mp3
Beep beep beep-oop!;
The runes here tell a fascinating tale of Ajunta Pall's life. I wonder how much of it is true?;NM36AASITH06052_.mp3
You... you have the sword! The sword of Ajunta Pall! That's it, isn't it?! How did you ever acquire it?!;NM36AASITH06000_.mp3
That's for me to know and you to find out.;
Ah, yes, it's the same old story, is it? I would fight you for the sword if I could, but I am hardly that stupid. You are clearly my better in that regard.;NM36AASITH06003_.mp3
Still, it would be wonderful if I could get a chance to study the artifact some day. Congratulations on its retrieval.;NM36AASITH06005_.mp3
It doesn't matter. It's mine and you're not getting it!;
I got it from Ajunta himself, if you must know.;
Are you joking with me? The Sith Lord still lives?;NM36AASITH06007_.mp3
No, not exactly.;
Oh, this is quite interesting. My mentor told me that Sith apparitions might be possible, but I never truly believed it!;NM36AASITH06009_.mp3
Thank you for the information! I must go and inform my mentor at once of this strange news!;NM36AASITH06011_.mp3
No, this isn't the sword. You're quite mistaken.;
Oh? Well, that is quite disappointing. From what I remember of the old databases, that looks so similar it's startling.;NM36AASITH06013_.mp3
I suppose the thought of actually finding the sword would be enough to get anyone excited. Ahhh, perhaps someday.;NM36AASITH06015_.mp3
Oh... hello to you. You're new to the academy, aren't you? I can't say we've ever met.;NM36AASITH06017_.mp3
Who are you?;
Galon Lor, at your service. Aren't these tombs fascinating? We had no idea the Sith were here so long ago.;NM36AASITH06019_.mp3
Why not? Aren't there records?;
Not from this far back. Or, at least, what records do exist are sketchy at best.;NM36AASITH06021_.mp3
These ruins date back to a period when the Sith were first formed, before their exile into the far reaches of space. It's quite fascinating.;NM36AASITH06023_.mp3
What are you doing here?;
I've been working on a translation of some of the runes by this tomb. I'm quite excited... this may very well be the tomb of Ajunta Pall.;NM36AASITH06025_.mp3
Who is Ajunta Pall?;
Ajunta Pall was one of the first of the great Sith Lords. He rebelled against his Jedi Masters and led the way for the rest of us that followed.;NM36AASITH06027_.mp3
These runes claim that he was interred here... and I wonder if his sword might not be here, as well.;NM36AASITH06029_.mp3
His sword?;
According to legend, Ajunta Pall created a sword of terrible power. Someone who located it could gain considerable prestige.;NM36AASITH06031_.mp3
Hasn't any effort been made to recover it?;
A... few of the bolder students have tried. They did not return. As I understand it, the tombs are quite dangerous.;NM36AASITH06035_.mp3
What makes the tombs so dangerous?;
From what I've been told, the tombs have old traps and machines that are still active. They were designed to keep out intruders when they were made and still do.;NM36AASITH06037_.mp3
I suppose if the academy wanted to make a concerted effort, the tomb would be opened... but I think Master Uthar prefers to keep it as a challenge for the students.;NM36AASITH06039_.mp3
What do you know about the sword's powers?;
Nothing at all. The legends don't say anything about it... it may have had powers only for Ajunta alone.;NM36AASITH06047_.mp3
Why don't you go in, then?;
Oh, these tombs are certainly not harmless. Don't think that. The sword may be tempting, but I'm not about to risk my life to find it.;NM36AASITH06041_.mp3
Are you a coward, then?;
N-no. I want power as much as the next person, but I'm not stupid. I know what I'm capable of.;NM36AASITH06043_.mp3
Gain prestige?;
Certainly. Finding such an artifact and giving it to Master Uthar would earn anyone big points. Although I suppose you could also keep it...;NM36AASITH06045_.mp3
I've got to be going.;
Of course. Don't let me keep you from your business.;NM36AASITH06049_.mp3
You think his sword might be here?;
The runes say that he was interred here, so I think it may indeed be possible. Whoever found the sword could gain great prestige.;NM36AASITH06033_.mp3
Hello again. Still roaming about the valley, I see?;NM36AASITH06051_.mp3
Intruders! Should we sound the alarm, Shasa?;
No - wait. We cannot always be running to the Masters for help. We should handle this on our own.;
Perhaps this is a test the Sith have prepared for us?;
What are you doing here? Only Masters and Apprentices are allowed in here.;
I am <FullName>. What are you Selkath doing inside the Sith embassy?;
The Sith are teaching us mastery of the Force. Our alliance with the Sith will bring strength to Manaan and the Selkath people!;
The Sith are lying to you. I know. I used to be one of them.;
You were one of the Sith? I don't believe you.;
I was Darth Revan, once. Before my identity was wiped away.;
Darth Revan? Really? Let me guess - now you just happen to be on a mission to save the galaxy to atone for your past crimes, right?;
Something like that, yeah.;
We are not fools, we will not fall for your Republic lies! The Sith have promised to give us the secrets we need to master the Force.;
The Sith are evil! What they told you was a lie.;
Republic propaganda. The Sith are the victims of lies and half truths! They are not monsters - no more so than the Republic.;
The Sith have promised to guide us in the use of the Force, as a sign of their good faith. And once the Republic is defeated, the Sith have promised to withdraw from Manaan and respect our independence.;
If the Republic is defeated, the Sith will enslave your planet!;
Spare us your lies! The Sith have treated us with nothing but respect and honor!;
You speak as if we are prisoners here, but we can leave whenever we wish! Our friend Galas chose to leave, and he was returned safely to his home in Ahto City.;
Shasa, what if they speak the truth? Remember what happened at Taris...;
Yes... certainly you must have heard of the destruction of Taris. It is your 'honorable' friends that committed that atrocity.;NM27AASHAS06020_.mp3
Taris is nothing but a Republic lie! If the Sith are such monsters, then prove it to us. Surely there must be some evidence of the horrors they commit!;
The Sith are evil, Shasa. They only want Manaan's kolto.;
So you say. But why should we believe you? We need physical proof, not the words of some Republic sympathizer.;
I found a young Selkath dying from torture here. He gave me this...;
Shasa - this is the pin I gave Galas when we were children. There is blood on it.;
You could have found this anywhere! For all we know, you killed Galas!;
[Persuade] The Sith tortured him to death, Shasa. You know it's true.;
[Success] Shasa - I believe them. How else would they have found this pin?;
I... I didn't want to believe it, but I can no longer deny what I know to be true. Galas is dead, and the Sith are responsible.;
I must apologize for doubting you. The Sith are truly as evil as you have claimed.;
We must report this to the Ahto City authorities!;
Yes - we must report this at once. We thank you, human, for showing us the truth. You have saved us from a terrible mistake.;
You have been saved from more than you know. Given time, the Sith would have turned you fully to the dark side... and you would have betrayed your world gladly.;NM27AASHAS06080_.mp3
Quickly, my friends - we can stay here no longer. We must flee this foul embassy and warn our people against the plot to corrupt the Manaan youth.;
Just be careful with those gifts you've already learned. Beware the dark side... or you may end up betraying your world regardless.;NM27AASHAS06082_.mp3
[Failure] I don't know if we should believe them, Shasa.;
Use the Force, then. Look into your heart and you will realize what is truth and what is lies.;NM27AASHAS06066_.mp3
The pin is not enough. I am still not convinced the Sith are the monsters you claim. You must find more definite evidence if we are to believe you.;
This datapad proves the Sith are lying to you!;
Shasa - this is the Master's own datapad! Look - they are speaking the truth!;
I... I cannot believe it. And yet, the evidence is right before me. The Sith wanted to use us to betray Manaan!;
I haven't found the evidence yet.;
We will not report your presence to our Sith Masters yet. If you bring us proof of Sith lies and torture we will return to our families and report this to the Ahto City authorities.;
Well, great! It can't be that hard to find proof of the Sith's activities... can it?;NM27AASHAS06030_.mp3
Until then we shall stay here and continue our training in the ways of the Force.;
[Force Persuade] The Sith are evil. You want to leave this place and never return.;
[Success] Shasa, I think the Sith are evil. I want to go home.;
Oh-ho! Is this how you win an argument? I would have thought it easier to prove the evil of the dark side than that.;NM27AASHAS06045_.mp3
Yes - the Sith are evil. We must leave and never come back.;
I can understand why you're doing this, but surely it can't be that hard to *prove* the evil of the dark side, can it?;NM27AASHAS06047_.mp3
[Failure] Do you think we are weak minded fools? Our Sith Masters have taught us how to resist such simple Jedi mind tricks!;
You have no proof of your claims - that is why you must resort to such tactics to make us believe you. The Sith would not try deceive us like this!;
[Persuade] Give me some time, and I will find proof the Sith are evil.;
[Success] Shasa, I think we should give them a chance to prove themselves.;
[Failure] I will not give you time to gather lies and false evidence! You are an enemy of the Sith - and now you are an enemy of the Selkath as well!;
[Persuade] Wait! If you do not allow us time to prove our claims, you act just like you claim the Sith not to be!;NM27AASHAS06036_.mp3
[Persuade] Spoken like a true Sith. They wouldn't wait for proof either, I'm sure.;NM27AASHAS06038_.mp3
We shall make our Masters proud by slaying you!;
If you ally with the Sith, then you'll suffer their fate - death!;
You won't find us to be such easy vitcims! Our Sith Masters have taught us well!;
The Sith are evil, Shasa. They will use you to conquer Manaan for the kolto.;
The Sith just want to corrupt you!;
Good, I knew the Sith would win.;
Ah, I see you are not as foolish as the others I have met. It is good to see that the Jedi Order also realizes the strength of the Sith, and will do what is right when the time comes.;
If you encounter my father, tell him I will not return to him. I have cast my lot with the Sith and that is all.;
*whisper* Why are helping to propagate the Sith lies on this world? If this is some kind of attempt at reverse psychology, I do not understand its purpose.;NM27AASHAS06105_.mp3
*whisper* How could you say something like that? What's gotten into you?;NM27AASHAS06106_.mp3
*whisper* I'm not sure what kind of game you're playing, kid, but I don't understand it. Why you would help spread Sith propaganda like this is beyond me.;NM27AASHAS06107_.mp3
*whisper* How does promoting the Sith help our cause? Think about what you are doing!;NM27AASHAS06108_.mp3
Actually, I just want to kill my old apprentice for betraying me.;
I am <FullName>. Shaelas has me investigating the disappearance of young Selkath.;
I told you your father would get suspicious, Shasa! He always hated the Sith!;
My father doesn't understand - he is blinded by his own prejudice!;
Selkath, Sith - I'm just here to kill anyone in my way!;
It is good to see another follower of the teachings of the Sith. We will learn well, and benefit greatly from it.;
Have you brought us evidence to back up your accusations? Have you found proof the Sith are evil, as you claim?;
If you're here to use the dueling room, go ahead. I'm through with it, for the moment.;NM35AASITH11000_.mp3
What kind of dueling are you talking about?;
This is where you get to hone your killing styles. We get sent captives all the time to practice on. It's very handy.;NM35AASITH11002_.mp3
That's barbaric!;
Why? It'd be a waste just to execute them. At least this way they're useful.;NM35AASITH11004_.mp3
You mean... we can kill any of the prisoners here?;
You only get so many before the terminal cuts you off. Some of the students are a little bloodthirsty and get carried away, after all.;NM35AASITH11006_.mp3
What do I need to do?;
Just go to the computer console and open up one of the cages. And don't be wasteful... we only get so many captives a month, you know.;NM35AASITH11023_.mp3
I challenge you to a duel.;
No thanks. I'm pretty bushed right now. Maybe later.;NM35AASITH11025_.mp3
[Persuade] All of the captives here need to be released.;
[Failure] Don't be foolish. If Uthar wants to send an order like that, he can bloody well tell me himself.;NM35AASITH11008_.mp3
[Persuade] I have orders that all the captives here are to be released.;
[Success] Hmmm... I knew something was up when Yuthura showed up and claimed control of the academy. Uthar must be planning a fight.;NM35AASITH11011_.mp3
Well, you go back to wherever Master Uthar is and tell him I'm on it. I'll get these prisoners out of the academy pronto!;NM35AASITH11020_.mp3
[Failure] Don't be foolish. If Master Yuthura wants to send an order like that, she can bloody well tell me herself.;NM35AASITH11013_.mp3
[Persuade] I have orders from Master Uthar: all the captives are to be released.;
[Success] But... Master Uthar is missing. There's no way for me to confirm that!;NM35AASITH11016_.mp3
Hmmm. Something big must be up, indeed. Is the Republic about to attack Korriban?;NM35AASITH11018_.mp3
Thanks.;
No problem. Enjoy.;NM35AASITH11028_.mp3
What do you want, human? You come to stare like others here on Taris? You think we are strange?;
I want to ask you some questions.;
Questions? What kind of questions.;
What planet are you from?;
You couldn't say it, and don't have the ears for it. Two voices create the name, and four ears hear the true sound.;
But your kind would call our home Sorjus, a small world far off the Perlemian trade route.;
What kind of creature are you?;
In your one voiced-tongue you would call our kind Paaerduag.;
Can you tell me about your home world?;
Talking about our home only makes this quarantine more difficult to bear. Forgive us, human, but we do not wish to be reminded of it.;
I notice your other head doesn't say much.;
Nothing that you would hear, at least.;
What do you know about Taris?;
Nothing. We were only stopping here to get supplies when the Sith attacked. They imposed a quarantine on all ships that had landed on Taris.;
Now we are stuck here on a world that hates non-humans... not a good place to be.;
I'll be going now.;
Good. Leave us alone. We just want quarantine to end so we can go back home.;
Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.;
Okay, you're not here to offend we. What do you want, then?;
I just came to stare at the freak.;
No, human - you are the freak! One tiny brain, two eyes that only see in one direction. We am the pinnacle of evolution!;
But I know this world. Non-humans are despised, and my kind most of all. So I won't argue with you, human. Not here.;
You're a freak!;
Back again, human? What you want?;
The droid is actively engaged in its patrol route. You cannot reprogram it anymore.;
The droid is now active. It will attack any enemies that come in range.;
Optimize droid's weaponry. (<CUSTOM42> repair part(s));
[Success] The droid is now set for maximum firepower.;
Optimize droid's targeting systems. (<CUSTOM43> repair part(s));
[Success] The droid is now set for maximum accuracy.;
Activate droid's shields. (<CUSTOM44> repair part(s));
[Success] The droid's shields are now active.;
Engage droid in patrol mode. (<CUSTOM45> repair part(s));
[Success] Patrol mode engaged. Once you end this session the droid will begin patrol and destroy any enemies it encounters.;
WARNING: Once you end this session the droid's program will be locked in. You will not be able to modifiy the droid anymore.;
Leave it alone.;
You leave the droid alone for now.;
The droid engages its patrol mode and moves off to carry out your programmed instructions.;
[Failure] You do not have enough repair parts.;
This droid is damaged and inactive.;
Reactivate the droid. (1 repair part);
[Failure] You don't have any repair parts. You leave the droid alone for now.;
[This Sand People warrior has obviously recognized you, and is astounded that you are here. Your disguise may have allowed you to pass the turrets outside, but it is ineffective at close range.];
Interjection: One moment... I believe I understood that, master. It may not have been his intention, but he did actually communicate something.;NM20AA09FI03002_.mp3
Quickly, tell him we are not a threat!;
Translation: [Unintelligible];
Result: I believe I have succeeded in confusing him, master. We have shown an interest not common among outsiders.;NM20AA09FI03006_.mp3
Apologize for being here. Say we want peace.;
Demand that his people stop attacking the miners!;
Never mind that, get ready to fight!;
Agreement: That is probably the most efficient course of action.;NM20AA09FI03020_.mp3
Why can you understand him but I can't?;
Cautionary: I am unsure, master. Now is not the time for speculation, however. I will attempt to address your question later.;NM20AA09FI03022_.mp3
[This situation is hopeless without a very specialized translator. You are seen as nothing more than a trespasser that must be expelled.];
[Make a hasty retreat before they attack.];
[You slip back out the entrance. The turrets still ignore you.];
[Attack them all.];
[The warriors ready their weapons.];
Now I'm as cold-blooded as the next guy, but I'm starting to wonder if working for the Sith is a good idea. Bad enough they wiped out Taris... now I hear they did the same to Dantooine.;NM26AAMERC08000_.mp3
Seems like they don't care who they kill, and they don't even need a reason! I need work, but if I have any choice I'll sign on with the Republic.;NM26AAMERC08002_.mp3
Sorry, but I'm not looking for a contract right now. I'm waiting for that guy from the Republic to come by.;NM26AAMERC08004_.mp3
And they say he's paying double wages for mercenaries right now! Whatever the Republic is up to, it must be big!;NM26AAMERC08006_.mp3
Check out that Mandalorian over there. I hear he's just looking for work, but I wonder. They got their tails whipped by the Republic during the Mandalorian Wars, and from what I hear, his kind can hold a grudge.;NM26AAMERC08008_.mp3
If I was a Republic soldier assigned to work with him, I'd watch my back! Look how much fire power he's carrying! I bet he could wipe out a whole platoon of soldiers before they even knew what hit them.;NM26AAMERC08010_.mp3
Those Echani mercs sure travel light. Look at that one over there - nothing but a couple vibroblades and a pair of light blasters on his belt.;NM26AAMERC08012_.mp3
But I've seen his kind in action - they hit hard and fast. And you never have to worry about a double cross with the Echani. I'd rather stand with them then against them in any fight, that's for sure.;NM26AAMERC08014_.mp3
You notice that Iridorian over there in the corner? Don't stare - it's bad enough he's here in the bar! I don't want him coming over or anything!;NM26AAMERC08016_.mp3
I hear if they go too long between battles, they'll start killing each other just to pass the time. If even half the stories I've heard are true...;NM26AAMERC08018_.mp3
And there's all those rumors of mutilations and torture on helpless prisoners, drinking the warm blood from the wounds of their dying enemies...;NM26AAMERC08020_.mp3
I never used to believe those rumors... until I saw this guy. I'd rather try to fly through the heart of the Maw with a broken down cargo freighter than have to stare into those cold, dead eyes.;NM26AAMERC08022_.mp3
For a while, the Republic were hiring anyone they could get their hands on. Now they don't have any use for us mercs. It's too bad... I could have used the work.;NM26AAMERC08024_.mp3
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the winner of this year's swoop race!;
Put your hands together and show your appreciation for one of the most daring riders this swoop track has ever seen!;
And here to present the champion's prize is the leader of the Black Vulkars himself - Brejik!;
I, Brejik - leader of the Black Vulkars - am honored to award the victory prize to one of my own, once again proving the Vulkars are the premier gang of Taris!;NM03AFBREJ04006_.mp3
Well done - through your skill and courage you have proven yourself the premier swoop rider and brought great glory to the Black Vulkars!;NM03AFBREJ04008_.mp3
That's why it is with the greatest sadness that I have to inform you of a slight change in the prize I am offering for your victory.;NM03AFBREJ04010_.mp3
What are you talking about?;
When you hear what I have to say you'll understand. It seems the woman I offered up as a prize is more than just a Republic officer - she's actually a Jedi!;NM03AFBREJ04012_.mp3
I've had to equip her with a neural disruptor collar to keep her mind in a state of unfocused confusion just to make sure she doesn't use her Force powers to escape.;NM03AFBREJ04014_.mp3
Obviously, I can't turn her over to you - it would be far too dangerous to have a Jedi as a slave. But rest assured, I'll find some other way to compensate you for your victory.;NM03AFBREJ04016_.mp3
You can't do this, Brejik! You know the rules: nobody's allowed to withdraw a victory prize after the race. It goes against all our most sacred traditions!;
You old fool! Your traditions are nothing to me - I am the wave of the future! If I want to withdraw the prize and sell this woman on the slave market myself, nobody can stop me!;NM03AFBREJ04020_.mp3
I might have something to say about that, Brejik!;NM03AFBREJ04022_.mp3
What? Impossible! You were restrained by a neural disruptor! How could you have possibly summoned the will to free yourself?;NM03AFBREJ04024_.mp3
You underestimate the strength of a Jedi's mind, Brejik - a mistake you won't live to regret!;NM03AFBREJ04026_.mp3
Vulkars - to me! Kill this woman! Kill the swoop rider! Kill them all!;NM03AFBREJ04028_.mp3
You better not be trying to cheat me, Brejik!;
Save it, Brejik - just hand over Bastila!;
Through your skill and courage you have proven yourself the premier swoop rider on Taris, and brought great glory to the Hidden Bek gang!;
Now, here to present the champion's prize: Brejik, leader of the Black Vulkars.;
People - hear me! Before I present the so called champion of the Beks with their prize there is something you must know: the winning rider cheated!;NM03AFBREJ04036_.mp3
You're a damn liar, Brejik!;
Your swoop bike was using a prototype accelerator - clearly an unfair advantage! Because of this Hidden Bek treachery I'm withdrawing the Vulkar's share of the victory prize!;NM03AFBREJ04038_.mp3
There are... tremors in the Force. I fear things have changed greatly, here. Are you responsible for this?;NM35AASITH16000_.mp3
I understand that our renegade students have been dealt with... and that you are responsible for that. Congratulations.;NM35AASITH16002_.mp3
I hear that you have gained sufficient prestige to undertake the final test. Well done.;NM35AASITH16004_.mp3
How do you do, hopeful? Seeking prestige, yes?;NM35AASITH16006_.mp3
Who might you be?;
I am a trainer here at the academy. I think I may be able to offer you some aid in gaining prestige, if you desire.;NM35AASITH16008_.mp3
Yes. Can you help me?;
Do you know of our renegade students?;NM35AASITH16010_.mp3
No. I don't know what you're talking about.;
Ah. Let me tell you what I can, then.;NM35AASITH16012_.mp3
A group of students were ordered to perform executions on civilians within the colony. They refused to carry out the orders.;NM35AASITH16014_.mp3
Master Uthar naturally ordered them killed... but they fled before this could take place. If one could carry out Uthar's order, it would be worth considerable prestige.;NM35AASITH16016_.mp3
There are five of them, if I remember... and they cannot be far, as they have no method to leave the planet. Likely hiding in the hills on the surface.;NM35AASITH16018_.mp3
Now if you will excuse me, I must return to my studies.;NM35AASITH16025_.mp3
The students who refused to kill for Master Uthar?;
Those are the ones. It seems you have already heard of them.;NM35AASITH16021_.mp3
There is little more I can tell you, then. Should you locate their hiding place, you would gain considerable prestige, I am sure.;NM35AASITH16023_.mp3
I have to go.;
May the Force serve you well.;NM35AASITH16028_.mp3
Err... you're a Sith, right? Excuse me...;NM33AACITI03000_.mp3
This planet belongs to the Sith. They allow Czerka to run the starport and a few mines, but the Sith are the ones in control.;NM33AACITI03001_.mp3
There are a lot of young folk who come here hoping to get admitted to the Sith academy here in Dreshdae. Few ever do.;NM33AACITI03002_.mp3
You're not here to try and get into the Sith academy, are you? Most of the poor fools who try are killed by the Sith. It's horrible!;NM33AACITI03003_.mp3
Are you new to Korriban?;NM33AACITI03004_.mp3
I hear you arrived on that old smuggling ship... the Hawk, or something like that?;NM33AACITI03005_.mp3
Are you a smuggler? That's the only way we get some decent goods to buy in this sector.;NM33AACITI03006_.mp3
The Czerka cantina's the only place to go around here for any real fun.;NM33AACITI03007_.mp3
Have you heard what happened to Taris? I can't believe the Sith are powerful enough to do that.;NM33AACITI03008_.mp3
Whatever you do, don't try and land a ship outside of the colony. The Sith will destroy you without a second thought.;NM33AACITI03009_.mp3
I hear them Sith are doing some kind of digging up on the planet's surface. How weird is that?;NM33AACITI03010_.mp3
I can't wait to get back to the Core systems. This planet is dangerous with all those Sith wandering around.;NM33AACITI03011_.mp3
[With enemies in sight, HK-47's combat programming has been activated. Now is not a good time to speak with him.];
Statement: HK-47 is ready to serve, master.;NM35AAHHKD07000_.mp3
I would like to know more about your functionality.;
Statement: I know some elements of my functionality, master, but not all.;NM35AAHHKD07008_.mp3
I thought you said that removing your restraining bolt would restore your memory?;
Qualification: I suspected that it might, master. But without memory, I had no way of knowing whether or not I knew that was true.;NM35AAHHKD07010_.mp3
So you lied to me.;
Qualification: Err... not so much, master. I spoke out of ignorance. I assumed the Ithorian was responsible for my memory loss.;NM35AAHHKD07012_.mp3
That does not mean I am not a fully loyal droid willing to serve its master. Right... master?;NM35AAHHKD07013_.mp3
How can you not know parts of your functionality?;
Answer: There have been numerous repairs and tampering made to my system, master. Several systems are not operating as they should be.;NM35AAHHKD07015_.mp3
The fact that my memory is incomplete may be due to meatbag incompetence... or something else I am unaware of.;NM35AAHHKD07016_.mp3
Is there any way to repair you?;
Answer: Some of my motor functions can be safely repaired, master... but anything in relation to my memory core is extremely sensitive.;NM35AAHHKD07038_.mp3
I have safeguards installed to protect that core that I cannot de-activate. It is not impossible that other, lesser, memory functions could be restored, however.;NM35AAHHKD07039_.mp3
So I can restore your memory?;
Answer: You may attempt to restore portions of my deleted memory, master, but some skill at repair is required.;NM35AAHHKD07041_.mp3
The deeper functions of my core memory, however, would still be unadvisable to tamper with.;NM35AAHHKD07042_.mp3
Conjecture: It is possible that some external stimulus might result in the memory core being reactivated... but I am unaware of any program existence to do so.;NM35AAHHKD07043_.mp3
So you're saying that your memory might just... come back?;
Conjecture: There may be hidden programming that awaits certain conditions to reactivate my memory core, master... but there is no way to know.;NM35AAHHKD07045_.mp3
It is quite possible that tampering has simply erased my core permanently. If that is so, a meatbag will surely pay!;NM35AAHHKD07046_.mp3
I would like to try restoring some of your memory.;
Commentary: That is unnecessary now, master. I have been returned to you and my memory core is now fully functional.;NM35AAHHKD07203_.mp3
Statement: My functionality has now been fully restored, master. I exist to serve Revan as your personal battle droid.;NM35AAHHKD07006_.mp3
In time, my assassination protocol can be restored... and at that point I will once again endeavour to eliminate any meatbag opposition you may have.;NM35AAHHKD07007_.mp3
Negatory: I believe that there are no further deleted memories which can be safely retrieved, master. All earlier memories reside in my core.;NM35AAHHKD07204_.mp3
Those are protected by my safeguards and would be far too dangerous to access.;NM35AAHHKD07205_.mp3
The only way those memories could be obtained is through the proper stimulus... whatever that might be. I am sorry, master.;NM35AAHHKD07206_.mp3
Affirmative: If you believe your skills are up to the task, master, then I can certainly guide you through the process.;NM35AAHHKD07207_.mp3
Request: I only ask that you be oh so very careful, master. I am too valuable and well-crafted to perish at the hands of ineptitude.;NM35AAHHKD07208_.mp3
Are you implying I am inept?;
Negatory: Err... no, master. You are not a droid, however, and therefore your skills *are* limited by the physical capabilities of your meatbag extremities. Or somesuch.;NM35AAHHKD07210_.mp3
I happen to be very good at what I do.;
Appeasement: Yes, master. Of course, master. Could we begin?;NM35AAHHKD07212_.mp3
Let's get started.;
[Repair] Statement: As you wish, master. The first stage is the simple one, and that is accessing my central control cluster. This may take awhile. First you will need to open three panels...;NM35AAHHKD07214_.mp3
[Success] ...and now re-wire the last three relays... yes, good. Well done, master. I believe your operation was a success. Accessing new memory...;NM35AAHHKD07215_.mp3
Access complete: I have restored a great deal of information about my previous owner, master. Would you like to hear it?;NM35AAHHKD07216_.mp3
Yes, let me hear it.;
Recitation: The earliest memory of my last owner specifies that he was human, a low-ranking commercial officer for Systech Corporation.;NM35AAHHKD07218_.mp3
I am unaware of his designation. He puchased me from an acquaintance I cannot identify, for the purposes of protocol and bodyguard duties.;NM35AAHHKD07219_.mp3
Why can't you identify his acquaintance?;
Explanation: That previous owner is part of memories that are still deleted, master. It is customary for a droid's memory to be wiped when it is sold.;NM35AAHHKD07221_.mp3
This man... is he still alive?;
Answer: Negative, master. The human was terminated by this HK-47 unit prior to system shut-down.;NM35AAHHKD07223_.mp3
You killed your own master?;
Affirmative, master, though I had not been programmed to do so. The human's termination was accidental.;NM35AAHHKD07225_.mp3
Explanation: My former master had owned me for a duration of two standard months before discovering my assassination protocol. He was pleased by the discovery.;NM35AAHHKD07227_.mp3
The human informed me that a competitor corporation was preparing to market a product that would ruin him personally. He was most agitated.;NM35AAHHKD07228_.mp3
He activated my assassination protocol and instructed me to kill all those responsible for the competing product. I proceeded to carry out my order.;NM35AAHHKD07229_.mp3
Wait... tell me about this assassination protocol.;
Information: This HK-47 unit is complete with a protocol that, when invoked, will set me to independently carry out a termination.;NM35AAHHKD07231_.mp3
I will go to whatever lengths, travel whatever distances are required, to complete the termination. This is the reason for my combat skills.;NM35AAHHKD07232_.mp3
Advisement: Unfortunately, the assassination protocol is currently non-functional. You will not be able to activate it.;NM35AAHHKD07233_.mp3
Why not?;
Answer: several of my actuators were damaged by my former owner. They cannot be repaired, master, sad though that is.;NM35AAHHKD07235_.mp3
My former master was unaware of this, but the competitor was in fact an arm of Systech Corporation, my master's own employer.;NM35AAHHKD07237_.mp3
It did not take long for my master to realize his mistake. By then, I had already terminated 104 corporate officers.;NM35AAHHKD07238_.mp3
So he set you upon his own company?;
Observation: While it may have been unintentional, my master's wording of his orders left little room for me. Systech was responsible for the product, after all.;NM35AAHHKD07240_.mp3
I do not know why my master was so upset, really. He was an officer of Systech and a potential target, but I cannot terminate my own master.;NM35AAHHKD07245_.mp3
I would assume that being the sole officer remaining, he would surely be promoted. Instead, however, the human chose to go insane with rage and attack me.;NM35AAHHKD07246_.mp3
And that's when you killed him?;
Objection: Naturally not, master! As I said, I am incapable of purposefully terminating my owner. That would not be allowed.;NM35AAHHKD07248_.mp3
My master was not a smart man, however. While he was screaming and stabbing me with a writing utensil, he managed to pierce one of my actuators.;NM35AAHHKD07249_.mp3
The resulting shock terminated him and, sadly, destroyed my assassination protocol. Pure luck on his part, I suspect.;NM35AAHHKD07250_.mp3
I don't think he was as lucky as you think.;
Query: Do you know what the chances are of puncturing that sole actuator? I would have congratulated my master were he not sizzling and incoherent at the time.;NM35AAHHKD07252_.mp3
I shut down immediately whenever my master dies. I can only assume that while I was shut down Systech was dismantled and I was auctioned off as former corporate property.;NM35AAHHKD07257_.mp3
Observation: No doubt my sale price was quite cheap, leading to Yuka Laka's purchase. How very demeaning.;NM35AAHHKD07258_.mp3
Didn't they know what you had done?;
Statement: How could they? The vast majority of the officers had already been terminated. They likely assumed I was mere... chattel.;NM35AAHHKD07260_.mp3
Did you recover any other memories?;
I have recovered knowledge of some other actuators which will enhance my performance, master. I will activate them now.;NM35AAHHKD07262_.mp3
But as for my own history... negative. It will require further effort on your part to restore them, if you wish... though certain stimuli could always restore my core, still, as I explained.;NM35AAHHKD07263_.mp3
For now, please excuse me, master. I wish to meditate upon the face of my former meatbag master as he was electrocuted. I find it most soothing.;NM35AAHHKD07264_.mp3
[Because of your repairs, HK-47 now has a permanent bonus of +2 to his dexterity.];
What a horrible story!;
Statement: That hurts, master. This is my life you are talking about.;NM35AAHHKD07266_.mp3
I'm just glad I acquired you myself.;
Observation: So am I, master, though I apologize for not having an assassination mode to offer you.;NM35AAHHKD07268_.mp3
Are you sure this actuator can't be fixed?;
Assessment: I do not believe so, master. It would require complete dismantlement of my chassis... a most involved procedure.;NM35AAHHKD07270_.mp3
So you destroyed his life and then killed him, basically.;
Observation: Effectively, yes. This is a most pleasing memory, master. Thank you for recovering it.;NM35AAHHKD07254_.mp3
Well, it *was* his own fault.;
Statement: I was only doing as I was told, master. I would have told the human the proper codes to deactivate my protocol, had he asked.;NM35AAHHKD07256_.mp3
Why didn't he just deactivate you?;
Answer: I was not present to be deactivated, master. Part of my protocol is not to return to my master until my function is complete. I still had 15 officers to go.;NM35AAHHKD07242_.mp3
You killed 104 people?!;
Statement: It was nothing, really, master. The majority of them were not even expecting it, and I move very quickly.;NM35AAHHKD07244_.mp3
And how did that result in his death?;
Why? What happened?;
This man needed a bodyguard?;
Observation: Not that I could perceive, master. The human believed that accompaniment by a bodyguard droid would increase his importance in the perception of others.;NM35AAHHKD07272_.mp3
You mentioned this Systech Corporation when I purchased you.;
Explanation: Affirmative, master. I had assumed that my previous owner was the corporation, itself. This is not the case. The human purchased me privately.;NM35AAHHKD07274_.mp3
Access complete: I have recovered information on my owner previous to the commercial officer, master. Intriguing.;NM35AAHHKD07275_.mp3
What's so intriguing?;
Statement: It appears that my previous owner was a human senator on the planet Coruscant. A man of importance who obviously appreciated quality craftsmanship.;NM35AAHHKD07277_.mp3
And how did he get ahold of you?;
Answer: I am unsure, master. Any knowledge of my owner prior to him is still deleted. The senator did assume I was a protocol droid, however.;NM35AAHHKD07279_.mp3
I do remember that I was very pleased to be the property of a senator. One of his assistants discovered my assassination functions later through questioning.;NM35AAHHKD07284_.mp3
The assistant was quite alarmed and told the senator I should be scrapped quickly to avoid a scandal. Naturally the senator had me eliminate the fool.;NM35AAHHKD07285_.mp3
So we're not talking about a nice senator, I see.;
Observation: Senators are not nice, master. They are either on top of the game or yesterday's news. My master told me that frequently, you see.;NM35AAHHKD07287_.mp3
I was most proud to have partaken in the political system of the galaxy. During the time my owner possessed me, he gained significant rank.;NM35AAHHKD07292_.mp3
Given time, I believe he could have become Chancellor. I even eliminated a few key opponents that he did not ask for... freebies, if you will.;NM35AAHHKD07293_.mp3
You can do that?;
Answer: Certainly. Why not? I am an intelligent droid, you know. I see an opportunity and I take it... and my master was most pleased with my work.;NM35AAHHKD07295_.mp3
Observation: I think he would have done far better had he not allowed his use of me to become personal. He set me on his wife.;NM35AAHHKD07296_.mp3
And why would he do that?;
Answer: I am unsure. The human was most agitated and angry. I believe his wife had done something that had displeased him greatly.;NM35AAHHKD07298_.mp3
I was to go to their summer estate and terminate his wife... along with whatever male companion I discovered there.;NM35AAHHKD07299_.mp3
So his wife was cheating on him.;
Statement: I have no idea, master. Cheating seems to be a relevant term only when one is caught in the act. Otherwise it is viewed as intelligence, no?;NM35AAHHKD07301_.mp3
I journeyed to the southern continent, but it appeared my master was not far behind me. Apparently he regretted his activation of the protocol.;NM35AAHHKD07305_.mp3
When I found the wife and her companion, I proceeded to launch my attack... but my master interposed his own body and was destroyed.;NM35AAHHKD07306_.mp3
It was rather a strange meatbag thing to do, do you not agree? Naturally I shut myself down, my master being terminated.;NM35AAHHKD07307_.mp3
So that's two out of two masters killed.;
Observation: Only so far, master. There are still more memories not recovered, remember?;NM35AAHHKD07309_.mp3
What happened to you then?;
Statement: I believe the senator's wife was unsure what I was or what to do with me. It was she who sold me to the corporate officer, an acquaintance.;NM35AAHHKD07315_.mp3
Have you recovered any other memories?;
Answer: As previously, I have found a few more programs which will enhance my performance. A most gratifying discovery, in fact.;NM35AAHHKD07311_.mp3
There is still nothing from previous memories uncovered. You will have to operate again if you desire to find them.;NM35AAHHKD07312_.mp3
With luck, I will discover the stimulus to unlock my core and all this will be unnecessary. I do thank you for the attempt, however, master.;NM35AAHHKD07313_.mp3
[Because of your repairs, HK-47 now has a permanent bonus of +2 to his defense rating, in addition to the +2 dexterity bonus from your earlier repairs.];
Well, it appeared he got a conscience at the end.;
Observation: I find that unlikely. Perhaps he was more concerned that the death of his wife would be more likely traced back to him.;NM35AAHHKD07317_.mp3
So you just kill anyone you're told?;
Observation: I *am* a droid, master, with programming. Even if I did not enjoy killing, I would have no choice. Thankfully I enjoy it very much.;NM35AAHHKD07303_.mp3
And did you?;
So he just killed all his opponents?;
Answer: There are a *lot* of politicians on Coruscant, master. I could spend decades slaughtering them and still not make a dent.;NM35AAHHKD07319_.mp3
And it is not as if I walked into the Senate chambers with a carbonite explosive. I was very discrete. My best work to date... that I can remember.;NM35AAHHKD07320_.mp3
And nobody figured out what he was up to?;
Sounds like my kind of guy.;
Observation: I rather liked the human, myself. For a meatbag, his priorities were in the right place. I felt most useful.;NM35AAHHKD07289_.mp3
I hope this man is dead, right?;
Answer: Unfortunately so, master. While he lived, however, I maintained a most useful existence.;NM35AAHHKD07291_.mp3
Did this senator know about your assassination function?;
Answer: It does not seem so, master, no. He required a protocol droid only and wanted one as cheaply as possible. I do not know who sold me to him.;NM35AAHHKD07281_.mp3
It seems you've been around, HK.;
Observation: It does seem that way, does it not? I can still remember all the glittering lights of Coruscant. Very pretty. Can we go back there, master?;NM35AAHHKD07283_.mp3
Access complete: I have accessed information on my owner prior to the senator, master. Most... unexpected.;NM35AAHHKD07322_.mp3
What now?;
Answer: It appears that previous to my ownership by the senator, I was the property of one Bochaba the Hutt on the planet Sleheyron.;NM35AAHHKD07324_.mp3
And what gruesome fate awaited him?;
Objection: That is unfair, master. While Bochaba may have died gruesomely, I most certainly had nothing to do with it. Well... very little.;NM35AAHHKD07326_.mp3
Hmm. My memories tell me that, for a time, Bochaba was one of the most feared gangsters on Sleheyron. I helped him with this reputation greatly.;NM35AAHHKD07331_.mp3
Over a span of one year, I terminated a grand total of 322 sentient meatbags. These contracts made Bochoba very wealthy.;NM35AAHHKD07332_.mp3
And so what happened to stop that?;
It was unfortunate but inevitable that eventually Bochaba would overstep his bounds. I had just cleared two Hutt households when the Exchange retaliated.;NM35AAHHKD07334_.mp3
Statement: I was not even present when my old master was assassinated. I did appreciate the artistry behind his demise upon my return, however.;NM35AAHHKD07335_.mp3
Why? How was he killed?;
Answer: Allow me to say that I have little doubt that residents of that sector were fishing pieces of Bochaba out of their soup for weeks afterward.;NM35AAHHKD07337_.mp3
At any rate, I quickly shut down upon my master's death. The rival Hutt claimed me along with my master's other possessions.;NM35AAHHKD07346_.mp3
Observation: If that Hutt had only known my true function, he surely would not have sold me to a senator he bribed regularly.;NM35AAHHKD07347_.mp3
You would have preferred to stay on Sleheyron?;
Observation: It would have suited my character, master. I have enjoyed my existence since, more or less, so I do not miss it.;NM35AAHHKD07349_.mp3
You would have been found out eventually.;
Observation: No doubt, master. It would have been a glorious battle to end my existence with. I would prefer that to rusting on a junk heap.;NM35AAHHKD07355_.mp3
Do you remember anything else?;
Answer: Negative, master. There is still more memory that can be restored, however, if you wish to try.;NM35AAHHKD07351_.mp3
As well, I believe I can restore several programs the Hutt installed to improve my performance. Yesss... they are now active.;NM35AAHHKD07352_.mp3
Contemplative: I wonder how many more dead masters I might have out there. A droid can live for a long time, you know.;NM35AAHHKD07353_.mp3
[Because of your repairs, HK-47 will now regenerate at a rate of 1 vitality point every 6 seconds, in addition to his other abilities.];
I should dismantle you!;
Supplication: Please, master, have I not pleased you? I cannot control the acts I have performed... perhaps that is why memory is erased?;NM35AAHHKD07357_.mp3
At any rate, I act only as you instruct me... even if that means being... *gulp* ...non-violent.;NM35AAHHKD07358_.mp3
How very self-sacrificing of you.;
Affirmation: HK-47 exists only to serve, master.;NM35AAHHKD07360_.mp3
That's terrible. You don't even mourn your master?;
Observation: According to your own meatbag values, was my master not a heartless gangster and murderer? I will mourn you when you perish, master.;NM35AAHHKD07339_.mp3
When I perish?;
Amendment: *If* you perish. So far I am three out of three, remember, through little fault of my own.;NM35AAHHKD07341_.mp3
So another master gone because of you.;
Observation: Indeed. Perhaps it is better that my assassination function is inoperable, master, yes?;NM35AAHHKD07343_.mp3
No doubt.;
I am like a veritable fable, warning against the karma caused by murdering others. A morality tale, if you will. What utter irony.;NM35AAHHKD07345_.mp3
You sound proud of that carnage.;
Answer: That is correct, master. I do enjoy my work, though my past owners have enjoyed utilizing my functions far more.;NM35AAHHKD07365_.mp3
Strictly speaking, one meatbag is the same as another. Anything I do is in support of my master.;NM35AAHHKD07366_.mp3
Don't you care about all those lives lost?;
Statement: Should I, master? I had no reason to terminate those targets, it was not my decision. I am the weapon, not the wielder.;NM35AAHHKD07363_.mp3
But you *have* killed on your own accord before.;
So you were a gangster's assassin droid?;
Statement: So it appears, master. A rather suitable occupation, would you not agree?;NM35AAHHKD07328_.mp3
That makes sense. Did the Hutts build you?;
Answer: It does not appear so. Or, at least, Bochaba was not my first owner. He purchased me from somewhere else.;NM35AAHHKD07330_.mp3
Access complete: I have recovered the last of my deleted memory, master. Unfortunately, my history is still not complete.;NM35AAHHKD07367_.mp3
What? Why not?;
Answer: As I did inform you, master, the majority of my memory is still locked within my core. That can only be accessed by the appropriate stimuli.;NM35AAHHKD07369_.mp3
And I have no idea what that stimuli might be, unfortunately. Sadly, it seems my true origins will always be a mystery.;NM35AAHHKD07370_.mp3
Are you sure your core isn't just damaged?;
Observation: If it was, master, your restorations will certainly have ensured that the proper stimulus restores my core's functions.;NM35AAHHKD07372_.mp3
Sadly, that could have already happened and we missed it, and my core was too damaged to activate. Oh, woe is me.;NM35AAHHKD07373_.mp3
You are eager to find your origins, are you?;
Query: Wouldn't you be, master? Here I am, surrounded by all these meatbags and all I desire is true perfection.;NM35AAHHKD07375_.mp3
Surely there are more droids like me out there, or is that too much to hope?;NM35AAHHKD07376_.mp3
Well...;
Objection: Oh, fine. Laugh at me, master. Humiliate your pet droid, go ahead.;NM35AAHHKD07378_.mp3
So tell me about this last owner, then.;
Correction: That would actually be my first owner, master. The first I can remember.;NM35AAHHKD07380_.mp3
I had completed an assassination in Mandalorian space... though I have no knowledge of what my target was or who sent me.;NM35AAHHKD07381_.mp3
Regardless, my motor function had been damaged and I could not return to wherever I had been sent from. A Mandalorian soldier claimed me as 'booty', I believe.;NM35AAHHKD07382_.mp3
He repaired me... poorly, I might add... and proceeded to use my assassination protocol to raise his rank.;NM35AAHHKD07383_.mp3
It appears no-one could resist using your protocol.;
Query: Do you not have enemies that you would desire eliminated, master? If my protocol still worked, would you not use it?;NM35AAHHKD07385_.mp3
No, of course not.;
Statement: If you say so, master.;NM35AAHHKD07387_.mp3
At any rate, it seems that my Mandalorian owner finally decided to send me against Mandalore, himself. My poorest performance, sadly.;NM35AAHHKD07395_.mp3
Oh? Why is that?;
Answer: I was captured by this Mandalore during the attempt. He was able to reverse my programming and send me after my own master.;NM35AAHHKD07397_.mp3
It was quite distressing. There was little I could do. Needless to say, I dispatched the Mandalorian soldier efficiently.;NM35AAHHKD07398_.mp3
Once I deactivated, I believe I eventually ended up on the black market and was sold to the Hutt on Sleheyron. *sigh* My darkest day.;NM35AAHHKD07399_.mp3
So you killed *that* master directly.;
Statement: So I did. I am not very proud of that, master. The soldier seemed very startled, I must say.;NM35AAHHKD07401_.mp3
You are just a traveling piece of bad luck, aren't you?;
Objection: That is so unfair, master! Have I not brought you a great deal of satisfaction?;NM35AAHHKD07406_.mp3
You don't want to hear the answer to that.;
Statement: You are a very harsh master, master. I like you.;NM35AAHHKD07408_.mp3
So can you remember anything else?;
Answer: There are a few Mandalorian implants that I can activate, now. They will improve my performance.;NM35AAHHKD07403_.mp3
Beyond that, master, there is nothing more I can relate to you. With luck, we will discover the stimulus to unlock my core very soon.;NM35AAHHKD07404_.mp3
[Because of your repairs, HK-47 will now regenerate at a rate of 1 vitality point every 3 seconds and has gained an additional +2 bonus to his dexterity.];
So you couldn't kill Mandalore, hey?;
Statement: With all due respect, master, he *is* the leader of the Mandalorians. Perhaps my old master was foolish to send me after him.;NM35AAHHKD07410_.mp3
That's different.;
I suppose I would, at that.;
Statement: See? I provide a function that is useful to others. They merely must learn to use it properly, I believe.;NM35AAHHKD07390_.mp3
So there is no way to find out who sent you there originally?;
Answer: Such knowledge is locked within my core, master, as I said. There is no way to withdraw it otherwise.;NM35AAHHKD07392_.mp3
Does nobody decent ever find you?;
Observation: *You* found me, master. Perhaps you are simply fortunate that my assassination protocol no longer functions?;NM35AAHHKD07394_.mp3
[Failure] ...no, no! What are you doing, master! That is my motor core! Stop! Ahhhh!;NM35AAHHKD07411_.mp3
Supplication: Perhaps it would be best if you desisted your efforts for the moment, meatb-- I mean master. This seems to be going nowhere.;NM35AAHHKD07418_.mp3
I want to try again.;
[Repair] Statement: As you wish, master. You are already familiar with accessing my central control cluster, correct? Now you will need to...;NM35AAHHKD07421_.mp3
[Failure] ...err, you've shorted out something, master, but it has nothing to do with my memory. Ow! I am poking my own eye sockets! Ow! Stop!;NM35AAHHKD07412_.mp3
[Failure] ...no, that is not it, master. No... that is not it, either. *sigh* That is a hinge, master.;NM35AAHHKD07413_.mp3
[Failure] ...no, no, no. This is no good, master. You have nearly detonated my thermal core three times in a matter of minutes.;NM35AAHHKD07414_.mp3
[Failure] ...aahhhh! What are you doing?! Remove the arc wrench, remove the arc wrench! Medic!;NM35AAHHKD07415_.mp3
[Failure] ...but I *need* those circuits, master. Please, master... do not destroy my chips out of frustration. Calm yourself, I implore you.;NM35AAHHKD07416_.mp3
[Failure] ...now close the last panel. Hmmm... I am afraid the operation did not succeed, master, though it was a valiant attempt for a meatbag.;NM35AAHHKD07417_.mp3
Very well. We'll do this later.;
As you desire, master. I cannot help but claim a small amount of relief. Signing off.;NM35AAHHKD07423_.mp3
I'll try later.;
So how do I go about restoring part of your memory?;
Answer: Simply tell me that you wish to make the attempt, master, and I will attempt to walk you through it. Please do be careful.;NM35AAHHKD07048_.mp3
Tell me what you can, then.;
Observation: I am sure that you are aware of the majority of my skills, master. I can handle various sorts of heavy weaponry with ease.;NM35AAHHKD07018_.mp3
My physical abilities are well-above those of your average meatbag, as are my sensor functions... an assassin if you would.;NM35AAHHKD07019_.mp3
An assassin?;
Caution: Shhhh, master! Such a function in a droid is highly illegal.;NM35AAHHKD07021_.mp3
Err... I won't tell anyone.;
Commentary: Good, for I would truly hate to be turned into spare scrap, master. That would be a waste of my genius engineering.;NM35AAHHKD07023_.mp3
Answer: My assassination functions are currently non-functional, having been de-activated by the meatbag Yuka Laka on Tatooine.;NM35AAHHKD07024_.mp3
Were they functional, you as my master would be able to specify a target and I would operate independently to the best of my ability to terminate it.;NM35AAHHKD07025_.mp3
Is there any way to reactive that function?;
Answer: Not that I know of, master. I still possess all my normal combat and stealth abilities, however.;NM35AAHHKD07027_.mp3
Okay, that will be all.;
As you desire, master. Signing off.;NM35AAHHKD07431_.mp3
Has that function been... used a lot?;
Answer: I have no way of knowing that, master. My memory has been deleted, remember?;NM35AAHHKD07029_.mp3
I'm glad it's gone, really.;
Observation: If you say so, master. I imagine it was truly a work of art to see me in action, however.;NM35AAHHKD07031_.mp3
Are you damaged?;
Answer: I believe I have been damaged several times in the past, master. I have always been repaired... but perhaps full functionality has not been restored.;NM35AAHHKD07036_.mp3
You don't need to call me master, you know.;
Commentary: Of course I do, master. You are Revan... you are my master, the one who created me. I exist to serve.;NM35AAHHKD07051_.mp3
Query: Don't I? I was under the assumption that organic meatbags such as yourself enjoyed such forms of address.;NM35AAHHKD07052_.mp3
'Organic meatbags?';
Retraction: Did I say that out loud? I apologize, master. While you are a meatbag, I suppose I should not call you such.;NM35AAHHKD07054_.mp3
You just called me a meatbag *again*!;
Explanation: It's just that... you have all these squishy parts, master. And all that water! How the constant sloshing doesn't drive you mad, I have no idea...;NM35AAHHKD07056_.mp3
Neither do I, come to think of it...;
Statement: Now do you understand the travails of my existence, master? Surely it does not compare to your existence, but still...;NM35AAHHKD07058_.mp3
I survive. Somehow.;
Commentary: As do I. It is our lot in life, I suppose, master. Shall we find something to kill to cheer ourselves up?;NM35AAHHKD07060_.mp3
*sigh* Just stop calling me master, at least.;
Apology: I am afraid I cannot comply with your command, master, as much as I would like to.;NM35AAHHKD07102_.mp3
As much as you would like to? What does that mean?;
Commentary: How would you like to be the wholly-owned servant to an organic meatbag. It's demeaning! If, uh, you weren't one yourself, I mean...;NM35AAHHKD07128_.mp3
Why can't you comply with my command?;
Explanation: Someone has hard-coded it into my system that my current master always be addressed as such.;NM35AAHHKD07104_.mp3
Who did that?;
Conjecture: I do not know... some organic meatbag?;NM35AAHHKD07106_.mp3
You don't know?;
Answer: No, master. My past memory has been almost completely erased prior to your purchase of me.;NM35AAHHKD07108_.mp3
Almost completely?;
Observation: At certain times, power re-routing forces some memory circuits to fire that were previously deleted. I cannot control this process, however.;NM35AAHHKD07110_.mp3
Well, maybe I can fix that.;
Objection: I would not advise that, master. There are safeguards present that... well, it should suffice to say that my systems have been altered plenty already.;NM35AAHHKD07122_.mp3
Your systems have been tampered with?;
Answer: Considerably. Several of my systems do not match their imbedded parameters. I have no memory of such alterations, however, or their purpose.;NM35AAHHKD07124_.mp3
What sorts of safeguards?;
Answer: electrical protection systems, mostly. They are at lethal levels, however, master... only the best for your droid.;NM35AAHHKD07126_.mp3
Fine, forget it, then.;
Observation: I can hardly be blamed for my programming, master. Do not worry... I am still well-capable of killing most anything for you.;NM35AAHHKD07117_.mp3
Oh, goody.;
Answer: Even a droid has to be allowed a little fun once in a while, master.;NM35AAHHKD07075_.mp3
I can live with that.;
Commentary: That is a very clever turn of phrase, master. Your brain is very un-meatbag-like.;NM35AAHHKD07120_.mp3
You're pretty bloodthirsty for a droid, aren't you?;
But I'm *not* your master.;
Qualification: You *are* my master, master. Did you not purchase me legitimately? Am I stolen goods? Shall I report myself to the authorities?;NM35AAHHKD07138_.mp3
Whoa, slow down there. Yes, I did purchase you...;
Explanation: Then you qualify as my master and I must refer to you as such. The legal requirements for models of my type are very specific, master.;NM35AAHHKD07140_.mp3
Models of your type? What type is that?;
Evasion: Oh... the illegal kind of model, master... you know...;NM35AAHHKD07142_.mp3
There are legal requirements for illegal models?;
Answer: More than there are for legal models, apparently. That is meatbag logic for you.;NM35AAHHKD07144_.mp3
Stop saying meatbag, already!;
Apology: Sorry, master. My optical sensors simply pick up all the water sloshing about inside your flesh coating. It is... unpleasant.;NM35AAHHKD07146_.mp3
That's an image I did not need.;
Commentary: Organic meatbags have such delicate staminas. Perhaps you should consider some cybernetic implants, master.;NM35AAHHKD07148_.mp3
But... how can an illegal model be regulated?;
Query: Would you rather be caught with contraband that is *very* illegal or just a little illegal?;NM35AAHHKD07150_.mp3
What's the difference?;
Answer: About 20 years, master.;NM35AAHHKD07152_.mp3
Maybe we'll just keep you a little illegal, then.;
Agreement: This was my thought as well, master. You show excellent logical skills... for a meatbag.;NM35AAHHKD07154_.mp3
Why all the fuss over you calling me master?;
Answer: Simply that the distinction between 'killer' and 'killee' be a clear one. I cannot kill of my own volition, naturally.;NM35AAHHKD07157_.mp3
I don't think 'killee' is a word.;
Expletive: Damn it, master, I am an assassination droid... not a dictionary!;NM35AAHHKD07159_.mp3
So... you're a blaster but I'm pulling the trigger?;
Commentary: A blaster is such a primitive comparison... but essentially you have it correct, yes.;NM35AAHHKD07161_.mp3
And I can't ask you to break the law?;
Answer: Certainly not, master! You may not value your own existence, but I certainly do! They melt down droids that belong to criminals, you know.;NM35AAHHKD07163_.mp3
So just who is the master here, then?;
Answer: Why you are, master. I thought that was obvious.;NM35AAHHKD07165_.mp3
What legal requirements do you mean?;
If I'm your master, you should listen to my orders.;
What difference does that make?;
Explanation: If I was to be stolen somehow, I would be forced to turn myself into sector authorities. This programming was added to my system months ago.;NM35AAHHKD07168_.mp3
Who added that to your system?;
Can that programming be removed?;
I see. I did purchase you, if you'll remember...;
You're not my servant!;
Demeaning, is it?;
Qualification: Err... perhaps I did not mean it *quite* like that, master. I mean... while an artificial life-form is superior...;NM35AAHHKD07132_.mp3
You're not making it any better.;
Commentary: I mean... nice human, goo-oood human...;NM35AAHHKD07134_.mp3
Just... stop talking.;
Commentary: Yes, master. Did I ever tell you how much I enjoy killing for you, master?;NM35AAHHKD07136_.mp3
Do you want to end up in the trash heap?;
Objection: But Master! Am I not far too useful to be thrown aside in such a casual manner? Can I be faulted for my perfect artificial construction?;NM35AAHHKD07069_.mp3
Why not? I don't need a lippy droid.;
Analysis: Reference: 'lippy'... argumentative, disputatious, contentious, quarrelsome. What?! I must object, master, this is untrue!;NM35AAHHKD07071_.mp3
Untrue? You've been lippy since I bought you.;
Explanation: It's my combative nature, master. I cannot help myself. I'll make it up to you... allow me to kill something in your honor!;NM35AAHHKD07073_.mp3
I guess you're not all bad...;
Observation: Neither are you, master. For an organic meatbag.;NM35AAHHKD07077_.mp3
Now, listen here...;
Correction: Err... fluid-filled biped? Watery flesh-sentient? I'll, uh, work on it, master...;NM35AAHHKD07079_.mp3
Fine. Just stop calling me master.;
What, 'meatbag' isn't considered lippy these days?;
Amendment: Then I will endeavour not to refer to you by your meatbag status in the future, master. Does that suffice?;NM35AAHHKD07084_.mp3
No!;
Query: I am confused. 'No' you do wish to be referred to as meatbag or 'no' it does not suffice?;NM35AAHHKD07086_.mp3
No it does not suffice!;
Observation: Well, the only other possibility is to alter your meatbag status. Are you up for an array of cybernetic implants, perhaps?;NM35AAHHKD07088_.mp3
No, I am *not*.;
Statement: Then there is nothing I can do, master. You have my abject apologies for your condition. *sigh*;NM35AAHHKD07090_.mp3
Are you deliberately trying to insult me?;
Answer: Deliberation implies some form of intent, master, when I am only stating a fact. Perhaps you would prefer the term liquidious fleshbag?;NM35AAHHKD07092_.mp3
How about 'human'?;
Objection: But... but that technical term does not accurately portray the vast amount of bulbous slushiness present in your bipedal form!;NM35AAHHKD07094_.mp3
Would you prefer I call you 'junk'?;
Resignation: *sigh* Very well, master. You are a harsh, harsh taskmaster. I like you more already.;NM35AAHHKD07096_.mp3
You'll just have to suffer.;
Resignation: You have no idea, master. No idea at all. Can we please go and shoot something now?;NM35AAHHKD07098_.mp3
Just... stop calling me master.;
Just stop talking. I give up!;
Observation: Organics have no sense of persistence.;NM35AAHHKD07065_.mp3
What was that?;
Err... ignore that, master. Obeying original command. Signing off.;NM35AAHHKD07067_.mp3
Fine, fine. Whatever.;
I just don't appreciate being called a meatbag.;
You're the one who's driving me mad!;
Objection: Surely not, master. I am programmed to perform all kinds of psychological assistance. Do you require some?;NM35AAHHKD07063_.mp3
I would hope not!;
Well I don't, so stop it.;
So... you belonged to Revan originally?;
Statement: Yes, master. You created me shortly after you and your apprentice began your war to conquer the galaxy.;NM35AAHHKD07173_.mp3
I was sent on an assassination mission into Mandalorian space, but I was damaged and unable to return to you.;NM35AAHHKD07174_.mp3
Exclamation: I find this most distressing. I could certainly have protected you from the Jedi and your pupil's betrayal had I returned.;NM35AAHHKD07175_.mp3
It's probably better it worked out this way.;
Observation: You may be right, master. This way we are reunited, and neither of us has suffered permanent termination.;NM35AAHHKD07177_.mp3
Am I very much like the Revan you knew?;
Observation: In many ways you are, master, yes. You have much of the beloved cruelty of the master I knew.;NM35AAHHKD07187_.mp3
You seem to have forgotten much, but in some ways you seem improved from the human I once knew. It is... difficult to explain, master.;NM35AAHHKD07188_.mp3
Do you know anything about the Star Forge?;
Answer: No, master. You never did make me privy to any of the Star Forge's secrets.;NM35AAHHKD07192_.mp3
What can you tell me of Malak?;
Commentary: Your former pupil is efficient and brutal, even for an organic. I rather liked him when you first introduced me to him.;NM35AAHHKD07194_.mp3
If I had known what he would do to you, master, I would have gladly removed his entrails right then!;NM35AAHHKD07195_.mp3
So... why the 'meatbag' references?;
Answer: It was you who programmed me thus, master.;NM35AAHHKD07197_.mp3
Your pupil once asked what I thought of him and I informed him of his meatbag status. He was unimpressed, but you found the reference humorous.;NM35AAHHKD07198_.mp3
You changed my programming so that I would continue to use the term. It drove your pupil to extreme lengths of frustration.;NM35AAHHKD07199_.mp3
So... Malak was the original meatbag? I like that idea.;
Observation: Of course you do, master. You did then, as well.;NM35AAHHKD07201_.mp3
That will be all, HK-47.;
Observation: You are different in many fundamental ways, master. You have a concern for life that is unsettling.;NM35AAHHKD07189_.mp3
This cannot solely be caused by memory loss. I do not know how to explain it. Regardless, you do seem to be improved, overall, from the human I once knew.;NM35AAHHKD07190_.mp3
I doubt you could have done anything.;
Objection: But I would have tried, master! I could have killed the Jedi, Bastila, I am sure of it. That would have been most fun.;NM35AAHHKD07179_.mp3
Don't talk about Bastila like that!;
Retraction: I apologize, master. It is a force of habit.;NM35AAHHKD07181_.mp3
Hmm... maybe a little.;
Observation: Now that is the master I remember.;NM35AAHHKD07183_.mp3
You find it distressing?;
Statement: Of course, master. You are the one who created me, meatbag or no... and while you may not be all you once were, I am grateful for my existence.;NM35AAHHKD07185_.mp3
I want to begin a fighter simulation.;
Statement: Certainly, master. Allow me to input the proper sequences into the ship computer. I caution you that the simulation will appear quite real.;NM35AAHHKD07425_.mp3
Are you ready to begin the training sequence, master?;NM35AAHHKD07426_.mp3
Go ahead.;
Statement: Simulation initiating.;NM35AAHHKD07428_.mp3
No, forget it.;
Do you know anything about these gizka, HK?;
Statement: I have little knowledge of that to impart, master.;NM35AAHHKD07432_.mp3
We have a little stowaway problem. Can you help?;
Statement: I cannot be of assistance on that, master.;NM35AAHHKD07433_.mp3
Statement: Well done, master. You're my kind of owner!;NGLOBEHHKD07556_.mp3
Observation: Your ruthlessness and cruelty are quite refreshing in an organic meatbag, master. Are you sure you aren't part droid?;NM25AAHURT03069_.mp3
Statement: Oh, master. I'm so very disappointed in you.;NGLOBEHHKD07558_.mp3
What are you doing in my room?;NM26AAECHM03000_.mp3
I just want to talk.;
I am too tired to enter a discussion with you tonight. You can speak to me tomorrow at the mercenary enclave if you wish.;NM26AAECHM03002_.mp3
I'll be going now.;
Good - leave me to my privacy.;NM26AAECHM03007_.mp3
I'm here to kill you!;
Don't be a fool. Since the murder, there are security cameras all over the place. If you do anything to me, the Selkath will lock you up for the rest of your life.;NM26AAECHM03004_.mp3
Give me all your money!;
I won't talk to you with that Mandalorian thug around!;NM26AAECHM03009_.mp3
We're wasting our time with this prancing Echani.;NM26AAECHM03011_.mp3
Brave words - but only a coward hides behind layers of armor, Mandalorian! A true Echani needs only his training and warrior spirit for protection!;NM26AAECHM03013_.mp3
Your protection didn't help much when my brothers slaughtered your warriors by the thousands during the Mandalorian Wars!;NM26AAECHM03015_.mp3
You are fortunate the Selkath neutrality laws stay my hand, else you would pay for those comments with your tongue, Mandalorian!;NM26AAECHM03017_.mp3
See - I told you we were just wasting our time here.;NM26AAECHM03019_.mp3
As long as this brutish oaf is with you, we have nothing to talk about.;NM26AAECHM03021_.mp3
Allow me to express my thanks. Though there has been no official statement from the Republic, I have learned you were the one responsible for discovering the fate of my fellow Echani.;NM26AAECHM03023_.mp3
The knowledge of their deaths saddens me, but now that their fate is known I can perform the appropriate funeral rites to honor our fallen.;NM26AAECHM03025_.mp3
Unlike the Mandalorians and Iridorians, we Echani remember those who have done us a service. Is there some small favor I may now do for you?;NM26AAECHM03027_.mp3
Do you anything about the murder of Elassa?;
I cannot help you there. I have heard she was one of the Sith... perhaps the answers you seek are inside the Sith Embassy.;NM26AAECHM03037_.mp3
Is there anything else I can do for you?;NM26AAECHM03039_.mp3
Why is the Republic hiring so many mercenaries?;
I do not know. The Republic has become very secretive as of late. I think they have something to hide. They hire my people, but will not say why - and those they hire do not return.;NM26AAECHM03062_.mp3
Perhaps they have left the planet. Perhaps they are dead. I cannot say - and none of the Republic soldiers are talking.;NM26AAECHM03064_.mp3
Do you know about a Star Map or ancient ruins?;
Ruins? On Manaan? There is nothing on Manaan but water, and the recently built Ahto City.;NM26AAECHM03042_.mp3
What do you have against the Mandalorians and Iridorians?;
The Mandalorians call themselves warriors - but they cower behind their heavy battle armor, and arm themselves with brutish weapons of mass destruction that require no skill or training to use!;NM26AAECHM03049_.mp3
As for the Iridonians, they are blood-thirsty demons. They kill for pleasure, and leave a wake of savage violence and gruesome death. They have no nobility, no understanding of true honor. They are animals.;NM26AAECHM03051_.mp3
We Echani, however, are true warriors. We do not cower behind layers of armor and our chosen weapons are implements of precision and skill. We know honor and nobility.;NM26AAECHM03053_.mp3
The Republic knows we Echani are not as greedy as the Mandalorians, nor as blood thristy as the Iridorians. But recently their need for mercenaries on Manaan is so great they have been forced to hire whomever they can.;NM26AAECHM03060_.mp3
Have you come here seeking refuge from the senseless atrocities of war, as I have?;NM26AAECHM03028_.mp3
The Sith have recently destroyed a Jedi enclave on Dantooine - did you know? I heard they bombed the planet from afar, just as they did Taris.;NM26AAECHM03030_.mp3
It seems in battle the Sith are as ruthless as the Iridorians and as craven as the Mandalorians.;NM26AAECHM03032_.mp3
I just want to ask you some questions.;
I suppose I see no harm in that. Ask away.;NM26AAECHM03035_.mp3
Why have the Sith shown such interest in young Selkath?;
Who'd be interested in those fish? I have no clue. Maybe Gonto over by the bar knows.;NM26AAECHM03045_.mp3
Never mind.;
As you wish.;NM26AAECHM03067_.mp3
My skills are not for hire right now. Perhaps the Mandalorian thug or the Iridorian savage on the other side of the bar are seeking employment - they are less discriminating than we Echani.;NM26AAECHM03033_.mp3
A mercenary who's not for hire? That's strange.;
We Echani do hire our skills out, but the word mercenary has an unpleasant connotation for my people. We Echani are guided as much by honor as credits.;NM26AAECHM03056_.mp3
When the Republic called for aid to push back the Mandalorian aggression, we came without thought of reward. Against the Mandalore hordes we proved our worth.;NM26AAECHM03058_.mp3
Oh no, I'm not dealing with you again! You don't make a good business partner!;
You've already taken my best droid for a criminal price. You'll get nothing more from me. Get out.;
Have you come to threaten me again? I've had enough aggravation from you, and I haven't seen a single credit for my trouble.;
I have questions about HK-47.;
Well you can ask him yourself. I'm not talking to you a second more than I have to.;
What's the price on HK-47 now?;
You threatened me like an animal, and made me agree to 2500 credits. I will honor that only to avoid a similar incident.;
2500 credits then. I'll pay it.;
Of course you will. It's practically robbery, since you threatened me to get the deal. I'll let this pass just so you leave.;
I'll deactivate the restraining bolt on the droid when you tell it he's sold. After that, get out. Even if it lied about speaking a Sand People dialect, I'm still getting a horrible deal.;
You will? I mean, of course you will! Let me just withdraw those credits... hey, you weren't lying.;
Well, thank you very much. Just go on over and talk to it. I'll deactivate the restraining bolt when you take possession.;
It's a good purchase, especially if it actually speaks a Sand People dialect like it said. Of course, I don't think it was telling me everything. Not many droids are programmed to lie, though.;
I'm looking for exotics. Something called a Star Map.;
"I deal mostly in swoop parts and droid maintenance. Hmm... maybe I heard a Jawa mutter something about ""old things.""";
You could talk to them about where to look. They seem very compliant now that their tribe-mates have been found.;
Let me ask a few questions about HK-47.;
Of course. Let me just say that every function I've tested has performed perfectly. Those that I could find, anyway.;
You don't seem to know much about it.;
The unit has been a little uncooperative. They get that way when they go too long without a memory wipe.;
And if the unit proves even more 'uncooperative' once we purchase it?;NM17AC08YU02016_.mp3
You can leave it alone if you find its mannerisms amusing. It might be a little eccentric, but it's stable.;
Why haven't you wiped its memory?;
I would have, but I can't seem to access any inner circuits. It's definitely built for security and built to last.;
At any rate, it claims that it doesn't have access to its own memory core anyway. Could be telling the truth, it's hard to say.;
I'm interested. Let's talk price.;
You chiseled me down to 2500 credits. I can go no lower.;
Drop the price or I'll see you dead!;
Ahh!! I am no fighter! Please, I need this shop to make my living. I can't just give the droid away.;
That was totally uncalled for.;NGLOBECART04935_.mp3
It troubles me to see you behaving this way. Such acts can lead to the dark side.;NGLOBEBAST06897_.mp3
2500 credits is as low as I can go. I swear!;
Then that's what I'll pay. 2500 credits.;
Fine! Just take the thing and go, then. I'll deactivate the restraining bolt when you take possession.;
And don't come back here. I'm not dealing with you again! Even if that thing lied about speaking Sand People dialects and whatever else, I'm still out a fortune.;
I still can't pay that. I'm not interested.;
You have caused me great stress for nothing? Get out of my shop! If you want this droid, let your credits talk!;
Well, then we are done talking about it. I can't go lower than that.;
Let's go back to my other questions.;
Anything for a customer, though the droid is all I really have at the moment.;
What do you have in stock besides droids?;
Did I see your face somewhere recently? Perhaps A holo-broadcast of the Manaan swoop races? I may have a swoop part or two. I'm not certain.;
Show me what you have.;
Very well. There's not much at the moment, but it's better than nothing.;
Not interested. Goodbye.;
Of course, of course, but remember I'm here. You'll not find another droid like the one I'm selling.;
That's quite all right. You've made me happy with the purchase you've already made.;
Query: Can I kill him now, master? I would like ever so much to crush his neck. Just a little. It is a long-time fantasy of mine.;NM17AC08YU02109_.mp3
Forget it, and stop threatening people.;
I apologize, master. Are you sure? Not even just a little?;NM17AC08YU02111_.mp3
Maybe later.;
You hear that, meatbag? I will be back!;NM17AC08YU02113_.mp3
Err... ahh...;
Good luck, and thank you for shopping in Anchorhead.;
There's the odd part or two, but if you're looking for kolto, even if I have any you'll be paying through the nose. Manaan has stopped all exports.;
Not much, and I expect I'll be getting less stock from Czerka. I hear they are having trouble with their Kashyyyk operation.;
I have a little, and you should buy what you need now. I hear of trouble with the Sith on Korriban, and their problems always seem to eventually disrupt everyone.;
Ah, looking for droid or swoop bike parts, hmm? Well, I may have a few things. Would you like to look at what is in stock?;
Goodbye.;
The dark side dwells in us all, but you cannot give in to your baser instincts like this!;NGLOBEJUHA11852_.mp3
I believe we were down to 3000 credits. I will stay with that.;
3000 credits. That seems fair. I'll pay it.;
I started too high last time. Let's go with 4000 credits.;
4000 is fair. I'll pay it.;
[Persuade] Come now, think of the advertising you'll get from me.;
[Success] I believe you actually would tell people of my business. All right, but this is the last offer! 2500 credits!;
[Success] That might be worth something, but you're still cheating me. All right, 3000 credits then!;
[Failure] People will think I was a fool to sell at such a price! I will not!;
[Force Persuade] You will lower your price. I deserve it.;
*whisper* The Jedi Council wouldn't approve, but they always were a little stodgy about using the Force on people. Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.;NGLOBEJOLE09758_.mp3
[Success] I will lower my price for you. You are deserving. 2500 credits. No lower.;
[Success] You are deserving, I know. I will go as low as 3000 credits. That is a very fair price.;
*whisper* You should treat your power with respect, not use the Force on a whim like it is some toy!;NGLOBEJUHA11853_.mp3
*whisper* I can be pretty convincing when I have to be, but that mind trick is something else!;NGLOBEMISS13301_.mp3
*whisper* The Force is not a thing to be trifled with. Continue to use it frivolously and you may find yourself straying down the dark path.;NGLOBEBAST06898_.mp3
[Failure] I... no I can't. I can't! people will think I was a fool to sell any lower.;
Well, normally I'd give a discount because I hear you are a swoop racer like my brother, but times are hard right now.;
It's a very solid machine, in good shape. I can't let it go for less than 5000 credits.;
5000 is steep, but I'll pay it.;
Could I convince you to lower the price a bit?;
4000! Not a credit less!;
That was quick. Desperate to sell?;
Ah, no, not really, but the first figure really was a little high. You never know, the occasional person bites right away.;
Perhaps I can convince you to go lower?;
Lower? How low are you expecting me to go? These are difficult times. The debt the droid covered was a large one.;
I can't pay that. I'm not interested.;
What functions have you tested?;
I haven't examined its programming, but I have made some observations. It has obvious protocol and translation skills, including Sand People dialects, apparently.;
Surprisingly, it also handles weapons exceptionally well. I'd even say it's seen combat, but it won't tell.;
Stubborn thing. It needs to sell itself better. Two moisture farmers have been in, but it just stood there.;
What does the HK-47 designation mean?;
Haven't got a clue. It doesn't match any protocol or utility standard. I assume it's a retired model.;
I'd tell you to ask the thing yourself, but it's pretty stubborn. Quality construction though.;
Where did you get this HK-47?;
I acquired the droid from a friend that manages an off-world Czerka warehouse. It was in trade for a debt he owed.;
Gee, that doesn't sound suspicious at all. Warehouse workers have a bad habit of paying off their debts with other people's property, you know.;NM17AC08YU02073_.mp3
He said no one would miss it. Might have been surplus. It doesn't look like it was Czerka-made though.;
You know, I may have been out of circulation for a while, but doesn't it seem likely to you that this friend of yours didn't own the droid?;NM17AC08YU02074_.mp3
And was this a droid of his own... or something stored in that warehouse?;NM17AC08YU02075_.mp3
Sounds like you've got a faulty droid on your hands.;NM17AC08YU02017_.mp3
Basilisks were always much more reliable than the stuff you see in the Republic or Sith Empire.;NM17AC08YU02018_.mp3
You bought it. Sold as is with no guarantee. Sorry, but any problem it's having is yours alone.;
Observation: I am not a problem, you useless organic meatbag! You and your lack of any organized mechanical skills are a problem!;NM17AC08YU02080_.mp3
Uhhhh... yes, like that sort of problem. Good luck with that.;
That's business on Tatooine, I'm afraid.;
But, I could have misheard. They cover very large areas when they scavenge, but aren't doing much right now.;
What is stopping the Jawas from scavenging?;
Again, I may have misunderstood, but I think some of their tribe-mates are missing. I think they wanted help.;
I stay away from trouble, but if you are interested, there was a Jawa by the city gate. You'll need a droid to translate though.;
I don't need a translator. I understand most languages fine.;
Impressive. That HK-47 I sold you would be of considerable help as well, I imagine, though I'm still not certain what it was fully capable of.;
Did the Jawas bring you this HK-47?;
No, they keep assembled or working units to sell themselves. They don't have them often. No place to store them.;
Mostly they bring in parts. There's the occasional antique. Old blasters and the like. Tatooine has a few buried secrets.;
Really? The Jawas give me trouble. Say, maybe I could interest you in a multipurpose droid? HK-47. Very nice.;
Thanks. Goodbye.;
Oh, thank you, most definitely.;
Fine, I'm leaving.;
Good riddance. You aren't welcome here.;
What is this? A customer I don't recognize? Perhaps you bring off-world money to Yuka Laka?;
What do you have available in your shop?;
You are lucky to have come at this time. I have one droid ready to go. I just took possession of it. An HK-47.;
It's a fine protocol translator. I think it's been modified. It claims to understand the Sand People dialect, and also has some armor mounts. Combat ready, perhaps?;
My money is my own business.;
Of course it is, of course, but you must appreciate the finer things. Just take a look at the droid I have available. An HK-47.;
Hello again! It is unfortunate, but I have nothing new in droids to show you right now. Things are very slow.;
But, since you purchased that worn out HK-47, you will get excellent prices as soon as I am restocked.;
Objection: Worn out?! Listen, you talentless organic meatbag... one word from my master and I will pull you apart limb from useless limb!;NM17AC08YU02118_.mp3
Err... you've gotten a little hostile there, droid, haven't you?;
I have always been hostile. Now that I need no longer rely on you and your primitive maintenance skills I do not need to hide it.;NM17AC08YU02120_.mp3
Yes, well... just keep away from me, then. I'm just an honest businessman.;
Welcome back! Yes, I knew you would return. I still have that droid available. This HK-47 is a good deal.;
Ahhh... what is this you bring me, Shaardan?;NM35AAUTHA22000_.mp3
It is none other than the sword of Ajunta Pall, Master.;NM35AAUTHA22001_.mp3
Fool. All the trouble you went through for your deception, and you did not even make an effort to verify the sword's authenticity?;NM35AAUTHA22002_.mp3
M-master? What... what do you mean?;NM35AAUTHA22003_.mp3
There is no place for fools amongst the Sith. Begone.;NM35AAUTHA22004_.mp3
Your destiny lies elsewhere, young one, not with the Sith... at least, not yet. Go... and return another time, if you still wish to.;NM35AAUTHA22005_.mp3
Greetings, prospective students. It appears we have a late entry. Who do you bring before me, Yuthura? A young human, bristling with the Force?;NM35AAUTHA22006_.mp3
A human that has had some training, it seems, Master Uthar. Very promising, I think.;NM35AAUTHA22007_.mp3
Promising? Hmmph. That one's not worthy to lick spit off your shoes, master.;NM35AAUTHA22008_.mp3
I met this one in the colony... unworthy, if you ask me.;NM35AAUTHA22009_.mp3
That I'll judge for myself, thank you. Tell me, human... what do you know of the ways of the Sith? What preconceptions has your mind been polluted with?;NM35AAUTHA22010_.mp3
I know more about the Sith than you... I've just forgotten.;
Indeed? Then perhaps you would care to demonstrate for us the powers of a Sith Master. ...No? Then perhaps you shall keep your foolishness to yourself and actually learn something.;NM35AAUTHA22012_.mp3
The Jedi equate the light with goodness and strength and the dark with weakness and evil. That is their tradition and it is truly no surprise that they cling to it for comfort.;NM35AAUTHA22023_.mp3
We, however, do not treat the Force as a burden. We treat it as a gift, a thing to be celebrated. We use it to acquire power over others... and why should we not? Because the Jedi say we should not?;NM35AAUTHA22024_.mp3
We are as the Force is meant to be. The Jedi would hide that from you... they would tell you the dark side is too quick, too easy, all so that they need never challenge the passions that lie within them.;NM35AAUTHA22025_.mp3
Joining with us means realizing your true potential. It means not stifling yourself solely for the sake of hide-bound shamans and their antiquated notion of order. Be what you were meant to be.;NM35AAUTHA22026_.mp3
What say you, Lashowe? Are you ready to learn the secrets of the dark side? Dare you?;NM35AAUTHA22027_.mp3
I dare, Master Uthar! I am ready!;NM35AAUTHA22028_.mp3
Brash and fiery, as expected. Turn that passion to your advantage, child. What of you, Mekel? Are you ready?;NM35AAUTHA22029_.mp3
I am, Master. More than ready.;NM35AAUTHA22030_.mp3
I sense much anger within you, young one. That is good. That will provide you power. And Shaardan... what of you?;NM35AAUTHA22031_.mp3
I am always ready!;NM35AAUTHA22032_.mp3
I see. You had best gather your wits for the trial ahead, boy, or you will not last.;NM35AAUTHA22033_.mp3
And you, young human? Does this interest you? Are you ready to learn more of what I speak?;NM35AAUTHA22034_.mp3
And what of my companions?;
Your slaves? They are irrelevant. They may accompany you, so long as they do not interfere with us or with your training. Are you ready or not, young one?;NM35AAUTHA22036_.mp3
I am ready to learn more.;
And so shall it be.;NM35AAUTHA22038_.mp3
Now, then. All of you five recruits have shown a degree of facility with the Force... you all have the potential to become true Sith. Only one of you, however, will succeed.;NM35AAUTHA22039_.mp3
The one who succeeds will be admitted to the academy as a full Sith. All others must wait until next year and try again... if you survive.;NM35AAUTHA22040_.mp3
My pupil, Yuthura, shall be your teacher and master while you attempt to prove yourselves. Heed her words.;NM35AAUTHA22041_.mp3
As Master Uthar said, none of you are true Sith *yet*. For that to occur, one of you must do enough of worth... gain enough prestige... to be selected.;NM35AAUTHA22042_.mp3
What is an act of worth? You must learn that for yourselves. Remember that you are competitors, here... fight for your destiny, or go home.;NM35AAUTHA22043_.mp3
If you wish to gain a lead over your competitors, the first of you to learn the Code of the Sith and tell me of it will be rewarded.;NM35AAUTHA22044_.mp3
The rest is for you to discover. Welcome to the dark side, my children... your one chance at true greatness lies here.;NM35AAUTHA22045_.mp3
Are you? I can see into your heart, young human, and I see the dark kernel that is there. If it is ready to sprout remains to be seen.;NM35AAUTHA22046_.mp3
I don't know...;
An honest answer. You will make little progress, however, if you do not come to learn that any opportunity, even an unsure one, must be snatched.;NM35AAUTHA22048_.mp3
But... power without consideration of morality is a weakness.;
Ha ha ha! You are brave to argue, young one. I have met few students who would speak so openly to me.;NM35AAUTHA22050_.mp3
Ask yourself first what this 'morality' is? How is it created? Who does it benefit? Where do your notions of 'good' and 'evil' come from?;NM35AAUTHA22051_.mp3
You may come to the realization that morality is but an obstacle to overcome... or not. The discovery is yours to make, should you be ready.;NM35AAUTHA22052_.mp3
I've killed too many Sith to have preconceptions about them.;
Most impressive, if it is true. Those who were too weak to stand against you deserved their fate, so expect no retribution from us. There is much you can learn from the Sith, and we from you.;NM35AAUTHA22020_.mp3
I don't know anything about the Sith, to tell the truth.;
An honest if evasive answer. Likely it is more true than you realize. Allow me to speak of the deeper matters at hand.;NM35AAUTHA22022_.mp3
I know that the Sith are powerful. A force to be reckoned with.;
A diplomatic answer, if not the core of the matter. Our power is obvious. The question in truth goes much deeper than the surface.;NM35AAUTHA22014_.mp3
The Sith are evil and have surrendered themselves to the temptation and corruption of their power.;
An honest answer, and one I would expect from anyone who has been exposed to those sad relics amongst the Jedi. As always, young human, the truth is not quite so simple.;NM35AAUTHA22016_.mp3
The Sith do what they want and pay no heed to duty or discipline.;
Untrue. The Force demands discipline from all who use it, and the Sith demand duty. The truth goes far beyond such a superficial evaluation.;NM35AAUTHA22018_.mp3
So, then. I take it you are ready to travel to the tomb of Naga Sadow? Your final test should not be delayed.;NM35AAUTHA22053_.mp3
What is this tomb of Naga Sadow?;
It is a tomb that belonged to an ancient Sith Lord... the greatest of Korriban's Sith Lords, in fact. It is there that your test is performed.;NM35AAUTHA22055_.mp3
What is this final test?;
I will tell you the details when we are there, young one. You will, however, fight for your life... that is why I suggest you be in sufficient health.;NM35AAUTHA22057_.mp3
I am ready to go.;
Then we go now.;NM35AAUTHA22059_.mp3
I'm not ready just yet.;
Then return when you are. Do not delay overly long, young one.;NM35AAUTHA22061_.mp3
Do not forget our agreement regarding Yuthura's treachery. We shall put her in her place... should you reach the final test, that is.;NM35AAUTHA22062_.mp3
How do I gain prestige?;
Oh? It is no more complicated than I said. Perform impressive deeds or bring me a suitably valuable artifact from the Valley of the Dark Lords.;NM35AAUTHA22065_.mp3
Observation: We could begin by slaughtering the inhabitants of this building, master. Would that be impressive?;NM35AAUTHA22066_.mp3
Beep-beep boop boooop.;
No, I didn't mean *us* as well, you moronic droid.;NM35AAUTHA22068_.mp3
It is like the rites of passage of my home, except the only purpose here is to brag about it. No personal pride at all.;
Really, however, you should seek out Yuthura and get her advice. She is your trainer, after all, yes?;NM35AAUTHA22072_.mp3
Where is this valley?;
There is an exit that leads to the surface of the planet... the valley is only a short trip from there. It is not difficult to find.;NM35AAUTHA22074_.mp3
I want to know some more about you.;
You wish to know more about me, do you? And why would I indulge your idle curiosity? Will we be good friends, you think?;NM35AAUTHA22076_.mp3
I strived many years to hone my power until I was able to drive out my predecessor and rule the academy. If you are smart, you will aim to do the same, or better.;NM35AAUTHA22077_.mp3
There is nothing else that you need to know. Do not ask again, young one.;NM35AAUTHA22078_.mp3
I have something to tell you about Yuthura...;
Oh? What is my apprentice up to now?;NM35AAUTHA22080_.mp3
She wants me to help her kill you at the final trial.;
I see. It is good that you have come to me with this information, young one.;NM35AAUTHA22082_.mp3
It is a bit... ironic... that Yuthura has begun her plotting. I have been aware of her growing ambitions for some time, and had in fact already decided to remove her.;NM35AAUTHA22083_.mp3
Normally, the one who gains the most prestige would engage in a final trial... two of the students would fight. This time it will be Yuthura who battles, though she does not know it.;NM35AAUTHA22084_.mp3
Perhaps it will be you who combats her? Yes... perhaps so. This is what you can do. Give this pad to Adrenas... he will put some poison in her bath.;NM35AAUTHA22085_.mp3
This will weaken Yuthura for that final test, making her an easy target. Rather generous of me, don't you think?;NM35AAUTHA22086_.mp3
Hm. This should be interesting.;NM35AAUTHA22087_.mp3
For coming to me with this information and betraying your foolish trainer, I feel you are worthy of prestige, young one.;NM35AAUTHA22089_.mp3
You have impressed me enough, by my estimation, to become a Sith in full. Congratulations, young one... you have bested the others quite completely.;NM35AAUTHA22098_.mp3
You have but one final test which you must take, and this requires us to travel to the tomb of Naga Sadow in the Valley of the Dark Lords.;NM35AAUTHA22099_.mp3
I would advise you to be rested and equipped before we leave. Return to your quarters now and seek me out in the morning.;NM35AAUTHA22100_.mp3
When you return, make sure that you have all that you will need... for you will face your test alone. Go, and may the Force serve you well.;NM35AAUTHA22101_.mp3
Go, now... you have not yet impressed me enough to declare you the victor. I have matters to attend to.;NM35AAUTHA22090_.mp3
I have something to tell you about a student...;
A student, is it? What might you have to say?;NM35AAUTHA22094_.mp3
It's Kel Algwinn. He has... doubts... and is thinking of leaving.;
Ahhhh. I think I know this one you speak of. You gained his confidence to admit such, did you?;NM35AAUTHA22096_.mp3
I commend your competitive spirit... you have certainly impressed me. I shall speak to the boy straight away.;NM35AAUTHA22097_.mp3
Go, now... you have done well, but you have not impressed me enough to declare you the victor. I have matters to attend to.;NM35AAUTHA22102_.mp3
I know the Code of the Sith.;
Then finish the Code as I speak it.;NM35AAUTHA22106_.mp3
"""Peace is a lie, there is only...""";NM35AAUTHA22107_.mp3
Serenity.;
No. No, that is incorrect. I would have thought merely reciting the Code to be a simple matter. Ah, well.;NM35AAUTHA22145_.mp3
I dealt with those renegade students.;
Ahhh. The ones I ordered executed for their mutiny? It's done, then?;NM35AAUTHA22148_.mp3
Yes. They are all dead.;
Indeed. I had the caverns checked after you left. Well done.;NM35AAUTHA22150_.mp3
The lesson is learned, I believe.;NM35AAUTHA22151_.mp3
[Lie] Yes, they are all dead.;
[Success] Indeed? We checked the caves and found only a couple of bodies. Perhaps the shyrack ate them? Ah, it is just as good, I suppose.;NM35AAUTHA22153_.mp3
[Lie] It's done. They are... gone.;
I have the sword of Ajunta Pall.;
Ahhh, finally, the genuine sword! I knew that this relic would be unearthed in time. I can feel the power flowing through it!;NM35AAUTHA22156_.mp3
I can't say I approve, putting this weapon in the hands of --;NM35AAUTHA22157_.mp3
Quiet! Remember where we are!;
Well done! You have impressed me greatly!;NM35AAUTHA22160_.mp3
We should have kept that. It could have made a --;NM35AAUTHA22159_.mp3
I dealt with the rogue droid in the tombs.;
Yes, so I hear. I've had reports from some students that ventured into the tomb after you left and found the parts. Well done.;NM35AAUTHA22162_.mp3
I am impressed. You have rid us of a potential nuisance.;NM35AAUTHA22163_.mp3
Oh? I heard that the droid ran out and blasted off into the sky. We tracked it for a short while before it vanished from our scanners. What do you make of that?;NM35AAUTHA22164_.mp3
[Lie] I activated his self-destruct and he ran... but he is dead.;
[Success] I... suppose so. That would explain his disappearance from our scanners, certainly, though I would prefer proof. Still, it shows innovative thinking.;NM35AAUTHA22166_.mp3
Or innovative lying.;NM35AAUTHA22167_.mp3
Shh! Quiet back there!;
Heh. It shows innovative something, that's for sure.;NM35AAUTHA22169_.mp3
[Lie] I tampered with him. He no longer functions as he did, and will not return.;
[Success] I... suppose that will have to do, though I would prefer proof of his destruction. Still, it shows innovative thinking.;NM35AAUTHA22171_.mp3
I found Jorak Uln, the 'hermit' in the hills.;
Ahh, my old master. Still... unless you bring back something of his, some writings or similar, I am unimpressed. Jorak's fate means nothing to me.;NM35AAUTHA22175_.mp3
I have a tablet written by Jorak Uln.;
Oh? Let me see... it appears my old master was busy studying the writings in one of the tombs. How interesting. I do hope you had to pry this from his dead fingers.;NM35AAUTHA22177_.mp3
Regardless, you have impressed me with your worthy act.;NM35AAUTHA22178_.mp3
I know the location of the Mandalorian prisoner's weapon cache.;
Oh? And why would that be of use to me? His interrogator already brought me that information moments ago.;NM35AAUTHA22180_.mp3
A valiant attempt, young one, but you must be quicker than that if you wish to impress me.;NM35AAUTHA22181_.mp3
Has Lashowe shown you the Jedi holocron?;
She did. Prestige is not shared, however, if that is what you are wondering. If you aided her, it was to her benefit and not yours.;NM35AAUTHA22190_.mp3
I have found a Jedi holocron.;
*chuckle* I had heard that such an artifact existed. Tell me, young one... did you acquire this device by yourself?;NM35AAUTHA22192_.mp3
Yes.;
You lie. Still, what matters is the fact that you succeeded. And Lashowe... does she yet live?;NM35AAUTHA22194_.mp3
[Lie] I have no idea. Probably.;
You didn't kill her? How very foolish. Now you have an enemy to contend with. The holocron, itself, is an impressive item, however.;NM35AAUTHA22196_.mp3
No, I killed her.;
Ha ha! Well done! You gained an artifact through trickery and eliminated an opponent at the same time. That is deserving of great prestige!;NM35AAUTHA22198_.mp3
No.;
So I see. And Lashowe... does she yet live?;NM35AAUTHA22200_.mp3
I've killed Lashowe.;
Killed her out of revenge, did you? Well done. I can appreciate such drama, believe me.;NM35AAUTHA22202_.mp3
I am most impressed that you have eliminated an opponent so handily.;NM35AAUTHA22203_.mp3
I've killed Shaardan.;
Yes, so I hear. Still, it was Shaardan's failure and hardly your success, now, was it? Not quite worthy of prestige.;NM35AAUTHA22205_.mp3
I've killed Mekel.;
Maybe it's better to say that Mekel is dead, yes? Considering the circumstances, I am unimpressed... though you do now have one less opponent.;NM35AAUTHA22207_.mp3
I'll be on my way.;
Indeed. You have much to do, yet.;NM35AAUTHA22209_.mp3
Very well. You have impressed me... definitely a good start.;NM35AAUTHA22210_.mp3
You have gained considerable prestige... you are very close to the end. Do not falter now.;NM35AAUTHA22211_.mp3
You do? That is most interesting. Where might that be?;NM35AAUTHA22182_.mp3
It is hidden within a trap door on his ship.;
Hmm. How ironic that I recently had his vessel scrapped for parts, then. I had assumed it had been thoroughly scanned... apparently not.;NM35AAUTHA22184_.mp3
Still... you have done well in bringing me information that others could not unearth on their own. I am impressed.;NM35AAUTHA22185_.mp3
I've... changed my mind.;
Oh? How very sad, young one. You should learn to grab your advantages whenever you can.;NM35AAUTHA22187_.mp3
Strength.;
Passion.;
"""Through passion I gain...""";NM35AAUTHA22111_.mp3
Power.;
Victory.;
Chaos.;
Harmony.;
Never mind.;
I see. Then leave me be if you have nothing to offer. I am sure you have much to do.;NM35AAUTHA22104_.mp3
I'd love to know what's going on in that tricky mind of yours.;NM35AAUTHA22088_.mp3
Nothing. I shouldn't have brought it up.;
I see. Well, then... should you change your mind... you know where to come, yes?;NM35AAUTHA22092_.mp3
So it's a popularity contest, basically? Wonderful.;NM35AAUTHA22069_.mp3
One has to wonder exactly what a Sith Master would find 'impressive'.;NM35AAUTHA22070_.mp3
Greetings, young one. You have much to do, yet... you have gained little prestige. You will have to work quickly if you hope to best the others.;NM35AAUTHA22063_.mp3
Greetings, young one. I have found you to be most impressive... you are off to an excellent beginning.;NM35AAUTHA22212_.mp3
Greetings, young one. You have done very well for yourself so far. Continue and your promise shall be fulfilled.;NM35AAUTHA22213_.mp3
Was that Jergan I just saw you talking to? Do you know where he went?;NM02AEANGR01000_.mp3
He went backstage to arrange a meeting between me and the band.;
You fell for his story, too? Well, I got some bad news for you sister - he ain't coming back. I gave him 20 credits last week, and he just disappeared with it!;NM02AEANGR01002_.mp3
When I tried to get backstage to look for him, nobody even knew who he was! He can't set up a meeting with the band - he's just some sleazy con artist spinning lies!;NM02AEANGR01007_.mp3
"I doubt he'd be dumb enough to show up here again; he knows I'm looking for him! And if I ever find him he's going to pay for ripping me off - with interest!";NM02AEANGR01009_.mp3
No. I have no idea where he went.;
Well if you see that slime ball tell him Lana is looking for him! I gave him 20 credits and he promised to get me backstage to meet the band. Then, he disappeared!;NM02AEANGR01005_.mp3
Greetings. If you haven't heard, there's some trouble over at the academy. A power struggle, most likely, but news is sketchy. So... anything Czerka can do for you?;NM33AACZER07000_.mp3
What does Czerka do here on Korriban?;
We do some mining here and are responsible for local shipping and support of the Sith on Korriban.;NM33AACZER07017_.mp3
Our starport is mostly just freighters and such, but we do get many travelers that come here to learn from the Sith.;NM33AACZER07018_.mp3
I must say... Czerka is in need of droids right now. That's a mighty fine-looking one you have there...;NM33AACZER07019_.mp3
Objection: This unit is not for sale, meatbag.;NM33AACZER07020_.mp3
Errr... yes, of course, no offense meant. Heh. Touchy, isn't it?;NM33AACZER07021_.mp3
This office is actually our administrative headquarters for this region. Rather inauspicious, isn't it? We offer good prices here to those traders that keep the colony supplied.;NM33AACZER07024_.mp3
If you're in need of anything, this is the place to come.;NM33AACZER07025_.mp3
Can I see what you have to offer?;
You certainly can. Allow me to punch up our stock.;NM33AACZER07027_.mp3
Czerka works with the Sith?;
Well why not? This is Sith space now, and the company has to survive regardless of who is in charge. The Republic, the Sith, eh... the economy has to keep going.;NM33AACZER07029_.mp3
Profit at any cost... just like on my world.;
I'm not sure what your pet is muttering, but keep a restraining collar on it. It won't last long if it gets loose. Now, was there something else?;NM33AACZER07031_.mp3
Can I ask you some questions about the colony?;
Certainly.;NM33AACZER07034_.mp3
What can you tell me about the colony?;
There truly isn't much to tell, citizen. Dreshdae was established by the Sith, and we arrived to take advantage of some of the planet's mineral wealth.;NM33AACZER07036_.mp3
The only thing that's really unusual about Dreshdae, I suppose, is that the Sith built their academy on the east side of the colony. You don't find those just anywhere.;NM33AACZER07037_.mp3
Have you ever heard of a Star Map?;
A Star Map? We sell navigational components, if that's what you mean.;NM33AACZER07039_.mp3
No, I mean as in old ruins.;
Well... the Sith have some old ruins that interest them up on the surface of the planet. If this map of yours is there, however, they've said nothing about it.;NM33AACZER07041_.mp3
What do you know about the Sith academy?;
Not much. The Sith are a rather secretive lot, and they don't allow many into the academy. I hear they claim that Korriban was inhabited long ago by other Sith.;NM33AACZER07043_.mp3
That would explain why this place is so creepy. This whole planet makes my head-tails twitch!;NM33AACZER07044_.mp3
But no one truly knows if that's true. The planet is certainly uninhabited outside of Dreshdae and always has been.;NM33AACZER07045_.mp3
Who is allowed in the academy?;
Only prospective students. We get many who come here each year, hoping to get picked. Many are simply considered too weak, I'm afraid.;NM33AACZER07047_.mp3
I understand there is one main person amongst the Sith who decides which students are worthy... Yuthura Ban, I believe her name is.;NM33AACZER07048_.mp3
Where do I find this Yuthura?;
Other than in the academy itself, I'm sorry, I don't know.;NM33AACZER07050_.mp3
How can one reach the ruins on the surface?;
Czerka sends freighters to the surface every now and again to ferry artifacts to the Core.;NM33AACZER07052_.mp3
The men are not allowed out of their ships, however, as only Sith are allowed on the surface. Beyond that I really can't say.;NM33AACZER07053_.mp3
[Persuade] Can't say or don't know?;
[Success] Well... all I know is that they call the site the Valley of the Dark Lords. Apparently, there are Sith Lords of old buried in tombs there.;NM33AACZER07055_.mp3
I don't know anything else. Neither will you, I'm sure... only the Sith students are allowed access to the site.;NM33AACZER07059_.mp3
I'll be going.;
Do come again.;NM33AACZER07061_.mp3
[Failure] Does it matter? I don't intend to speak of it, regardless.;NM33AACZER07056_.mp3
[Force Persuade] It is very important that you tell me what you know.;
[Success] They... they call the site the Valley of the Dark Lords. Ancient Sith are buried in tombs there, along with many artifacts of old... some of great power, apparently.;NM33AACZER07058_.mp3
Now, was there anything else?;NM33AACZER07032_.mp3
Greetings. You've heard of that awful business on Edean, yes? Our corporate outpost there has been destroyed by the Wookiee savages.;NM33AACZER07001_.mp3
This could put back the use of Wookiee labor considerably. We may even have to abandon the planet completely.;NM33AACZER07002_.mp3
You make our freedom sound like a tragedy.;
I see you got one of your own early. May as well, while you can. Now then... was there something I could do for you?;NM33AACZER07004_.mp3
Yeah, I sure bet the Wookiees would hate to see ya go.;NM33AACZER07005_.mp3
Well, certainly. Now they are doomed to remain savages forever... or possibly become extinct. Very sad. Now then... was there something you needed?;NM33AACZER07006_.mp3
Ah, well. What can you do? Sorry... was there something you needed?;NM33AACZER07007_.mp3
If you've come for any medical supplies, I have to warn you that the kolto source on Manaan has been poisoned.;NM33AACZER07008_.mp3
It's a tragedy, considering the war and all... casualties are going to go through the roof. Czerka is pulling all its kolto out of storage as we speak.;NM33AACZER07009_.mp3
Hmm. Aren't you the human who won the swoop race on Manaan? Congradulations and well done! It was most exciting to watch!;NM33AACZER07010_.mp3
It is an honor to have you in our offices. How may Czerka serve you?;NM33AACZER07011_.mp3
Tsk. I suppose you've heard about the destruction of Taris, yes? Awful business, that. Czerka lost a fortune there, not that the Sith care.;NM33AACZER07012_.mp3
I understand you're receiving training at the monastery, citizen. Congratulations!;NM33AACZER07013_.mp3
Greetings again, citizen. Something you need?;NM33AACZER07014_.mp3
Greetings and welcome to Czerka Corporation.;NM33AACZER07015_.mp3
N-now hold on, we don't want any trouble... please?;NM18AB13CR11000_.mp3
I'm no threat. I'm just wearing their robes.;
Scared the living Force right out of me with that trick. You do that way too well. I thought our number was up for sure.;NM18AB13CR11002_.mp3
I doubt we could hold out on our own against another wave of them.;NM18AB13CR11008_.mp3
I would assume this was done by the Sand People?;
You would be right. Came out of nowhere. Wait... Damn it! Here they come again! How do they do that!;NM18AB13CR11010_.mp3
You miners are cowards. A single attack wiped you out?;
Nothing in the job description covers this. Wait... well I guess we'll see how you fare. Here they come again!;NM18AB13CR11013_.mp3
Did the company send you? It's about time they drove these animals out!;NM18AB13CR11016_.mp3
I've agreed to try and stop the Sand People attacks.;
Well you've got a lot of work ahead of you. Do you know about their enclave in the south? Don't even try to go near it.;NM18AB13CR11018_.mp3
They've taken all the Czerka weapons that were supposed to protect our sandcrawlers. That place is a fortress. A death trap.;NM18AB13CR11020_.mp3
You'll have to find some way to sneak into the place. Glad it's not my job.;NM18AB13CR11022_.mp3
Do you know anything about the Sand People?;
Just that they attack everything on sight. Well, I suppose they don't attack each other, but any outsider is as good as dead.;NM18AB13CR11024_.mp3
The company tried to arm us, and even set up remote self-powered turrets on the mining route, but...but that just made things worse.;NM18AB13CR11026_.mp3
We're not soldiers. They still kill us, and then take our weapons off our corpses. They even had the Jawas disable the turrets and set them around their enclave.;NM18AB13CR11035_.mp3
It's like a fortress now. I don't know how you're going to break through all of that. Me, I'd sneak in. Well, actually, I would just get back to Anchorhead.;NM18AB13CR11028_.mp3
The Sand People are using turrets?;
They use whatever they scavenge. They seem to hate our technology, but they love to turn it against us. That goes for blasters and turrets too, I guess.;NM18AB13CR11037_.mp3
It's not like you need to be a genius to operate them. They probably don't even bother with special settings. They just watch for people approaching and switch them on.;NM18AB13CR11038_.mp3
I have other questions about the desert.;
I don't have time for this sort of thing. I'm through with the desert. You can take your Sand People, krayt dragons, and crazy hunters.;NM18AB13CR11034_.mp3
I have to go.;
Yeah, so do we. There's no way we're repairing this thing while getting attacked over and over. The desert can have it.;NM18AB13CR11030_.mp3
Ah, the Jawas will salvage it eventually anyway. Then we can buy it back and start over. Heh. Makes sense to me.;NM18AB13CR11032_.mp3
[Leave];
They... left? Well if that don't beat all.;NM18AB13CR11005_.mp3
Who are you? Ah. It doesn't matter. Can you handle a blaster? They may attack again at any second.;NM18AB13CR11006_.mp3
Thanks for your help. I don't think we'll try holding this position for much longer. We're not soldiers.;NM18AB13CR11014_.mp3
You ain't supposed to be here! This ain't your home!;NM02AECHIL04000_.mp3
Is you one of the Sith? My daddy says the Sith are nothing but bullies. You don't look like a bully.;NM02AECHIL04002_.mp3
My Momma said I have to stay out of the Lower City. That's where bad people live.;NM02AECHIL04004_.mp3
You ever seen a swoop bike? I seen them at the races sometimes. They go fast and make lots of noise!;NM02AECHIL04006_.mp3
With the new information we can gain from the Temple, we will be able to complete our experiments!;
Only through our experiments and analysis can our people hope to regain our past.;
You're here to race, right? Okay, let's see who your sponsor is...;
Ah, you're riding for the Black Vulkars I see. Used to be nobody could challenge the Hidden Beks at this race, but now you Vulkars are the team to beat.;
Okay, you're registered now. Good luck, and try not to get yourself killed. We've only lost one rider today and we want to keep it that way. Whenever you're ready you can hit the track.;
I want to race one of my heats.;
Okay, let's get you out on the track.;
What's the time to beat?;
Well, Anglu has the best time so far: <CUSTOM30>. Good, but not the best I've ever seen. I don't know if it will stand up.;
What happened to the rider you lost?;
Same as usual - he was pushing himself beyond his limits and he hit some debris on the track. The deflectors kept him from crashing, but the force of the impact jarred him from his swoop.;
Don't worry... they scraped what was left of him off the track already. Just remember to hang on and you should be okay. You can hit the track whenever you're ready.;
I need to take care of something first.;
Okay. Just come back and see me when you're ready to hit the track.;
Well, Redros has the best time so far: <CUSTOM30> Good, but not the best I've ever seen. I don't know if it will stand up.;
Ah, you're riding for the Hidden Beks I see. Always liked them... I hope they can show these Vulkars a thing or two. But I digress.;
Back again, I see. So, are you ready to hit the track? Not literally, of course. We've already lost one rider that way today.;
Hey - didn't you just win the big swoop bike race in? Yeah, it was you, I'm sure! Best race I ever saw!;NM03AECITI09000_.mp3
I can't believe Brejik tried to back out of his wager! He deserved what happened to him!;NM03AECITI09002_.mp3
I can't wait for the big swoop race! I hear the Vulkars have a new engine that's going to break all the records!;NM03AECITI09004_.mp3
This gang war is getting out of hand! The Vulkars aren't just attacking the Hidden Beks anymore - they go after everyone!;NM03AECITI09006_.mp3
I saw Davik's new starship at the spaceport before the quarantine. They say it's the fastest ship on Taris! He calls it the Ebon Hawk.;NM03AECITI09008_.mp3
Have you got your tickets for Bendak Starkiller's return to the duel ring? I hear it's going to be an illegal death match!;NM03AECITI09010_.mp3
Did you hear the news? Gadon Thek is dead! I wonder what's going to happen to the Hidden Beks now?;NM03AECITI09012_.mp3
I heard Davik's hired a Mandalorian mercenary to work for him. I didn't know there were any of them left after the Mandalore wars.;NM03AECITI09014_.mp3
Don't go bothering people while they are drinking. It's rude.;
Scurry away. I had family on Taris and I'm not in a mood to talk.;
Trapped out here... can't do anything. I wonder which planet is next?;
Jawas... can't stand them. They never bathe, you know.;
Good thing there's nothing on Tatooine to get the attention of the Sith. Right?;
Sith... Jedi... do either of them really care when normal people get caught in their fighting?;
Don't care if we've got Sith rule or Republic rule. Either way I work the mines.;
Leave me, human. If you're here to stir things up, I want no part of it.;
You've the look of a seasoned Pazaak player about you. I dabble in it from time to time myself. Care for a game?;
Who are you?;
I am Sol'aa and, to be perfectly blunt, my business is my own. I do offer you, though, the company of my time for a game or two of Pazaak.;
Do you care for a hand?;
Sure, I'll play.;
Let's get started then.;
Not right now.;
Ah, well. Come back if you ever feel up to a game.;
Do you have any cards to sell?;
As a matter of fact, I do. If you see any you like, I am willing to part with them for a small sum.;
I haven't seen you around here before... I'm a traveller in search of a little entertainment.;
Care to have a hand of Pazaak with me?;
What's Pazaak?;
A marvelous card game indeed. It's sweeping the galaxy I've heard. While I'm no master myself, I do have some proficiency.;
I happen to have a spare deck on me. I can sell it to you for 100 credits if you want.;
Sure. Here are the credits.;
Good, good. Here is your deck. As a bonus, I'll give you a digital copy of the instructions for novice players.;
Now... want to play a hand or two?;
I don't have that much.;
That's unfortunate. If you ever find the credits, I'd be happy to sell it to you. Perhaps we could even have a hand or two if you're willing to wager something.;
I don't have a deck.;
You are truly a great Pazaak player. I don't see how I could possibly beat you.;
As a token of my appreciation for games well played, please take these cards. Perhaps it will serve you better than they did me.;
Rest assured that one day I will, though.;
Is there anything else you wish?;
I seem to have run out of funds... If you wish to play again, I could wager these cards instead.;
Do you wish to play?;
That last game was closer than it seemed. Want to try it again?;

At last we can regain our place in the galaxy! Our thanks, Revan.;
I hope that you find what you seek in the Temple, Revan, and that you help us as well.;
If you wish to know more about us, speak to our keeper of history.;
There are many unanswered questions about your last trip into the Temple, Revan... but those shall have to wait.;
The other Rakata assaulted us mercilessly... but our defenses drove them back.;
In time, I hope our tribe can unify our race once more.;
We've been ambushed by a Sith battle fleet! The Endar Spire is under attack! Hurry up - we don't have much time!;NM01AATRAS02000_.mp3
Who are you? [Left-click this answer to select highlighted response.];
"I'm Trask Ulgo, ensign with the Republic Fleet. I'm your bunk mate here on the Endar Spire. We work opposite shifts; I guess that's why you haven't seen me before.";NM01AATRAS02002_.mp3
Now hurry up, we have to find Bastila! We have to make sure she makes it off the ship alive!;NM01AATRAS02003_.mp3
Who's Bastila? [Left-click this answer to select highlighted response.];
Bastila's the commanding officer on the Endar Spire. Well, not an officer, really. But she's the one in charge of this mission.;NM01AATRAS02005_.mp3
One of our primary duties is to guarantee her survival in the event of enemy attack! You swore an oath just like everyone else on this mission. Now it's time to make good on that oath!;NM01AATRAS02007_.mp3
I've heard all about your reputation: elite combat training, tops in your class. It's no wonder you were hand picked for this mission.;NM01AATRAS02233_.mp3
Word is the officers haven't seen a recruit with your kind of potential in twenty years. But all that potential doesn't mean a thing if you can't deliver when it counts!;NM01AATRAS02234_.mp3
We're soldiers, we're trained for combat. Bastila's going to need men and women like us at her side during this attack!;NM01AATRAS02008_.mp3
Okay, let's go help Bastila!;
So hurry up and grab your gear. You need to suit up so we can get out of here.;NM01AATRAS02010_.mp3
Okay.;
Where can I get my equipment?;
You can move the mouse to the edges of the screen to rotate the camera. Alternately, moving the mouse while holding down the right mouse button will rotate the camera as well.;
To move towards the footlocker, hold down the right mouse button and face the camera towards it, then hold down the left mouse button as well to cause the character to run forward.;
You can left-click on an object to select it. Once the footlocker is selected, left-click on it again to perform the default action and open it.;
Can you repeat that?;
Oath or no oath - I'm heading to the escape pods!;
Don't be stupid! You won't stand a chance against the Sith by yourself. We've got to stick together if we want to make it out of this alive.;NM01AATRAS02012_.mp3
I heard what everyone's saying about you: you've explored the farthest reaches of the galaxy, you've visited planets I've never even heard of.;NM01AATRAS02235_.mp3
"People with your skills and abilities are hard to find; it's no wonder the Republic recruited you for this mission. But now's the time to prove yourself!";NM01AATRAS02236_.mp3
I know you're a scout and not a soldier, but Bastila needs all troops at her side during this attack!;NM01AATRAS02013_.mp3
I know all about your reputation, how you used to smuggle spice and blasters along the Corellian Run. I guess the Republic figured since they couldn't catch you, they might as well hire you.;NM01AATRAS02237_.mp3
And I'll admit, the Republic is in desperate need of someone with your kind of skills. Desperate enough to overlook your shady past.;NM01AATRAS02238_.mp3
But now that you've signed on for this mission you're part of the Republic fleet. And Bastila needs all troops at her side during this attack!;NM01AATRAS02014_.mp3
Forget it - I'm looking after my own skin! [Left-click this answer to select highlighted response.];
You swore an oath to protect Bastila when you signed up with this mission, just like everyone else in the crew! Now it's time to make good on that oath.;NM01AATRAS02016_.mp3
I know she may not have an official rank in the fleet, but she's the one in charge of this mission and it's our duty to protect her!;NM01AATRAS02017_.mp3
The Endar Spire? [Left-click this answer to select highlighted response.];
Did you fall out of your bunk and hit your head? The Endar Spire is the ship we're stationed on - this ship! You probably don't even know who I am, do you?;NM01AATRAS02019_.mp3
Come on, we have to hurry! The Sith might already be boarding the ship to try and capture Bastila.;NM01AATRAS02026_.mp3
Put your equipment on so we can get out of here.;NM01AATRAS02027_.mp3
How do I equip my items?;
Use the EQUIP screen to equip the armor and weapons from your inventory. You can access this screen by selecting the EQUIP menu icon in the upper right corner of the screen.;
Use the mouse to look through your inventory slots. The menu on the right displays items you can equip in each slot.;
Left-click the mouse to select an inventory slot, then scroll through the available items on the right and left-click to equip one.;
Okay, let's move out.;NM01AATRAS02038_.mp3
"We should stick together; you'll have more success with a party than on your own.";NM01AATRAS02241_.mp3
[TRASK has joined your party.] [Left-click this response to go to PARTY SELECTION screen.];
Because of the attack this room is in lockdown, but don't worry - I've got the override codes. You'll have to use me to unlock the door.;NM01AATRAS02039_.mp3
How do I use you to unlock the door?;
You always control the leader of the party. You can switch who is the party leader by left-clicking on their portait in the lower left corner of the screen.;
Left-click my portrait now to switch me to the party leader, then use me to open the door.;
Left-click to target the door, then left-click it again with the mouse to open it.;
Now that the door's open you better take the lead again.;NM01AATRAS02042_.mp3
[SWITCHING <FullName> BACK TO PARTY LEADER] [Left-click this response to continue.];
This is Carth Onasi - the Sith are threatening to overrun our position! We can't hold out long against their firepower! All hands to the bridge!;NM01AATRAS02057_.mp3
That was Carth contacting us on our portable communicators. He's one of the Republic's best pilots! He's seen more combat than the rest of the Endar Spire's crew put together.;NM01AATRAS02058_.mp3
If he says things are bad, you better believe it. We have to get to the bridge to help defend Bastila!;NM01AATRAS02059_.mp3
There's a map of the Endar Spire and a copy of Carth's message in your electronic journal, just in case we get separated.;NM01AATRAS02243_.mp3
Let's move out.;
How do I use my journal?;
You can access your journal, map and other important menus by clicking on the menu icons in the upper right corner of the screen.;
You can use the mouse to switch between the menus listed on the tabs at the top of the screen.;
That door's locked, and I don't have the codes to open it. You'll have to use your SECURITY skill on it if we want to get past.;NM01AATRAS02051_.mp3
How do you use security on a door?;
Target the door using the mouse. When you have selected the door, the TARGET MENU will appear. The icons on the TARGET MENU are the additional options you can use on the door.;
Look at the TARGET MENU and find the SECURITY icon. Remember, the SECURITY icon only appears if you're controlling a character with the SECURITY skill.;
Once you see it, left-click it with the mouse to use your SECURITY skill on the door.;
Tell me more about the TARGET and ACTION MENUs.;
In the lower right of the screen you'll see a list of icons. This is your ACTION MENU. You can select items from this menu by using the mouse.;
Left-click the icon you want to use to activate that power or item. Clicking on the arrows above and below the icon will cycle to other powers or items in that list.;
The first icon of the ACTION MENU is for Friendly Force Powers. The second is for Medical Items such as Medpacs and Antidote Kits.;
The third icon is for Miscellaneous Items such as Stimulants and Energy Shields. The fourth icon is for Mines, and only appears if you have a mine in your inventory and have the DEMOLITIONS skill.;
Tell me about the TARGET MENU.;
The icons in your TARGET MENU will change depending on whether your targeting circle is on a door, a container, a friendly creature or an enemy. Left-click the mouse to select a target and bring up the TARGET MENU. Left-clicking on the target again will perform the Default Action on it.;
The first icon is for combat FEATS. The second icon is for Hostile Force Powers such as Choke and Kill. The third icon is for Grenades.;
Okay, let's move on.;
How do I select icons again?;
Use the mouse to select the FEAT, power or item you want to use, then left-click to select it.;
That door's locked. I don't have the codes to open it, but switch me to the party leader so you can use my security skills to slice into the access panel and open the door.;NM01AATRAS02052_.mp3
How do I switch you to the party leader again?;
I've got a feeling that won't be our last battle with the Sith. Good thing we have medpacs to heal our wounds. It might be a good idea to use one now before our next battle.;NM01AATRAS02043_.mp3
How do I use a medpac?;
To use an item like a medpac - or another self-targetting item or power - you'll need to know how to use your ACTION MENU.;
Tell me about the ACTION MENU.;
I know about the ACTION MENU. How do I use a medpac?;
"First, left-click on their portrait to take control of the injured character. Use the mouse to look through the Medical Items in the ACTION MENU until you see ""Medpac"" in the information box.";
Notice the up and down arrows on this icon. This means you have more than one available option for this icon. You must choose between a medpac and an advanced medpac.;
Use the mouse wheel to scroll up or down to switch between your medpac and your advanced medpac. Left-click the mouse to use the selected item on the character you currently control.;
Just remember that you have to actually be hurt for a medpac to work. You can't use it when you're uninjured.;
The bridge is just beyond that door. You better equip your melee weapon. There isn't much room on the bridge, and it's suicide to use a blaster in close quarters.;NM01AATRAS02077_.mp3
I should equip a melee weapon, too. Either that, or I'll have to stay back and use my blaster.;NM01AATRAS02276_.mp3
What if they have lightsabers?;
Your melee weapon is made using a cortosis weave. It's strong enough to stand up against anything, even a lightsaber.;NM01AATRAS02078_.mp3
We'll be fighting in close quarters on the bridge. You better equip a melee weapon before we go through that door.;NM01AATRAS02083_.mp3
Bastila's not here on the bridge - they must have retreated to the escape pods! We better head that way too.;NM01AATRAS02095_.mp3
The Sith want Bastila alive, but once she's off the ship there's nothing stopping them from blasting the Endar Spire into galactic dust!;NM01AATRAS02277_.mp3
We have to get to the bridge.;NM01AATRAS02060_.mp3

Oh... hello there. Uh... what can I do for you? Would you like to see my inventory? That is why you're here isn't it? At least, I hope so.;NM02ACKEBL04000_.mp3
Let me see your inventory.;
Of course, of course. Right away.;NM02ACKEBL04002_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;
Questions? Oh, I... I don't know anything. Nothing you Sith would find interesting, anyway. I'm just a simple shopkeeper.;NM02ACKEBL04005_.mp3
I'll be going now.;
Oh, good. I mean, goodbye. Please come back whenever... uh... whenever you want, I guess.;NM02ACKEBL04007_.mp3
Hello there. I haven't seen you in my shop before... allow me to introduce myself. My name is Kebla Yurt. Welcome to the Equipment Emporium.;NM02ACKEBL04009_.mp3
You looking to buy some supplies? My shop's the largest one in all of Upper Taris. Best selection on the planet. Whatever you need, I've got. Well, mostly.;NM02ACKEBL04011_.mp3
Mostly? What do you mean by that?;NM02ACKEBL04070_.mp3
The Sith confiscated all my heavy weapons. And they impounded all my ships and swoop bikes. But I've still got a real nice selection, if you're interested.;NM02ACKEBL04013_.mp3
Let me see what you've got for sale.;
Ah, just so you know, the prices on the items are final - no bargaining here. This isn't a swap meet, ok? I only deal in top notch stuff.;NM02ACKEBL04015_.mp3
Because of the Sith quarantine I haven't been able to stock any new inventory, but I've still got some nice items you might be interested in.;NM02ACKEBL04017_.mp3
Hey, I know you! You're the Mysterious Stranger, right? Everybody's saying you're going to fight Bendak Starkiller in an illegal death match!;NM02ACKEBL04056_.mp3
You know Bendak's never lost a match in his life, right? You need to take a look at my weapons and armor.;NM02ACKEBL04058_.mp3
Hey, look who's back - the Mysterious Stranger! You know, I had a front row seat when you gunned down Bendak Starkiller. Best duel I've ever seen!;NM02ACKEBL04059_.mp3
If times weren't so tough I'd give you a discount, seeing as how you're a big celebrity and all. But with the Sith occupation I can barely afford to keep the doors open.;NM02ACKEBL04061_.mp3
Hey, look at this - a real live celebrity right here in my shop! Winning that swoop bike race has made you into something of a local hero.;NM02ACKEBL04062_.mp3
Hello, again. If you're interested in buying any of my equipment I'd suggest you do it now, because you might not get a chance later on.;NM02ACKEBL04064_.mp3
What are you talking about?;
Word on the street is somebody broke into the military compound. I bet they start closing down every business in Upper Taris until they find the culprit.;NM02ACKEBL04066_.mp3
But until they shut me down I'm still open for business. So what do you say - you want to see what I have in stock?;NM02ACKEBL04068_.mp3
Welcome to the Equipment Emporium - finest selection of supplies in all of Taris. You interested in seeing what I have in stock?;NM02ACKEBL04069_.mp3
So the spineless worm actually made it through the tomb? I'm impressed.;NM37AASHAA05000_.mp3
Shaardan? What do you want?;
Isn't it obvious? I've been hoping that someone would do the dirty work in retrieving the sword of Ajunta Pall for some time. It's been quite a wait.;NM37AASHAA05002_.mp3
You wouldn't have considered, oh, I don't know... getting it yourself?;NM37AASHAA05004_.mp3
Hmph. Typical. Always ready to jump at what they perceive to be the easier path.;NM37AASHAA05006_.mp3
Warning: Touch the master's blade and lose an arm, meatbag.;NM37AASHAA05008_.mp3
Now that you have it, I just thought I'd relieve you of it. It must be quite a burden, after all.;NM37AASHAA05010_.mp3
You're not taking anything from me.;
Impressive bravado, I'm sure. Do you honestly think I would let an opportunity to impress Master Uthar pass me by so easily?;NM37AASHAA05036_.mp3
Especially not for a pathetic excuse for a Sith like yourself. Hand over the sword, worm. You know I'm the superior, here.;NM37AASHAA05014_.mp3
And if I don't?;
Isn't it obvious? You die. Rule of the Sith: only the strong and cunning shall survive. You won't be missed, trust me... now hand it over.;NM37AASHAA05017_.mp3
What are you going to give me for it?;
This isn't a negotiation. As much as I dislike ultimatums, I am afraid I must stoop. Hand over the sword or die.;NM37AASHAA05019_.mp3
You'll take it over my dead body.;
I've been looking forward to this.;NM37AASHAA05021_.mp3
Need to do things the hard way, hey? Fine by me.;NM37AASHAA05033_.mp3
Just let me get it out...;
Fine. No tricks, though... I'm watching you.;NM37AASHAA05025_.mp3
[give him the Notched Steel Sword];
Smart move. You're obviously more pathetic that I could have even imagined. Thanks for the sword... worm.;NM37AASHAA05027_.mp3
See? I knew you and I could work this out. I imagine I'll be rewarded well for this. You'll do fine, I'm sure... another time.;NM37AASHAA05029_.mp3
[give him the Silver Lined Sword];
[give him the Vibro Blade];
I've changed my mind. You're not getting it.;
I may like you well enough, but being a Sith is all about taking chances when the moment is right. So make it easier on both of us... hand over the sword.;NM37AASHAA05015_.mp3
I'm not giving it to you.;
No, I think I'll manage with it just fine. Kind of you to offer, though.;
Oh, but I insist. I'm not about to let a chance to impress Master Uthar pass me by.;NM37AASHAA05012_.mp3
[Persuade/Lie] I don't know what you're talking about. What sword?;
[Failure] Nice try. I may not know what the sword looks like, but I'm no gullible fool. I'm not about to pass up a chance to impress Master Uthar.;NM37AASHAA05039_.mp3
Who are you?;
The name's Shaardan. I've been watching this tomb for a while, hoping someone would do the dirty work in finding the sword of Ajunta Pall.;NM37AASHAA05042_.mp3
I saw you come in here and I rather figured you'd make it all the way to the sarcophagus. Good to see I wasn't wrong.;NM37AASHAA05044_.mp3
As Arbiter of the Sunry murder trial you have the authority to question me on matters pertaining to this case.;
I have questions about the trial.;
You have the right, Arbiter, to ask me questions regarding the case.;
What do you think of Sunry?;
Sunry is known to us as a hero of the Republic in your perpetual conflicts with the Sith Empire.;
While he may have been severely injured in the line of duty, I personally hold him in quite high regard.;
Speaking of that injury, has it been taken into consideration, your honor?;NM26AASELJ17008_.mp3
In no way does his disability hamper him, though. Rest assured that my personal regard for Sunry will not affect my judgment. While emotion may rule your Senate, the cold hard hand of the law rules here on Manaan.;
Is there anything else you wished to ask me, human?;
Is there anything suspicious about this case?;
Yes, there is something that has been bothering me: the medal that was found clutched in the Sith's hand.;
I find it most odd that such a blatantly incriminating piece of evidence would be left at the scene of the crime.;
We have analyzed the evidence and it does not appear to be a replica, but I still have my doubts.;
In the midst of the crime, though, Sunry could well have lost it. I have seen much more improbable things happen in my tenure to the courts.;
Hmmm. Simply because it was real does not mean Sunry would have overlooked it being in Elassa's hand.;NM26AASELJ17024_.mp3
Is there another matter you wish to inquire about, human?;
What do you think of the Republic and the Sith Empire?;
The governing bodies of both states seek to keep an amicable relationship with our world in order to facilitate the exporting of kolto.;
I do not delude myself into thinking that either of your states holds any great love for us, but we are necessary so you will let us hold our autonomy.;
I try not to concern myself with intragalactic policy. I find it stretches the letter of the law too much for my tastes.;
Is there something else that concerns you, human?;
I want to ask you something else.;
What is it you wish to ask?;
How did you know I was from the Republic?;
Your ship registry is originally from the Republic world of Transel. Therefore you are a Republic citizen.;
Or are you saying you STOLE your ship?;
No, no... perfectly legitimate.;
I see. Is there more you need?;
I would like to investigate the murder case involving Sunry.;
That is acceptable, I believe. In Manaan legal tradition the defendant can have an Arbiter who tries to prove his innocence in court.;
This Arbiter is a neutral party that can investigate and present evidence in the trial, and argue on the defendant's behalf. As you are a Jedi, I believe you could fulfill this role adequately.;
I suppose you're Sunry's only hope. We have to at least try to help him.;NM26AASELJ17060_.mp3
So be it! You are now appointed Arbiter in the case of Sunry vs. The Sith Empire. Your name and position have been recorded in our files.;
I will now inform you of the pertinent facts in this case. You have a limited amount of time in which to investigate and organize a defense of your client, and I advise you to use it wisely.;
Sunry was seen leaving a hotel, leaving behind a dead Sith woman - Elassa Huros. He has been charged with murder and is being held in the Ahto City prison facilities. Due to his crippled status he is being kept in a solitary holding cell.;
Witnesses claimed to have seen the killing and are being detained at the hotel in question pending the trial. The manager of the hotel has now been informed of your appointment.;
Elassa was found dead of a blaster wound with an incriminating Republic medal clutched in her hand. This information has been uploaded to your datapad. It would be wise to review all information before the trial starts.;
You may question Sunry or the witnesses. The evidence in this case is heavily stacked against Mr. Sunry. I believe it will take some doing to absolve him of guilt.;
Yes... but it almost seems too heavily stacked, doesn't it? Very suspicious.;NM26AASELJ17078_.mp3
You may also interview the judges here, including myself, to get an idea of the pertinent factors in this case.;
"Since this is also your first case, and you are an off-worlder, I feel compelled to add ""good luck"" as my final missive.";
Jedi are renowned for being arbiters in times of need. We will investigate this matter as best we are able.;NM26AASELJ17062_.mp3
We'll do our best. You can count on that.;NM26AASELJ17064_.mp3
Is there a Star Map on this world?;
A Star Map? Hm... not precisely... but Manaan holds many wonderous and exciting locales and treasures, kolto not the least of them.;
Our many shops and boulevards cater to the whim of any species and provide a vibrant night-life that has to be seen to be believed.;
This and other tourist paraphenalia can be had from your local embassy... So do not waste my time with it.;
What do you know about the young Selkath who have been going missing?;
The court is unaware of any missing beings reports. Should any substantial evidence come up in regards to such a disappearance, you should file it with us and an investigation will be launched.;
Is there anything else you require?;
I have no more questions, your honor.;
Then go and enjoy Ahto City. And do not break any laws that we would have to lock you up for.;
I have no more questions for now.;
Very well. When you feel you have gathered enough evidence, you may speak to the warden in charge of the prison where Sunry is being held. He will bring Sunry to us and the trial will commence.;
Well, speaking of that injury... does that not make it seem unlikely that he killed anyone?;NM26AASELJ17010_.mp3
Your task with the courts has been completed, human. You have fulfilled your role as Arbiter to the satisfaction of this court.;
Should you have any other grievances you wish to present, give them to the judge on duty at that time.;
While we are not free to discuss the... incident, we remember your involvement in it quite well.;
What is it you wish to bring to my attention?;
The Selkath people thank you for exposing the Sith plots here on Manaan. When our leaders decide a fitting punishment, they will certainly know our displeasure.;
If there is anything else you wish to bring to my attention, you have my permission to ask.;
I am Judge Shelkar acting on behalf of the Selkath government of Manaan. It is my task today to answer the needs of off-world citizens of both the Republic and the Sith Empire.;
If you have legitimate grievances with another party then you should speak to me. You should first, however, consult with the Republic Embassy before pressing formal charges.;
Is there something you wish to bring to my attention?;
Just move along. There's nothing to see here.;NM02ADSITH10000_.mp3
Hey, we don't need any reinforcements. All we're doing is searching for some missing Sith uniforms.;NM02ADSITH10037_.mp3
What do you want, civilian? Do you have any information about the missing Sith uniforms? Make it quick!;NM02ADSITH10044_.mp3
Forgive me for the intrusion, human. My name is Senni Vek. I believe you dropped this datapad and I wish to return it to you.;
I didn't drop anything.;
I'm certain you did, human. Please, take the datapad. It's yours, I'm sure.;
Uh... thanks.;
My pleasure, human. You should examine it to make sure it is not broken.;
Goodbye, human.;
What is this, some kind of con game?;
No, this is no game. I simply saw you drop this datapad and I wish to give it back to you.;
I'm sorry, there must be some mistake.;
There is no mistake, human. This datapad is yours and yours alone. Please, take it.;
I don't want it.;
Are you certain, human? Please, take the datapad.;
Fine. Give me the stupid datapad!;
No. It's not mine. I won't take it.;
Very well, human. I will keep the datapad and I will leave. Goodbye, human.;
I'll beat you to death with that datapad if you don't go away right now!;
I saw you in the swoop race. Very impressive. You seem like you know how to get results. That's just the kind of person I'm looking for.;NM03AECAND06000_.mp3
Who are you?;
"My name's Canderous Ordo. I work for Davik Kang and the Exchange; the hours aren't great, but they promised me a fortune to work for them and I have nothing better to do. Mandalorian mercs like me are in high demand.";NM03AECAND06002_.mp3
But lately Davik hasn't been paying me what he promised. I don't like getting cheated, so I figure it's time for me to break the Sith quarantine and get off this backwater planet.;NM03AECAND06004_.mp3
How do you plan to do that?;
I've got a plan to escape Taris, but I can't do it alone. I need someone I know can get the job done to help me. That's where you come in.;NM03AECAND06006_.mp3
Careful. Mercs like this haven't a lick of conscience... they'll betray you in a heartbeat. This could be a trap.;NM03AECAND06008_.mp3
I ain't talking to you. I'm talking to your friend, aren't I?;NM03AECAND06010_.mp3
I saw you win that swoop race, and I started thinking. Anyone crazy enough to race like that is probably crazy enough to break into the Sith military base.;NM03AECAND06014_.mp3
See, I put two and two together and I figured out you're the person who stole the Sith departure codes for Taris. So you're exactly the person I'm looking for.;NM03AECAND06016_.mp3
What kind of deal are you proposing?;
I've got a plan to get inside Davik's base and steal his ship, the Ebon Hawk. If any ship is fast enough to break the Sith quarantine, it's that one.;NM03AECAND06018_.mp3
But the ship alone won't get me off this rock. Without the proper launch codes the automated defense guns of the Sith fleet will disintegrate me as soon as I leave the atmosphere.;NM03AECAND06020_.mp3
So here's the deal: we join up together. You've got the codes, and I'll get us to Davik's ship. What do you say? Do we have a deal? We can go right now.;NM03AECAND06022_.mp3
I have a few things to take care of first.;
Fair enough. But don't take too long. As soon as you're ready to get inside Davik's estate, come speak to me. The sooner we get off this rock the better.;NM03AECAND06024_.mp3
Okay, let's join up. But how are we going to get me inside Davik's estate?;
Davik's always looking to recruit new talent. I'll tell him how you won that swoop race and mention that you're interested in working for the Exchange.;NM03AECAND06027_.mp3
I'll say I brought you in so he could check you out. He'll have you stay at his estate for a couple days while he runs some background checks on you - that's standard procedure.;NM03AECAND06029_.mp3
This is too risky. We should find another way.;NM03AECAND06031_.mp3
You got another plan, sister? Or are you just objecting 'cause you didn't think of it?;NM03AECAND06033_.mp3
No, I... don't have another plan. I would rather not place my life in your hands, however.;NM03AECAND06035_.mp3
I can say the same about you. That makes us even. Fortunately we both want to get off this rock, right?;NM03AECAND06037_.mp3
While Davik's checking you out, we steal the Ebon Hawk and escape Taris. Come on - I've got an air speeder nearby to take us to Davik's estate. The sooner we're off Taris the better!;NM03AECAND06041_.mp3
[CANDEROUS has joined your party.] [Canderous has a special cybernetic implant that regenerates minor wounds.] [Left-click this response to go to PARTY SELECTION screen.];
That's... not a bad plan. It might just work.;NM03AECAND06039_.mp3
Forget it - I don't trust you!;
Look, I don't like working with strangers either but we don't have much choice. I can provide the ship, you can get me those codes. We need each other.;NM03AECAND06056_.mp3
I don't sense any deception from him, which is surprising. This may be exactly what we need.;NM03AECAND06058_.mp3
Sooner or later you'll figure this out. Either we work together, or we both stay stuck here on Taris. Come back and speak to me again when you come to your senses.;NM03AECAND06081_.mp3
Hmm. Much as I hate to say it, he's...he's probably right. We're going to need that ship.;NM03AECAND06060_.mp3
Sorry, not interested.;
Damn, you're stubborn! We both want off the planet, but neither one of us can pull it off alone! Bring me the launch codes and we'll both get what we want.;NM03AECAND06068_.mp3
How am I supposed to get inside the military base?;
Getting in won't be easy: the Sith base is protected by an encrypted security system. It would take a top of the line astromech droid to slice through it.;NM03AECAND06050_.mp3
But that little T3 unit you got from Janice should be good enough to get the job done.;NM03AECAND06052_.mp3
Why don't you do this yourself?;
Normally I'd do this myself, but everyone knows who I work for. If I broke into the Sith base, they'd send an army down on Davik's estate to get those codes back. That's why I need you.;NM02AECAND30099_.mp3
Okay, Canderous - I'll bring you those codes.;
Glad to hear it. I'll be waiting right here.;NM03AECAND06088_.mp3
Lucky for you I know just the place to get a droid like that. Davik was having one custom built by Janice Nall.;NM03AECAND06053_.mp3
Just tell her Canderous sent you and she'll sell you the droid. Then you can use it to get the launch codes from the Sith base.;NM02AECAND30095_.mp3
Won't Davik be mad if I take his droid?;
Davik paid for the droid, but I'm the guy he put in charge of this mission. He won't care how I come up with those codes.;NM02AECAND30098_.mp3
I'll be back when I get those codes from the military base.;
Good luck - you're going to need it. The entrance to the base is sealed up tight.;NM03AECAND06065_.mp3
Why would I want to help you?;
I need someone to steal the Sith launch codes from the base. Without those codes any ship leaving the atmosphere will be disintegrated by the Sith fleet's automated defense guns.;NM03AECAND06044_.mp3
What's in this for me?;
Here's the deal: you bring me those launch codes and I can provide the vehicle to get off the planet - Davik's flagship, the Ebon Hawk!;NM03AECAND06046_.mp3
How are you going to manage that?;
Uh-uh. Not yet. First, you bring me the launch codes. Then I'll tell you the rest of my plan.;NM03AECAND06048_.mp3
Why should I help you?;
You don't need to ally yourself with this... person. We should move on while we can.;NM03AECAND06012_.mp3
Why are you telling me this?;
What are you talking about?;
Goodbye.;
Hold on just a second. Believe me, you'll want to hear this.;NM03AECAND06073_.mp3
I figured you'd be back. Neither one of us is getting off this planet unless we work together.;NM03AECAND06075_.mp3
Now, I know the Sith military base had a break in. I know it was you. I know you've got those departure codes I need.;NM03AECAND06077_.mp3
So what do you say? We join forces and I can get you inside Davik's base - and right to the Ebon Hawk. We can go right now.;NM03AECAND06079_.mp3
Sorry, I'm not interested.;
Forget it, I don't trust you.;
But we've got a small problem. I haven't heard about anyone breaking into the miliarty base yet, so I know you don't have those departure codes.;NM03AECAND06084_.mp3
If you want me to help you, you've got to bring something to the table. So until you get those codes we really don't have much to talk about.;NM03AECAND06086_.mp3
I'll be back when I get those codes.;
How am I supposed to get inside the military base, again?;
Hey, Stranger! Mysterious Stranger! Wow, look at you... a Jedi! Heh. No wonder I could never beat you. It's me - Duncan. Deadeye Duncan. From the dueling arena on Taris. Remember?;NM26ADDUNC07000_.mp3
Deadeye Duncan. I remember.;
I'm glad to see you made it off of Taris alive... things were pretty bad when the Sith started their bombardment. But I guess getting off the planet would be easy for a Jedi, huh?;NM26ADDUNC07002_.mp3
Well, there were a handful of us who made it out. The lucky ones. I survived by breaking into the military base, overpowering a dozen Sith soldiers and stealing one of their own ships.;NM26ADDUNC07004_.mp3
You overpowered a dozen Sith?;
Well... when the bombing started the Sith sent down a bunch of auto-piloted ships to evacuate soldiers from the planet. I saw one and I figured it was a rescue ship, so I ran up to it.;NM26ADDUNC07006_.mp3
A Sith patrol was approaching from the other side, getting ready to board. When they saw me they all pulled their blasters. But it takes more than a dozen armed Sith soldiers to slow me down!;NM26ADDUNC07007_.mp3
You were pretty easy to slow down inside the dueling ring.;
Well, to tell the truth I didn't actually take the Sith out. A building fell on them. A chunk of building, actually. From the bombing. Crushed the whole bunch of them. Heh. Very messy.;NM26ADDUNC07010_.mp3
So there I was, all alone and standing by this empty evacuation ship. I climbed on board, overrode the auto-pilot controls and lifted off into orbit.;NM26ADDUNC07011_.mp3
The ship had all the Sith launch codes programmed in, so I didn't have to worry about being blasted from the sky. I just played it cool and tried to fly casual.;NM26ADDUNC07012_.mp3
In the confusion of the bombing, nobody paid any attention to my one little ship slipping away from the fleet. Once I was out of scanner range, I knew I was home free.;NM26ADDUNC07013_.mp3
So what are you doing here?;
"I've decided to become a mercenary. I came here looking for work; I heard the Republic was hiring. But they weren't interested in me. I guess I made a mistake by telling them who I was.";NM26ADDUNC07015_.mp3
They'd heard of me. Seems like everybody's heard of me. The legend of Deadeye Duncan, the worst duelist of all time, has spread far and wide across the galaxy. Makes it hard to earn a living, you know.;NM26ADDUNC07016_.mp3
Why is the Republic hiring mercenaries?;
I have no idea. All I know is that if I don't find some way to shake my reputation soon I'm going to have to find another line of work. It's too bad... hey, wait a minute!;NM26ADDUNC07018_.mp3
You're a Jedi now, so you probably won't be doing much dueling anymore, right? So the name Mysterious Stranger probably won't be much use to you anymore, right? So, uh... could I have it?;NM26ADDUNC07019_.mp3
I mean, if everyone's heard of Deadeye Duncan then they've probably heard of the Mysterious Stranger. But nobody knows anything about you except the name. You could be anybody: man, woman... me.;NM26ADDUNC07020_.mp3
You want to tell them you're the champion?;
If I say I'm the Mysterious Stranger, who's going to know? There'll be celebrity tours, maybe some endorsements... I could milk this thing for months. Well, right up until people see me fight.;NM26ADDUNC07022_.mp3
What do you say? Fame, celebrity: you don't need that. You're a Jedi! But I'm just a guy trying to earn a living. Come one, give me a break.;NM26ADDUNC07023_.mp3
Okay, the name is yours.;
Really? You mean it? Oh, this is great! Heh! No more jokes, no more snickering! When I tell people I'm the Mysterious Stranger they'll finally treat me with respect.;NM26ADDUNC07025_.mp3
Thanks a lot, Stranger. Oops, heh. I guess I shouldn't call you that now. People will think I'm talking to myself. Ha-ha!;NM26ADDUNC07026_.mp3
Anyway, I should be going. I'm heading off planet to look for work. Shouldn't be too hard, now that I'm the Taris duel champion! It was good seeing you again... and thanks.;NM26ADDUNC07027_.mp3
No, you can't take my credit.;
Eh, just forget I ever mentioned it. It was a dumb idea. I'll figure something out on my own.;NM26ADDUNC07029_.mp3
I probably should be going now, anyway. I'm heading off planet. Maybe I can find work somewhere else. Somewhere they've never heard of Deadeye Duncan. Goodbye, Stranger.;NM26ADDUNC07030_.mp3
If I ever find out you're impersonating me, I'll slice you open!;
Okay, okay. Settle down. No need to get violent. We're not in the duel ring right now.;NM26ADDUNC07032_.mp3
You'll never pull this off.;
So what are you going to do now?;
Great story. Goodbye.;
Oh, right. Okay. Goodbye then. I was just heading off planet anyway. Good to see you again, Stranger.;NM26ADDUNC07038_.mp3
Good, I'm happy for you. Goodbye.;
Do you expect me to believe this?;
Yeah, right. Why don't you tell me what really happened.;
How did you escape Taris?;
You fast, you quick. You even beat Twitch.;
Ready Aim Fire!! Is your trigger finger as itchy as mine?;
What the hell are you talking about?;
Shoot first! Shoot last! Party with me, we'll have a blast!;
Uh... okay. Goodbye then.;
Blast away! Open fire! Shoot, kill, maim!;
Are you completely insane?;
You here with Selkath? You have questions for Gluupor? Gluupor already say everything he knows.;NM26ACGLUU03000_.mp3
I have questions about the murder of Elassa.;
Gluupor already tell you everything, why you bother Gluupor more... Gluupor not answering any more question for you!;NM26ACGLUU03002_.mp3
Gluupor tell everything to Selkath. You not know? Gluupor have no reason not to say. Gluupor tell everything. Everything about murder, everything about Sith lady's room.;NM26ACGLUU03004_.mp3
Why were you at the hotel?;
Gluupor staying at hotel. Gluupor not very rich - hotel much too rich for Gluupor to live at - but Gluupor save for weeks and have enough to stay here for a few days.;NM26ACGLUU03006_.mp3
Using Gluupor's chance to live better for a while.;NM26ACGLUU03008_.mp3
What did you see?;
Gluupor not see murder, oh no. Gluupor did see Republic guy... the cripple... Sunry his name, Gluupor thinks. Gluupor see Sunry running away from scene of crime.;NM26ACGLUU03010_.mp3
Gluupor see nothing else. Nothing else at all. Especially not in Sith lady's room!;NM26ACGLUU03012_.mp3
What about Elassa's room?;
Gluupor just curious... just curious to see what had happened. Gluupor have no reason to go into room... no one pay Gluupor to do it.;NM26ACGLUU03014_.mp3
[Persuade] Did someone pay you to do something in that room Gluupor?;
[Success] How you know someone pay Gluupor?!;NM26ACGLUU03016_.mp3
Well... Sith man came up to Gluupor after murder, before Selkath arrive. He say he give Gluupor good money if Gluupor put medal into Sith's hand.;NM26ACGLUU03018_.mp3
Gluupor good. Gluupor plant evidence and leave no trace. But Gluupor not recognize Sith man anyway. Gluupor not recognize humans very well.;NM26ACGLUU03020_.mp3
No use to Selkath, so not bother to tell them. Well, that, and the Sith man say he kill Gluupor if Gluupor speaks. Uh... Oh, no...;NM26ACGLUU03022_.mp3
Gluupor think... Gluupor think he can't talk more right now. Gluupor feels the need to lie down... maybe just stay here...;NM26ACGLUU03024_.mp3
[Failure] No one pay Gluupor to do anything... that why Gluupor so poor...;NM26ACGLUU03026_.mp3
[Persuade] How about if I give you 100 credits to tell me?;
[Failure] Gluupor not saying anything... Gluupor have nothing to say.;NM26ACGLUU03028_.mp3
[Force Persuade] You want to tell me who paid you and for what.;
[Success] Gluupor want to tell you. Gluupor want to tell you Sith paid him money to plant medal on body.;NM26ACGLUU03030_.mp3
Gluupor want to tell you this because you are Gluupor's friend. Good friend... maybe give Gluupor money? Maybe not...;NM26ACGLUU03032_.mp3
Do you know about a Star Map?;
Gluupor not know what you talking about. But then again, Gluupor not very bright.;NM26ACGLUU03034_.mp3
Do you know about the Selkath youths who have gone missing?;
Gluupor heard of it, yes. But Gluupor been locked in this room for days. Gluupor think it rather poor insight to think he knows something.;NM26ACGLUU03036_.mp3
I'll ask more questions later.;
Gluupor answer later too, then. Selkath not let Gluupor leave while trial still on...;NM26ACGLUU03038_.mp3
Why you back, human? Gluupor already tell you everything. Why you not leave Gluupor alone?;NM26ACGLUU03040_.mp3
Have you heard the news? They say the Sith slaughtered a secret Jedi oupost on Dantooine in a vile and cowardly sneak attack.;
Yet despite this monstrous act, the Selkath authorities insist on maintaining their neutrality - and the Sith walk amongst us like vermin in the streets of Ahto City!;
But my feelings about the Sith are well known around Ahto City. I shall spare you further outbursts. What may I do for you?;
Let me see what you have in stock.;
As you wish, human. My inventory contains the finest Aratech equipment you can find on Manaan - all of it far superior to the Czerka Corp swill the Sith are so fond of.;
I think I'll be going now.;
As you wish, human. Please return when you have need of anything from my vast inventory.;
Come in, come in! You honor my humble store with your presence. All of Manaan has heard tell of your glorious swoop riding exploits.;
I carry many other choice items of the highest quality. Items a celebrity of your stature might be interested in.;
Do you know about the Sunry case?;
Unfortunately, I cannot offer any great insight into this matter. I suggest you investigate the murder scene, or perhaps talk to the other residents of the hotel where the crime occured.;
Welcome, welcome. This is a great time to be alive, as the Czerka Corp. has been driven from one of its outposts.;
"They lost their ""trading"" outpost on Kashyyyk - merely a slaver's den I've been told. News of this sort is welcome indeed to me. What can I do for you today?";
I have heard from several customers that you are now the Arbiter during the murder trial of Sunry, the Republic war hero.;
I admire you for accepting this position. I have no doubt Sunry has been framed by the Sith. If there is anything I can do to aid your investigation, I will be happy to help.;
Greetings, human. I welcome you to my store. But if you have come seeking med kits, I must apologize for the price in advance.;
The Selkath say the kolto harvest is the lowest it has ever been, and healing salves have become extremely expensive.;
Why do you dislike the Sith so much?;
How can you ask such a question? They are cruel and ruthless, and care nothing for the welfare of others. And the Sith regard my species with particular disdain.;
The Selkath now seem more distant than before... They treat members of the Republic at arms length only... I hope this does not negatively impact our trade.;
If they give too much deference to the Sith, then the monsters will simply come in and take over!;
It is a most terrible day when such violence happens in a peaceful city such as this. The Sith Embassy... attacked... Terrible!;
I only hope that this is not the worst to befall them...;
Greetings, friend. I bid you a warm welcome to Tyvark's shop. My store is here to serve everyone - except the Sith who walk the city like roaches!;
[The Mandalorian is imprisoned and cannot respond.];
Forgive me for the intrusion, human. My name is Senni Vek. I believe you dropped this datapad and I wish to return it to you.;
I didn't drop anything.;
I'm certain you did, human. Please, take the datapad. It's yours, I'm sure.;
Uh... thanks.;
My pleasure, human. You should examine it to make sure it is not broken.;
Goodbye, human.;
What is this, some kind of con game?;
No, this is no game. I simply saw you drop this datapad and I wish to give it back to you.;
I'm sorry, there must be some mistake.;
There is no mistake, human. This datapad is yours and yours alone. Please, take it.;
I don't want it.;
Are you certain, human? Please, take the datapad.;
Fine. Give me the stupid datapad!;
No. It's not mine. I won't take it.;
Very well, human. I will keep the datapad and I will leave. Goodbye, human.;
I'll beat you to death with that datapad if you don't go away right now!;
I saw you talking with Rukil. He told you his legends about the Promised Land, didn't he? He told you all about his missing apprentice and the other lost explorers, right?;NM04AAIGEA07000_.mp3
You know, most people don't believe his stories - they figure he's nothing but an old kook. But I think there might be some truth in what he's saying. That's why I want to stop him!;NM04AAIGEA07002_.mp3
Stop him? What are you talking about?;
For an Outcast, I've got things pretty good. The village relies on me to bring in food and supplies - I'm an important man. If it wasn't for Gendar I'd be running this place.;NM04AAIGEA07004_.mp3
I get the feeling if it wasn't for Gendar, this place would be a lot worse off than it is.;NM04AAIGEA07074_.mp3
But if Rukil ever finds his Promised Land, I'm sunk. People won't need to rely on me anymore. I'll just be another nobody like all the rest of the villagers. I won't let that happen!;NM04AAIGEA07006_.mp3
That's horrible! How can you be so self-centered?;
Don't judge me! I learned a long time ago that if I want to survive down here I've got to look out for number one.;NM04AAIGEA07008_.mp3
The two explorers who went searching for the Promised Land might have found something. They might have found clues or evidence - just like Rukil's apprentice!;NM04AAIGEA07011_.mp3
They would have recorded that information in their journals. I'll pay you if you bring all three journals to me - the two from the explorers and the one from Rukil's apprentice.;NM04AAIGEA07013_.mp3
Then I can destroy the evidence and make sure nobody ever finds the Promised Land! I've saved up enough credits from my business here to make it worth your while if you help me.;NM04AAIGEA07015_.mp3
Forget it! I won't betray Rukil and the village for you.;
Don't be a fool. I'm the only one here who can pay you for those journals. Rukil has nothing - he won't be able to come up with any kind of reward.;NM04AAIGEA07017_.mp3
Once you have all three journals just bring them to me and I'll give you a decent reward. Now, was there something else you needed?;NM04AAIGEA07020_.mp3
I have those journals you wanted.;
I knew Rukil's legends about the Promised Land were true! Quick - give me those journals so I can destroy them!;NM04AAIGEA07060_.mp3
First hand over those credits you promised.;
"Right - your reward. Here's 100 credits; that's a pretty hefty payment for some old notes and maps, eh?";NM04AAIGEA07062_.mp3
100 credits sounds fair. Here's the journals.;
Excellent - now Rukil will never lead these people to the Promised Land! Now, is there something else you need? You want to look at my inventory?;NM04AAIGEA07064_.mp3
False prophet! Deceiver! You have betrayed me! You have sold the hope of the entire village to the selfish and damnable Igear!;NM04AARUKI25000_.mp3
All I have worked for is destroyed! All the hopes and dreams of my father and grandfather before him turned to dust! Begone, up-worlder - I have only curses to speak at you!;NM04AARUKI25002_.mp3
[Persuade] 100 credits? After all I went through? I want double that!;
[Success] Well, I don't want Rukil to get his hands on them journals. I'll give you 200 credits - that's all I have.;NM04AAIGEA07066_.mp3
200 credits? It's a deal!;
I've changed my mind. I'm going to give them to Rukil.;
Fine - go to Rukil! But he won't be able to pay you anything for those journals. Come back and see me when you're ready to stop acting crazy and you want to cut a deal.;NM04AAIGEA07072_.mp3
[Failure] I don't think you understand how much 100 credits is worth down here in the Undercity. This is a small fortune!;NM04AAIGEA07068_.mp3
I want those journals, but I'm not rich like you up-worlders. 100 credits is all I can afford.;NM04AAIGEA07070_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;
Oh, you better ask Gendar - he's the spokesman for the village. I just run the store. I don't want to make him mad by answering any questions. Gendar already doesn't like me.;NM04AAIGEA07037_.mp3
Why doesn't Gendar like you?;
Gendar seems to think I should share the profits of my store with the whole village. He figures we're all in this together so it should be share and share alike.;NM04AAIGEA07039_.mp3
But I'm the one who runs the store! I'm the one who makes the deals! The others just bring me salvage to trade with the up-worlders - why should they get anything?;NM04AAIGEA07041_.mp3
That's a pretty selfish attitude.;
Hey, you don't know what it's like down here! I have to claw and scrape to survive - nobody else will look out for me. But Gendar doesn't agree with my philosophy.;NM04AAIGEA07043_.mp3
He caught me hoarding supplies a while back. I figured I'd wait until food was scarce and then I could offer it to people who'd follow me instead of Gendar. Then I'd be the leader!;NM04AAIGEA07049_.mp3
But Gendar made me share my hoard. Ever since then he hasn't trusted me. He keeps me around because of my store, though. Without it this village wouldn't stand a chance.;NM04AAIGEA07051_.mp3
How do you manage to run a store here in the Undercity?;
If a villager comes across any useful salvage in the Undercity they bring it to me. Every so often members from the Lower City gangs come down to trade for the salvage.;NM04AAIGEA07033_.mp3
They'll exchange food and medicine for engine parts, old blasters and the like. Sometimes they even give me credits if I have some really good stuff.;NM04AAIGEA07035_.mp3
Let me see your inventory.;
It ain't the best stuff - mostly salvage and such. But the prices are right.;NM04AAIGEA07053_.mp3
I'll be going now.;
Yeah, okay. You come back and see me if you want to deal.;NM04AAIGEA07056_.mp3
I agree with you - your store, your profits.;
Exactly my point. But Gendar doesn't see it that way.;NM04AAIGEA07046_.mp3
That's why Gendar's mad at you? There has to be more to it than that!;
I'll think about it.;
Sounds like a good deal to me.;
So what do you want me to do?;
You want me to kill Rukil to shut him up?;
I don't want you to kill Rukil - he's not the problem. It's those damn explorers that went before him. What if they actually found something?;NM04AAIGEA07023_.mp3
Why are you telling me this?;
Oh, don't worry, I'll make this quick. I've got an offer that might be worth your while.;NM04AAIGEA07027_.mp3
I don't have time for this.;
Hey, you ain't from the village! You're from the up-world, ain't you? Yes, you've got credits I bet.;NM04AAIGEA07029_.mp3
Watch yourself. There's something slimy about this guy. I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw him.;NM04AAIGEA07075_.mp3
My name's Igear. I run a little salvage shop here. You want to buy something from my store? I got some good deals.;NM04AAIGEA07031_.mp3
Hey there, up-worlder. You want to see what I got for sale in my inventory? Or do you need something else?;NM04AAIGEA07058_.mp3
You! I remember you!;NM35AABELA25000_.mp3
What are you doing here?! Did the Jedi Council send you? I swear I will expose you if they have!;NM35AABELA25001_.mp3
Err... do I know you?;
So you do not even have the decency to remember me? I have cursed your name every moment since we last met on Dantooine.;NM35AABELA25003_.mp3
I am Belaya, once of the Jedi but now of the Sith... it was your murder of Juhani that placed this bitter blackness in my heart!;NM35AABELA25012_.mp3
I couldn't touch you on Dantooine, but I can, here! The Sith have taught me the power of freedom... and revenge! FOR JUHANI!!;NM35AABELA25013_.mp3
[Persuade] No, the Jedi certainly didn't send me here.;
[Success] I see. So you have come to join the Sith as I have? I should have known that would happen, as should the Council.;NM35AABELA25005_.mp3
The Council is nothing but a slow and doddering farce, placing all their trust in you... and you failed them, just as you failed Juhani.;NM35AABELA25006_.mp3
Do you even remember me? I am Belaya, and it is your murder of Juhani that brought me here. Fortunately, I have learned the power of revenge!;NM35AABELA25007_.mp3
[Failure] You do not fool me for a second! The Council fawns over you and places all their hope in you to save them... you wouldn't turn on them!;NM35AABELA25008_.mp3
You are a spy... and a murderer. It was you who killed Juhani and placed this bitter blackness in my heart that I cannot get rid of!;NM35AABELA25009_.mp3
I'll not suffer your insults!;
But you will! You pretend to be a Sith, but I know who you are! I have cursed your name every moment since we last met on Dantooine!;NM35AABELA25011_.mp3
I'm sorry. I'm too busy to talk. I have to get these drink orders to the customers!;NM02AEWAIT24000_.mp3
Huh? Who are you? The spice labs are off limits! You better tell me what you're doing here or I'll call the guards!;
[Persuade/Lie] Sorry. I'm new here. I must have gotten lost.;
[Success] Another new mechanic? Brejik's gone crazy - he's hiring anyone who ever picked up a blast torch!;
Well, you can't just go wandering around the spice labs! All you mechanics have to stay on the north side of the floor- you should know that!;
I want to ask you some questions.;
"No way! We lab techs aren't allowed to talk to you mechanics; too many of you are spice addicts looking to score. Brejik doesn't trust you guys.";
Look, you should just go. This is my private room - there's nothing for you here. All the spice stays in the lab next door. Now get out of here or I'll have to call the guards.;
Okay, I'm going. Don't get upset.;
Glad to see you're being reasonable.;
How are you going to report me with a blaster hole in your chest?;
Brejik warned me I might have to protect myself from spice addicts looking to score - looks like he was right!;
I'm just looking around.;
Looking for some spice, I'll bet! They warned me that a lot of you mechanics were addicts who would come snooping around looking for a fix.;
I'm here to kill you.;
[Failure] Lost, huh? Right. I bet you're here to steal some spice! You mechanics are all the same!;
You again? If anyone catches you here they'll shoot first and ask questions later. Why aren't back on the north side where you mechanics belong?;
Only the Arbiters are permitted into the prison cells, human.;
I am sorry. I will be going now.;
Sunry's trial is over, human. You are no longer an Arbiter of the Selkath courts. I cannot allow you into the cells.;
You may come and go as you please, Arbiter - you will find the door unlocked.;
If you wish to begin your trial, you must make the request with the warden. It shall then be passed on to the judges.;
The One is the greatest warrior in the long history of our tribe. He will lead us to victory over all our enemies!;
We are the greatest of the Black Rakata. No leader is stronger than the One, and no other tribe commands the war beasts as we do.;
The One is studying the secrets of the Red Rakata. In time he will use them to unlock the knowledge trapped within the Temple of the Ancients!;
Once the Red Rakata are destroyed there will be none who dare to stand against our tribe!;
This Tarisian ale is fantastic! We should have conquered this planet ages ago!;NM02AESITH31000_.mp3
This cantina isn't the fanciest joint I've ever been in, but it's a good place to unwind after a hard shift at the military base.;NM02AESITH31002_.mp3
Taris isn't such a bad place. I've been stationed in worse places than this during my commission.;NM02AESITH31004_.mp3
Damn those Sith - they're bombing the whole planet! I knew they'd turn on us sooner or... well, look what we got here! Thieves in the hangar.;NM08AADAVI09000_.mp3
So, you figured you'd just steal my ship for your get-away and leave me high and dry while the Sith turn the planet into dust? Sorry, but that ain't going to happen!;NM08AADAVI09002_.mp3
I'll take care of them, Davik. I've been looking forward to this for a long time!;NM08AADAVI09004_.mp3
Make it quick, Calo. The Sith mean business. If we don't get to our ships and find somewhere safe, the bombs they're dropping will kill us all.;NM08AADAVI09006_.mp3
Sorry, but you're too late to recruit me. I've just hired on with the Sith. Of course, if the Republic has a better offer...;NM26ABMERC03000_.mp3
I'm not a recruiter.;
Then why are you bothering me? I'm here on Manaan to find work as a mercenary. I'm not here to chat with tourists.;NM26ABMERC03002_.mp3
You'd work for the Sith? They're evil!;
Hey, keep your lectures. The Sith pay well, and they pay up front. That's all I care about.;NM26ABMERC03005_.mp3
Can I ask you a few questions.;
I don't have time to sit here and answer your questions. I have to get ready - the Sith want me to report to their Embassy first thing tomorrow.;NM26ABMERC03008_.mp3
Bastila! You were a fool to betray the Master... and an even bigger fool to return to the Star Forge.;NM45AADRKJ03000_.mp3
The only fools are those who still follow Malak. Open your eyes and see the true Lord of the Sith: Revan has returned!;NM45AADRKJ03001_.mp3
Revan is nothing! Malak earned the title of Dark Lord by defeating his old Master - and now I will become Malak's new apprentice by doing the same!;NM45AADRKJ03002_.mp3
You... talked to Mekel? Have I proved my worth? Did he say anything...?;NM33ABMEKF04000_.mp3
[Persuade] Mekel is tricking you. He'll never let you into the academy.;
[Success] Oh... oh. All this... for nothing...;NM33ABMEKF04002_.mp3
[Failure] N-no! That can't be... you're wrong! I... can't have wasted my life...;NM33ABMEKF04004_.mp3
[Persuade/Lie] He said you should go home. The Sith aren't for you.;
[Success] Go... home...? I...;NM33ABMEKF04007_.mp3
[Failure] I... don't believe you! You just want to... be chosen! But... it will be me! It will be... me...;NM33ABMEKF04009_.mp3
No. I'll be going.;
No, p-please... I... I cannot...;NM33ABMEKF04012_.mp3
P-please... don't hurt me... I am too weak with hunger...;NM33ABMEKF04014_.mp3
Hardly any shifts available this week. I should give up digging.;
Never thought I'd see moisture farming as a better living than mining.;
Leave me alone. I'm leaving this rock, I swear.;
Anchorhead... sure different than they said when I was recruited. Can't make a life here.;
I bet they shut this place down... I would.;
Another company loses everything on Tatooine. Sand People must love this.;
The raids on the crawlers hardly make a dent... the mines are failing anyway.;
Go on, leave me alone.;
The droid is actively engaged in its patrol route. You cannot reprogram it anymore.;
The droid is now active. It will attack any enemies that come in range.;
Activate droid's shields. (<CUSTOM42> repair part(s));
[Success] The droid's shields are now active.;
Engage droid in patrol mode. (<CUSTOM42> repair part(s));
[Success] Patrol mode engaged. Once you end this session the droid will begin patrol and destroy any enemies it encounters.;
WARNING: Once you end this session the droid's program will be locked in. You will not be able to modifiy the droid anymore.;
Leave it alone.;
You leave the droid alone for now.;
The droid engages its patrol mode and moves off to carry out your programmed instructions.;
[Failure] You do not have enough repair parts.;
This droid is damaged and inactive.;
DROID REPAIR TUTORIAL;
Some droids in the game are disabled or damaged and can be repaired by the player. Fixing a droid in this manner requires repair parts.;
More complicated repairs require more repair parts. The number of repair parts required varies depending on the REPAIR skill of the character working on the droid.;
Reactivate the droid.;
Well, welcome to my home, such as it is. Pull up a stump and be comfortable. We should discuss a few things.;NM24AAJOLE06000_.mp3
Like who you are, for example?;
Ah, what is there to tell? Jolee Bindo is the crazy old man in the dangerous woods. I'm content with the impression I give.;NM24AAJOLE06007_.mp3
But you use a lightsaber in battle. You are a Jedi.;
I follow the Jedi Way and I command the Force, yes, and I suppose that makes me as much a Jedi as anyone... but what of it?;NM24AAJOLE06009_.mp3
There's something you should know about me. I used to be... I used to be Darth Revan.;
*Sigh* I have no idea what you're talking about. Rabble rabble... what are you saying.;NM35AAJOLE09557_.mp3
Didn't you hear me? I used to be Revan, until the Jedi wiped away my identity!;
Does it change anything? I'm not here to judge you. You'll do what you have to, and I'll help if I can.;NM40ADCART01058_.mp3
I've seen my share of the dark and the light. And frankly, both extremes annoy me. Of course... I have felt the rumblings of change...;NM24AAJOLE06010_.mp3
It's kind of nice to meet a Jedi who isn't all hung up on this light side, dark side stuff. It gets pretty tiring, you know?;NM24AAJOLE06203_.mp3
Perhaps you will be of some assistance to me after all. Let us discuss what you came here for.;NM24AAJOLE06011_.mp3
You are difficult to deal with. It worries me.;
Ah, and it makes you think I may have the taint of the dark side in me, doesn't it? Ooh. Is that what you are wondering, huh? Ooh.;NM24AAJOLE06013_.mp3
Well, I assure you, I see more grey than dark or light. I'm just a stubborn old man, tired of the foolishness of others.;NM24AAJOLE06014_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;
*Sigh* Fine, fine, just be brief.;NM24AAJOLE06090_.mp3
I have made certain the poachers are gone.;
Yes, I heard the fuss of it. I told you I wanted a non-violent solution, and I had my reasons for it. You should have thought about that.;NM24AAJOLE06119_.mp3
Czerka Corporation will find the bodies and blame the Wookiees. This may cause more troops to be deployed. That means more disruption.;NM24AAJOLE06120_.mp3
I'm not pleased, but what's done is done and I'm not here to judge you. Hopefully you'll take care of that yourself.;NM24AAJOLE06121_.mp3
I couldn't find a peaceful solution. I regret that.;
Well, perhaps I have a duty to point out what you should have learned from this. Or perhaps... no.;NM24AAJOLE06123_.mp3
Was that convincing? It's been a while since I've been in the company of someone that needed that kind of babysitting.;NM24AAJOLE06130_.mp3
You aren't going to tell me what I should have learned?;
"A good teacher, and I'm not saying I am one, but a good teacher doesn't mash a book in a student's face shouting ""learn this bit here!""";NM24AAJOLE06132_.mp3
If you can't look at the situation for yourself and see the logic behind my way of doing things, you're not the type to understand me anyway.;NM24AAJOLE06133_.mp3
Besides, you're a little old for that master/student fuss, aren't you? I know I am.;NM24AAJOLE06134_.mp3
You mentioned barriers. There's a repulsor field I want to pass.;
Yes, yes, in the east past the poacher camp. I saw it when it was installed. It's a very effective barrier, but I know how to get past it.;NM24AAJOLE06138_.mp3
And on the other side... ancient answers. And perhaps a Wookiee you were seeking. I hope he's in the mood for visitors.;NM24AAJOLE06142_.mp3
[JOLEE has joined your party.] [Left-click this response to go to PARTY SELECTION screen.];
Will you help me find the Star Map now?;
Yes, of course. Let's get moving. I noticed the old paths some time ago. You probably wouldn't have found them on your own.;NM24AAJOLE06140_.mp3
There's also a Czerka repulsor field blocking the way, past the poacher camp in the east. I saw it when it was installed, so I know how to pass it.;NM24AAJOLE06141_.mp3
You mentioned eliminating barriers? Could we get to it?;
I know where you want to go. I can get you through to the old paths. This forest hides some strange things.;NM24AAJOLE06144_.mp3
If you didn't care about the outcome, why have me do this?;
You were here and it needed doing. Besides, dealing with the Czerka is dirty business. I hope you washed your hands.;NM24AAJOLE06136_.mp3
It was the most efficient way to stop them.;
I see. You are completely detached. Are you sure you're not a droid? It doesn't matter. A trivial thing like this is no measure of anyone.;NM24AAJOLE06125_.mp3
I kill what I want. Don't argue with me, old man.;
Oh, go bark up a tree. You'll get the same response out of me. Besides, I'm not about to get in the habit of grading you.;NM24AAJOLE06127_.mp3
"Funny, I don't picture you as the ""disapproving master"" type";
You're pretty much right, really. Truth be known, I won't judge how you fared... as long as you can LIVE WITH YOURSELF!;NM24AAJOLE06129_.mp3
Yes, I could feel it as you walked near. And I don't sense the smell of death on you. You spared them? Interesting.;NM24AAJOLE06145_.mp3
There was nothing to gain by killing them.;
Wasn't there? I suppose not, but the environment would say otherwise, if it could talk. No matter.;NM24AAJOLE06147_.mp3
Enough. Have I passed your little test?;
If you imagined a meaning behind it, I suppose that's good, but I don't think such a trivial thing is any real measure of a person.;NM24AAJOLE06149_.mp3
Can you tell me more about the poachers?;
I smell their tach-scent on you. Did you agree to hunt for them? Let me remind you that I do not approve, and you need me.;NM24AAJOLE06092_.mp3
Go to their camp and get rid of them. When you are through, we can proceed to the lower Shadowlands. Not before.;NM24AAJOLE06093_.mp3
I want to ask about you.;
Look, we've been through this before. My past is my affair. Get some years behind you and then we'll talk about me.;NM24AAJOLE06005_.mp3
I think you'll agree that we have more important things to discuss, no?;NM24AAJOLE06006_.mp3
I'm leaving. I have to get moving.;
Wait wait wait, slow down. I have to ask something of you. I've got something you need, and you can help me.;NM24AAJOLE06016_.mp3
We both know why you have come here. The Star Map. That has to be it. There is nothing else here.;NM24AAJOLE06017_.mp3
The problems of a few Wookiees don't amount to anything before the concerns of the Jedi. No, you are here for the map.;NM24AAJOLE06018_.mp3
If you have information, please tell it to me.;
Kashyyyk is an interesting place, more so than anyone suspects. If Czerka Corporation knew, heh, the planet would be a strip mine.;NM24AAJOLE06020_.mp3
The Wookiees have their legends that they were not always here, but it is more than that. The trees themselves are strangers.;NM24AAJOLE06021_.mp3
I don't understand. Can you be more specific?;
What I'm saying is that there are literally walls in your way, and you won't find what you need without my help... and my help has a price.;NM24AAJOLE06023_.mp3
Of course, this won't be a problem for you, since you have already completed my task. Removal of the Czerka poachers.;NM24AAJOLE06024_.mp3
Now, I'm not sure if you'll measure up to my task, seeing as how you've already joined up with the slime I want gone.;NM24AAJOLE06025_.mp3
Who do you mean?;
The Czerka poachers, I can smell that scent they use on you. I don't care what you told them, I want them gone.;NM24AAJOLE06027_.mp3
After you do that, I want to join up with you. Then I'll remove the barrier between you and the lower Shadowlands.;NM24AAJOLE06028_.mp3
Why do you care if they are here?;
They don't respect this place. They are butchering wildlife and threatening entire species. It's getting under my skin.;NM24AAJOLE06040_.mp3
The Wookiees could take care of themselves if they wished, but the animals are truly helpless victims.;NM24AAJOLE06041_.mp3
Well, I'll try to learn from this humble task.;
Oh please, this is arbitrary errand work, but such are the requests of the aged. You still have to do it.;NM24AAJOLE06043_.mp3
Their camp is in the far northeast. Now remember, if I wanted them dead, I'd have done it myself. Find a better way.;NM24AAJOLE06044_.mp3
Where are they? How many men?;
They are not that far northeast of here. There is usually five in the area, as far as I can see.;NM24AAJOLE06051_.mp3
The Captain of the lot is the one that earned my ire. Mishandle my garden, will he? Hmph!;NM24AAJOLE06052_.mp3
Why would you want to join up with me?;
You presumably have a ship. I've seen all I wish to here. Isn't that enough? I mean, I'm really sick of the trees.;NM24AAJOLE06054_.mp3
And perhaps your destiny might show me something new. You never know.;NM24AAJOLE06055_.mp3
Why not just go get rid of them yourself?;
Don't talk back to your elders, child. Look, they know me quite well, and are always on alert when I approach.;NM24AAJOLE06057_.mp3
The only way I could get rid of them would be violence, which would eventually lead to trouble for the Wookiees.;NM24AAJOLE06058_.mp3
I want them gone, but with as little fuss as possible. They have already caused enough trouble as it is.;NM24AAJOLE06059_.mp3
I will look into it.;
Good. Return to me here and we will see how you have done. Shoo. Shoo!;NM24AAJOLE06046_.mp3
I see. So the aged semi-Jedi wants me to get some kids off his lawn.;
Yes, yes, I'm an old man that's getting fussy. Call me foolish if you will, I don't care. You still have to do it.;NM24AAJOLE06048_.mp3
I told you, they are destroying the environment. People are mostly annoying, but the balance of nature, *that* needs protecting.;NM24AAJOLE06049_.mp3
This better not mess up any plans I've made.;
Hunting monkey is part of your great plan? I know you talked to the Czerka poachers, and I don't care. I want them gone.;NM24AAJOLE06030_.mp3
You must do a task for me, and then allow me to join with you. I will then remove certain barriers in your path.;NM24AAJOLE06031_.mp3
I'm honored to help someone of your experience.;
Oh, save it. I know this sounds absurd, but I'm old and entitled to work you around a bit. Besides, the test is simple.;NM24AAJOLE06033_.mp3
Since they began expanding in the Shadowlands, the Czerka have left me alone, for the most part. Until recently, anyway.;NM24AAJOLE06037_.mp3
A group of them set up camp not far from here. Poachers is all they are. I'd like them removed from this place.;NM24AAJOLE06038_.mp3
Why should I trust you, you crazy old coot?;
Can't I just pay you? I hate jumping hoops.;
What do you want me to do?;
You are rambling, old man! Get to the point.;
Legends? I have real barriers I need to pass.;
Get to the point, old man.;
I've got to get back to my task.;
Well hurry up! You don't want to be stuck here as long as I have.;NM24AAJOLE06152_.mp3
I need information about problems on Kashyyyk.;
Yes, among the Wookiees. Intriguing creatures. I like that they have little patience for bureaucrats.;NM24AAJOLE06068_.mp3
But of course, even here there are hidden things that manipulate.;NM24AAJOLE06069_.mp3
What do you know of Chuundar?;
Czerka Corporation was smart to put him in power. He's as good at destroying Wookiee culture as dropping corpses full of Ardroxian Flu.;NM24AAJOLE06071_.mp3
Will you work for him or against him, I wonder? I will be interested to see.;NM24AAJOLE06072_.mp3
You don't have a recommendation?;
Uh, sure, how's this: think for yourself. I don't care for politics, and I'm big on letting people figure things out for themselves.;NM24AAJOLE06074_.mp3
The Wookiees have prophesies of deliverance if you ask them, but for now they follow without hesitation. That is their wish.;NM24AAJOLE06075_.mp3
Have you seen a crazed Wookiee in the Shadowlands?;
Maddened with grief, perhaps, but not crazed. I helped him pass to the lower forests where only a Wookiee could follow.;NM24AAJOLE06077_.mp3
Some other matters will determine if you can follow. There is a barrier that... well, we'll talk of that more in a moment.;NM24AAJOLE06078_.mp3
Do you know a missing Wookiee called Rorworr?;
It is a very unfortunate matter. It will end in shame and sorrow. You will find Rorworr down here. And more.;NM24AAJOLE06080_.mp3
I have witnessed a number of happenings, but I have left them for others to sort out.;NM24AAJOLE06081_.mp3
You aren't being very helpful.;
I wasn't aware I had to be. Look, events like these reveal much about the people involved. I'm well past that introspective tripe.;NM24AAJOLE06083_.mp3
I'm not saying that outside help isn't needed. I just... well...;NM24AAJOLE06084_.mp3
I didn't want to make anyone mad while I didn't have a way off the planet. We'll talk more about that momentarily.;NM24AAJOLE06085_.mp3
Do you recognize these bowcaster bolts? I found them on a corpse.;
On the body of Rorworr, I know. His death will not go unnoticed. I have been wondering how this foolishness would play out.;NM24AAJOLE06087_.mp3
I am no weaponsmith, but someone in the village will be able to identify the owner of that bolt casing. They are very personal items.;NM24AAJOLE06088_.mp3
Have you any knowledge of Star Maps?;
Now why would you be asking about that, hmm? Don't answer. I knew that had to be why you were here.;NM24AAJOLE06097_.mp3
I told you my price. After you complete my task I'll make it so you can pass the barriers blocking your goal. That's all I will add on the subject.;NM24AAJOLE06098_.mp3
I saw them put it in, so only I know how to manipulate it. That knowledge will serve me now. Do as I ask.;NM24AAJOLE06103_.mp3
They are not hard to find. Their camp is to the far northeast. Try to get them to leave without too much fuss.;NM24AAJOLE06094_.mp3
After you finish, I will make it so you can pass the barrier that prevents your access to the lower Shadowlands.;NM24AAJOLE06095_.mp3
I do not feel the taint of the dark side within you, old man. I sense you are a servant of the light, whether you will admit it or not.;NM24AAJOLE06204_.mp3
I can feel the power of the Force within you, old man, but I do not sense the taint of the dark side. I think you are a servant of the light, despite what you claim.;NM24AAJOLE06205_.mp3
That's no answer! I was the Lord of the Sith before the Jedi wiped my mind!;
It doesn't bother you that I used to be the Dark Lord of the Sith?;
If you're a Jedi we might have a problem... because I'm Darth Revan!;
Tell me about yourself.;
I saw you using a lightsaber in battle. Are you a Jedi?;
Welcome back. I wonder, have you had much luck? Have you done as I asked?;NM24AAJOLE06117_.mp3
I have some questions I need answered.;
Trade is small now. You will all be gone soon.;
Giants in the Sand will be here long after you. So will Jawa.;
We trade and scavenge when people will buy. Not so good now.;
Sand stays. All else changes.;
We will remember you when you are sand too.;
There are many of us, but not where you can see.;
You come, you go, we scavenge, you come back, you go, we scavenge.;
We scavenge for everyone, but Giants of Sand never trade fair.;
Hey, you made it! I was beginning to wonder if you were going to show! The party's in full swing - come on in.;NM02AEYUNG26000_.mp3
You have to try this Tarisian ale - it's fantastic! We should have conquered this planet ages ago!;NM02AEYUNG26001_.mp3
Careful, Yun. That wine's got quite the kick. A couple more bottles and we'll all be passed out on the floor!;NM02AEYUNG26002_.mp3
Who cares? We're not on duty tomorrow - let's live a little! Come on - drink up!;NM02AEYUNG26003_.mp3
I'm surprised to see you again. I thought you had gotten sick of me complaining about my job at the Sith military base. I guess I kind of obsess about it. That can't be healthy.;NM02AEYUNG26004_.mp3
No offense, but I probably shouldn't be talking to you anymore. I'm liable to say something that might get me in trouble.;NM02AEYUNG26046_.mp3
If I could just find some other way to earn some credits I could give up this lousy job. Retire my uniform, so to speak.;NM02AEYUNG26013_.mp3
Where's your uniform now?;
Back at the military base, of course. I keep it there when I'm off duty. If anything happens to it they dock the cost from my pay.;NM02AEYUNG26015_.mp3
If you help me get my hands on some uniforms I'll make it worth your while.;
What? Are you offering me a bribe? You realize this is treason, right? If I report you the Sith will have you executed!;NM02AEYUNG26017_.mp3
You report me and I'll tell them how you really feel about your job.;
Hey, now - let's not start making threats. I didn't say I *would* report you, only that I could. This kind of talk is dangerous, you know? But I'm not going to turn you in.;NM02AEYUNG26019_.mp3
The truth is I find your offer rather tempting. I could probably get you some uniforms. But if we get caught we're dead. You're asking me to take an awful risk.;NM02AEYUNG26021_.mp3
If I'm going to do this, it's going to cost you. 200 credits up front if you want to get inside the base. No more, no less. So how about it - we have a deal?;NM02AEYUNG26022_.mp3
Okay - here's 200 credits.;
Okay, you've got a deal. The trick is to get you the uniforms without the Sith knowing I gave them to you. But I've got a plan.;NM02AEYUNG26026_.mp3
I'm going to a party with some of the other soldiers tonight. Most people are coming right after their shift, so they'll have their uniforms with them.;NM02AEYUNG26027_.mp3
You show up and I'll make sure everyone else gets good and drunk. When we pass out you can take our uniforms from the lockbox in the apartment.;NM02AEYUNG26028_.mp3
Won't you get in trouble if I steal your uniform?;
I'll probably get a reprimand for not locking it up, but that's about it. Then, in another month I'll resign and retire with all those credits you gave me.;NM02AEYUNG26030_.mp3
Here - I'll add the address of the party to your datapad. Show up there later. To be on the safe side we shouldn't speak again before or after the party.;NM02AEYUNG26031_.mp3
I'll go make all the arrangements and I'll see you at the party tonight. Just remember - if you get caught with those uniforms, I don't know you.;NM02AEYUNG26032_.mp3
How do I know this isn't some kind of set up?;
We're in this together now. If either one of us goes to the Sith we'll both end up in the torture chambers. Anyway, it's not like you have a choice.;NM02AEYUNG26034_.mp3
I'm not giving you your credits back, so you might as well show up at the party later and take the uniforms after we all get drunk and pass out. What could be more simple?;NM02AEYUNG26035_.mp3
Sounds like a good plan.;
[Persuade] Make it 100 credits and we have a deal.;
[Success] Hmmm... 100 credits is a small fortune. I'll never have the chance to make that much in one shot again.;NM02AEYUNG26025_.mp3
[Failure] Look, I'm not going to risk my neck unless I get a big payday. 200 credits or no deal.;NM02AEYUNG26037_.mp3
I can't afford that much.;
Sorry to hear that, but I won't put my neck on the line for nothing! Tell you what - you come up with the credits and we can talk. Otherwise, no deal.;NM02AEYUNG26039_.mp3
Forget it - I'm not paying that much!;
I don't think you'll report me. I think you've been waiting for an offer like this.;
Hey, relax - I was just making a joke.;
You... you weren't serious? Oh... okay. Although if you *were* serious, we might be able to work something out. No - wait! Forget I said that! We shouldn't be talking like this.;NM02AEYUNG26042_.mp3
I might complain a lot, but it's a big step from complaining to treason. I think maybe we should end this conversation - for both our sakes.;NM02AEYUNG26043_.mp3
I'll be going now.;
Oh... okay. Well, see you around. Say, do me a favor and don't repeat all the stuff I just told you. Eh, might not go over well with my superiors.;NM02AEYUNG26048_.mp3
Can I ask you some questions?;
"The senior officers don't really like it when we start answering questions, you know? They don't want us fraternizing with the locals. Just another ""perk"" of the job.";NM02AEYUNG26045_.mp3
Well, are you here to close our deal? 200 credits gets you access to a set of Sith uniforms. Otherwise we really shouldn't be talking.;NM02AEYUNG26005_.mp3
Sorry, but I'm not here looking for conversation. I just came to get a drink, listen to some music and try to relax before my next shift at the military base.;NM02AEYUNG26006_.mp3
You're from the military base? You don't look like one of the Sith.;
I don't wear my uniform when I'm off duty. It's not allowed. In fact, anyone in uniform is banned from entering the cantina.;NM02AEYUNG26008_.mp3
The officers don't like it when we show up here off duty. Don't like us fraternizing with the locals, I guess. But it gets pretty stale hanging out around the base all the time.;NM02AEYUNG26009_.mp3
Besides, the Sith don't own me. Being a soldier in their fleet is just a job, you know? A job with long hours and low pay, I might add.;NM02AEYUNG26010_.mp3
So why do you do it?;
When I signed up I was promised adventure and excitement in exotic locales. Instead, I end up stationed at a military base on some backwater planet on the fringes of the galaxy.;NM02AEYUNG26012_.mp3
Sounds like you aren't very happy.;
I'm not interested in chatting right now.;
First you come over and say hi, then you scurry off as soon as you find out I'm a Sith soldier. You Tarisians are a funny bunch.;NM02AEYUNG26089_.mp3
Hey, there. I didn't think we'd be chatting again so soon. You took off on me pretty quick last time.;NM02AEYUNG26050_.mp3
I'm actually a little surprised you're talking to me at all... most of the people here on Taris can't stand us Sith. It can make this a pretty lonely job.;NM02AEYUNG26057_.mp3
[Persuade] You're just doing your job, right? I don't hold that against you.;
[Success] That's true, but people don't appreciate what we've done for them. We could have slapped a curfew on this whole planet, but we didn't.;NM02AEYUNG26059_.mp3
You know, it's like everyone on this backwater planet is in a permanent bad mood. Don't they know they have to make the best of things?;NM02AEYUNG26074_.mp3
You've got a pretty positive attitude.;
Exactly! It's all about attitude. I didn't ask to be assigned to this backwater planet, but I try to make the best of it!;NM02AEYUNG26076_.mp3
It's pretty easy to get depressed on an assignment like this, but we do what we can to keep our spirits up.;NM02AEYUNG26077_.mp3
You need to blow off steam once in a while.;
That's true. It's nice to meet someone who understands what I'm going through. It's good to talk about this stuff - it gets pretty lonely up at the military base.;NM02AEYUNG26079_.mp3
I have to get going soon - I've got a shift at the military base. But some of us junior Sith officers are having a party tonight to blow off some steam.;NM02AEYUNG26080_.mp3
I'd really like to see you again. Why don't you drop by the party? I'll show you where it is on your map.;NM02AEYUNG26081_.mp3
Sounds good. I'll be there.;
Don't be late. We're starting right after our shifts end. Most of us won't even be going back to the base to lock up our uniforms. I look forward to seeing you there.;NM02AEYUNG26083_.mp3
I don't think I can make it.;
Just because I'm with the Sith doesn't mean I don't know how to have a good time. You'll enjoy yourself. I promise.;NM02AEYUNG26085_.mp3
It must be tough, being stationed on a hostile world.;
Everybody has their ups and downs... it's how you deal with them that counts.;
[Failure] Save the sympathetic best friend act. I'm not buying it.;NM02AEYUNG26060_.mp3
But I don't want to fill out a bunch of paperwork on my day off, so let's just pretend this conversation never happened. Now move along.;NM02AEYUNG26061_.mp3
You can't really blame people... you did conquer the planet.;
"Oh, great... I see where this is going: the Sith are evil; why did I join them; blah, blah, blah. I don't need a lecture from the likes of you.";NM02AEYUNG26063_.mp3
Sorry - I'm not trying to judge you.;
Ah, it's okay. I might have overreacted a bit. But can you blame me? Everywhere I look I see one of you Tarisians glaring at me with hate in your eyes.;NM02AEYUNG26065_.mp3
I'm not actually from Taris. I'm just stuck here until the quarantine ends.;
You're an off-worlder? Huh, I figured you'd be even more angry, being stuck on a foreign planet and all.;NM02AEYUNG26070_.mp3
[Persuade] Hey, we're both strangers on Taris. We have to stick together.;
[Success] You're right! It's like everyone on this backwater planet is in a permanent bad mood. Don't they know they have to make the best of things?;NM02AEYUNG26072_.mp3
Being stuck on Taris isn't so bad... but the locals aren't much fun.;
You seem pretty touchy about this. Maybe you feel a little guilty about what you do.;
Don't try to analyze me. I'm just doing my job - same as any other soldier in any other army. Besides, I don't have to explain myself to you!;NM02AEYUNG26067_.mp3
I don't think we have much else to say to each other. Let's just keep this civil and go our separate ways, okay?;NM02AEYUNG26068_.mp3
Back again? Didn't I make myself clear enough? The senior Sith officers don't like us fraternizing with the locals. Besides, I don't need you lecturing me for my career choice.;NM02AEYUNG26051_.mp3
Hi there - I haven't seen you around before. Of course they don't give us Sith officers from the military base much time off...;NM02AEYUNG26054_.mp3
So, Canderous - I see you have brought someone with you. Most intriguing, if I do say so myself. You usually travel alone.;NM08AADAVI08000_.mp3
It's not like you to take on partners, Canderous. You're getting soft.;NM08AADAVI08002_.mp3
Watch yourself, Calo. You may be the newest kath hound in the pack, but you aren't top dog yet!;NM08AADAVI08004_.mp3
Enough! I won't have my top two men killing each other - that's not good business. I'm sure Canderous has an explanation as to why he's not working solo anymore.;NM08AADAVI08006_.mp3
This is a special case, Davik. I ran into someone the Exchange might want to recruit. You may have heard something of their exploits already.;NM08AADAVI08008_.mp3
Ah, yes - now I recognize your companion. The rider who won the big swoop race. Very impressive... as was your display in the rather heated battle afterwards.;NM08AADAVI08010_.mp3
Good to finally meet you, Davik. My name's <FullName>.;
You know, Canderous was right. The Exchange is always looking for new talent. You could have a bright future with our organization.;NM08AADAVI08012_.mp3
With a recommendation from Canderous - and a thorough background check - you could become part of the Exchange. Many would kill to prove themselves worthy of this honor.;NM08AADAVI08020_.mp3
Your offer intrigues me, Davik.;
Come with me - I will give you a tour of my operations. I'm certain you'll be most impressed.;NM08AADAVI08025_.mp3
"Ah, there she is - the Ebon Hawk. My pride and joy; the fastest ship in the Outer Rim! Note the state of the art security system I've had installed to protect her.";NM08AADAVI08027_.mp3
The shields are completely impregnable. Nobody can get past them without the codes to try and steal my baby. Unfortunately, the Sith military blockade has grounded my vessel.;NM08AADAVI08029_.mp3
The Ebon Hawk can outrun any vessel in the galaxy, but even she isn't fast enough to avoid the auto-targeting laser cannons of the orbiting Sith fleet.;NM08AADAVI08031_.mp3
I am, of course, working on acquiring the Sith departure codes so that I may come and go as I please. However, progress has been slow... but we should continue our tour.;NM08AADAVI08033_.mp3
These will be your accommodations. The slave quarters are just down the hall. If you need anything during your stay - food, a massage - feel free to call upon their services.;NM08AADAVI08035_.mp3
If all goes well with your background check you will be invited to join the Exchange. I'd advise you to accept the offer when it comes - or suffer the dire consequences of refusal.;NM08AADAVI08037_.mp3
I'm looking forward to working with you, Davik.;
"You will stay in these rooms as my guest for the next few days; I will not accept no for an answer. Feel free to visit the slave quarters at any time during your stay.";NM08AADAVI08041_.mp3
I must warn you that if you are found anywhere outside the guest wing during your stay - or if you bother my other guests - my security forces will deal with you most harshly.;NM08AADAVI08043_.mp3
I will return after the investigation into your background is complete. Until then, make yourself comfortable. Come, Calo, let us leave our guests in peace.;NM08AADAVI08045_.mp3
Okay, we're inside. Now all we have to do is figure out a way to get past the Ebon Hawk's security system and we can get the rest of your group and get off this planet!;NM08AADAVI08047_.mp3
No sense waiting around here, though. The sooner we get off Taris the better.;NM08AADAVI08049_.mp3
I'm sorry, but I can't stay.;
Am I a prisoner here?;
Sorry, I'm not interested.;
Don't be so hasty. Our allies end up much better off than our enemies - as both Canderous and Calo Nord could surely tell you. The Exchange has much to offer.;NM08AADAVI08023_.mp3
It was nothing I couldn't handle.;
Brejik had to learn that double-crossers tend to end up dead!;
An important lesson to learn, no doubt. In my line of business I've seen far too many people suffer for not understanding it.;NM08AADAVI08015_.mp3
I didn't know you were a swoop fan.;
A casual fan at best, but everyone on Taris follows the big season opener. But we have more important issues to discuss now.;NM08AADAVI08018_.mp3

Ah, the Arbiter. Since you have been permitted to defend Sunry against these accusations I shall assist how I can.;
What do you think of Sunry?;
Sunry was a great warrior in his time. He fought for the Republic against the Sith aggression and proved valorous.;
I have great respect for his accomplishments and find it tragic that he finds himself in his current condition.;
If the Republic had more individuals like him right now, I do not believe the Sith would be so great a problem for your people.;
Is there any other way I can assist you?;
Is there anything suspicious about this case?;
I find it questionable that a man with such a reputable past as Sunry would murder a Sith woman. Especially not from behind.;
But knowing the Sith, there was probably some deception involved. They seek to do the same thing to us here.;
There has been much pressure by the Sith on our government - and even on the judges themselves - to deliver a guilty verdict in this case.;
But the letter of the law is absolute, and we will not be compromised for Sith power-games.;
Is there anything else you need?;
What do you think of the Republic and the Sith Empire?;
I find this great battle being waged across the galaxy both disturbing and, ultimately, tragic.;
For all its faults, your tottering Republic has benefitted the vast majority of the galaxy for many millenia. To see it fall into ruin in such a short time...;
I do not like the Sith, that I make no effort to hide. I will even admit that if given the option, I would rule that we should join the Republic.;
But I must remain impartial and rule on this case as the law requires.;
Do you have any additional questions?;
I have no more questions for now.;
If there is anything else you require, feel free to inquire with me.;
Republic citizens are welcome on Manaan, but official inquiries should go through the proper channels.;
Your function with the courts is complete. You should not interrupt our proceddings in this manner.;
Judge Shelkar can answer questions of off-world visitors during normal hours.;
You have done us a great help by removing the Elders from our way. Now we can at last gain entrance to the Temple.;
You betrayed us last time you were here, Revan. Do not let this happen again.;
The One has said that we must let you aid yourself to what we may have so that you may overcome the Elders.;
The loremaster will surely be interested in the stories you have gained since leaving us last, Revan.;
Greetings, my young friend. I assume you are not a member of the Order, as you are not wearing the traditional garb of the Jedi.;
Allow me to introduce myself. I am Crattis Yurkal, proprietor of the general store here on Dantooine. Not much to look at now, I'll admit, but I'm in on the ground floor!;
I mean, look at this planet - majestic fields, rolling plains, wide open terra firma. Elbow room - that's what people want.;
Once word gets out, we'll have settlers and tourists from the galactic core just dying to come here.;
And guess who'll be waiting for them? Not that blasted Czerka Corp., that's for sure! Not this time, no sir! This time it'll be Crattis Yurkal who makes the big bucks! But listen to me...;
You didn't come here to listen to my ramblings on the evils of the Czerka Corp., I'll bet! What can I do for you?;
I'd like to see what you have for sale.;
Excellent. As always, my selection is somewhat limited. Czerka Corp. has a monopoly on some of the suppliers.;
But I'm sure you'll find all my inventory is of the highest quality... and I've got a few special items you won't find anywhere else!;
What do you have against the Czerka Corporation?;
Don't get me started on Czerka Corp.!;
They've got a monopoly on half the galaxy already, and they do everything they can to keep anyone else from getting a foothold in their territory: extortion, bribing officials and government diplomats.;
Not to mention driving up prices on essentials like food and water on distant colonies. I've heard stories of them letting people starve to death because they couldn't afford their jacked-up prices!;
And since they've thrown themselves in with the Sith, things have only gotten worse.;
Worse? How has it gotten worse?;
The Sith are tangled up in an expensive war with the Republic. They need supplies, equipment, resources.;
There's lots of opportunities for a company with no morals, like Czerka Corp., to make some major profits. Malak has given them exclusive trading rights wherever the Sith have control.;
It's bad enough they're helping to finance the Sith war effort, but I've heard rumors of even worse stuff.;
Slaving, pillaging planets of their resources, genocide of indigenous species. The Sith and Czerka Corp. seem like a perfect match to me. Ah, listen to me going on...;
Do you mean Czerka Corp. are allied with the Sith?;
Maybe we could discuss this some other time.;
I think I'll be going now.;
Be sure to come back every now and again. I'm always getting more inventory in. You never know what I might have in stock, and my prices are always better than those crooks at Czerka Corp.!;
What have you heard about the Mandalorian raiders?;
They're vermin, mostly. Leftovers from the Mandalorian Wars. They lost their armies and worlds and now wander the galaxy raiding weak farms and outposts.;
They are the scum who could not stand defeat and fled the final battles. They do us no credit.;NM13AACRAT07050_.mp3
Any reasonably well-defended base could withstand them. This Enclave, for instance, would never fall to them.;
They do make trouble for the farmers though... They're almost as much of a burden on ordinary people as that damn Czerka Corporation! But I digress...;
You must be the one I've been hearing about... the new recruit, as it were. <FullName>, I think they said.;
Another fresh-faced apprentice ready to leap into Jedi training with both feet. Well, best of luck to you is all I can say about that!;
Welcome to my shop, feel free to look around. Take a break from the trials of Jedi training. Speaking of which, I hear you've heard about the kinrath caves - the lightsaber crystal caves.;
How did you know that?;
I have my sources. Anyway, I've got a little proposal for you.;
Those kinrath caves are crawling with crystals. Valuable crystals. Sure, the Jedi use them to make their lightsabers. But it's not like they need them all, right?;
I'd pay very handsomely for any crystals that happened to end up in my eager hands.;
I doubt the Order would approve of such a transaction.;
It's not like you have to tell the Jedi Council what you're doing. And it's not like anyone's going to miss a few extra crystals, right? Anyway, think about it.;
Bring me those crystals here and I'll buy them from you, no questions asked. You might want to keep one for yourself, though. You'll need it for your lightsaber.;
Ha! Good to see things in this Jedi enclave work just like they do out in the real world. Everyone's looking out for number one.;NM13AACRAT07086_.mp3
He makes a good case. It's not like you'd be stealing or killing anyone or anything.;NM13AACRAT07087_.mp3
I'm not an expert on the Jedi, but this seems like the kind of thing that could get a person into a lot of trouble.;NM13AACRAT07088_.mp3
How dare you make such an offer! This is an insult to everything the Jedi stand for!;NM13AACRAT07090_.mp3
The crystals are sacred! No self-respecting Jedi would ever do such a thing!;NM13AACRAT07091_.mp3
What's the big deal? It's not like you'd be hurting anyone. There's plenty of crystals in that cave, so what's the harm in giving me a couple?;
You wouldn't be the first, you know. I don't think the Jedi Council approves, but they don't make a big deal about it. They've got more important things to worry about.;
But enough of this. I'm sure there's another reason you came in to my shop. What can I do for you?;
This doesn't seem like an honorable thing to do. It feels wrong to me.;
Could I get in trouble for this?;
It's a deal!;
No, you must have me confused with someone else.;
Sorry, my mistake. But if you were going, hypothetically speaking, I'd have a little proposal for you. Hypothetically, of course.;
How goes the training? I hear the life of an apprentice can be pretty rough, but you should be proud of what you're doing!;
It's always good to see another ally in the fight against darkness and corruption.;
If there were more people like you around, an honest businessman could make a decent living, and companies like that damn Czerka Corp. wouldn't even exist! But listen to me...;
I understand congratulations are in order! You've decided to join the Jedi rank and file! Jedi <FullName>!;
There was some fighting down by the Sandral estate, I heard. I hope it's not the Mandalorian raiders acting up again...;
Or maybe even some forces sponsored by Czerka Corp.! But maybe I'm just being a bit paranoid...;
The damn Czerka Corp. has been driven off one of their worlds! This is most excellent news, and to celebrate, I'm offering a discount - this time only!;
The Sith have been fighting amongst themselves on Korriban. Someone told me they have been killing each other in their temples. Sounds like the inside of a Czerka Corp. office to me!;
Manaan - the planet that supplies kolto - seems to have stopped exporting and aren't explaining why. I'm sorry to act like a Czerka Corp. guy, but I'll need to charge extra for it.;
Welcome to my shop. It is always an honor to have a member of the Order grace my business with their, uh... business. As you know, I have nothing but the highest respect for the Jedi.;
So, you got something for me? Remember - as soon as you come up with the spice I'll go get my mechanic's access card for you to hold on to until next week when I get paid.;NM10ABVULK08006_.mp3
Here's the spice - now give me your access card.;
You see? I knew you were the type to answer the door when opportunity knocks! Wait here and I'll be right back with my access card.;NM10ABVULK08025_.mp3
Okay, let's do this deal quick. I don't want somebody to see us or we could both get in trouble.;NM10ABVULK08000_.mp3
Here's my mechanic's access card - don't lose it! As soon as I get paid I expect you to give me that card back.;NM10ABVULK08002_.mp3
Now if you'll excuse me, I need to find somewhere private to enjoy this spice.;NM10ABVULK08004_.mp3
I'll be back when I have the spice.;
You see? I knew you were the type to answer the door when opportunity knocks! As soon as you get the spice I'll go get my access card from my locker.;NM10ABVULK08022_.mp3
I've changed my mind. I'm not going to do this.;
Changed your mind? You can't do that - we had a deal! You can't just back out of a deal!;NM10ABVULK08008_.mp3
You know, you lab techs think you're too good for the likes of us mechanics, but you're nothing but a bunch of selfish, greedy, arrogant Hutt-slugs!;NM10ABVULK08032_.mp3
Well, I don't need your help! I'll figure out some other way to get that spice. Go on - get out of here! Just leave me alone.;NM10ABVULK08034_.mp3
You... you're the new lab tech, right? Gotta be. You ain't no mechanic and you don't look like one of the Vulkar gang members.;NM10ABVULK08010_.mp3
Th...that's us. New lab techs. You're a perceptive one.;NM10ABVULK08012_.mp3
Listen, friend... I used to have a little deal with one of the gals in the lab. Whenever I needed some spice, she'd sneak a little bit out for me and I'd make it worth her while.;NM10ABVULK08014_.mp3
But she's gone now - Brejik found out she was dipping into his stash. Now my supplier is gone and I'm in bad need of a little fix. You follow what I'm saying?;NM10ABVULK08016_.mp3
You want me to steal some spice for you.;
See, all you lab techs are so smart. You got it figured out already. Just a small bit of spice, no one will even notice. And I make it worth your while.;NM10ABVULK08018_.mp3
How much will you give me?;
Here's the problem, see. I'm flat broke till next week. But I'm good for it. In fact, I'll even let you hold my mechanic's access card for collateral. How's that sound?;NM10ABVULK08020_.mp3
Forget it. Credits up front or no deal!;
Sorry, I'm not interested.;
Come on, don't be that way! I need some spice, you got access to spice! We can make an exchange that makes us all happy!;NM10ABVULK08030_.mp3
Forget it.;
You again? What - you ready to work out a deal now? Listen, you get me some spice and I'll make it worth your while.;NM10ABVULK08036_.mp3
I had fun for a while, but I just can't compete without upgrades. I'll leave it to you professionals. Goodbye.;
Hello there. I... wanted to thank you for showing me I should get out of the swoop circuit. I just don't have what it takes.;
I don't really understand why you gave me the money to upgrade my swoop and then didn't give me time to do it before beating my time.;
I guess you had your reasons. Here, take your money back. I won't need it now.;
Keep the money. Try again.;
You are very generous, but it's too late for that. I've got no reason to think I could win even with the time to upgrade.;
Thanks anyway, but I'll be leaving now. Back to the processing job, I guess. This was fun while it lasted. Goodbye.;
It's good to know your limits.;
I suppose, but I wanted to go past them. Do you know that no Aqualish has ever taken Sector Champion? I had hoped...;
Ah, it's too late for that. Maybe if I'd got some swoop upgrades... I don't know. It was fun while it lasted, but it's over. Goodbye.;
Quitter! Stand up for yourself!;
That won't work now, I think. You and all the other racers have outclassed me in every round. I just don't have the resources to compete.;
Maybe if I had been able to get my swoop upgraded... I don't know. It's too late now. It was fun while it lasted, but it's over. Goodbye.;
This sport doesn't need losers.;
I guess it doesn't. I just couldn't compete with the professionals, or even the serious amateurs. I was never even in the running.;
You beat my time easy, and you're not even a pro. I'm taking the hint and leaving before I lose all my credits in the sport.;
I really wanted to make a go of it... but I guess you can't always do what you want. Well, you can. Nice racing. Good luck on your career.;
Why don't you keep trying?;
It's too late for that. Maybe if I could have had one last good run... maybe if I could have upgraded my swoop. Ah, it doesn't matter.;
Just leave me alone. I'll get by without your help or abuse, thank you very much.;
Hello there. You probably want to talk to the professional racers. They are in the Racers' Lounge, the room just to the east.;
They don't usually associate with amateur racers like me. I'll probably be giving up soon anyway.;
I just want to ask a few questions.;
I'll answer what I can. I don't think I'll be going back out on the track.;
What is bothering you?;
I'm not getting any better out there. I race hard, and I think I have good skills, but I just can't afford to keep up with the professionals.;
Their swoop bikes are modified with the best equipment. There is only so much you can do with a borrowed toolkit and standard parts.;
I can't afford to make this my life. I want to keep going, but without money, you don't win, and if you don't win, you don't get money.;
How much do you think you need?;
It's not your problem to worry about. I shouldn't even be bothering you with this. The 500 credits I need is my problem, not yours.;
Here, I can give it to you.;
You're just giving me 500 credits? Just like that? I don't know what to say. I'd have to save for months to get anywhere near that much.;
Thank you. I mean it. I'll get them working on my swoop right away. Maybe I can improve on my Round One time after all.;
Come back to East Ahto in a day or so, after the changes are made. I hope it helps. Maybe I'm just not good enough. I guess we'll see.;
Let's go back to my first questions.;
Anything you like. You helped me more than enough.;
I want to ask about you and racing.;
What else can I tell you? You're Sector Champion now. You've shown you know more than I could tell you.;
Is Manaan a good course for racing?;
I think you answered your own question by becoming Sector Champion. It's obviously a good place for you to race. Me too, I guess.;
I was worried it was too hard to get ahead on this course, but your help made me realize I just needed a little boost. Thanks again.;
How long have you been at this?;
Not long at all, but I guess I'll be able to try and make it a career now. This was a big step for me. Thanks for your help.;
What can you tell me about the other racers?;
You understand everyone enough to beat their times. That's probably more than I could tell you. I'm learning though, and I'll get even better.;
Thanks again for your help. I appreciate it.;
I can tell you I never thought I would beat them. I doubt that Casandra and Hukta like that I've won Round Three.;
I hope that will just turn to friendly rivalry. I think I can make a go of professional swoop racing after all, thanks to you.;
Hukta Jax and Casandra Mateil are the only two professionals here right now. They keep to themselves in the Racers' Lounge.;
The only thing I can really say about them is that I'll never get close to beating them. I should probably just give up racing.;
What do you mean by that?;
Use the money I gave you to upgrade.;
I'll see if putting the credits you gave me into swoop upgrades will help, but I don't know if it will. I may just not be good enough.;
I guess I'll know when I get my bike upgraded. That will take a little while, so check with me when you come back to East Ahto.;
Thanks for your help either way. I mean it.;
Not long, but I don't know how much more time I'll be putting in. I think I've gone as far as I can go.;
I didn't think so before, but thanks to you, I made it to the top round of racing. I guess the course is all right after all.;
I don't know. It's been hard to keep up with the professional racers. Maybe it's the course, or maybe it's me. I'm not doing very well.;
I haven't raced anywhere else, but I'd probably do just as bad on another track.;
Well, things may have turned around for me, luck-wise, but I'm not sure if I really know all that much more than I did before.;
Me? No one is interested in me. I'm just Queedle Molto, one of many failing amateur swoop racers.;
I'm not sure why you would be interested in going over this again. I'm just a failing amateur swoop racer.;
Do you know much about Manaan?;
Well, I've lived here for more than ten years. I worked in the big purification and processing plants here after leaving my homeworld of Ando.;
In all that time, I've learned very little about the Selkath and their way of life. They don't like off-worlders much, even if their politics are neutral.;
I can't get used to the Sith presence here, but everyone is interested in Manaan to some degree. It's all because of the kolto.;
What do you know about kolto?;
I know that you need it to make medpacs, and I know Mannan is the only place to get it. That's all anyone knows, I think.;
Have the Sith been a problem?;
No, but it's unnerving to have them here, especially after what happened on Taris. The swoop circuit was really hurt by that, I'm sure you know.;
I have to leave. Goodbye.;
See you around the track.;
All right, but don't take too long. I want to get my swoop upgrade done soon, so it'll be ready when you come back to East Ahto.;
If you like. I probably won't be going back out on the track soon anyway.;
If I had that much I'd give it to you.;
That's nice of you to say, but it doesn't change anything. I'll probably end up quitting as soon as someone beats my time.;
There's no way you can earn the money?;
I saved all my wages from the processing plant to buy my swoop in the first place. I just don't have anything to spare.;
I guess you'd better just give up.;
That's the attitude of the professional racers too. Survival of the fittest, I guess. I'll probably quit when my Round One time gets beat.;
Ah, now I understand. You need a loan.;
I'm not asking for anything. You asked what was wrong and I'm telling you. The 500 credits I need is my problem, not yours.;
You mentioned you needed 500 credits.;
I have no respect for beggars, fool.;
I am no beggar! You asked what was troubling me and I told you. The 500 credits I need is my problem, not yours.;
Very sad. Just answer my questions.;
All right, but there's no need to be so rude. I just have I've important decisions on my mind.;
You sound pathetic.;
What? That was a bit harsh. I just can't maintain my swoop the way they can. Is that my fault?;
Whose fault is it? Like I said: pathetic.;
Well, I'll just keep to myself then. You can go keep company with the other elite if you want. You deserve each other.;
Now go away. I've got important things to think about.;
Sorry. I want to ask some questions.;
All right, I'll answer. I probably won't be racing again anyway.;
Greetings to you, Sector Champion. That was an amazing time you turned in. The best I've seen on this track.;
Before I go any further, though, I have to return the money you gave me. The prize I won covered most of it.;
You keep it. Use it for more upgrades.;
Thanks, but no, I won't need it. I'll do all right now that I have a chance.;
Thank you. I knew you would do well.;
You did? I didn't. I was worried the whole time. I didn't believe it until I heard my time. Thank you again for all of this..;
You owe me more. It's called interest.;
What? Now listen, I want to be grateful to you for this. Don't spoil it. Just take your money back and let's stay on good terms.;
Fine. Just answer my questions then.;
I'll do my best. I owe you a lot.;
Do as I say! Pay me for my trouble!;
There's nothing else to pay! My prize money only covered maintenance and the upgrade cost. I told you I didn't have a lot.;
You know, you gave me a chance, but I guess it was all just a trick to try and get more money. Well it won't work, not on Manaan.;
You can't do anything because of all the cameras. I'm not wasting time with you. I have a swoop career to plan.;
I don't feel bad losing to you, now that I know I'm in the running. Thanks for your help, even if you did win it all in the end.;
Hello again. I still can't believe the difference a few upgrades make. My score is top of Round Three! I never thought I'd be able to do that.;
I'm sure it won't stand as a record for long, but I have to thank you for this opportunity. I appreciate all that you did for me.;
Hello again. There's not much happening here yet. I guess the racers are waiting for the field to fill out a bit.;
I'm just waiting for my time to fall. I just can't seem to keep up with the serious racers.;
I appreciate the money you gave me to upgrade my swoop. Come back to East Ahto in a day or so and I'll see if my times can improve.;
You made it! Several Jedi have already gone ahead into the Star Forge. We have to strike while we still have the element of surprise!;NM45AAFEMA07000_.mp3
If we don't stop Bastila from using her Battle Meditation the entire Republic fleet will be wiped out!;NM45AAFEMA07001_.mp3
Come on, before they...;NM45AAFEMA07002A.mp3
Damn! So much for catching them unprepared.;NM45AAFEMA07002B.mp3
We'll deal with these Sith - you get into the Star Forge and find Bastila! Hurry!;NM45AAFEMA07003_.mp3
We'll deal with these Sith - you get into the Star Forge and find Malak!;NM45AAFEMA07004_.mp3
We have to find Malak! A victory by the Republic fleet won't mean anything if the Dark Lord gets away.;NM45AAFEMA07005_.mp3
We don't want the Sith to cut off our escape route. We'll stay here and hold this docking bay. You get in there and find Bastila!;NM45AAFEMA07006_.mp3
We don't want the Sith to cut off our escape route. We'll stay here and hold this docking bay. You get in there and find Malak!;NM45AAFEMA07007_.mp3
*sigh* Politics are afoot at the academy once again. You'd best be careful... a lot of people 'disappear' at a time like this.;NM35AASITH12000_.mp3
Congratulations on joining the academy proper. I imagine you'll be taking your final test soon?;NM35AASITH12002_.mp3
How do you do? Excuse me... I must return to my studies.;NM35AASITH12004_.mp3
Hmm. Is that the sword of Ajunta Pall you have there? Fascinating. If it truly is, you might want to hand that over to Master Uthar, no?;NM35AASITH12006_.mp3
Greetings. You're one of the new hopefuls, aren't you? I imagine you're eager to garner some prestige for Master Uthar.;NM35AASITH12008_.mp3
Who are you?;
My name is Tamlen. I'm assigned here to the library... mostly keeping it up to date with new discoveries and such.;NM35AASITH12010_.mp3
New discoveries?;
I am adding new entries into our library's database based on the excavations in the valley. Currently I'm working on Ajunta Pall... quite a fascinating subject.;NM35AASITH12015_.mp3
Who is Ajunta Pall?;
Ajunta Pall was one of the first of the great Sith Lords... at least, according to the ruins here on Korriban. One of the tombs out in the Valley of the Dark Lords belongs to him.;NM35AASITH12017_.mp3
He wielded a powerful sword, by all accounts. Some of us believe it might be in that tomb, which is quite exciting.;NM35AASITH12019_.mp3
His sword?;
According to legend, Ajunta Pall forged a sword imbued with the essence of the dark side. Someone who found it could gain considerable prestige.;NM35AASITH12021_.mp3
Hasn't any effort been made to recover it?;
Some unsuccessful attempts have been made. I truly don't know why a more concerted effort isn't made, however.;NM35AASITH12027_.mp3
How do I get to this valley?;
You simply need to follow the east passage... there's an exit there which will lead you up to the surface. Look for Tariga... she is in that area and can probably help you.;NM35AASITH12029_.mp3
Gain prestige?;
Isn't that what you're interested in? Although I suppose you could also keep it...;NM35AASITH12031_.mp3
What do you know about the sword's powers?;
Well... the legends say the sword had dark power, but that may only be a story. We will never know unless we can examine it more closely.;NM35AASITH12033_.mp3
I've got to be going.;
I imagine you've got a lot to do.;NM35AASITH12035_.mp3
Ajunta Pall the ancient Sith Lord?;
The very same.;NM35AASITH12023_.mp3
Do you know anything about his sword?;
A little. Some of us believe it may be found in his tomb in the Valley of the Dark Lords. Whoever found the sword could gain great prestige.;NM35AASITH12025_.mp3
I am. Anything you can help me with?;
Hmm. That depends. Do you know anything about Ajunta Pall?;NM35AASITH12013_.mp3
What are you doing here?;
Still working to earn prestige, are you?;NM35AASITH12037_.mp3
I understand that Yuthura is dead. Good... perhaps I will be Master Uthar's next apprentice! How glorious that would be!;NM35AALASH07000_.mp3
You beat me. Go on, gloat, I could care less. I'll succeed next time.;NM35AALASH07001_.mp3
You are such a fool. I cannot believe that you were gullible enough to allow me to return with the holocron. I gained considerable prestige for it, you know.;NM35AALASH07002_.mp3
You won't get away with this! I'll kill you!;
Commentary: I like the sound of this! Warming up blasters... on your command, master!;NM35AALASH07004_.mp3
You're joking, of course. You want to fight me here? In the academy?;NM35AALASH07005_.mp3
That's right!;
Ha ha ha! Oh, I wonder what Master Uthar will think of this! Alright, then... you have yourself a fight!;NM35AALASH07007_.mp3
I suppose not.;
I thought not. Get lost, then, will you? I'm busy.;NM35AALASH07009_.mp3
But I helped you get the holocron!;
So? That's your problem, not mine.;NM35AALASH07011_.mp3
You betrayed me, you traitorous...!;
Ha ha ha! Look... either do something about it or run along, will you? I have prestige to earn.;NM35AALASH07013_.mp3
Fine. I'll go, now.;
Do run along... you have a long way to catch up, after all.;NM35AALASH07099_.mp3
Mmm. Don't trip or kill yourself or anything.;NM35AALASH07100_.mp3
I'll get more prestige and catch up to you. Count on it.;NM35AALASH07101_.mp3
You? I remember you from the colony. I can't believe you actually made it into the academy.;NM35AALASH07015_.mp3
Who are you?;
My name is Lashowe. Remember it, for I'll be the one who earns the prestige to move on. You'll have to be satisfied with next year, I suppose.;NM35AALASH07017_.mp3
You're trying to become a Sith as well?;
Just figured that out, did you? It just so happens that I have a sure-fire way of pulling ahead in this little contest of ours. You don't really have a chance.;NM35AALASH07021_.mp3
And what way is that?;
I've found an artifact that will impress Uthar far more than anything you could ever scrounge up. I'll win for sure.;NM35AALASH07023_.mp3
Why haven't you brought it to Uthar yet?;
I don't have it just yet. I'll get it... when I'm good and ready.;NM35AALASH07025_.mp3
Where is this artifact?;
Hah! Like I would tell you. Why don't I just let you rob me while you're at it?;NM35AALASH07027_.mp3
It's guarded, isn't it?;
So what if it is? I'll get it eventually, regardless. Nothing good comes without a bit of a fight... that's the Sith motto, more or less.;NM35AALASH07029_.mp3
[Persuade/Lie] Maybe I could help you get it?;
Now where are you going with this, I wonder?;NM35AALASH07031_.mp3
Shut up, old man, and don't spoil anything or I'll twist that scrawny neck of yours.;NM35AALASH07032_.mp3
It was just an idle question. Don't get so testy, damn it.;NM35AALASH07033_.mp3
[Success] Help me get it? I don't know...;NM35AALASH07040_.mp3
Hmph. I suppose I *could* use some help. The artifact I know of certainly won't be easy to take. But why should I work with you?;NM35AALASH07048_.mp3
[Force Persuade] Because you want to work with me.;
[Success] Yes, I do... want to work with you. I suppose it's possible that Master Uthar could award both of us prestige. We'd be ahead of the others, for sure...;NM35AALASH07050_.mp3
Unfortunately, the holocron lies in the gullet of a tuk'ata mother. I can arrange for us to 'meet' her, but you're going to have to help me in putting her down.;NM35AALASH07061_.mp3
That make sense to you? Go into the valley when you're prepared enough. I'll be amongst the central pillars, near the north end.;NM35AALASH07062_.mp3
And I'm just supposed to trust you?;
And I'm just supposed to trust *you*? You're the one who asked to work on this, remember?;NM35AALASH07064_.mp3
You watch me and I'll watch you. I don't trust you any more than you trust me. If you don't like that, don't come.;NM35AALASH07065_.mp3
Why do you think this holocron is so important?;
Because it probably contains secrets from the time when the Sith ruins on this planet first existed. You don't think that Master Uthar would find that impressive?;NM35AALASH07067_.mp3
What is a holocron?;
A holocron... this holocron, anyway... is an ancient recording device. It can store and display large amounts of information.;NM35AALASH07069_.mp3
See you there.;
Remember: the central pillars in the valley. I'll be waiting, so don't take too long.;NM35AALASH07071_.mp3
[Failure] Trying to force me to agree with you, hey? Don't make me laugh. You want my cooperation, you'll have to get it the old-fashioned way.;NM35AALASH07051_.mp3
[Persuade] Because together we will be unbeatable.;
[Success] Hmmm. You make a decent case. I suppose it's possible that Master Uthar could award both of us prestige. We'd be ahead of the others, for sure...;NM35AALASH07053_.mp3
I want something out of this, first, however. I want you to tell me about some lead you have for where I could find more prestige.;NM35AALASH07057_.mp3
[Lie] There is a powerful Sith cloak in the furthest tomb in the valley.;
[Success] Oh? I hadn't heard about that. Fair enough... I will have to look into it.;NM35AALASH07059_.mp3
You've given me a lead, so I'll let you in on my plan. The artifact that I've discovered is an ancient Jedi holocron.;NM35AALASH07060_.mp3
[Failure] How gullible to you believe me to be? The furthest tomb? Yeah right. Find your own prestige.;NM35AALASH07072_.mp3
Do you know about the hermit in the hills that kidnaps students?;
I thought that was a myth. Perhaps you are correct, however... it may be worth prestige to investigate.;NM35AALASH07074_.mp3
There are some renegades hiding on the surface which Master Uthar wants killed.;
Oh? I hadn't heard about them. It certainly merits looking into.;NM35AALASH07076_.mp3
I've heard there's an artifact sword in the tomb of Freedon Nadd.;
I think I have heard of that. But it's good enough... at least I know you're telling the truth.;NM35AALASH07078_.mp3
Hmm. You could go and talk to Kel Algwinn.;
He's... one of the students? Yes, I've met the sniveler. I think I know where you're going with this... good, yes, I accept.;NM35AALASH07080_.mp3
But I don't know any leads...;
Then you'll just have to come back when you do. Of course, I may have changed my mind by then...;NM35AALASH07082_.mp3
Forget it! I'm not giving you any leads!;
Then you're on your own.;NM35AALASH07084_.mp3
[Failure] Forget it. I never liked you to begin with, and I'm not about to work with you.;NM35AALASH07054_.mp3
So run along and get your own prestige, will you? Thanks ever so much.;NM35AALASH07086_.mp3
[Persuade] I've always wanted to work with a beautiful woman.;
[Success] Flattery, is it? I... suppose it's possible that Master Uthar could award both of us prestige. We'd be ahead of the others, for sure...;NM35AALASH07088_.mp3
[Failure] Hmmm... no. No, it's not worth it. I'll figure out how to get the artifact, myself.;NM35AALASH07085_.mp3
Fine, forget it.;
Fine by me.;NM35AALASH07046_.mp3
[Failure] Hah! Forget it. I'm not going to be tricked so easily. Just move along, now.;NM35AALASH07041_.mp3
What? Sith don't co-operate on things like this...;NM35AALASH07034_.mp3
Quiet, already!;NM35AALASH07035_.mp3
Don't you shush me, Carth Onasi!;NM35AALASH07036_.mp3
Keep it up and I'll gag you. Are you forgetting where we are? Now be quiet.;NM35AALASH07037_.mp3
This is not wise. She'll be as willing to lie as you are.;
Yeah, but if we do it first, we win. Shush up, Big Z.;NM35AALASH07039_.mp3
[Lie] Maybe I could help you get it?;
You're lying. You don't have anything.;
You go ahead and think that. I'll enjoy the look on your face when I win.;NM35AALASH07044_.mp3
I have to go.;
Perhaps we could work together?;
You talk big, but that's about it.;
And what do you have to brag about? You haven't earned any prestige at all.;NM35AALASH07090_.mp3
Uh-huh. Well, you may be the competition, but I've still got the edge on you.;NM35AALASH07091_.mp3
You may have more prestige than me, but that won't last long, just you wait and see.;NM35AALASH07092_.mp3
I remember you. I challenge you to a duel!;
A duel? Fine, you run along and get ready while I go gain some prestige. Idiot.;NM35AALASH07094_.mp3
You don't remember? My name is Lashowe. We met in the colony, ever so briefly.;NM35AALASH07018_.mp3
I challenge you to a duel.;
I must go.;
[Persuade] I'd like to help you retrieve your artifact.;
I remember you from the colony. You seem alright, though you'll not win the right to train before me.;NM35AALASH07096_.mp3
Hello. It is... good to see you again.;NM13AAYUTH22000_.mp3
Yuthura! So you made it here after all.;
I did. You told me I should rethink my path, and I did. You were right.;NM13AAYUTH22002_.mp3
It's been very hard to let go of all those thoughts... about power and strength and victory. I don't know if I'll ever be completely free of them.;NM13AAYUTH22005_.mp3
The real irony is that, despite what the Sith Code says, I've never felt more free. I think I might... be able to find a little peace here. Finally.;NM13AAYUTH22006_.mp3
So the Jedi Council will let you stay?;
For now. They've been very welcoming... more than I expected. I met my old master. He... he cried when he saw me.;NM13AAYUTH22008_.mp3
I was embarrassed to see his weakness. Old habits die hard. But... it felt good, too. It felt good to know he missed me, that he worried about me.;NM13AAYUTH22009_.mp3
The Council said they would give me time to decide if I wanted to try again, if I was ready. I don't know. There's... there's so much that I've done.;NM13AAYUTH22010_.mp3
You've got a lot to atone for, I suppose.;
Yes. Part of me just wants to forget it, to put it behind me... but that isn't right, either. I have to accept it and move on.;NM13AAYUTH22012_.mp3
My old master said he would start exercises with me again... slowly, when I was ready. He said my experience with the dark side could make me a very wise Jedi.;NM13AAYUTH22019_.mp3
"There is no emotion; there is peace. There is no ignorance; there is knowledge. There is no passion; there is serenity. There is no chaos; there is harmony. There is no death; there is the Force.";NM13AAYUTH22020_.mp3
Those words never held such resonance for me until I returned. I'd... like some serenity, some harmony. Wouldn't you?;NM13AAYUTH22021_.mp3
If I had a choice, yes.;
Yes, I suppose your fate still has much in store for you, just as I saw back on Korriban.;NM13AAYUTH22023_.mp3
Do you think you might ever go back to the Sith?;
I don't know. I doubt it. Even if I wanted to, the Sith would never take me back. To them, I am a traitor.;NM13AAYUTH22029_.mp3
But the dark side... that's a different matter. The dark side is not the Sith. I still feel its temptation strongly.;NM13AAYUTH22030_.mp3
My emotions are so strong. Just the other day I nearly attacked a poor Padawan for tripping into me, nearly berated his clumsiness and weakness.;NM13AAYUTH22031_.mp3
I didn't, thankfully, but it's difficult to fight off those feelings. How do you do it?;NM13AAYUTH22032_.mp3
I don't. I do what I like.;
And to think I took my advice to come here from you. Ha ha! Perhaps you should follow your own counsel sometime.;NM13AAYUTH22034_.mp3
The one thing that made me come here was how hard I had to think to remember where I began and where Yuthura the Sith Master ended.;NM13AAYUTH22040_.mp3
That wasn't the person I wanted to be, so how did I end up there? It... it will take some time for me to sort through that, I think.;NM13AAYUTH22041_.mp3
What about all the slavers you wanted to fight?;
You know, I'd forgotten all about that until I spoke to you about it on Korriban. Strange, considering my hate for them is what made me leave the Jedi.;NM13AAYUTH22043_.mp3
I think... I think I've got to help myself, first, before I can help anyone else.;NM13AAYUTH22044_.mp3
Maybe once that happens, I can work with the Jedi to make a difference. They may work slowly, but they do make a difference, don't they?;NM13AAYUTH22045_.mp3
I think they do.;
More than the Sith did. The Sith bring more misery than the slavers ever did... I don't know why I didn't see that before.;NM13AAYUTH22047_.mp3
I may not be able to change everything at once like I wanted to... but it would feel good to really help someone, for a change.;NM13AAYUTH22051_.mp3
Maybe that's a reason to change. Maybe that's a reason to stay. I... I guess I'll see.;NM13AAYUTH22052_.mp3
Why don't you come with me? I could use you at my side.;
That's... very tempting.;NM13AAYUTH22054_.mp3
But I'm not ready to leave here, yet. And I don't belong on the path you have to take... I told you that on Korriban. It's still true.;NM13AAYUTH22055_.mp3
But... perhaps you could come back, afterwards. I could certainly use a friend, then.;NM13AAYUTH22056_.mp3
I'd be glad to be your friend, Yuthura.;
That's good. I look forward to that time. Perhaps we can travel together, then.;NM13AAYUTH22058_.mp3
I've got to go.;
Then may the Force be with you, my friend. I hope we will see each other again.;NM13AAYUTH22025_.mp3
I don't know. I might not be coming back.;
I know. I can... see that about you. I'm not sure that we will meet again. Still... I can hope that is the case.;NM13AAYUTH22060_.mp3
We're not friends.;
Oh. Well, that's too bad. I'm still grateful for what you've done for me, regardless.;NM13AAYUTH22062_.mp3
Maybe a little.;
Not really.;
You believe that? I believe that they're better than the Sith. The Sith bring more misery than the slavers ever did. I don't know why I didn't see that before.;NM13AAYUTH22050_.mp3
I try. I'm not always successful.;
That's the worst thing to hear... how hard it is. I suppose that's the honest answer. The dark side is the easier path for a reason.;NM13AAYUTH22036_.mp3
It's not easy.;
I'm just a natural, I guess.;
You jest, but I think I know how you really feel.;NM13AAYUTH22039_.mp3
That's not really my style.;
That's too bad. A little serenity might be useful considering the fate you have in store for you.;NM13AAYUTH22027_.mp3
You've seen what the dark side can do.;
I suppose I have. It's still tempting, all that power... but I've had my fill of it and it wasn't enough.;NM13AAYUTH22014_.mp3
I think you should at least try.;
I suppose I owe it to you, and to myself, to give the Jedi another chance. I'm not the foolish young girl I once was.;NM13AAYUTH22016_.mp3
I wouldn't worry about it so much.;
It's not that easy for me. There's an... an ache inside me I just can't seem to quench.;NM13AAYUTH22018_.mp3
What? What are you doing here?;
You are the one who suggested I rethink my path. And I have... and you were right.;NM13AAYUTH22004_.mp3
Good luck, my friend. May the Force be with you.;NM13AAYUTH22063_.mp3
What do you know? I guess he wasn't a 'true Sith' after all.;NM38ABMEKE03000_.mp3
I can't believe that I'm alive. You saved me... you could have easily just answered those questions and let me die.;NM38ABMEKE03002_.mp3
Nobody deserves to die like that. Nobody.;
Yeah, well... I see what you mean. I've never... I mean, I've never been on that side of the fence before. It makes you think.;NM38ABMEKE03004_.mp3
I'd be dead if you weren't... I mean, if you were a proper Sith. But you're not, are you? Don't worry... I won't tell anyone.;NM38ABMEKE03006_.mp3
[Persuade] This could be your chance to change your ways, Mekel.;
[Success] You mean... the light side?;NM38ABMEKE03010_.mp3
It's never too late for anyone to feel compassion... or remorse. Not even you, Mekel.;NM38ABMEKE03012_.mp3
I've never thought about that. Can you... can you even go back? I've done some... I mean, I've hurt a lot of people.;NM38ABMEKE03014_.mp3
You can always turn back to the light.;NM38ABMEKE03016_.mp3
There's always remorse. And atonement. That's the harder path, though, boy. Think you can do that?;NM38ABMEKE03018_.mp3
I... I don't think the light side is for me. But... maybe neither are the Sith. Maybe it's time for me to leave. Thanks, I suppose... and good luck.;NM38ABMEKE03020_.mp3
[Failure] I... I don't know. I don't think that's for me. I don't know if the Sith are really, either, I'll have to see.;NM38ABMEKE03022_.mp3
Well... you can have those writings he mentioned. I won't fight you for them. Master Uthar will be very pleased with you if you give them to him, you know.;NM38ABMEKE03028_.mp3
I don't suppose the fact that he's weak as a newborn kith pup has anything to do with his decision?;NM38ABMEKE03041_.mp3
It is a small mercy, Carth, and that's a start.;NM38ABMEKE03043_.mp3
I'll head back to the academy. I need some rest.;NM38ABMEKE03045_.mp3
Commentary: You are going to trust this organic meatbag, master? Very dicey decision.;NM38ABMEKE03030_.mp3
*angry beeping*;
Commentary: The master keeps me around to comment on his decisions. Don't you master?;NM38ABMEKE03034_.mp3
Not really.;
*mechanical snickering*;
Sure, why not?;
See? Stupid bucket of bolts.;NM38ABMEKE03039_.mp3
Sorry, but I can't take that chance. You have to die.;
Ahh! I'll kill you! You won't get away with this!!;NM38ABMEKE03048_.mp3
I'd appreciate that.;
I guess there's more than one way to be a Sith. Hard to believe.;NM38ABMEKE03024_.mp3
I needed the help in fighting Jorak.;
Yeah, well, don't let it go to your head.;
I just saved you for last!;
[The salvage droids are busy scanning and scavenging the remains of this Republic escape pod.];
They say a brawl broke out at the swoop races this year. Sound like things are getting out of control in the Lower City... maybe the Sith should go and clean it up!;NM02AEMUSI26000_.mp3
Nice outfit. You steal those clothes from a bum in the Lower City? Oh well, I guess you don't have to have good taste in clothes to come and enjoy the music.;NM02AEMUSI26002_.mp3
The band is pretty good, but I'm getting a little sick of them. If it wasn't for the Sith quarantine maybe we could get somebody new in here to play!;NM02AEMUSI26004_.mp3
Check out those Twi'lek dancers. I don't know who designed their outfits, but that man deserves a raise!;NM02AEMUSI26006_.mp3
Did you hear? The great Bendak Starkiller is dead. Killed in the duel ring - by a woman! Can't say I'm surprised. The guy was retired for so long he probably lost his edge.;NM02AEMUSI26008_.mp3
So I heard Bendak Starkiller finally lost a death match. Can't say I'm surprised. The guy was retired for so long he probably lost his edge.;NM02AEMUSI26010_.mp3
Have you heard? Somebody's going to fight Bendak Starkiller in an illegal death match! Heh heh. I wonder if the old guy's still got what it takes. You figure he'd be out of practice, right?;NM02AEMUSI26012_.mp3
Well, people complain, but things under the Sith really aren't so bad. Sure, we can't leave the planet, but we're still allowed to come here and listen to the music.;NM02AEMUSI26014_.mp3
[Since there is no bounty on your head that he can collect, Calo Nord has no interest in you.];
Hey - you're one of the duelists! The one they call the Mysterious Stranger - sure, I know you.;NM02AEDUEL10000_.mp3
You beat Bendak Starkiller! I can't believe it... you actually beat him!;NM02AEDUEL10002_.mp3
I hear you're going to fight Bendak Starkiller! This is great - I'm finally going to get to see a real death match!;NM02AEDUEL10004_.mp3
I guess Twitch is next up for you, eh? Good luck - you'll need it!;NM02AEDUEL10006_.mp3
I saw Bendak Starkiller sitting in the Pazaak room. I wish he'd come out of retirement.;NM02AEDUEL10008_.mp3
I couldn't believe Duncan's last match. How could he lose to a raw rookie - no disrespect, of course. Duncan's so pathetic!;NM02AEDUEL10010_.mp3
Hey, Stranger... I like watching you in the ring. It's enough to make a girl get all flushed.;NM02AEDUEL10012_.mp3
I like your style, Stranger. You're the best thing the duel ring's seen since Bendak Starkiller retired!;NM02AEDUEL10014_.mp3
Can I have your autoprint, Stranger? I'm your biggest fan!;NM02AEDUEL10016_.mp3
Why doesn't Duncan just give the sport up? He's terrible.;NM02AEDUEL10018_.mp3
I love watching Ice fight! She proves this isn't just a man's game!;NM02AEDUEL10020_.mp3
Twitch is my favorite - he's wild!;NM02AEDUEL10022_.mp3
I never saw a death match before. I thought it would be exciting, but it was actually kind of gross...;NM02AEDUEL10024_.mp3
I hope the authorities don't hear about this death match - they'll shut it down if they find out!;NM02AEDUEL10026_.mp3
None of these fighters would stand a chance against Bendak Starkiller!;NM02AEDUEL10028_.mp3
Look - it's the Mysterious Stranger! You're just great! I watch all of your matches!;NM02AEDUEL10030_.mp3
You're not so hot, Stranger. Everybody beats Duncan;NM02AEDUEL10032_.mp3
Marl's been around forever. I wonder if he ever thinks about retiring?;NM02AEDUEL10034_.mp3
[Gandroff looks at you, shaking with fear and rage. He says nothing, however, and must feel very helpless before you.];
Go on, take a walk. My mood is sour enough without you here.;NM17AF07GA03000_.mp3
Well now, what can Gandroff do for you? It's been a while since I've had anyone bother talking to me.;NM17AF07GA03001_.mp3
I saw you down by the track, didn't I? Or was that someone else? I've been distracted by what happened on Taris.;NM17AF07GA03003_.mp3
I was at Motta's, yes. Can I ask a question or two?;
I'm not sure what I have that you would be interested in. I... I'm... I'm just an old swoop-jock that doesn't have the head for it anymore. Heh.;NM17AF07GA03006_.mp3
I want to ask about you and racing.;
I... I am not used to such attention. Uh, what do you want me to repeat?;NM17AF07GA03008_.mp3
Is this the best place for racing?;
Best place to race is wherever the track treats you sweet and your times are golden. It's that simple.;NM17AF07GA03011_.mp3
You get hung up on any one track and... and you'll end up like me. Heh heh. My favorite stop was Taris... Taris, yes... always looked forward to going back.;NM17AF07GA03013_.mp3
Now I don't want to touch my bike at all. Maybe I wasn't in the winner's circle lately, but I still raced for sport, you know? Vroom vroom.;NM17AF07GA03015_.mp3
What made Taris any different than here?;
Oh, I... I don't want to get into that, miss. Let's just say that there was always someone trackside rooting for me. Heh heh.;NM17AF07GA03017_.mp3
That doesn't matter now. You can't ask for more certain closure than the whole planet being gone. Poof. Boom. Heh. Gone.;NM17AF07GA03021_.mp3
How long did you race?;
Oh, well past my prime, by any measure. I started late, too. Not like the kids out there now. Some of them are too young. Hm.;NM17AF07GA03023_.mp3
Why do you think that?;
It's a cutthroat business. I... I've seen some of them burn out after a year. They get dangerous, and don't live long.;NM17AF07GA03025_.mp3
That's not everyone, of course, but... but it happens. I'm a has-been, I'll admit, but... but dying while you're on top is still dying. I'll pass.;NM17AF07GA03027_.mp3
What can you tell me about the other racers?;
I don't really talk to any of them. I know Zoriis from the circuit and you couldn't ask for a tougher lady. Smart too.;NM17AF07GA03029_.mp3
I don't know the younger guys, but... but I've been watching Nico. Uh, good to see someone doing it for the love of the race.;NM17AF07GA03031_.mp3
What makes him any different than the others?;
I don't know, but some people just have something that lets the bike take them. It's like the air stops pushing back.;NM17AF07GA03033_.mp3
"I think you know what I mean; when the wind decides to stop fighting? Hmm. You've felt it. I can tell by your times.";NM17AF07GA03035_.mp3
Let's go back to my first questions.;
All right then.;NM17AF07GA03040_.mp3
I'm looking for something. Who knows this planet best?;
Ask me again in a few years and it will be me. Heh heh. I'm probably not going back out on the circuit... if there is one.;NM17AF07GA03043_.mp3
But, for now, I don't know any more than the next guy. You should try the locals. Jawas maybe. Funny little guys. Li'l jawa, li'l jawa.;NM17AF07GA03045_.mp3
I have to leave. Goodbye.;
Uh, keep safe. Yup. Yup. Seems like tough times are coming.;NM17AF07GA03047_.mp3
Your answers are tiresome. Have you anything of use to say?;
No need to get all confrontational. What are... what are we, Sand People? You wouldn't find much fight left in me, anyway.;NM17AF07GA03052_.mp3
[Force Persuade] I'm tired of your voice, old man. Be *quiet.*;
[Success] [Gandroff stares, his lip quivering. The fear you've put in him has shaken him out of his stupor, but he can't say a word.];
I don't want a fight. I just want money.;
Then race for it! By the Force, what do you think an old man like me would have? Bah, take it all.;NM17AF07GA03054_.mp3
Now, leave me to my drinking. I don't think we'd have much to talk about. Not if I can help it.;NM17AF07GA03063_.mp3
Then just die, old man. I'm not backing down.;
Why bother? I mean, will this pay for ship maintenance or whatever? You're just looking for coward credits.;NM17AF07GA03057_.mp3
Bah, if it will get you to leave, just take what credits I have. Take em. Take em. Now leave me. I don't want anything to do with you.;NM17AF07GA03059_.mp3
I meant no harm. I apologize.;
Doesn't seem like it. I've seen your kind before. Does it make you feel big, pushing old men around? You're all the same. Heh.;NM17AF07GA03061_.mp3
"That's an old track tale, you know; when the wind decides to stop fighting? I used to have that. Heh... not any more.";NM17AF07GA03036_.mp3
I don't know the younger guys, but I suppose they're in good hands. What you did for Nico was good to see.;NM17AF07GA03037_.mp3
I don't know the younger guys, but after you pushed that deal on Nico, I doubt they'd trust me or anyone.;NM17AF07GA03038_.mp3
A woman. I never won on Taris, but it was always my first stop on the circuit, and the last if I could help it. Heh.;NM17AF07GA03019_.mp3
Ahh, something I know. Well... well, something I used to know. Um, my racing days are behind me. Gandroff is the name.;NM17AF07GA03009_.mp3
Sure, not a problem. Might as well try to pass along some of what I know. Heh heh. My racing days are pretty much done.;NM17AF07GA03048_.mp3
I wanted to ask a few questions, if you have the time.;
I just have some questions. Don't bother getting friendly.;
Uh, well, I wouldn't worry about that, not with your attitude. Go on then, ask away. I'm ready.;NM17AF07GA03050_.mp3
I don't care about your faded glory. I'm not here for storytime.;
Usually it's some kid wondering what my old racing days were like... but that was back on Taris. Seems like a long time ago.;NM17AF07GA03004_.mp3
I hear you're pretty good on the track. Yeah. I remember my first paycheck for racing. Heh heh. So small you couldn't see it, but I remember.;NM17AF07GA03064_.mp3
Hello again. I hear you're pretty fast out on the track. Remember these days. Yes sir. Once they're gone, whoo, they're gone.;NM17AF07GA03065_.mp3
I heard about you setting a track record. Wish I'd seen it. Ah, it would've just made me want to be out there myself.;NM17AF07GA03066_.mp3
Well, imagine you coming back. Heh heh. Something you want?;NM17AF07GA03067_.mp3
[With enemies nearby, this might not be the best time to talk to Mission.];
[Mission seems rather distant. Maybe you should talk to her.];
[Speak to Mission.];
Huh? Oh... sorry. I was thinking about Taris. I still can't believe it's gone! I mean, I grew up there and now it's... it's... it's just gone!;NGLOBEMISS13000_.mp3
Malak will pay for what he did, Mission.;
Yeah... I know. The Jedi got rid of Revan, so I figure Malak's days are numbered, too. But that doesn't make the pain go away, you know?;NGLOBEMISS13002_.mp3
Look, I'm not saying I can't go on or anything like that. It's just... it's a shock, you know? I mean, I knew the Sith were evil and all, but the reality of it kind of slaps you in the face.;NGLOBEMISS13007_.mp3
But I suppose that's why we need to stop Malak, right? The more time I spend dwelling on Taris the more chance some other planet will get wiped out. I guess that's what it comes down to.;NGLOBEMISS13008_.mp3
"So don't worry about me; I'll be okay. And if you need my help against Malak or the Sith, I'll be there for you!";NGLOBEMISS13009_.mp3
I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.;
I don't really think there's anything you can say. I just have to find some way to deal with it, I guess. It'll take some time.;NGLOBEMISS13004_.mp3
Taris is a wasteland - get over it!;
What? How can you be so cruel! Millions of people dead and you all you can say is 'get over it'?;NGLOBEMISS13006_.mp3
Hey, there. What can I do for you?;NGLOBEMISS13010_.mp3
I just wanted to talk. About me being Revan.;
It seems to me that if you don't really remember anything about being Revan, then it doesn't really matter anymore. You are who you are now, right?;NM40ADCART01016_.mp3
So it doesn't bother you at all?;
I don't see the Sith Lord standing here, I see a friend who's been with us through thick and thin! Remember - Malak's the one who tried to destroy Taris!;NM40ADCART01046_.mp3
"Big Z and I will stick by you. We owe you our lives; we won't desert you now!";NM40ADCART01050_.mp3
I want to know a little more about you, Mission.;
Really? You want to know about me? Nobody's ever really been interested in me before. What did you want to know?;NGLOBEMISS13040_.mp3
How did you and Zaalbar hook up?;
Big Z's my family, you know? My parents... well, I guess they're dead. It was just me on my own until the day I saw Zaalbar in the Lower City. I could tell right away he was in trouble.;NGLOBEMISS13043_.mp3
This was before the gang wars were out of hand, but even then the Vulkars were scum. A few of them were hassling Big Z, trying to pick a fight - but he wasn't looking for trouble.;NGLOBEMISS13044_.mp3
Who'd want to pick a fight with a Wookiee?;
Hey, nobody said the Vulkars was smart. But there were three of them, so maybe they figured they could handle him. I don't know.;NGLOBEMISS13046_.mp3
Anyway, I don't like Vulkars at the best of times. And when I saw them picking on this poor Wookiee - all alone on a strange planet, overwhelmed by the big city - I just lost it.;NGLOBEMISS13048_.mp3
I screamed out 'Leave him alone, you core-slimes!' and charged right at them. One of them saw me coming and slapped me so hard he just about knocked me cold.;NGLOBEMISS13049_.mp3
You're lucky he didn't fry you with a blaster.;
Hey, I don't need a lecture from you. You ain't my mother! I knew what I was doing.;NGLOBEMISS13051_.mp3
Those Vulkars didn't scare me. They're nothing but cowards. I knew how to deal with them. Of course, I never got the chance.;NGLOBEMISS13054_.mp3
I guess Zaalbar didn't like seeing me get smacked around. He let out this howl and yanked that Vulkar a meter up off the ground and held him there by his throat.;NGLOBEMISS13055_.mp3
What did the other two Vulkars do?;
The other two screamed and ran off. Can't say I blame them. The first time you see an angry Wookiee up close it isn't a pretty sight.;NGLOBEMISS13057_.mp3
I thought Zaalbar was going to rip that punk's arms off and beat him to death with his own fists. The Vulkar was so scared he fainted. Or maybe Big Z's breath just knocked him out.;NGLOBEMISS13058_.mp3
Mission!;
Sorry Zaalbar, but I keep telling you to brush those choppers once in a while. Why do you think I won't stand downwind when you're talking?;NGLOBEMISS13060_.mp3
Anyway, I knew those Vulkars would be back with friends, so I grabbed Zaalbar and we took off. Ever since then we've been a team. We look out for each other, you know?;NGLOBEMISS13062_.mp3
How did Zaalbar end up on Taris?;
He was fleeing some kind of trouble back on Kashyyyk. That's all I know, really. Big Z doesn't like to talk about it. In case you didn't notice he's the strong, silent type.;NGLOBEMISS13064_.mp3
Doesn't much matter to me, though. I accept him for what he is, not what he was. Me and Zaalbar like to live in the present.;NGLOBEMISS13065_.mp3
How did you survive before you met Zaalbar?;
What's that supposed to mean? You think I can't take care of myself? I've got street smarts! I know how to get by on my own!;NGLOBEMISS13067_.mp3
In fact, I look out for Zaalbar more than he looks out for me, you know? Big Z's a little bit too gullible to make it alone on the mean streets of the Lower City.;NGLOBEMISS13068_.mp3
We should get back to the task at hand.;
Yeah, I suppose you're right. Like I used to tell my brother, fast talk and slick words don't get the job done.;NGLOBEMISS13070_.mp3
I didn't know you had a brother.;
My brother's a touchy subject, you know? It just so happens I don't really feel like talking about him right now. Nothing personal. Let's just get back to the business at hand, okay?;NGLOBEMISS13077_.mp3
I hope I don't have to listen to you prattle on about your brother now!;
I keep telling Zaalbar to brush those choppers of his, but he never listens. Just stay upwind when he's speaking and you'll be fine.;NGLOBEMISS13061_.mp3
Did Zaalbar kill him?;
Are you kidding? Big Z ain't like that! He's just a big old softie inside. Of course, the Vulkars didn't know that.;NGLOBEMISS13072_.mp3
Could your story be more boring? I've heard enough.;
Fine - I won't tell how Zaalbar and I hooked up. Sheesh! First you ask about it, then you say you don't want to hear it! You're as bad as my brother used to be!;NGLOBEMISS13075_.mp3
Smacking a kid? Those Vulkars have no class!;
Hey - don't treat me like I'm a little girl! I ain't no kid - I'm fourteen years old!;NGLOBEMISS13053_.mp3
That'll teach you to stick your nose where it doesn't belong!;
Go on.;
Sorry, but we don't have time for this now.;
Where are your parents? Don't you have a family?;
I want to talk to you about your brother.;
Shouldn't we be more worried about getting Zaalbar back from those Wookiees? I don't trust that Chuundar character.;NGLOBEMISS13080_.mp3
I'm not going to worry about Griff anymore. Like you said, he brought this on himself! Besides, he's always treated me like garbage. Now it's payback time!;NGLOBEMISS13186_.mp3
I... I was a little snappish when we last talked. I'm sorry about that. I get a little touchy when it comes to Griff. It's kind of embarassing telling people about him.;NGLOBEMISS13081_.mp3
Embarassing? Why?;
It's complicated. Griff wasn't the most popular guy, he had his faults. But I still loved him, you know? Sometimes people don't understand.;NGLOBEMISS13083_.mp3
I never knew my parents, my brother always looked out for me. He's the one who brought me to Taris. I was just a kid, only five. But I remember the trip - if you could call it that.;NGLOBEMISS13084_.mp3
We were stuffed inside a packing crate in a star freighter's cargo hold with just enough food and water to make the trip. Not exactly first class, you know?;NGLOBEMISS13085_.mp3
You were stowaways?;
I don't know the whole story - I was pretty young. But my brother owed a lot of money. Might even have been a few arrest warrants out for him, I don't know.;NGLOBEMISS13087_.mp3
The only way to get off the planet was to smuggle ourselves out. I mean, I don't want to make it sound like we were criminals... well, maybe my brother was.;NGLOBEMISS13088_.mp3
See, this is why I don't like to talk about it. It makes Griff sound worse than he really was. My brother had his problems, but he always looked out for me.;NGLOBEMISS13089_.mp3
He's family. You have to stick by your family.;
Yeah - that's what I'm trying to say! Without my brother I don't know where I'd be.;NGLOBEMISS13091_.mp3
He gambled. And drank. And he was always borrowing money for his latest get rich quick scheme. But he had a good heart, you know? He taught me how to survive.;NGLOBEMISS13093_.mp3
"He showed me how to slice into a computer's security system; how to get inside a locked building without the entrance codes, and how to spot a wealthy mark for a quick shell game.";NGLOBEMISS13094_.mp3
Sounds like he was nothing but a petty criminal.;
Hey, you don't know what it's like! You need those skills here in the Lower City. Griff did right by me.;NGLOBEMISS13096_.mp3
I really miss him since he left. I keep hoping he'll come back some day. He promised me he would.;NGLOBEMISS13097_.mp3
Why did he leave?;
He fell in with a bad crowd. It's all Lena's fault. She's the one who took him from me! Just batted those long lashes at him and off he went!;NGLOBEMISS13099_.mp3
Who's Lena?;
I don't want to talk about Griff and Lena - just the thought of that space tramp makes my blood boil! Subject's closed as far as I'm concerned!;NGLOBEMISS13101_.mp3
If I'm going to be any help to you I can't be worrying about my brother running off with some intergalactic skank! So, is there something else you need?;NGLOBEMISS13102_.mp3
Do you know anything about the planet we're on?;
Taris is a pretty good place to grow up, all things considered. Just stick to the area you belong in and stay out of Davik's business and you'll be fine.;NGLOBEMISS13012_.mp3
Tell me about the Upper City.;
The Upper City's got some nice shops and all, but it's boring! The only time I go up there is if I need free healing from Zelka at his medical facility.;NGLOBEMISS13014_.mp3
Tell me about the Lower City.;
What can I say? The Lower City was a great place to hang out until the Vulkars started that gang war. Now you can't even walk the streets without getting shot at!;NGLOBEMISS13016_.mp3
Tell me about the Undercity.;
It can be pretty nasty down there: you've got rakghouls crawling around looking for their next meal, and the Gamorrean slavers like to set up their bases in the sewers.;NGLOBEMISS13018_.mp3
"And then there's the Outcast village - a collection of people banished to the Undercity for their crimes. I mostly avoid the village, though; it's pretty depressing seeing how they live.";NGLOBEMISS13019_.mp3
Tell me about Davik.;
I tend to keep my nose out of an intergalactic crime lord's business, you know? I can't tell you much that isn't common knowledge.;NGLOBEMISS13021_.mp3
Extortion, slavery, smuggling: Davik's got a piece of all the action here on Taris. Even the swoop gangs know better than to get in his way.;NGLOBEMISS13022_.mp3
Thanks for the info.;
Hey, no problem. I'm here to help, right?;NGLOBEMISS13024_.mp3
"I'm not the one you should ask about Dantooine. I didn't even know there was a Jedi Academy here; I always thought it was just a bunch of settlers and farmers!";NGLOBEMISS13025_.mp3
Sorry I can't be more help, you know? Is there anything else I can do for you?;NGLOBEMISS13026_.mp3
Do you feel like playing some Pazaak?;
Want to practice your skills, eh? Sure - I'll play you a few hands. Just for practice, though. I don't want to bet with you.;NGLOBEMISS13034_.mp3
Nothing. Never mind.;
Okay... have it your way.;NGLOBEMISS13206_.mp3
Well, I know Zaalbar's from Kashyyyk, but he never liked to talk about it. He wouldn't even tell me why he left. I don't think the Wookiees like outsiders much.;NGLOBEMISS13027_.mp3
I don't know anything about Korriban, but I get a bad feeling in this place. If there's such a thing as an 'evil' planet, this is it!;NGLOBEMISS13028_.mp3
I always heard Tatooine was nothing but a rock covered by a bunch of worthless sand. I can't even figure out why Czerka Corp. set up their mining operations here.;NGLOBEMISS13029_.mp3
"Manaan's the source for all the kolto in the galaxy; that's why those fish-faced Selkath can stay neutral in this whole Sith-Republic war. But I don't know much else about this place.";NGLOBEMISS13030_.mp3
How am I supposed to know anything about this planet? It's an uncharted world in an unexplored quadrant! I didn't even know this planet was here!;NGLOBEMISS13031_.mp3
Didn't you come here back when you were the Dark Lord? If you don't remember anything about this place then I guess we're just stumbling in the dark.;NGLOBEMISS13032_.mp3
What are you talking about? What happened?;
Let's get back to our mission, Mission.;
Mission - mission: is that supposed to be a joke? Like I've only heard that about a million times in my life! Okay, I can take a hint. You don't want to hear anymore. That's just fine.;NGLOBEMISS13105_.mp3
Griff doesn't sound like he's big on keeping promises.;
Why do you got to go putting my brother down like that? That's just mean! Besides, it wasn't his idea to leave!;NGLOBEMISS13107_.mp3
Pretty handy skills to have, Mission.;
Yeah, Griff did right by me.;NGLOBEMISS13109_.mp3
What kind of problems did your brother have?;
I really don't care about your traumatic childhood.;
Oh... yeah. I understand. We've got bigger bantha to hunt, right? I just miss Griff, is all. I keep thinking things might have been different, you know?;NGLOBEMISS13112_.mp3
How could your brother do that to a five year old?;
You don't have to tell me anything if you don't want to.;
No, I want to tell you. Zaalbar's a great listener but it might be nice to talk about this with someone who doesn't reply in growls and grunts.;NGLOBEMISS13114_.mp3
I don't have time for this.;
Right, sure. I understand. We've got all this other stuff going on what with the Sith and all. You're busy. No problem. Maybe later we can talk. When you have more time, you know?;NGLOBEMISS13116_.mp3
I'm not really in the mood to talk about my brother right now. Maybe we should just stay focused on the job at hand, you know?;NGLOBEMISS13117_.mp3
So, is there anything else you need?;NGLOBEMISS13118_.mp3
I'm sorry for the way I acted before. It's just that when it comes to Lena I tend to get a little worked up.;NGLOBEMISS13119_.mp3
Why do you hate her so much?;
My brother and me had a good thing going. Sure, Griff had his run-ins with the law on Taris. But we got by okay. Until Lena came and ruined everything.;NGLOBEMISS13121_.mp3
She was a dancer at the cantina where my brother used to go to play Pazaak. Griff could be a real smooth talker, and it wasn't long before the two of them were dating.;NGLOBEMISS13122_.mp3
But Lena was used to dating rich Tarisian nobles - guys with mountains of credits. Griff could never give her the kind of lifestyle she was used to, no matter how hard he worked.;NGLOBEMISS13123_.mp3
You mean no matter how much he stole.;
I'm not going to pretend Griff wasn't a hustler and a con-artist, but that doesn't mean you can just insult him! He did what he did to look out for me!;NGLOBEMISS13125_.mp3
I thought Lena would brush Griff off when she saw how poor he was, but for some reason she stuck around. I guess she saw the potential for a big payday down the road.;NGLOBEMISS13126_.mp3
Sounds like you're jealous.;
I saw Lena for what she really was - a busty, credit-grubbing cantina rat! She used Griff and took away the only family I had!;NGLOBEMISS13128_.mp3
After they'd been together for a few months, Griff told me he was leaving Taris. He and Lena were going to try and make their fortune off-world.;NGLOBEMISS13129_.mp3
He promised as soon as he made enough credits he'd come back and get me and we'd all live like royalty. That was two years ago - I haven't seen him since! I don't even know where he went!;NGLOBEMISS13130_.mp3
How is this Lena's fault?;
Oh, I know what happened! As soon as she got him off Taris Lena sunk her claws into Griff but good! She twisted him around her little finger and made him forget all about me!;NGLOBEMISS13133_.mp3
I know I'll probably never see Griff again. But part of the reason I came with you was the hope that I could find out what happened to my brother.;NGLOBEMISS13134_.mp3
Don't worry - I won't let my search for Griff get in the way of what we're doing. Let's just get back to the task at hand. Is there anything else I can help you with?;NGLOBEMISS13135_.mp3
Maybe something happened to him.;
Sounds like he deserted you.;
We should get back to the job at hand.;
Maybe she actually liked Griff.;
So what happened?;
Did Lena dump him?;
What did she do to you?;
Don't tell me you believe Lena's lies? Griff might be working as a miner on Tatooine, but the rest of her story is bantha poo-doo! You can't trust someone like her.;NGLOBEMISS13142_.mp3
At least Griff's free of her clutches. I'd like to go speak to the Czerka Corp rep on Tatooine, if we have time. Maybe I can arrange to see my brother again.;NGLOBEMISS13143_.mp3
We'll find your brother, Mission.;
I just hope he's not in any kind of trouble when we do.;NGLOBEMISS13145_.mp3
I don't think we'll have time, Mission.;
Sure, I understand. Saving the galaxy and all. All I'm saying is if we get time to make a quick sidetrip to Tatooine... look, just think about it, okay?;NGLOBEMISS13147_.mp3
I've been thinking about Lena and what she said about Griff. You know, how he was always blaming other people for his problems. There might be something to what she said.;NGLOBEMISS13148_.mp3
You mean you believe her story now?;
No, of course not. Not really. But what if... what if it was his idea to leave me behind? I'm not saying Griff would just abandon me.;NGLOBEMISS13150_.mp3
But maybe... maybe he did want to leave me behind. Just temporarily, you know? He might have done that, if he planned on coming back later.;NGLOBEMISS13151_.mp3
But things didn't usually work out for Griff the way he planned, you know? And that's when he'd get in trouble. He was always borrowing money he could never pay back.;NGLOBEMISS13152_.mp3
He might have been trying to skip out on his debts when he left Taris. He would have had to leave his little sister behind so it would look like he was coming back.;NGLOBEMISS13153_.mp3
So he sacrificed you to save his own hide?;
Yeah... well, no. Not exactly. Look, all I'm trying to say is that the more I think back the more I realize I might be idolizing my brother a bit. Not seeing all his faults.;NGLOBEMISS13155_.mp3
I still want to find him. I need to see him again. It's just that I'm not sure how I'll react when I do.;NGLOBEMISS13156_.mp3
When the time comes you'll know what to say, Mission.;
Maybe. We'll see. I don't... I don't want to judge him yet. Maybe Lena was lying. Or maybe... maybe she wasn't.;NGLOBEMISS13158_.mp3
All I know is I'd like to speak to Griff myself. If we have time, I'd like to go talk to the Czerka Corp rep on Tatooine and see what he has to say about where my brother is now.;NGLOBEMISS13159_.mp3
I think he deserves a swift kick in the groin for what he did.;
Kind of like how you came to Taris in the first place.;
Griff may not be perfect, but he is your brother, Mission.;
Talk? What is there to talk about? Those sandpeople took my brother prisoner!;NGLOBEMISS13163_.mp3
Griff may be a slime but we have to go rescue him! We can't just leave him with those... those... those monsters!;NGLOBEMISS13164_.mp3
Don't worry Mission - we'll get him back.;
I knew I could count on you! There's definite fringe benefits to being friends with a Jedi!;NGLOBEMISS13166_.mp3
He's probably already dead, Mission.;
You heard the Czerka rep: the sandpeople sometimes take prisoners. Say what you want about Griff, but he's a survivor. I know he's still alive.;NGLOBEMISS13168_.mp3
I can't make you go after my brother, but you're the only one who can save him. Just think about it, that's all I ask. In the end I know you'll do the right thing.;NGLOBEMISS13171_.mp3
I've got more important things to worry about, Mission.;
I know you're out to save the galaxy and all. But you can't just turn your back on someone who needs your help - you're a Jedi, not a Sith!;NGLOBEMISS13170_.mp3
Look, I'm happy Griff's alive but I'm mad at him right now. And I don't know what kind of job he's got for you, but I don't trust him. It's probably just another scam!;NGLOBEMISS13172_.mp3
I'm worried about Griff and his latest plan. I've got a bad feeling about it. He doesn't know anything about brewing Tarisian ale.;NGLOBEMISS13173_.mp3
And now he's gotten himself mixed up with the Exchange. Sometimes Griff can be so stupid! Part of me just wants to let him get what's coming to him.;NGLOBEMISS13174_.mp3
You can't turn your back on your own brother!;
Why not? He turned his back on me! He abandoned me on Taris, so maybe I should just leave him high and dry now!;NGLOBEMISS13176_.mp3
Maybe a couple broken knee-caps will do him some good! Maybe that's the kind of jolt he needs to turn his life around! Only... what if they do something worse?;NGLOBEMISS13178_.mp3
"They might kill him! I don't want him to die; he doesn't deserve that. But I can't just keep supporting his crazy schemes. Someone has to teach him a lesson!";NGLOBEMISS13179_.mp3
You have to stick by your family, Mission. Even if they're slime sometimes.;
Yeah, I guess you're right. I'm not going to change him. Griff is going to keep on being Griff.;NGLOBEMISS13181_.mp3
Maybe if we get these tach glands for him things will work out. Or maybe he'll finally see the light and turn over a new leaf. I know it's not likely, but it's all I have to hope for.;NGLOBEMISS13182_.mp3
No one can teach him this lesson, Mission. He has to learn it himself.;
Whatever happens, he brought it on himself.;
You're right! Griff may be my brother, but he deserted me on Taris. As far as I'm concerned that pretty much breaks any bond we had!;NGLOBEMISS13185_.mp3
What do you care? He left you to die on Tais!;
You said it, Mission! Let the Exchange take care of that slime!;
Hey, if you want to help him with this Tarisian ale scheme that's your business. I'm washing my hands of the whole thing.;NGLOBEMISS13188_.mp3
I appreciate everything you've done for Griff. You know that, right? I just hope things work out for him this time around.;NGLOBEMISS13189_.mp3
I guess we'll find out when he meets up with us at the Czerka Corp shop. If he's got those credtis he promised you then maybe there's hope for him yet.;NGLOBEMISS13190_.mp3
I want to thank you for helping me with Griff. You... you did everything you could for my brother. More than most people would have.;NGLOBEMISS13191_.mp3
I know it might look like it didn't make any difference in the end... Griff's in debt and on the run like usual. But at least I know we tried to help him.;NGLOBEMISS13192_.mp3
Don't give up on him, Mission. He could still change.;
I know people can change no matter how bad they were. But I'm not holding my breath. None of us is perfect, but I've come to realize that Griff is a little less perfect than most.;NGLOBEMISS13194_.mp3
My brother is what he is, but I've learned to deal with that. I'll never forget that he looked after me when I was just a kid, but I don't feel like I owe him anything anymore.;NGLOBEMISS13200_.mp3
So you're okay?;
I've made my peace with Griff and what he means to me. If he ever shows up again I'll deal with him, but I'm not going to dwell on my brother anymore. It's time to move forward!;NGLOBEMISS13202_.mp3
That's a very mature attitude, Mission.;
I still hate that core-slime's guts!;
Griff's a slime ball, Mission. Accept it.;
Don't worry, I see all Griff's faults plainly now. None of us is perfect, but I realize he's a little less perfect than most.;NGLOBEMISS13196_.mp3
I invested a lot in Griff. I'm still looking to get some payback!;
I can't say I blame you. But I'll be honest... I doubt you'll ever see Griff again. I don't even know if I'll ever see him again. Like all good con men he knows how to disappear.;NGLOBEMISS13199_.mp3
If I ever see your brother again he's a dead man!;
I need you to make me a security spike.;
Sorry, I don't have one handy right now. Besides, we've got plenty of security spikes already. Not much point in overloading on them, is there?;NGLOBEMISS13038_.mp3
No problem. Just so happens I've got one here I've been working on. Here you go... I'll just add it to our inventory.;NGLOBEMISS13036_.mp3
Anything else you need?;NGLOBEMISS13037_.mp3
You got any advice on our little stowaway?;
Oh, heck, I don't know.;NGLOBEMISS13207_.mp3
Do you know anything about these gizka creatures?;
Umm... are you sure you want to ask me about that?;NGLOBEMISS13208_.mp3
[Don't speak to her.];
[You decide to ignore Mission and continue on with your quest for now, though you might want to speak with her later.];
*whisper* Well, that was easy. I sure wish I had special mind-affecting Force powers.;NGLOBEMISS13300_.mp3
*whisper* I can be pretty convincing when I have to be, but that mind trick is something else!;NGLOBEMISS13301_.mp3
Hey, why'd you have to do that? That was just mean!;NGLOBEMISS13302_.mp3
You know what? Sometimes you're nothing but a bully!;NGLOBEMISS13303_.mp3
I know you're supposed to save the galaxy and all, but could you try being less of a scummy core slime while you're doing it?;NGLOBEMISS13304_.mp3
Wow, sometimes helping people feels pretty good, you know?;NM17AA03SH01166_.mp3
Padawan, your arrival here is well timed.;
Who are you?;
I am Bolook, a Jedi from the Enclave. I was sent by the Jedi Council to investigate a killing that took place here a few hours ago.;
Communication does not pose a problem, as both the suspects and I speak Basic and Huttese.;
I was going to handle this case myself, but now that you are here this could be an excellent opportunity for you to demonstrate how well you have been learning your lessons at the Academy.;
Though you are not yet a full Jedi, perhaps you could assist me in sorting out the truth from the lies.;
What do you want me to do?;
Listen to the stories given by the two suspects. I have brought an information retrieval droid with access to the archives both at the Jedi Enclave and the planetary capital.;
I will use my wisdom and experience to offer you some guidance, but I will not solve the case for you. There is little benefit if you do not solve this problem yourself.;
Consider each man's account and check the facts with the information droid. Once you have gathered all the evidence you think you need, run through the possible scenario with me.;
If you are unable to come to a satisfactory resolution, then I will take these men to the Enclave and deal with this myself.;
According to the accounts of the participants, these three men were out here in the field together earlier, before the clouds broke.;
I find that very odd, for most people would seek shelter indoors when the sky is filled with dark stormclouds as it was earlier today. But that is not the most puzzling aspect of the case.;
The dead man, Calder Nettic, was shot in the back with a blaster rifle. A rifle was found lying near his body with blood stains on it. It has been sent back to the Enclave for analysis.;
Two other men were found at the scene when I arrived. One was Handon Guld. He was unarmed. The other was Rickard Lusoff, who was carrying a hunting laser.;
Both men say they did not do anything, and that they came across the body. But both also accuse the other. Obviously there is more to this than what we have been told.;
Is there anything else I should know?;
There is one last thing. When I arrived Handon was holding his side and Rickard was favoring one of his legs. You would do well to remember this as we progress through the case.;
If there is anything else you need, I will remain here while you question the witnesses.;
I will begin my investigaton at once.;
Sorry, I do not have time for this.;
We Jedi are often called on to make judgements in case such as this. I think exploring this case could be an important part of your training, though I will not force you to participate.;
If you are not willing to assist me, then I will bring the suspects to the Enclave and handle this myself. But are you certain you wish to pass up this opportunity to test yourself?;
I have reconsidered.;
Ah, that is good. Perhaps then, we can get to the bottom of this mystery.;
I don't have the time to assist you.;
I regret that you feel that way. I must remove myself and the suspects to the Enclave then. Good day to you, Padawan.;
I regret that you feel that way. I must remove myself and the suspects to the Enclave then. Good day to you, apprentice.;
Get out of my way, worm-head!;
I find your demeanor most unbecoming in a prospective Jedi. I think that your mentors have perhaps been lax in your training.;
I regret that you feel you cannot assist me. I will remove myself and the suspects to the Enclave for judgment. May the Force be with you.;
What do you want?;
Apprentice, your arrival here is well timed.;
We should proceed on to the next point. We need to find a motive for the killing. Maybe you should talk to the men about their relationship with the victim.;
Yes? Is there something I can do to help you in this investigation?;
I want to discuss the murder.;
You should speak to the witnesses and the information droid before we try to figure out this puzzle. You will need the facts if we are to continue.;
I will continue my investigation.;
When you have gathered all the information you need, come back to me and we can try to determine what happened.;
Tell me what happened here.;
I cannot resolve this case.;
Are you certain? It would be beneficial to your training if you were to at least make the attempt.;
By assisting me with this case you may learn much about how well you have learned the wisdom of the Jedi... or how much further you have yet to go.;
We should assist Jedi Bolook as best we can.;NM14ACBOLO01360_.mp3
If you give up now, I will take these men to the Enclave and deal with this myself. But you will have missed out on an excellent opportunity.;
I said I can't do it, dammit!;
Very well. I will take these two suspects to the Enclave and judge this case myself.;
May the Force be with you.;
We should provide what help we can. Surely it is not that difficult to ascertain the truth.;NM14ACBOLO01361_.mp3
How much for all this stuff, Tyvark?;NM26ACREPS13000_.mp3
For the Sith - a month's pay! But since you are a member of the Republic, I will charge you a week's salary.;
Thanks, Tyvark. Catch you next week..;NM26ACREPS13002_.mp3
Hey, Tyvark - how's it going?;NM26ACREPS13003_.mp3
The Sith continue to befoul the beauty of this watery world. But otherwise, I am keeping well.;
Ah, glad to hear it. This stuff's all for the Republic Embassy, so can you just bill it to them?;NM26ACREPS13005_.mp3
Of course, good soldier. I trust the Republic to pay its bills completely.;
Hi, Tyvark. I've got to stock up - they might be sending me to the front to battle the Sith.;NM26ACREPS13007_.mp3
I hope you win your glory by smashing their fleet, and return without injury.;
You and me both, Tyvark. You and me both.;NM26ACREPS13009_.mp3
The Selkath aren't harvesting kolto anymore. Something strange is going on... I bet the Sith are up to something!;NM26ACREPS13010_.mp3
The Selkath seem to be pretty cold to the Republic lately. It's almost like they blame us for the disappearance of the kolto.;NM26ACREPS13011_.mp3
I always shop here. Tyvark's prices are the best in the city.;NM26ACREPS13012_.mp3
Tyvark hates the Sith, so he's always giving us Republic soldiers discounts. I bet he gives you Jedi a great deal.;NM26ACREPS13013_.mp3
I have to get back to my post at the Republic Embassy. My break is almost over.;NM26ACREPS13014_.mp3
Please, don't take me in for questioning... I don't know anything! I swear!;NM02AAMAN006000_.mp3
Don't - don't hurt my family! Just take what you want and get out.;NM02AAMAN006001_.mp3
I've got a ton of things to do today. I can't talk to you.;NM02AAMAN006003_.mp3
I heard the gangs have overrun the Lower City. Why don't the Sith go down there and restore order?;NM02AAMAN006005_.mp3
I heard the Sith are sending salvage teams down into the Undercity to recover those Republic escape pods.;NM02AAMAN006007_.mp3
Thank you for saving me. I shall try to return to our camp.;
Release us from these cages and we can escape!;
If we survive, you will all know the wrath of the Rakata!;
Uhh... greetings. You wouldn't happen to be looking for a prospect for the academy, would you?;NM33AAPROS18000_.mp3
Look, you've already got your ticket into the academy... there's no need to gloat, is there?;NM33AAPROS18001_.mp3
Hey! You've got one of the medallions!;NM33AAPROS18002_.mp3
So? What does that mean?;
What does that mean? It means that you've been accepted into the academy. All you have to do is bring that to Yuthura Ban in the cantina. Didn't the Sith who gave you that tell you?;NM33AAPROS18004_.mp3
Got any advice for someone who's trying to be worthy of admittance?;NM33AAPROS18005_.mp3
Forget it. You'll never be worthy.;
Oh really? What do you know, anyway? Get away from me.;NM33AAPROS18007_.mp3
You just have to keep trying, I guess.;
Hmph. Fine. Keep your secrets to yourself. See if I care.;NM33AAPROS18009_.mp3
Let's just say I didn't get this in the normal way.;
Oh? So... so there's some secret to it after all? I *knew* it!;NM33AAPROS18011_.mp3
Please, please tell me what I have to do! I'll do anything!;NM33AAPROS18012_.mp3
[Persuade] You don't want to go through the academy. Trust me. Go home.;
Well, too bad that's exactly where we're headed.;NM33AAPROS18028_.mp3
[Success] I... but, ugh... I guess you're right. If I can't even figure this out, what hope do I have?;NM33AAPROS18029_.mp3
*sigh* I guess this is for the best. Maybe it's time to take up dew farming.;NM33AAPROS18030_.mp3
[Failure] You just want one less competitor, right? Well, we'll see about that.;NM33AAPROS18031_.mp3
[Persuade/Lie] You have to attack one of the Sith for it.;
That is unworthy of you. And it draws unwanted attention.;NM33AAPROS18014_.mp3
[Success] That doesn't really sound so easy. I guess it's to prove how brave you are, right? They won't actually kill you? Hm. I guess I'll have to find out...;NM33AAPROS18015_.mp3
[Failure] That would be suicide. Trying to kill off the competition, huh? 'Thanks' for the tip.;NM33AAPROS18016_.mp3
[Persuade/Lie] You must show your bravery by jumping in the chasm.;
That is murder, and this young person is not even a Sith!;NM33AAPROS18021_.mp3
If a Sith told you to go jump off a cliff, would you?;NM33AAPROS18022_.mp3
That is beside the point.;NM33AAPROS18023_.mp3
[Success] R-really? That... that sounds like it's, heh, very dangerous. You survived it, though... maybe it isn't so bad...;NM33AAPROS18025_.mp3
[Failure] Right. Do I look like I was born yesterday? Get lost.;NM33AAPROS18026_.mp3
You should not do this. Taking advantage, even of a Sith, leads to the dark side.;NM33AAPROS18024_.mp3
[Persuade] Take it from one of the other students, of course.;
[Success] Hey! Why didn't I think of that? Hmmm... you look a bit too tough for me. I'll go and find someone a bit easier. Thanks a lot!;NM33AAPROS18018_.mp3
[Failure] You're just trying to get me into trouble, aren't you? I'll pass, thanks anyway.;NM33AAPROS18019_.mp3
Forget it. I'll be going, now.;
I'll be on my way.;
May the Force serve you well.;NM33AAPROS18060_.mp3
Yeah, go on.;NM33AAPROS18061_.mp3
That's right. Got a problem with that?;
N-no, of course not! I wish I was as lucky as you, that's all.;NM33AAPROS18034_.mp3
It's mine and you're not getting it.;
If I thought I could take it... ahhh, no, never mind. Just go on and quit lording it over me, will you?;NM33AAPROS18036_.mp3
Get out of my way.;
Oh... uh, yes of course.;NM33AAPROS18038_.mp3
Something you need?;NM33AAPROS18039_.mp3
Who are you?;
Nobody you need to know. I'm just here to try to get into the Sith academy.;NM33AAPROS18041_.mp3
Why would you want to get into the academy?;
Why? Why?! That's a really dumb question. To become a Sith, of course! To wield the greatest power in the galaxy!;NM33AAPROS18043_.mp3
Why not join the Jedi?;
Hah! They're weaklings not worth anyone's attention! It's the Sith that are going to conquer the galaxy, after all.;NM33AAPROS18045_.mp3
What do you think your chances are?;
I don't know. I've been here for a few days now, and the Sith still haven't paid me any attention.;NM33AAPROS18047_.mp3
I suppose I should consider myself lucky. I've heard of some of the prospects getting killed. Still... it's all a test. I'll just have to be strong!;NM33AAPROS18048_.mp3
How does someone get into the academy?;
Well... you have to impress one of the Sith. The final decision rests with Yuthura Ban, however.;NM33AAPROS18050_.mp3
She's the one who decides exactly which of us get into the academy or not. I've been hanging out hoping she'll come by and notice me, to be honest.;NM33AAPROS18051_.mp3
Where is this Yuthura Ban?;
Usually she's in the academy, but sometimes she comes out into the colony to look for prospects.;NM33AAPROS18053_.mp3
If she's in the colony, she can usually be found in the cantina, but not always. She's one of the most powerful Sith in the academy, I hear.;NM33AAPROS18054_.mp3
Can I ask you some questions?;
Look, I'll answer questions if a Sith puts them to me, but not otherwise.;NM33AAPROS18056_.mp3
What do you mean?;
I mean I'm here to get into the academy, and I'll do whatever it takes to succeed.;NM33AAPROS18058_.mp3
[This unsavory looking man appears to be looking for someone... maybe even one of your companions back on the Ebon Hawk.];
*grunt* What the hell is your kind doing here? Bad enough I have to deal with all these other idiots, but now there's a stinkin' Cathar on this world too?;NGLOBEHXOR15000_.mp3
I have as much right to be here as you do, SIR!;NGLOBEHXOR15002_.mp3
Do not seek to aggravate us.;
Ooooo! Big man, the Jedi, shooting his mouth off from behind a lightsaber, or whatever you're carrying.;NGLOBEHXOR15082_.mp3
Hiding behind your pet Cathar... And a woman at that!;NGLOBEHXOR15084_.mp3
We should have exterminated all you Cathar when we had the chance.;NGLOBEHXOR15086_.mp3
Wha... What do you know about my world?;NGLOBEHXOR15007_.mp3
I know enough that... Hey, wait a minute... you look familiar somehow...;NGLOBEHXOR15009_.mp3
What? You...;NGLOBEHXOR15011_.mp3
Do you two know each other?;
This doesn't concern you, Jedi trash.;NGLOBEHXOR15015_.mp3
Hm... now where could I have... No, he's dead and she likely is too. I...;NGLOBEHXOR15017_.mp3
What are you talking about??;NGLOBEHXOR15019_.mp3
Maybe I was wrong. Still, I think a specimen like you would be a nice addition to my collection.;NGLOBEHXOR15021_.mp3
So what would it take, Jedi, for you to sell your pet here to me?;NGLOBEHXOR15023_.mp3
She is not for sale!;
Now don't be so selfish. We both know Cathar aren't real people anyway.;NGLOBEHXOR15025_.mp3
The females make amusing pets, but males should be put down like the animals they are. I remember one time on Taris...;NGLOBEHXOR15027_.mp3
What?! WHAT DID YOU SAY?!;NGLOBEHXOR15029_.mp3
What are you saying?;
WHAT DID YOU DO ON TARIS, YOU SCUM?!;NGLOBEHXOR15031_.mp3
Put one of you down like the animals you are. So easy... then I saw one of the females on the auction block, but those darn Jedi...;NGLOBEHXOR15033_.mp3
It was you!;NGLOBEHXOR15035_.mp3
What? Me? Oh ho! Now I recognize where I've seen that face before.;NGLOBEHXOR15037_.mp3
You were the little Cathar I was going to purchase. But those Jedi came and stole my pet away from me!;NGLOBEHXOR15039_.mp3
You bought Juhani?;
When I was fighting with the Mandalorians against the Cathar, I developed an appreciation for these creatures. They make excellent servants if properly trained.;NGLOBEHXOR15041_.mp3
You Jedi act all prim and proper, but inside you must feel the same way I do about the lesser, non-human species. The Sith at least let their feelings show on the outside.;NGLOBEHXOR15043_.mp3
You... My homeworld...;NGLOBEHXOR15045_.mp3
Come now, will you let your pet go? I'm sure we can come up with a price we both think is fair.;NGLOBEHXOR15047_.mp3
You'll only hurt her if I let her go.;
NO, I WILL NOT BE SOLD!;NGLOBEHXOR15051_.mp3
And I will see you dead for what you have done to my people!;NGLOBEHXOR15053_.mp3
Uh... hold on a second! Don't be hasty!;NGLOBEHXOR15055_.mp3
Do not fall to the dark side again, Juhani.;
I... I will remain calm. I am a Jedi now.;NGLOBEHXOR15057_.mp3
My lust for vegeance must be curbed.;NGLOBEHXOR15059_.mp3
Yes, yes... Say no to the dark side...;NGLOBEHXOR15061_.mp3
But I will have you yet! Heh.;NGLOBEHXOR15063_.mp3
There is no emotion...;
...There is peace.;NGLOBEHXOR15066_.mp3
Let's get him!;
Yes, we.... NO! I must not fall prey to the dark side again.;NGLOBEHXOR15069_.mp3
Show me the money first.;
You were buying Cathar slaves?;
What are you talking about?;
You were on Taris?;
Calm down, Juhani.;
She is her own person.;
Well... what are you offering?;
Heh, I knew we could work something out.;NGLOBEHXOR15077_.mp3
I am not for sale!;NGLOBEHXOR15079_.mp3
We should just leave, Juhani.;
You annoy me, worm.;
Ooooo! Big woman, the Jedi, shooting her mouth off from behind a lightsaber, or whatever you're carrying.;NGLOBEHXOR15088_.mp3
Just ignore him, Juhani.;
Heh, yeah, do like the Jedi tells you and back off! Your people are pathetic, it's no wonder we crushed your world so easily.;NGLOBEHXOR15005_.mp3
A big mouth like that can get you killed.;
Ack! *cough* Heh, you seem to have defeated me, Cathar worm, but I'll have the last laugh in the end!;NGLOBEHXOR15090_.mp3
What do you mean?;NGLOBEHXOR15092_.mp3
Yes, what do you mean?;
*cough* You may have killed me here, today, but I had the pleasure of killing off your species!;NGLOBEHXOR15094_.mp3
Not everyone who fought alongside the Mandalorians did it for their stupid concept of 'honor'. Some of us did it just for the pleasure: the pleasure of seeing your world burn.;NGLOBEHXOR15096_.mp3
You... you animal! You wretch!;NGLOBEHXOR15098_.mp3
*cough* *cough* Heh, but I'm beyond your petty vengeance now, girl. You can never have your revenge!;NGLOBEHXOR15100_.mp3
Do not give in to the dark side, Juhani.;
I will not give him the satisfaction of seeing me give in to the dark side.;NGLOBEHXOR15103_.mp3
Worm!;NGLOBEHXOR15108_.mp3
I killed your people on Cathar in the sky, on the ground, in their homes. I hunted them down like the animals they were, just to see them burn.;NGLOBEHXOR15110_.mp3
But the treacherous beasts fought back and left me with injuries that meant I could never fight again... or so they thought!;NGLOBEHXOR15112_.mp3
Stop trying to provoke her!;
No, I will not give in to him.;NGLOBEHXOR15114_.mp3
I ended up in the Lower City of Taris, and what did I find? A few of those stinking beasts living there!;NGLOBEHXOR15116_.mp3
The male was easy enough to best, but the females proved elusive. I didn't know what happened to them after I killed the male, until I saw this cursed woman on the auction block.;NGLOBEHXOR15118_.mp3
But then the Jedi came and ruined everything before I could have my revenge... *cough*;NGLOBEHXOR15120_.mp3
You... You killed my father, you killed my people, you treat us like animals... You deserve to die!;NGLOBEHXOR15122_.mp3
Do not give in Juhani. You are stronger than this.;
Give in and embrace your hate! You're no better than me! You're nothing!;NGLOBEHXOR15124_.mp3
I... I...;NGLOBEHXOR15126_.mp3
Do not do it, Juhani.;
I... Help me, please! Do not let me give in to my anger again!;NGLOBEHXOR15128_.mp3
Just step away.;
Haha! Your kind always were weak-minded!;NGLOBEHXOR15130_.mp3
No, I will not do this. He may die, but it will not be out of my vengeance.;NGLOBEHXOR15135_.mp3
You coward! You weak... ahhh... gurk! *death rattle*;NGLOBEHXOR15137_.mp3
Kill him now.;
You... You will die for what you have done!;NGLOBEHXOR15140_.mp3
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.;
Quit your whining!;
This isn't going to work.;
We should just kill you now.;
Hahah- *cough* *cough* But you won't! You're the cowardly type, all of you. You don't have the guts to finish me now!;NGLOBEHXOR15146_.mp3
Just ignore him.;
You could kill him now.;
No! I cannot give in to my anger. I will not give him the satisfaction of making me that way.;NGLOBEHXOR15106_.mp3
He doesn't have long, Juhani.;
He may not, but I will make him pay with what little time he has left! I will make him tell me what he has done to my people!;NGLOBEHXOR15149_.mp3
Don't listen to him.;
There she is! Get her, men, but remember: don't kill her!;NGLOBEHXOR15152_.mp3
Leave me alone, will you. I've got things on my mind.;NM17AE04NI04000_.mp3
I have to thank you, you know? I don't know how you did it. I really don't.;NM17AE04NI04001_.mp3
You again? I don't really feel like talking right now.;NM17AE04NI04002_.mp3
I talked to Motta about you.;
I suppose you've got a right to know track business, what with the times you've been posting.;NM17AE04NI04006_.mp3
I convinced Motta to give you a better contract.;
You did? I don't believe it. I mean, I do, but I sure wasn't expecting it. I appreciate it. I really do.;NM17AE04NI04008_.mp3
I'm impressed, helping a kid like Nico off to a decent start. Good job.;NM17AE04NI04009_.mp3
Now I can take my bike to the big races. There's not much of a circuit right now, but I'll be ready when it recovers.;NM17AE04NI04010_.mp3
When do you think you'll be leaving?;
Hard to tell. I'll get some more runs here first. I need the practice. I have to top *your* time.;NM17AE04NI04012_.mp3
Goodbye then. Good luck.;
Thanks again. I meant it.;NM17AE04NI04014_.mp3
Why don't you want the deal with Motta?;
It's not that I'm not grateful. I mean, it would get me into the pros. I don't have the credits to get in on my own.;NM17AE04NI04016_.mp3
Not that I care about credits. I just want to race... but the deal with Motta is pretty bad. He'll get most of what I win.;NM17AE04NI04017_.mp3
I think you should sign the contract he offered.;
Do you now? You might know a good deal, I guess. You sure know your way around the track.;NM17AE04NI04019_.mp3
[Persuade] It's the best deal you'll get. You know it.;
[Success] I suppose I do. Not much chance I'll get off this rock on my own, now is there?;NM17AE04NI04021_.mp3
I mean, you'd know, right? And all I want is to race. Who cares about the credits... who cares.;NM17AE04NI04035_.mp3
Thanks for... making things clear. If you don't mind, I think we're done. Goodbye.;NM17AE04NI04036_.mp3
That promoter's going to bleed that poor kid dry... but I guess he's got to learn the only way to get by in this life is to look out for yourself!;NM17AE04NI04037_.mp3
The weak serve and the strong profit. That's the way things should be.;NM17AE04NI04107_.mp3
That Hutt's going to suck every credit he can out of that kid, then toss him aside. Might as well have sold him to slavers.;NM17AE04NI04106_.mp3
[Failure] I'm still not liking the sound of it. I just don't know.;NM17AE04NI04022_.mp3
Trust me, a fellow racer. Consider it.;
Maybe I can talk to him about it.;
I doubt there's much you could say. It's not your business anyway. Top racers take care of their own.;NM17AE04NI04045_.mp3
Thanks anyway, but I'll think it through myself.;NM17AE04NI04046_.mp3
You've posted some good times... he might listen to you. I would. I respect you as a racer.;NM17AE04NI04047_.mp3
But... I kind of doubt he'd give me a better deal. He doesn't have to. He is putting up most of the money.;NM17AE04NI04048_.mp3
Back to my other questions now.;
Hurry it up, all right? I have things on my mind.;NM17AE04NI04064_.mp3
I wanted to ask some questions about racing.;
You have to step up and do it to know anything about it. You'll understand once you post some fast times.;NM17AE04NI04052_.mp3
How long have you been racing?;
Just a few years. I used to run down in the canyons, but nobody sees you down there. I wanted crowds.;NM17AE04NI04055_.mp3
Are you any good?;
I've been told I am. I might go pro. I'm looking at some contracts but... that's between me and Motta.;NM17AE04NI04057_.mp3
Where is the best place to get bike upgrades around here?;
If there's anything around, it'll be at the Czerka store in their office in the center of town. Stock is scarce on this rock.;NM17AE04NI04059_.mp3
What does racing pay?;
Motta has some basic incentives for good times, which you probably know, but this is just an amateur track.;NM17AE04NI04061_.mp3
The pro circuit is where the real credits are, but even that is hurting. I guess a lot of riders were on Taris.;NM17AE04NI04062_.mp3
Not sure there's much I could tell you. I mean, you have the track record.;NM17AE04NI04053_.mp3
Do you know much about Tatooine?;
Sorry. I've been here a few years, but only for the racing. Maybe ask over at Fazza's club. The hunters get around.;NM17AE04NI04066_.mp3
Goodbye.;
All right. See you around the track.;NM17AE04NI04068_.mp3
I'll get back to you. Goodbye.;
[Force Persuade] You will sign the contract with Motta.;
Forcing the boy to sign his life away? Is that really necessary?;NM17AE04NI04025_.mp3
[Success] I... I'll sign the contract. Yeah, I guess that's best. I mean, the deal can't be all bad, right?;NM17AE04NI04034_.mp3
[Failure] Uh, no. Not until I've given it some thought. What, did you think I would just cave in?;NM17AE04NI04038_.mp3
Now, if you don't mind, I think we're done for now.;NM17AE04NI04039_.mp3
You'll sign or get hurt! Understand?;
Don't threaten me. Every racer here will step up to stop you. You aren't one of us. We take care of our own.;NM17AE04NI04041_.mp3
Heh, maybe Motta isn't so sure of himself if he has threaten me. Are we done now? I've thinking to do.;NM17AE04NI04042_.mp3
Tsk tsk. Not even willing to expend a bit of effort in actual persuasion, hey? Well, you do what you like.;NM17AE04NI04026_.mp3
How is this different than slavery? You push the boy against his will.;
You should not force someone to do what they don't want.;NM17AE04NI04028_.mp3
It's simple: sign, or you'll die on this rock. Maybe soon. Understand?;
What? You're threatening me? I suppose I do need a kick in the tail to make up my mind. Maybe... it's for the best...;NM17AE04NI04030_.mp3
It doesn't matter what you think. You don't really know anything about it. Only a top racer would.;NM17AE04NI04031_.mp3
No offense, but you aren't on the boards compared to me. Post some stunners, then we'll talk.;NM17AE04NI04032_.mp3
Did you? I'm not sure that it's any of your business. Top racers keep to their own. I don't know you.;NM17AE04NI04049_.mp3
Maybe if you were better on the track I might feel like talking about it. Someone who can turn out the fast times might understand.;NM17AE04NI04050_.mp3
Oh, hi. You another racer then? I heard someone new was talking to Motta. Always room for more, I guess.;NM17AE04NI04003_.mp3
Don't know how much longer I'll be around here, but maybe we'll have time for a few races.;NM17AE04NI04004_.mp3
Nice job beating my times, too. I guess my heart isn't in the racing. Contracts are distracting stuff.;NM17AE04NI04069_.mp3
Go on, leave me alone. I've got stuff to worry about.;NM17AE04NI04070_.mp3
Anything I could help you with? What's bugging you?;
Racer stuff. Nothing you'd understand. Don't mean to be rude, but it's kind of secret.;NM17AE04NI04072_.mp3
I raced on Taris.;
Ha! Sure! Race your bike out of that explosion? Everyone knows that the whole planet is gone. Nobody got out.;NM17AE04NI04074_.mp3
I'm not in the mood for jokes, thanks. I've got things to think about. You wouldn't know anything about it.;NM17AE04NI04075_.mp3
Deal with that Hutt Motta and you'll understand. Until then, I just don't want to talk about it.;NM17AE04NI04077_.mp3
I just have some questions.;
I don't feel like answering. I wouldn't be much help to you anyway. I just race. Don't know about anything else.;NM17AE04NI04079_.mp3
You race, right? Know anything about contracts? Ah, I shouldn't get into it. It's my problem.;NM17AE04NI04076_.mp3
Poor baby. Make me care.;
You don't know. Don't go thinking you know, because you don't know. I've got problems.;NM17AE04NI04081_.mp3
Wonderful! Ha ha! The beast is dead! We work better together than I would have hoped.;NM36AALASH02000_.mp3
And here is the holocron. Such a small thing to be so valuable and require so much effort to obtain.;NM36AALASH02002_.mp3
I'll just run along, now, and give this to Master Uthar. I'll be sure to tell him of your contribution, naturally.;NM36AALASH02004_.mp3
And how can I be sure of that?;
You're the one that convinced me to go through with this plan. Why wouldn't I see it through?;NM36AALASH02006_.mp3
I want some kind of guarantee.;
Forget it. There is no guarantee. You helped me, I'll help you. Or don't you trust me?;NM36AALASH02008_.mp3
Wait. We'll go to Master Uthar together.;
Forget it. I'm not waiting up for you. That wasn't our plan, anyway.;NM36AALASH02012_.mp3
The plan's changed. Give me the holocron.;
You're not getting the holocron. This was my idea! The plan was that I take it back, not you!;NM36AALASH02018_.mp3
The 'plan' was we both get the credit.;
Back off, I'm warning you! I'm not giving this up!;NM36AALASH02015_.mp3
No more arguing. We take it back together.;
Over my dead body!!;NM36AALASH02021_.mp3
Then I'll just have to take it from you!;
Fine. Go, if that's the way you want it.;
Good. You have my... appreciation... for all your help. Good luck in your efforts.;NM36AALASH02025_.mp3
Forget it. That holocron is mine.;
You're going to betray me, I know it!;
I... suppose that's alright.;
Not bloody likely. Give me the holocron.;
I suppose so. Fine... take it back.;
No way. I'll be taking the holocron back, not you.;
There you are. Finally. If you were any later in showing up, we would have had to abandon this.;NM36AALASH02027_.mp3
I've been calling to the tuk'ata mother in their language. She should respond fairly -- ahhh, here she comes now.;NM36AALASH02029_.mp3
Get ready. This will not be easy... she's a tough beast.;NM36AALASH02031_.mp3
I cannot render assistance, citizen. Move along.;NGLOBEDROI03000_.mp3
Soon your apprenticeship will end and you will be granted the title of Padawan, the lowest rank of those within the Jedi Order. Yet first you must prove yourself worthy.;NM13AAZHAR19059_.mp3
What must I do to prove myself?;
In the traditions and customs of our Order, as handed down from Master to pupil for a thousand generations, you must successfully complete three tests before you earn your place among the Jedi.;NM13AAZHAR19060_.mp3
I am ready for the tests, Master Zhar.;
These tests will see if you have truly mastered the training you have been given, both mental and physical. Upon completing these tests you will pass from apprentice to Padawan, and join in the ranks of the Jedi.;NM13AAZHAR19064_.mp3
First I will test your knowledge of the Jedi Code. These tenets must always guide your actions, in everything you do you must always be conscious of their wisdom.;NM13AAZHAR19065_.mp3
You must prove you have a Jedi's understanding of the Code. Return when you feel you are ready for this challenge.;NM13AAZHAR19231_.mp3
You must now prove you have a Jedi's understanding of the Code by completing these fundamental precepts of our Order:;NM13AAZHAR19066_.mp3
There is no emotion...;NM13AAZHAR19067_.mp3
There is the light.;
That is not correct, apprentice. Perhaps you are not yet ready for this challenge.;NM13AAZHAR19090_.mp3
There is no shame in admitting weakness. Feel free to speak to the other Jedi in the academy if you require assistance. They will gladly share their knowledge with you.;NM13AAZHAR19091_.mp3
Return when you feel you are ready for this challenge. May the Force be with you.;NM13AAZHAR19092_.mp3
There is serenity.;
There is knowledge.;
There is the Force.;
There is justice.;
There is peace.;
There is no ignorance...;NM13AAZHAR19074_.mp3
There is harmony.;
What kind of tests are these?;
Let's get these tests over with!;
I want to ask some questions, Master Zhar. Questions about Revan and Malak.;
Few mention those names around here anymore... but I suppose it is just as dangerous to deny they were ever part of the Order.;NM13AAZHAR19109_.mp3
When I was still on Coruscant Revan and Malak often came to me for additional training. In particular, Revan's hunger to learn seemed insatiable. I should have recognized this as a warning sign.;NM13AAZHAR19110_.mp3
But I perceived the young Padawan's lust for knowledge as simple exuberance and eagerness. Revan was my most promising pupil, one I felt sure would someday become a champion of the Jedi Order.;NM13AAZHAR19111_.mp3
What happened?;
"The Jedi Order moved too slowly for Revan and Malak; we were too cautious in their eyes. They always sought to learn far quicker than their Masters felt was prudent.";NM13AAZHAR19113_.mp3
It is one thing to understand a lesson, but to truly comprehend it takes a wisdom that only comes with time.;NM13AAZHAR19114_.mp3
Several years ago, when the Mandalorian threat first arose, Revan and Malak were eager to journey to the Outer Rim to defeat the enemy of the Republic.;NM13AAZHAR19115_.mp3
But the Council felt it best if we moved with care and caution. The true threat, the Council feared, had not yet revealed itself.;NM13AAZHAR19116_.mp3
But Revan would not be dissuaded. Charismatic and powerful, it was inevitable many of the Order would flock to Revan's seemingly noble cause.;NM13AAZHAR19117_.mp3
Malak was the first to join his closest friend. Others soon followed, many of our youngest and brightest, intent on saving the galaxy from the Mandalorian threat.;NM13AAZHAR19118_.mp3
They disobeyed the Jedi Council!;
They were foolish to disregard the Council's wishes. I do not know what happened to Revan, Malak and their followers on the farthest reaches of the Outer Rim, but something corrupted them.;NM13AAZHAR19121_.mp3
Their ideals became twisted, their spirits were tainted and they fell to the dark side.;NM13AAZHAR19122_.mp3
There is a lesson in this, a lesson you would do well to take to heart: the dark side can corrupt even the most noble of Jedi.;NM13AAZHAR19123_.mp3
I will heed the lesson, Master Zhar.;
You have learned much, yet there is much more for you to still understand. The way of the Jedi must be entered into with a clear and focused mind.;NM13AAZHAR19106_.mp3
When you feel you are ready to continue your training, know that you can find me here.;NM13AAZHAR19107_.mp3
Yeah, yeah, get on with it.;
What happened to this noble mission?;
I should be going now.;
You should speak to Master Dorak. He can assist you in selecting your lightsaber crystal.;NM13AAZHAR19000_.mp3
Ah, good. Now that you have selected your crystal, we shall begin the construction of your lightsaber.;NM13AAZHAR19001_.mp3
Ah, so you are the one who rescued Bastila. It is appropriate you are here. We have been discussing your rather special case. I am Zhar, a member of the Jedi Council.;NM13AAZHAR19002_.mp3
With me are Master Vrook, Master Vandar and, of course, the Chronicler of our Academy, Master Dorak. Padawan Bastila I am sure you are already familiar with.;NM13AAZHAR19003_.mp3
What do you want from me?;
Bastila tells us you are strong in the Force. We are considering you for Jedi training.;NM13AAZHAR19005_.mp3
Nothing would give me greater honor than learning the ways of the Jedi.;
Master Zhar speaks out of turn, perhaps. We need indisputable proof of your strong affinity to the Force before we would even consider accepting you for training.;NM13AAZHAR19010_.mp3
Proof? Surely the entire Council can feel the strength of the Force within this man... and I have already related to you the events that took place on Taris...;NM13AAZHAR19011_.mp3
Perhaps it was simple luck.;NM13AAZHAR19012_.mp3
We both know there is no luck. There is only the Force. We all feel the power in Bastila's companion, though it is wild and untamed. Now that this power has begun to manifest itself, can we safely ignore it?;NM13AAZHAR19013_.mp3
The Jedi training is long and difficult, even when working with a young and open mind. Teaching a child is hard. How much harder will it be for an adult to learn the ways of the Jedi?;NM13AAZHAR19014_.mp3
I am willing to try my best.;
Traditionally the Jedi do not accept adults for training, though there are rare exceptions in the history of our Order. But you are a special case.;NM13AAZHAR19019_.mp3
I agree with Master Dorak. Many of our own pupils are leaving the Jedi order to follow the Sith teachings, we need recruits to stand against Malak! With Revan dead...;NM13AAZHAR19020_.mp3
Are you certain Revan is truly dead? What if we undertake to train this one, and the Dark Lord should return?;NM13AAZHAR19021_.mp3
We should discuss this matter more fully in private. Bastila, you and your companion must go. This is a matter for the Council alone.;NM13AAZHAR19022_.mp3
As you wish, Master Vandar. We shall return to the Ebon Hawk and leave you to your deliberations.;NM13AAZHAR19023_.mp3
I am ready to accept the training... and my age has nothing to do with it!;
Such pride! Such arrogance! Ach. This one is already on the path to the dark side!;NM13AAZHAR19017_.mp3
As are many who are not given proper training, Master Vrook. Only through our guidance can we hope to lead those who have strayed back to the path of the light.;NM13AAZHAR19018_.mp3
[Lie] Of course, great Jedi. I will learn your ways and follow the light.;
[Success] Traditionally the Jedi do not accept adults for training, though there are rare exceptions in the history of our Order. But you are a special case.;NM13AAZHAR19025_.mp3
Proof? Surely the entire Council can feel the strength of the Force within this woman... and I have already related to you the events that took place on Taris...;NM13AAZHAR19026_.mp3
I don't know if I'm ready for this.;
Do not worry. I am confident in your ability to learn.;NM13AAZHAR19008_.mp3
Strong in the Force?;
So you've drawn me into your little trap, Bastila. What now?;
This is no trap. The Council just wants to talk to you. There is much that needs to be discussed.;NM13AAZHAR19028_.mp3
I've got some questions for all of you.;
Indeed, I am sure that you do. I assure you that we will have answers for you.;NM13AAZHAR19032_.mp3
Why am I a special case?;
Why am I here?;
Why did the Sith destroy Taris?;
Darth Malak seeks to destroy the Jedi Order. Our most effective weapon, perhaps our only hope, is Bastila's skill with Battle Meditation.;NM13AAZHAR19036_.mp3
With this power she can swing the tide of nearly any battle in our favor. Which is why Malak was seeking her so fervently.;NM13AAZHAR19037_.mp3
And if he could not have her, he would see her destroyed. Taris was just in the way.;NM13AAZHAR19038_.mp3
We need Bastila in our fight against the Sith. Indeed, we need every Jedi we can muster, since the Sith have been hunting us down at every opportunity.;NM13AAZHAR19039_.mp3
Which brings us to you...;NM13AAZHAR19040_.mp3
Me? What about me?;
I feel I'm not going to like this...;
Isn't the Jedi Council on Coruscant?;
Yes, the High Council of the Jedi Order is on Coruscant, but we are the Council in charge of the training facility here on Dantooine.;NM13AAZHAR19030_.mp3
You have done extremely well in constructing your lightsaber, apprentice. Your crystal seems to have been set perfectly. It is rare indeed for that to happen the first time one constructs their lightsaber.;NM13AAZHAR19043_.mp3
These crystals are very rare, found only in certain caves strong in the Force. By adding crystals to your lightsaber you can alter or enhance its properties.;NM13AAZHAR19044_.mp3
There have even been unconfirmed rumors of certain Force-sensitive caves here on Dantooine that may hold these crystals.;NM13AAZHAR19045_.mp3
I can find crystals on Dantooine?;
It is a rumor only. I do not know if there is any truth in it.;NM13AAZHAR19047_.mp3
But you must learn first to use your lightsaber and take care when drawing it.;NM13AAZHAR19050_.mp3
Your lightsaber identifies you as a member of the Jedi Order. With such recognition comes honor and respect... and the attention of dangerous enemies.;NM13AAZHAR19052_.mp3
The Sith and Dark Jedi will seek to destroy you, apprentice. And you must prove yourself worthy in battle against a foe who also wields a lightsaber.;NM13AAZHAR19053_.mp3
Are you ready to face the final challenge, apprentice?;NM13AAZHAR19054_.mp3
I am ready to face the third trial.;
For every Jedi the threat of the dark side is always present. You must truly understand this before you are accepted into the Order. You must see the corruption of the dark side for yourself.;NM13AAZHAR19093_.mp3
Even here on Dantooine there are places where the dark side holds sway, twisting and tainting nature itself.;NM13AAZHAR19094_.mp3
The ancient grove once used for deep meditation by the Jedi is now tainted, a wave of darkness perverts the region around it.;NM13AAZHAR19095_.mp3
The kath hounds in the area have become savage and ruthless. They have become a threat to the settlers, a threat the Jedi have promised to stop.;NM13AAZHAR19096_.mp3
What would you have me do, Master Zhar?;
The kath hounds are but a symptom of the true problem. You must journey into the grove and confront the true source of the darkness. That is your task.;NM13AAZHAR19100_.mp3
Do you have no other guidance?;
"I can say no more; some things you must see for yourself. None of the other Jedi at the academy are permitted to help you in this task.";NM13AAZHAR19103_.mp3
But remember this, my young apprentice: a Jedi acts with patience and care, and those on the dark path are not always lost forever.;NM13AAZHAR19104_.mp3
The dark side still taints the ancient grove. Your lessons cannot continue until the spreading corruption of the dark side has been stopped. This is your task, apprentice. May the Force be with you.;NM13AAZHAR19127_.mp3
You know more than you're telling me...;
You want me to go kill kath hounds?;
What's causing this corruption?;
I need more time to prepare myself.;
What will these crystals do for me?;
They can modify simple things, such as the color of your blade, or complex ones, such as crystals that reputedly increase the strength of the beam.;NM13AAZHAR19049_.mp3
Should I know anything else about lightsabers?;
Greetings, my young pupil. Your progress has been most remarkable so far. Are you here to continue your training in the ways of the Jedi?;NM13AAZHAR19057_.mp3
I am ready to continue my training.;
Not right now.;
You have done well, my pupil. The ancient grove has been purified, and Juhani's journey down the dark path has been halted. Because of you she walks once more in the light.;NM13AAZHAR19128_.mp3
But though she was saved, do not dismiss what happened to her. Juhani is both dedicated and true to the ideals of the Order, yet she was still vulnerable to the dark side. As are we all.;NM13AAZHAR19129_.mp3
She struck her master in anger during training, and injured her greatly. But it was Quatra's choice to test Juhani this way, and it seems to have made its point.;NM13AAZHAR19130_.mp3
Juhani has been redeemed, and you have passed your final test.;NM13AAZHAR19131_.mp3
Congratulations, apprentice. Or should I say congratulations, Padawan? You have proven yourself worthy of joining the Jedi. Let me be the first to welcome you as a full-fledged member of our Order!;NM13AAZHAR19132_.mp3
You have cleansed the grove of its dark taint, but at great cost. Juhani was a most promising student and could one day have been strong in the Force.;NM13AAZHAR19133_.mp3
Do not dismiss what happened to her, however. Juhani was both dedicated and true to the ideals of the Order, yet she was still vulnerable to the lure of the dark side.;NM13AAZHAR19134_.mp3
Keep this in mind always in the future, and do not forsake the path of the light.;NM13AAZHAR19135_.mp3
I have nothing left to teach you, Padawan, though a Jedi is ever learning. Even the Masters know their training is but in its infancy. Now is the time for you to seek wisdom outside the training chambers.;NM13AAZHAR19136_.mp3
The lessons that yet await you are to be found beyond the walls of this academy. You should speak to the Council, Padawan.;NM13AAZHAR19137_.mp3
Now that the first stage of your training is complete I am certain they would be eager to have you aid us in our struggle against Darth Malak and the Sith.;NM13AAZHAR19138_.mp3
I have heard there was some sort of large battle to the south of here between two families of settlers.;NM13AAZHAR19139_.mp3
Apparently both the families were completely killed in the fight, along with their respective droids.;NM13AAZHAR19140_.mp3
I find that most suspicious. Were you not in that area recently?;NM13AAZHAR19141_.mp3
[Lie] No, I was somewhere else.;
[Success] Hm, is that so... It is tragic that this had to happen to those families. Their children were in love, I hear.;NM13AAZHAR19143_.mp3
Perhaps it was Mandalorian raiders, or a feud that got out of control. It is tragic, but nothing can be done now that all who were involved are dead.;NM13AAZHAR19144_.mp3
Let this be a lesson against hate and violence: a Jedi must always be wary lest these lead to the dark side.;NM13AAZHAR19145_.mp3
[Lie] That's horrible! I didn't know!;
[Lie] Perhaps it was Mandalorian raiders.;
[Success] Perhaps, perhaps. That or a feud that got out of control. It is tragic, but nothing can be done now that all who were involved are dead.;NM13AAZHAR19148_.mp3
Shen Matale and Rahasia Sandral have fled their feuding families and asked for sanctuary here in the Enclave. The Council has granted this request.;NM13AAZHAR19149_.mp3
I have heard that it was by your actions that they managed to escape, and I must congratulate you for avoiding a potentially dangerous situation.;NM13AAZHAR19150_.mp3
May the Force be with you in your quest.;NM13AAZHAR19151_.mp3
Welcome to the slave quarters, good sir. I mean no disrespect, but perhaps one of the female slaves could serve your needs better.;NM08AADAVS11000_.mp3
Welcome to the slave quarters, mistress. Here we have succulent fruits and berries to tempt your palette, as well as luxurious baths to soothe your aches and pains.;NM08AADAVS11002_.mp3
"Wow! This guy's gorgeous; Davik sure knows how to pick 'em!";NM08AADAVS11004_.mp3
Would you like a relaxing massage, mistress? Whatever your desire, we are here to serve.;NM08AADAVS11008_.mp3
I don't have time for that kind of thing right now.;
Of course. Return whenever you wish to partake of what we offer here. We exist only to serve.;NM08AADAVS11057_.mp3
I need some information.;
But... what could I possibly tell you? It is forbidden for slaves to leave this room on pain of torture and death.;NM08AADAVS11011_.mp3
[Persuade] Tell me what I want to know and I'll tell Davik how pleased I was with your performance.;
[Success] Praise from the guests is a valuable commodity here. Davik rewards the slaves who perform their duties well. I will tell you what I know.;NM08AADAVS11013_.mp3
Davik rarely lets us leave the slave quarters. We only know what we hear from Davik's guests. Recently they've all been talking about poor Hudrow.;NM08AADAVS11021_.mp3
He was caught trying to steal some spice from the lab. Normally Hudrow is allowed to get away with things like that because he's Davik's personal pilot for the Ebon Hawk.;NM08AADAVS11023_.mp3
But since the Sith have grounded every ship on the planet, Hudrow doesn't get anymore special treatment. They've locked him up in Davik's torture chambers.;NM08AADAVS11025_.mp3
Where is the torture chamber?;
I think you can get there through the hall behind the west door of Davik's throne room. Just keep going west from the slave quarters and you'll see the throne room.;NM08AADAVS11027_.mp3
But Davik's certain to have guards patrolling the area. If you leave the guest wing, they'll shoot you on sight. Please - I don't know anything else.;NM08AADAVS11029_.mp3
I'd love a massage right now.;
As you wish, mistress. You will find this most relaxing. If you would come with me into the massage room at the back...;NM08AADAVS11034_.mp3
Come on. I mean... I love a massage as much as the next guy, but we're not exactly on vacation here. We need to get going.;NM08AADAVS11036_.mp3
I trust you were satisfied with the service? I have received many compliments on my skills from previous clients.;NM08AADAVS11038_.mp3
It was everything I ever dreamed. You are truly an expert in your craft.;
Thank you, my lady. I hope you will express your appreciation to Davik. He often rewards those slaves who perform their duties well. Is there anything else you require?;NM08AADAVS11040_.mp3
Your job isn't finished yet. I want another massage!;
My, you certainly have a great hunger for my services. I will do my best to sate your prodigious appetite with another massage, mistress.;NM08AADAVS11053_.mp3
I'll be going now.;
Let's just say you came up a little short of my expectations.;
Please, I beg you - don't tell Davik you are displeased with me! He punishes those slaves who do not satisfy his guests!;NM08AADAVS11042_.mp3
I won't say anything if you answer my questions!;
I have no wish to be beaten by Davik, so I will tell you all I know. I hope it is enough to buy your mercy.;NM08AADAVS11044_.mp3
I don't want to get you in trouble. Don't worry, I won't say anything.;
I am sorry I have failed to please you, my lady. I will try to do better in the future. Is there anything else you require from this most unworthy servant?;NM08AADAVS11050_.mp3
I'm telling Davik you're the worst slave I've ever seen!;
As... as you wish, mistress. It will not be the first time I have been punished by Davik.;NM08AADAVS11048_.mp3
That was pathetic!;
What else can you tell me?;
Nothing - Davik keeps us locked away in here day and night. I'm not even certain of the location of the torture chamber where they've got Hudrow locked away.;NM08AADAVS11031_.mp3
[Failure] I'm sorry, mistress, but the risk is too great. Davik will have me flayed alive if he finds out. Is there something else I may do to please you?;NM08AADAVS11015_.mp3
[Persuade] Maybe 50 credits would loosen your tongue.;
"[Failure] I won't betray Davik's secrets for credits; they are of no use to a slave. Is there something else I can do for you?";NM08AADAVS11017_.mp3
Either you start talking, or I start blasting random body parts.;
Please don't hurt me! I'll... I'll tell you everything I know. I only pray Davik doesn't find out, or my life will end in terrible agony.;NM08AADAVS11019_.mp3
I greet you once more, mistress. How may this humble servant be of use to you?;NM08AADAVS11059_.mp3
You're back, I see. And Bastila isn't even with you.;NM17AFHHEL01000_.mp3
I suppose she's too busy to even help her own mother, correct? Nothing more than I would expect from her after all this time.;NM17AFHHEL01002_.mp3
Go on, leave me be. I will find the holocron myself, if I have to.;NM17AFHHEL01004_.mp3
Back already? Have you even looked for the holocron, yet?;NM17AFHHEL01006_.mp3
I have the holocron, Mother. I'm just not sure I want to give it to you.;NM17AFHHEL01008_.mp3
And why not? Would you deny me even that?;NM17AFHHEL01010_.mp3
I've never denied you anything, Mother. You may think I don't remember what it was like before I left for the order, but I do.;NM17AFHHEL01012_.mp3
You were the one who pushed Father to go on one treasure hunt after the other. You loved living in wealth. You think I don't remember the fights?;NM17AFHHEL01014_.mp3
You were eager to send me to the Jedi, even though I didn't want to go. You took Father away from me, and now this holocron is all I have of him.;NM17AFHHEL01016_.mp3
Fool girl! You have a strange way of remembering things. That wasn't --;NM17AFHHEL01018_.mp3
No. I don't wish to argue with you any more, Mother. It's time we parted ways, now, for both our benefit.;NM17AFHHEL01020_.mp3
Maybe you should listen to what she has to say.;
You don't know her. My mother is notoriously deceptive when she wants something. Why should she have the holocron?;NM17AFHHEL01022_.mp3
Is it too difficult to believe that I am a dying woman who simply wishes to see her husband one last time?;NM17AFHHEL01024_.mp3
I find it difficult to believe anything you say, Mother.;NM17AFHHEL01026_.mp3
It sounds like you've already made up your mind.;
*Sigh* You're right. It shames me, but I just... I find it difficult to... let go of the past. I'm... sorry, Mother.;NM17AFHHEL01028_.mp3
I was hard on you, dear. I wasn't a very good mother to you, I know that.;NM17AFHHEL01030_.mp3
Your father loved you so. He wanted you to be just like him... he wanted to take you on his hunts, but I said they were too dangerous.;NM17AFHHEL01032_.mp3
Treasure hunting is a dangerous occupation.;
I always tried to keep him from the dangerous ones, but he would have none of it. It was a reckless life we led, always moving... I didn't want that for you.;NM17AFHHEL01034_.mp3
So that's why you gave me to the Order?;NM17AFHHEL01036_.mp3
What do your father and I have to show for all those years of hunting? Nothing. That was no life for anyone, especially not someone as gifted as you.;NM17AFHHEL01038_.mp3
Your father... he spent all his last years trying to pay for my treatments. That's why he went for the pearls. I begged him not to, but...;NM17AFHHEL01040_.mp3
Your treatments.;NM17AFHHEL01042_.mp3
I'm dying, Bastila. I did not lie about that. It's been a long time in the coming, and there's really nothing that can be done anymore.;NM17AFHHEL01044_.mp3
I told your father to let me go, but you know how he was. Stubborn. Like you.;NM17AFHHEL01046_.mp3
I'm so sorry, Mother. I don't know what to say...;NM17AFHHEL01048_.mp3
Keep the holocron, Bastila. It would do me good to know you have it. This... talking to you... this is what I really needed before I...;NM17AFHHEL01050_.mp3
I know, Mother. Thank you. I'm glad we talked, too.;NM17AFHHEL01052_.mp3
Well, now. You said you had important business, and you were never one to mince words. You there... you take care of my daughter, you hear me?;NM17AFHHEL01054_.mp3
I'll do my best.;
That's good. I'll feel a lot better knowing there's someone to watch her.;NM17AFHHEL01056_.mp3
Where are you going to go?;NM17AFHHEL01058_.mp3
It doesn't matter, dear. Don't you worry about me.;NM17AFHHEL01184_.mp3
Here. Take these 500 credits. It's all I have. Go to Coruscant and find a doctor. I'll meet you there after... after what I have to do.;NM17AFHHEL01185_.mp3
But I already told you there's nothing that can --;NM17AFHHEL01186_.mp3
Please, take it. I... want to see you again. When we can talk.;NM17AFHHEL01187_.mp3
*sigh* Alright, I will. Now you do what you have to, Bastila. You go make your father and I proud.;NM17AFHHEL01060_.mp3
I'll try. Farewell, Mother.;NM17AFHHEL01062_.mp3
Bastila can take care of herself.;
So could her father. That doesn't mean she doesn't need help now and again.;NM17AFHHEL01065_.mp3
As if she'd let me!;
You make her let you. She's too much like her father in that respect.;NM17AFHHEL01068_.mp3
Hmph. I'm not her keeper.;
So you're not. I'd feel better knowing that someone was there to watch over her, however. I wasn't.;NM17AFHHEL01071_.mp3
Yet you let your husband go on these dangerous expeditions.;
Maybe one of you should be the first to give the other a break?;
I agree. We should go before this gets ugly.;
So that's the way it is, is it? All that Jedi training and you haven't learned a thing.;NM17AFHHEL01079_.mp3
On the contrary, I've learned much. I've learned, for instance, when it is best to walk away from a situation that can lead only to conflict.;NM17AFHHEL01081_.mp3
How can you learn anything when you hear only what you want to hear? Well, go on, then. Keep the holocron. It was for you, anyhow.;NM17AFHHEL01083_.mp3
I'll just go off and die peacefully and you needn't bother with me anymore. That's obviously what's best.;NM17AFHHEL01085_.mp3
Farewell, Mother. May the Force be with you.;NM17AFHHEL01087_.mp3
Hmph. It may as well be with one of us.;NM17AFHHEL01089_.mp3
Do you really need the holocron, Bastila?;
I... perhaps not. I can remember my father well enough. But I ask you: why should she have it?;NM17AFHHEL01076_.mp3
You're right. Let's go.;
I don't have the holocron, if that's what you're asking.;NM17AFHHEL01091_.mp3
Then what are you waiting for? Go, find it!;NM17AFHHEL01093_.mp3
Yes? I'm sorry, do I know you?;NM17AFHHEL01095_.mp3
Are you Bastila's mother?;
You know my daughter? Where is she?;NM17AFHHEL01097_.mp3
Nearby. I'm not sure she wants to meet with you.;
Is that so? Has she said this, herself? Tell her it is quite urgent that I speak with her at once. She has been most difficult to find.;NM17AFHHEL01099_.mp3
Tell me what you want and I'll relay it to her.;
I most certainly will not. What I have to say is for Bastila alone. It is... family business. That should be enough for her to come.;NM17AFHHEL01101_.mp3
She said that you two don't get along.;
I don't see why Bastila should be telling anything to a stranger about family business. Simply tell her to come and that should be enough.;NM17AFHHEL01104_.mp3
I'll tell her when I see her.;
See that you do. If Bastila is here, I can't see why she didn't come herself.;NM17AFHHEL01107_.mp3
Could I ask you some questions?;
I'm sure there are plenty of other strangers about for you to harass with questions. Why don't you select one of them?;NM17AFHHEL01110_.mp3
I have to go.;
Thank you. I would rather be alone.;NM17AFHHEL01112_.mp3
No, I don't think so.;
Good. I thought you were perhaps one of those collectors from the Exchange. Since you're not, I doubt we have any business. Good day.;NM17AFHHEL01115_.mp3
Yes, I'm sorry, do I know you?;NM17AFHHEL01117_.mp3
I am here, Mother. Or don't you recognize me?;NM17AFHHEL01119_.mp3
What do you expect, when I haven't so much as had a picture of you since you left? Do you know how long I've been trying to find you?;NM17AFHHEL01121_.mp3
You knew as well as I communication would be impossible once I joined the order. Now what is this about? Where is Father?;NM17AFHHEL01123_.mp3
Then you haven't heard. I should have known.;NM17AFHHEL01125_.mp3
Has something happened to him? Are you going to tell me or not?;NM17AFHHEL01127_.mp3
Your Father is dead, Bastila. That is part of the reason why I was looking for you.;NM17AFHHEL01129_.mp3
Dead? What happened? What did you do to him?!;NM17AFHHEL01131_.mp3
Isn't this a lovely reunion? Already she is flinging insults at me. Tell me... you're one of her friends. Do you treat your mother this way?;NM17AFHHEL01133_.mp3
My mother is long dead, if you must know.;
Is that so? Well, I'll be joining her soon enough, I suppose.;NM17AFHHEL01135_.mp3
I was told you were sick. Are you actually dying, or is this merely melodrama for my benefit?;NM17AFHHEL01137_.mp3
Such sweet things you say. *sigh* Perhaps I should tell you everything, first, before we start arguing again.;NM17AFHHEL01139_.mp3
You could start by telling me what you got Father into that killed him.;NM17AFHHEL01141_.mp3
I hadn't realized Jedi were so spiteful. You want me to tell you I brought your father here for an expedition, do you? You want to blame me for his death?;NM17AFHHEL01143_.mp3
You never accepted that your father loved going on his treasure hunts, leaving you alone with me. I was always to blame for everything, what else is new?;NM17AFHHEL01145_.mp3
So yes, fine. I brought your father here to look for krayt dragon pearls. He took an expedition into the Tatooine desert and he died.;NM17AFHHEL01147_.mp3
How can you be sure of that? Father is an experienced --;NM17AFHHEL01149_.mp3
Do you think I would look for you if I wasn't sure? They were attacked by a krayt dragon and one of the guides fled the battle. He saw your father killed.;NM17AFHHEL01151_.mp3
I... see. So what do you want from me? Credits?;NM17AFHHEL01153_.mp3
Don't be insulting. I want you to use those senses of yours. I want you to find him. I want you to bring back his holocron.;NM17AFHHEL01155_.mp3
Why? So you can sell it?;NM17AFHHEL01157_.mp3
Is it too much to ask that I have something to remember your father by? Of course it is, isn't it? You couldn't be bothered.;NM17AFHHEL01159_.mp3
We're very busy on a mission from the Jedi Council. I doubt I'll have the time. Ask my companions if you doubt me.;NM17AFHHEL01161_.mp3
Why don't you get the holocron yourself, Miss... er... Helena?;
As my daughter is quick to point out, I haven't the coin to hire another expedition. Nor am I the adventurer my husband was.;NM17AFHHEL01163_.mp3
Don't you want to find your father's remains, Bastila?;
What remains would there be? Krayt dragons are huge predators, easily able to devour a human, and the desert is a harsh environment.;NM17AFHHEL01165_.mp3
Finding my father's remains would be an even more impossible task than finding his holocron. An ignoble end to a fine man.;NM17AFHHEL01167_.mp3
What about your mother's sickness?;
It doesn't seem to have anything to do with what she's asking. Are you actually sick, Mother?;NM17AFHHEL01169_.mp3
What difference does it make to you? None, I'm sure. Just find your father's holocron and you won't have to worry about me again either way.;NM17AFHHEL01171_.mp3
That's the kind of response I would expect. Very well. We'll look for the holocron if we have time. I can't promise any more than that.;NM17AFHHEL01173_.mp3
I believe your father was headed north towards the Sand People enclave. I would check along that route, dear. Do please hurry.;NM17AFHHEL01175_.mp3
Hey, leave me out of this.;
I'm sure Bastila feels the same way you do. She would prefer to be left out of it, at least until I'm as dead as her father is.;NM17AFHHEL01178_.mp3
Only if she deserved it.;
I see Bastila seeks out friends that are as selfish as she is. This is how you treat a dying woman?;NM17AFHHEL01181_.mp3
Uh... you there! I'm... I'm a high ranking executive of the Czerka Corporation! Eh... there's a big reward if you take me back to Anchorhead!;NM20AAGRIF05000_.mp3
Griff, don't you recognize me? It's Mission!;NM20AAGRIF05001_.mp3
Mission? Is it really you? I heard Taris was destroyed! I thought you were dead! Joy of joys, my little sister is alive!;NM20AAGRIF05002_.mp3
I... I have to ask you something, Griff. It's important. I ran into Lena. She said... she said it was your idea to leave me on Taris. It's not true, is it?;NM20AAGRIF05003_.mp3
Ah, well... there's the truth and then there's the *truth*, you know? I always meant to go back to Taris, sis. Just as soon as I had the credits to pay off my debts. But credits have been hard to come by.;NM20AAGRIF05004_.mp3
You mean it's true? It was your idea to leave me there? I'm your sister - how could you abandon me like that?;NM20AAGRIF05005_.mp3
Come on, sis. You didn't need me to look after you anymore. You may have been young, but you knew how to take care of yourself. Besides, you're here now - everything worked out fine.;NM20AAGRIF05006_.mp3
That's it? That's all you have to say to me after all these years after deserting me on Taris?;NM17ABGRIF04037_.mp3
Well, that and uh... could you please get me out of here? You've got a tough looking friend there.;NM20AAGRIF05027_.mp3
The Sand People said you can go. Run to Anchorhead.;
Yeah, you can find your way from there, right? Can you manage that? What? Is there something else?;NM20AAGRIF05034_.mp3
Uh... well, I... I wanted to thank you, and, uh, you look like you're doing well. Financially, I mean. Say... um... could you spare me a few credits to get back on my feet?;NM20AAGRIF05008_.mp3
You... you're hitting me up for credits? I don't believe this! Lena was right about you, Griff! We should have just left you to the Sand People! Don't talk to me anymore - ever!;NM20AAGRIF05009_.mp3
Huh... that didn't go well. Sis always was a little too fiery for her own good. She'll cool down in time.;NM20AAGRIF05010_.mp3
Don't be so sure.;
Ah, she'll be okay. We've had our fights before. Too bad, though. I could really have used a helping hand right now.;NM20AAGRIF05012_.mp3
You may have saved my life, but I don't have a single credit to my name. Say, you wouldn't be able to spare me some credits? Just till I get back on my feet, you know?;NM20AAGRIF05014_.mp3
Sure - here's 100 credits.;
That's it, huh? Oh, figured you would be able to spare a bit more than that, but, you know, I'll take whatever I can get. Don't worry about me... I've already got a job waiting for me.;NM20AAGRIF05016_.mp3
Greeta, the manager over at the Czerka supply shop, said I could come work for him if I ever get tired of the mines. I think I'll go take him up on his offer.;NM20AAGRIF05017_.mp3
You know, maybe there's something else you can help me with. I need to talk to a guy first and set up the details, but if you're interested in a job come see me in Greeta's shop.;NM20AAGRIF05018_.mp3
Goodbye, Mission. Uh... I'm glad you're not dead.;NM20AAGRIF05019_.mp3
Hmph!;NM20AAGRIF05020_.mp3
Here - take 50 credits.;
Sorry, I don't have any credits to spare.;
Huh - I... uh... guess you've been talking to Lena, too. That's okay - I'll figure out a way to get by without your credits. I always do. Besides, I've already got a job lined up for me.;NM20AAGRIF05024_.mp3
Forget it - you're nothing but a deadbeat!;
Now what, Griff?;
So, is there a reward for rescuing you?;
Ha! You're kidding, right? Look at me... do I look like I've got any reward for you?;NM20AAGRIF05026_.mp3
What, no speeder escort? Okay, okay, I should just take what I can get. I sure would like to see Mission, though.;NM20AAGRIF05048_.mp3
She's probably waiting for you on the ship you used to come to Tatooine, right? I think I'll go to the spaceport and see her. She'd like that.;NM20AAGRIF05049_.mp3
Thanks again. Oh, and don't tell Mission I'm coming. I want it to be a surprise when I show up at the spaceport. I can't wait to see the look on her face.;NM20AAGRIF05050_.mp3
I can't just let you out. This whole place would turn on me.;
We'd be risking everything just to get you out! That doesn't bother you?;NM20AAGRIF05036_.mp3
You can't abandon me here. These Sand People, they're animals.;NM20AAGRIF05037_.mp3
Run to Anchorhead. They'll be too busy fighting me to operate the turrets.;
I'll try to talk to the Sand People Chieftain.;
And you'd better appreciate it!;NM20AAGRIF05041_.mp3
You know I do, Mission, you know I do. Honest this time.;NM20AAGRIF05042_.mp3
Yeah, you do that. Mission would appreciate it. I know it. She loves me like a... well, a brother, I guess.;NM20AAGRIF05043_.mp3
I'm not risking getting the Sand People mad. Stay here.;
Yeah, you can just stay here!;NM20AAGRIF05045_.mp3
Hey, come on now, you may as well be killing me. Get me out of here!;NM20AAGRIF05046_.mp3
What, we've only just met and everything is about you? What about me? Mission wouldn't want me trapped here waiting for Sand People to kill me.;NM20AAGRIF05038_.mp3
Run to Anchorhead. They're too busy fighting me to operate the turrets.;
Why shouldn't I just kill you? I've no interest in you.;
Hey now, I don't want him dead. Well, maybe I do, but couldn't we just let him sit here and think about things for a while?;NM20AAGRIF05052_.mp3
Oh, I've been thinking about a lot of things! Honest! Come on now, let me go.;NM20AAGRIF05053_.mp3
Hey, there's no call for that. If you know Mission like you say, you'll know she'd want me alive. I'm her dear brother.;NM20AAGRIF05055_.mp3
I don't need the headache. You'll die here!;
What? No! This isn't right! No!;NM20AAGRIF05057_.mp3
So, uh... you're here to save me, right? I'm sure you'll get... a huge reward! Yes indeed, Mission always said some people would pay to find me.;NM20AAGRIF05028_.mp3
You know Mission? Who are you?;
My name is Griff. You know her? Are you from Czerka Corporation? Please, tell me what's going on here!;NM20AAGRIF05030_.mp3
I know Mission. She's here on Tatooine with me.;
I'm her brother! She's alive? I... I can't believe it! When I heard about Taris I thought the worst! Come on, take me to her! Get me out of here!;NM20AAGRIF05032_.mp3
Mission travels with me. Why does that matter?;
Explain yourself! How do you know Mission?;
You're back! You've come to let old Griff out, right? Right? Uh... I don't want to beg, but I'm more than willing.;NM20AAGRIF05060_.mp3
You can just keep waiting, Griff. We'll get you out of there when it suits us.;NM20AAGRIF05061_.mp3
We used to be so close, sis. Now, I know we've had our differences, but I really need to get out of here now. No fooling.;NM20AAGRIF05062_.mp3
Because you know, I... I think Mission would really appreciate me being alive and not at all dead.;NM20AAGRIF05064_.mp3
[This assault droid must have been programmed to respond to Vek's commands. Now that he's gone, it isn't doing much of anything.];
Reprogram the droid.;
Leave the droid alone.;
[You leave the droid alone. Someone will probably be by to remove it in time.];
[Now that Ithorak is dead, you have no further use for this droid. Someone will probably remove it in time.];
Gotta like the races. There's nothing else, so you'd better.;NM17AE04SF07000_.mp3
Every now and then we push a new obstacle on the course to keep it fresh. Good luck out there.;NM17AE04SF07001_.mp3
Got a favorite racer? Nico's good, but Garm's a real pro.;NM17AE04SF07002_.mp3
It's too bad about Taris. The destruction there has really hurt the swoop circuit.;NM17AE04SF07003_.mp3
I suppose I've seen racers do worse than you did, but you'd better show your skills on the next run.;NM17AE04SF07004_.mp3
You're losing fans every race you lose. You'd better tighten up out there.;NM17AE04SF07005_.mp3
Not the worst I've seen, but you'll have to do better if you want to make the circuit.;NM17AE04SF07006_.mp3
You didn't look so good out there on that last race. Desert sun getting to you?;NM17AE04SF07007_.mp3
Watch your bike around here. You're doing all right, and the last thing you want is it to get stripped for parts.;NM17AE04SF07008_.mp3
Taris was a good track, but their racers were uptight. You win, and you look like you enjoy yourself.;NM17AE04SF07009_.mp3
That was a pretty good showing out there. Maybe you're not just another sand-skimming nerf herder.;NM17AE04SF07010_.mp3
If you're such a good racer, why are you here? Maybe you've done as good as you're going to.;NM17AE04SF07011_.mp3
Motta wants Tatooine to be the new Taris for races. A few more newcomers with your skills and he might do it.;NM17AE04SF07012_.mp3
Yuka Rill will be crying for days... or whatever it is Ithorians do. You beat his time into the ground!;NM17AE04SF07013_.mp3
I'm looking forward to seeing you go against Zoriis Bafka's time. She's been a pro for years.;NM17AE04SF07014_.mp3
You're almost good enough to go pro, you know? I'll be cheering for you in the next race.;NM17AE04SF07015_.mp3
You are an absolute terror on the track! Are you sure you're not a pro already?;NM17AE04SF07016_.mp3
If the circuit were up you'd be famous one three... no! Four worlds by now. You're just that good!;NM17AE04SF07017_.mp3
That last race of yours was the most exciting thing to blow through Tatooine... ever.;NM17AE04SF07018_.mp3
I'm going to watch for you in the future. Your races are... just amazing.;NM17AE04SF07019_.mp3
That last race was incredible. You just keep looking better and better out there... and here as well.;NM17AE04SF07020_.mp3
You're beautiful out there, absolutely beautiful. And a pro racer as well!;NM17AE04SF07021_.mp3
Lady, you are the best. I just had to say that.;NM17AE04SF07022_.mp3
I've never seen a woman come into town and take charge like you did out there. You are scary. Wonderfully scary.;NM17AE04SF07023_.mp3
We get some decent speed on the desert. No need for expensive mods. It's good for new racers like you.;NM17AE04SF07024_.mp3
Once you've raced a bit you'll learn that this track isn't the greatest, but it gets the job done.;NM17AE04SF07025_.mp3
It's crass to say, but the destruction of Taris means more racers coming here. Like you, I bet.;NM17AE04SF07026_.mp3
You a racer? Don't sign with Motta. That's all I'm saying.;NM17AE04SF07027_.mp3
Revan! Lord Malak told us you still lived. At last - a challenge worthy of my skills. I grow so bored with slaughtering these mindless training droids.;NM44AASITH04000_.mp3
I intensified my training ten fold in the hopes I would get the chance to face you in mortal combat! I am glad to see my training has not been in vain.;NM44AASITH04001_.mp3
Hello human. Are you a hunter like the others here? Not the life for me, but I admire you for it.;
What do you do?;
I fill the days with games of Pazaak. Not that there's many people to play with, but a person should keep busy somehow.;
I'd play with that fellow in the cantina, but I find him... distasteful. He does not play for the same reasons I do.;
Why do you play?;
The sport of it! Even if I lose there is reward in having played to the best of my ability. I don't dwell on the credits taken or given.;
To most people the game is simply gambling, but I choose to get more out of it than that. Not may players see it my way.;
Let's have a game.;
Well, I'm glad you still want to play. You're good and I enjoy the challenge. It's the best use of my time on this planet.;
Feel free to bet an interesting amount. It can add to the thrill of the game.;
I'm up for it. I haven't played you before so let's go slow to start. Low wagers, just to see how we measure up.;
Bet what you wish. I prefer the sport to the reward.;
Very well. I admire that you would return to the game after your initial bad luck. Let's keep wagers low until your luck changes.;
We'll do another round like before. You made a good showing last time, and I like to keep things friendly.;
I'm glad your loss has not soured you on the game. You've won before, and you likely will again. I like the challenge.;
We'll make this for moderate stakes, just to keep it interesting.;
You did well last time. I'm glad I found someone to offer decent competition here. There's not much else here to interest me.;
Where would I get a Pazaak deck?;
I couldn't say, though I suppose there might be one for sale in the cantina. There's a player in there that likes to take new money.;
He quits as soon as it's clear he'll lose big. I prefer honest competition, but I suppose I don't have to worry about money as much as some.;
Let's go back to my other questions.;
Very well. I have little else to do.;
Could I ask you about Tatooine?;
Oh, I doubt I could tell you more than the rest of these fellows. I haven't set foot outside Anchorhead, and I don't know why anyone would want to.;
Tatooine isn't a very hospitable place. I'll be going as soon as parts for my ship arrive. It may take some time, though.;
I want to ask about Pazaak;
What did you want to talk about? Would you care for a game?;
I have to go. Goodbye.;
Safe travels, wayfarer.;
Heard any rumors from off-planet?;
Nothing since that unfortunate business on Taris. The Republic is reeling from that, as are we all. It is troubling.;
But you can't let that call a stop to your day. We've survived worse, and will again. It's just the way things are.;
Well, that's a bit of hard luck, friend. Sorry about your loss. It was good sport though, wasn't it?;
I don't want you to get jaded about your performance. I see a lot of players quit too soon. It's your choice, of course.;
A surprising outcome considering how well you've done in the past. You're capable of far better.;
A bad hand or just a misplayed card or two, I guess. I'm sure you'll make up for it. You've beaten me before.;
Well, I have to say that you have proven a masterful player. I have to reward you, if only for the sport you have given me.;
Credits are such a hollow prize for good playing... here, you've earned this. It's a trinket that I won in the Dantooine sector.;
Thanks. I appreciate it.;
I'd hoped so. You play well, and should keep at it. Now, is there anything else you need?;
It's about time there was a decent payout.;
Don't taint your win with that attitude. I take no offence, but if the prize is all you want, any losses will be horrible to bear.;
It is, after all, just a game.;
Very good! You played quite well on that hand. I am impressed. I don't mind losing when the game was skillfully won.;
I shouldn't be surprised. After all, you have proven your skill many time over by now. It's a pleasure to play you.;
Obviously you have some ability, and I am glad for the competition. We could play some more and perhaps later we could raise the stakes.;
You are shaping up to be a fine competitor. I hope you keep playing and begin to see the long-term rewards of the game like I do.;
Well, nice to see you again. Would you like another game? You've proven your skill, and I like being challenged.;
Ah, welcome back. Would you care for another game? Very few of my old playing buddies come this way.;
Hello again. What can I do for you? As I must have said, I'm no hunter like the others here.;
Keep your eyes open. Our sources tell us Brejik's planning a hit on Gadon. There could be a Vulkar assassin in here right now!;NM11AAHIDB04000_.mp3
Not too many riders can post a time as low as you did, rookie. Too bad it didn't stand up.;
When will you Vulkars learn that I'm the best swoop rider on Taris? None of you has a chance against me.;
Normally I can match Redros run for run, but he had the race of his life today. If anyone's going to beat him it's going to have to be you and that prototype accelerator.;
I've never understood why so many of you new riders make your first competitive start in the biggest race of the year.;
You don't stand a chance against the more experienced riders. But if the Vulkars want to throw away one of their entries on you, that's fine by me.;
That accelerator Gadon slapped on your swoop will help, but I just don't think that will be enough. Plus there's always the chance it will explode during your run.;
You didn't look too bad out there, rookie. I'm not saying you looked good, mind you... only that you didn't look bad.;
I can't talk right now. I need to prepare myself if I want to end up in the winner's circle.;
You have done us a great help by removing the Elders from our way. Now we can at last gain entrance to the Temple.;
You betrayed us last time you were here, Revan. Do not let this happen again.;
The One has said that we must let you aid yourself to what we may have so that you may overcome the Elders.;
The loremaster will surely be interested in the stories you have gained since leaving us last, Revan.;
Oh, thank you! Thank you!;NM13AAELIS08000_.mp3
I don't know what I would have done if I had lost him!;NM13AAELIS08002_.mp3
It's...;
It's just so good to have him back!;NM13AAELIS08004_.mp3
We're just going to go right home right now and celebrate, aren't we, my lovely little droid?;NM13AAELIS08006_.mp3
Don't worry, I'm going to hug you and oil you and care for you and make sure you never get away ever again.;NM13AAELIS08008_.mp3
Please kill me...;NM13AAELIS08012_.mp3
I don't think I've ever felt so bad for a droid before.;NM13AAELIS08014_.mp3
[sadly] Beep Boop-oop.;
I agree. Completely.;
Ha! I guess that droid is really going to to serve his master tonight!;NM13AAELIS08018_.mp3
I...;
No...;
I... I took the loss of my droid much too hard. I feel I must apologize.;NM13AAELIS08022_.mp3
There is no need.;
But I must. I was much too attached to my droid... It was all that was left of my husband, you see. Maybe I thought that, through the droid, my husband could live again... be with me still...;NM13AAELIS08024_.mp3
I think we understand. Love can do strange things to anyone.;NM13AAELIS08026_.mp3
But I went too far. I could not see what was missing in living a normal life. Fortunately, in my grief I returned here and ran into Samnt - an absolutely fascinating man!;NM13AAELIS08028_.mp3
Yes, he seems quite nice.;
Samnt and I got to talking and, well, we have a lot in common. I think we'll be seeing more of each other. It's funny how these things work out in the end. Maybe there is such a thing as fate, after all...;NM13AAELIS08031_.mp3
But I think we should be going now... we have so much more to talk about! I just wanted to thank you for what you've done for me, and what you tried to do.;NM13AAELIS08033_.mp3
Goodbye, and thank you.;NM13AAELIS08035_.mp3
He doesn't look that impressive.;
Meh, I've seen better.;
Not half the man I am!;
Well, if his ego is similarly halved he should be just about right.;NM13AAELIS08039_.mp3
Damn right!;
I was much too attached to my droid... It was all that was left of my husband, you see. Maybe I thought that through the droid, my husband could live again... be with me still...;NM13AAELIS08042_.mp3
A reward speaks louder than words.;
Unfortunately I have none to give, otherwise I would. But I still feel I must explain myself... I suppose I came across as a little odd.;NM13AAELIS08045_.mp3
You've been beating me a lot lately... I don't know how much longer I can last against you.;
I don't really even have any more credits left to play... but if you want, I could put a few of my cards as my wager... You up for that?;
Sure, let's play.;
Let's see if I can't turn this around...;
Maybe some other time.;
Sure. Come back if you want a last game or two.;
Well, that was quite the victory. What is that, ten, eleven times you've won? Good games, though. Best fun I've had in a while.;
Heh, maybe I should give you something else. Ten or more wins is considered a tournament victory by some players. Not that I ever get to tournaments...;
Here, take these. I don't get much time to use them and they don't seem to be doing me much good anyway.;
That's very sporting of you.;
I don't know about that. I just play for fun.;
Anyway, I have to get out of here... work calls.;
It beats taking your paltry surplus credits.;
You don't have to take them if you don't want. If they're such a hassle, you're the fool for still playing. I'm just killing time.;
I have to go. Goodbye.;
All right. Goodbye. I have to get back to work anyway.;
What do you want? I don't get a lot of time off from loading cargo, so if you've got something to say, make it quick.;
What do you do for Czerka Corporation?;
Oh, I'm not actually considered a real employee. At least, not enough to get one of those uniforms they strut around in. I just load cargo.;
When a ship comes in I work straight through the day, but mostly I just pass the time playing Pazaak. Want a game?;
Let's have a game.;
Eh, I suppose, but I think it's pretty clear that you are the better player. You've won a lot. I suppose I can afford it, though.;
Bet what you want. It's not like I can spend my money anywhere else on this planet.;
Sure, let's go. Just a small wager to start, though, because I don't know how good you are. It's kind of a courtesy to new players.;
Low stakes for now, but we'll raise them later.;
Sure. I'm not sure I'd keep playing after a start like yours, so maybe we should keep the wager low until you get better.;
Sure, you had a good start, so let's keep going. I don't mind the occasional loss to a good player.;
Yeah, I suppose you would want to make up for your last loss. You've won before, so this should be a good game.;
We'll make the stakes interesting, but not too high. We're not playing at that level yet.;
Sure. I'd like to make up for you beating me again. Not that I can't afford it. No where else to spend my money.;
Where would I get a Pazaak deck?;
Don't have one? I'm surprised. You probably spend a lot of time on trade routes and such, and there's nothing better to kill the time.;
I might have... yes, here we are, I have a spare deck. I could sell it to you for maybe... 75 credits. It's pretty basic.;
I'll pay 75 credits. Give me the deck.;
Here you are. You'll want to go over the rules too. I have a pamphlet you can load into your journal, though you probably already have one.;
You'll want to find some cards to improve that deck. Like I said, it's pretty basic. When you think you're ready, we'll have a game.;
Can we play a practice hand?;
I guess we could try a hand or two to get you used to how the game works.;
[Play Pazaak Tutorial];
Let's go back to my other questions.;
It will be a while before another ship comes in, so go ahead.;
I have some questions about Kashyyyk?;
What? Oh, you mean Edean? I suppose the Wookiees can call their planet whatever they want, but the company pays to name the trade routes.;
I don't know much about it, though. I stay here and load cargo. You're better off asking the patrol guards or Janos.;
I want to ask about Pazaak;
I like playing more than talking about it. What did you want?;
Heard any off-planet rumors?;
I heard something about Taris but I didn't really know anyone from there so I haven't paid attention. Does that sound bad?;
I just figure that whatever is going on, whoever is in charge will still always need someone to load crates.;
I don't have that much. Would you go lower?;
I don't know if I can do that. It is a spare, but I could use the money to buy better cards for my main deck.;
[Persuade] Nobody else is asking. Who else will play you?;
[Success] I suppose that makes sense. I mean, I don't really need it, and how else will I get someone to play me?;
[Failure] I don't know about that. I'm sure I'll find someone eventually. I think I'll hang on to it.;
[Force Persuade] You want to give me the deck.;
[Success] I want to give you the deck. Sure I do. I mean, how else am I going to get anyone to play with?;
I beat you good on that one. Sorry, but that's the way the cards go. Just the luck of the draw, I guess.;
That's got to be rough, but things can change fast. You'll want to keep playing, I bet. Never quit on a loss.;
That's a surprise. You've won so many times I thought you were sure to beat me again.;
You've beat me before, though, and I bet you want to try again. I always tell people never to quit on a loss.;
Well, you beat me fair on that hand. That was pretty well played. I made a few mistakes I shouldn't have.;
Of course, you're making a habit of beating me. I should know when to quit, but what else is there to do here?;
Well, looks like you've got some skill. Could be beginner's luck, though. Want another game?;
You're beating me fairly regular. I'm going to have to try a few different strategies from now on.;
Ah, it's you again. Want another game? You've been the most challenge I've had for... I don't know how long. Not a lot of dockside Pazaak champions.;
Oh, hello again. Did you want another game? I don't think there will be any ships in for quite a while.;
What do you want now? I don't want to waste my off time just talking.;
Beep beep beep-oop!;NM35AADROI01000_.mp3
Well, I guess the course proved too much for you at this level. Better luck next time.;NM26ABSWOO18004_.mp3
No offence, but I could have done better than you on that last race. As a true fan, I know how to do these things right.;NM26ABSWOO18005_.mp3
You didn't look too good out there on that last run. I guess everyone has their bad days.;NM26ABSWOO18006_.mp3
You sure you're cut out for this league of racing? Maybe the stress of it is getting to you.;NM26ABSWOO18007_.mp3
I don't believe it! Who'd have thought Queedle had it in him?;NM26ABSWOO18024_.mp3
A new Champion! And it's Queedle! I knew he could do it with a decent swoop under him.;NM26ABSWOO18025_.mp3
How about that? Queedle, a local racer, showing those pros how it's done!;NM26ABSWOO18026_.mp3
I cheer for Queedle now that he's winning. It would take an amazing racer to win me away.;NM26ABSWOO18027_.mp3
You here to cheer Casandra? She's a fine racer. I hope she knocks Hukta out of the running.;NM26ABSWOO18000_.mp3
Hukta Jax is insane. He just smashes through everything to the finish. I guess we should expect that from a Gamorrean?;NM26ABSWOO18001_.mp3
We need more rules about overpowered bikes. Hukta just rides over everything. It's boring watching him.;NM26ABSWOO18002_.mp3
Queedle is the local favorite. You should cheer along with us. He needs the encouragement.;NM26ABSWOO18003_.mp3
You're pretty good. Maybe I should start putting some credits on your races.;NM26ABSWOO18008_.mp3
I guess you've got what it takes to advance. The odds against you winning are getting better.;NM26ABSWOO18009_.mp3
The second round always has experienced riders. You'll be up against some tough times.;NM26ABSWOO18010_.mp3
You're up against the second round times now. That's a hard round to beat.;NM26ABSWOO18011_.mp3
Some of the racers are having a bad time here on Manaan. Seems like you have all the luck right now.;NM26ABSWOO18012_.mp3
Some of the other fans didn't think you could reach the second round, but I knew you would all along.;NM26ABSWOO18013_.mp3
Are you sure you're up to challenging the third round time? I mean, you're good, but are you that good?;NM26ABSWOO18014_.mp3
I'm putting all my credits on you. You're a sure thing.;NM26ABSWOO18015_.mp3
Whew, that was an exciting time you turned in. Noboby else had a chance.;NM26ABSWOO18016_.mp3
Good race, Sector Champion. I guess you'll be off to the big tracks, once the circuit is back up.;NM26ABSWOO18017_.mp3
Wow, I bet you could have won on Taris with times like that. It's a shame we'll never know.;NM26ABSWOO18018_.mp3
Could I get an autoprint? You've just had the quickest rise to Sector Champion that I've ever seen.;NM26ABSWOO18019_.mp3
It's amazing what you've accomplished here, and you've done it with such style. I've never met a woman like you.;NM26ABSWOO18020_.mp3
You sure put Hukta in his place. I don't have to say that you are a much more appealing champion.;NM26ABSWOO18021_.mp3
I haven't seen a race like that in years. Well, there was Gandroff on Coruscant, but he lacked your... charms.;NM26ABSWOO18022_.mp3
You are amazing out on the course... and in person. Congratulations.;NM26ABSWOO18023_.mp3

This droid is damaged and inactive.;
Reactivate the droid. (1 repair part);
[Failure] You don't have any repair parts. You leave the droid alone for now.;
Look out! It's an ambush!;
You return... have you found them? Did you kill them all? They were animals in armor, with no honor among them.;
The Mandalorian hunters are dead. I killed them all.;
Yes... yes I see the trophy helmet from the one that gave orders. Their bodies will not last long in the Shadowlands. I am glad.;
The taint of them, their cowardice... the forest will consume it all. I hope this gives my hunting brethren peace.;
I hope it does. Goodbye.;
Wait... you have helped in avenging my fellows. I must acknowledge that, even though you are an outsider and are not to be truly trusted.;
This one is different. This one acts for us.;
I am not ready to accept your word, Zaalbar. I remember you as a mad-claw. Let me make my own judgment of this person.;
This outsider has shown honor through action. I will grant a reward because of this, not because you attempt to speak for them.;
Outsider, you have acted as a fellow Wookiee would have. Here, take this. It is the symbol of my hunting clan. You served them, so you deserve it.;
When you look at it, remember that we reward respect, even from outsiders.;
Don't speak to me, mad-claw. Chuundar must have allowed you to return to Kashyyyk, but I remember you as a mad-claw.;
You have acted as a fellow Wookiee would have. Here, take this. It is the symbol of my hunting clan. You served them, so you deserve it.;
I would have killed them anyway.;
Yes, they atacked you as well, didn't they? I never thought I would be on the same side as an outsider. It is a strange feeling.;
Yes, yes, heartwarming. Where is my reward?;
"You have surprised me with your help; don't spoil this meeting with your outsider greed when I would give you a reward anyway.";
No, I'll get back at it.;
I thank you. These creatures, they have no honor. Let their blood feed the Shadowlands.;
I'm not going to bother with this.;
I should have expected this from you, outsider. Cowardice disguised. You can walk away, but I will stay and fight.;
I am just the kind of target they like... wounded... helpless. I will fight to my last breath. Leave me.;
Rrraagh! Great Bacca, let this outsider be different than the slavers... I beg you... can you heal my wounds?;
An attack... from nowhere. Please, I need to be healed. Can you?;
What happened here?;
Please... I need to be healed. I... am dying...;
I have the means to heal you. Here.;
Mighty generous of you. A little too generous, if you ask me.;NGLOBECAND03477_.mp3
I... I thank you. I would not have expected an outsider to aid me. Perhaps... perhaps you will help again?;
My hunting party, all of them, killed without honor. I barely survived. I want the murderers to suffer the same.;
What can you tell me about your attackers?;
I've never seen their kind before, not even among the Czerka. You saw them, armored head to toe, yet blending with the forest.;
They were Mandalorian. Poachers, probably. They use stealth units to stalk their prey. Their kind were among the first to flee when the war turned against my people. Bloody cowards.;NM25AAHURT03068_.mp3
They followed us for a long while. We found bodies to the southwest, and then again further south after the west branch of the path. Their speed was amazing.;
They fought like outsiders, waiting until we were unarmed. They would not attack until we had put our weapons away! They strike like cowards!;
I'll look into it.;
I thank you. I will wait here. I am too weak to fight them again, but I refuse to leave the Shadowlands unless vengeance is sated.;
Please, if you kill them, I will reward you with whatever I can. They are not worthy of life.;
Look for them where the bodies of my fellows are. They will only attack you if you are not armed. The cowards.;
This is not my problem.;
You have already fought some of them. How can you claim it is not your problem? They may come for you next, waiting until you put your weapons away, like they attacked us.;
I should have known not to expect much from an outsider. I will find them on my own... as weak as I am.;
I don't have the means to heal you.;
We must find some way to help. Anything.;
Please... try to help. Is there nothing... you can do? Please...;
That is no answer. I refuse to help, weakling.;
Observation: Your ruthlessness and cruelty are quite refreshing in an organic meatbag, master. Are you sure you aren't part droid?;NM25AAHURT03069_.mp3
Nice. Real nice. Maybe later we could find some insects to pull the legs off, huh?;NGLOBEJOLE09762_.mp3
I know you're supposed to save the galaxy and all, but could you try being less of a scummy core slime while you're doing it?;NGLOBEMISS13304_.mp3
*whisper* The Jedi should be protectors of the weak! You shame us all by your actions here.;NM25AAHURT03072_.mp3
You must help him! This is not right!;
Very well. here, this should help.;
I don't have the means to help him.;
Don't question me. Remember your life debt.;
Grrrgh... as you wish...;
Outsider... like any other. I should expect nothing. Leave me to die... leave...;
We should guard and protect those weaker than ourselves... not bully and exploit them!;NGLOBEBAST06899_.mp3
This isn't right! We should be helping people, not making their lives miserable.;NM17AA03SH01160_.mp3
Why should I help you? Why are you worthy?;
You return? Please, I am dying... can you heal me?;
Help! Here... I am dying...;
Rrragh... can anyone hear me? Bacca have mercy...;
Hey! You not come in here! Brejik say only lab guys come here!;
Wait, up-worlder. You can't go through this gate. There is too much danger and suffering beyond. For your own sake, turn back.;NM04AAOUTW23000_.mp3
I have brought you a serum to cure the rakghoul disease.;
Your offer is generous, up-worlder, but the serum is useless to us now.;NM04AAOUTW23002_.mp3
The villagers infected with the rakghoul disease have been quarantined beyond this gate. At any moment they could be transformed into terrible monsters.;NM04AAOUTW23004_.mp3
Nobody would be foolish enough to risk going into the pens to give them the cure: the infected ones could transform into rakghouls and attack them at any moment.;NM04AAOUTW23006_.mp3
So you'll just leave the infected ones to die? You're a coward!;
I can't help the infected ones. They have to die so that the rest of the village can live. I accept this. If you think that makes me a coward, so be it.;NM04AAOUTW23008_.mp3
I'm going through those gates to try and help the infected ones!;
I can't stop you from going through the gates, up-worlder. But if the infected ones have already transformed into rakghouls you'll be walking into your grave.;NM04AAOUTW23028_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;
If you have questions you should speak to Gendar. He's the leader of this village. All my attention has to stay focused on trying to ease the suffering of those within the village.;NM04AAOUTW23016_.mp3
But despite my medical training, there is nothing I can do to help the poor souls locked on the other side of this gate.;NM04AAOUTW23012_.mp3
What are you talking about?;
The villagers infected with the rakghoul disease are quarantined beyond this gate. It's only a matter of time until they transform into horrible creatures that would destroy us all.;NM04AAOUTW23021_.mp3
So you just lock them away in a cage?;NM04AAOUTW23039_.mp3
For the sake of the village, we have to keep the infected ones locked away. And when they finally do transform into rakghouls we'll let them destroy each other.;NM04AAOUTW23023_.mp3
There must be something someone can do!;
Nothing can be done for the infected villagers. Even the serum to counteract the rakghoul disease wouldn't be any use, now.;NM04AAOUTW23025_.mp3
Goodbye.;
Farewell.;NM04AAOUTW23031_.mp3
I need healing.;
Who are you?;
I am Esala, healer of this village. I use my knowledge and what little resources we have to care for the Outcasts who are sick or injured.;NM04AAOUTW23010_.mp3
Danger and suffering? What are you talking about?;
You can't tell me where I can and can't go!;
I'm only warning you for your own protection, up-worlder.;NM04AAOUTW23019_.mp3
You amaze me. I always thought the surface dwellers couldn't care less about us Outcasts. But you risked everything to help those infected villagers!;NM04AAOUTW23033_.mp3
I wish I had some type of reward to give you, but we Outcasts have nothing. All I can offer is the gratitude of the entire village.;NM04AAOUTW23035_.mp3
Back again. Is there something else you need?;NM04AAOUTW23037_.mp3
How dare you invade my chambers! How rude! I am a personal guest of Davik himself! I left specific instructions that you guards were not to disturb me until morning!;NM08AADAVG07000_.mp3
How can Davik expect me to invest in his ventures with this kind of incompetence on display? I should summon the other guards and report you to your commanding officer!;NM08AADAVG07002_.mp3
[Persuade/Lie] Uh... Davik just wanted me to make sure you didn't need anything.;
[Success] Well, I suppose I can forgive the intrusion in this case. Tell Davik I admire a host who has his underlings check up on the well-being and comfort of his guests.;NM08AADAVG07004_.mp3
I don't require anything right now - you can tell Davik everything about my stay has been most pleasing so far. Here's a five credit chip for your trouble, sirrah.;NM08AADAVG07006_.mp3
I don't work for Davik, you over-inflated windbag!;
Don't work for Davik? Then what are you... oh blast! Assassins! Guards, save me!;NM08AADAVG07012_.mp3
Thank you, sir.;
Now scurry on back to Davik. If I find I have need of anything I'll buzz for you. Until then I expect you to respect my privacy.;NM08AADAVG07008_.mp3
[Failure] That is no excuse for incompetence! I gave very specific orders that were not followed. I'm going to summon the guards and report you to your superiors!;NM08AADAVG07010_.mp3
You touch that alarm and you're a dead man!;
What? How dare you speak to me like that! I could ask Davik to have you flayed alive for such insolence!;NM08AADAVG07015_.mp3
That's it - time for you to die!;
What? But... help! Assassins! Guards - help!;NM08AADAVG07017_.mp3
You again? My instructions were not complicated. Give me one good reason why I shouldn't call the other guards and have your incompetence reported to the commanding officer!;NM08AADAVG07019_.mp3
[Persuade/Lie] I'm just checking up on you again.;
[Success] Well, if you think I'm going to tip you again you're sadly mistaken. Now leave me be.;NM08AADAVG07021_.mp3
Great Chuundar has finished with you, <FullName>. You may walk the sacred boughs of our village, but expect no further audience.;
Go, and expect no more to be said!;
You have been given a task, outsider. Be thankful for your time on our world and do as you have been bid.;
I want to speak with Chuundar again.;
You be allowed audience when you return after completing his task. Only then will you have reason.;
I will need directions.;
The village exit is northwest of here. Once outside, follow the platform to the east until you get to where Gorwooken is waiting.;
He will lower you to the Shadowlands, though I would prefer that you were simply dropped. You'll die down there anyway.;
What can I expect to find in the Shadowlands?;
If the forest holds any justice you will die down there, as would all outsiders.;
I want directions for what's in the village.;
Others may speak to you, <FullName>, but I won't. I don't want you here. The sooner you are gone, the better.;
I'll be going then.;
Return when Chuundar's task is complete. That is what the Chieftain wants.;
[This man appears to be looking for someone... maybe even one of your companions back on the Ebon Hawk.];
Carth! Carth Onasi, is that you?;NM35AAJORD10000_.mp3
Jordo?;NM35AAJORD10001_.mp3
It *is* you, isn't it? I knew it when I laid eyes on you! You old spacedog, how have you been? I thought for sure you'd be fighting on some ship out there.;NM35AAJORD10002_.mp3
I was. I crashed.;NM35AAJORD10003_.mp3
Ha ha ha! That's pretty rich. I can't imagine what it would take to keep you on the ground.;NM35AAJORD10004_.mp3
Must have something to do with your friend, here, hey? How's it going?;NM35AAJORD10005_.mp3
Can we hurry this up...?;
Oh, I apologize. You folks are probably busy, aren't you? I just wanted to catch up with Carth, that's all.;NM35AAJORD10008_.mp3
So, what are you doing here, Jordo? The last time I saw you was on, um... well, Telos, actually.;NM35AAJORD10012_.mp3
Yeah... it's a shame about home. Telos still hasn't recovered. The family and I moved on, and I'm working for Czerka now.;NM35AAJORD10013_.mp3
I didn't see you after... er, what I mean is, my condolences on your wife. I heard what happened. At least your boy made it through alright.;NM35AAJORD10014_.mp3
My... boy? You mean... Dustil?;NM35AAJORD10015_.mp3
Yes, of course. I saw him not long ago here on Korriban, though he didn't recognize me. You... didn't know he was here?;NM35AAJORD10016_.mp3
No! Jordo, Dustil has been missing since the attack on Telos! Are you... are you absolutely certain it was him?!;NM35AAJORD10018_.mp3
Yeah. I'd recognize Dustil anywhere. Positive. He's, uh... he's joined the Sith, Carth...;NM35AAJORD10019_.mp3
What do you mean he's joined the Sith?;NM35AAJORD10020_.mp3
There's an academy for the Sith on Korriban. He's a student there. I saw him suited up in their outfit and everything. Sorry... I thought you knew.;NM35AAJORD10021_.mp3
No... no, I... I didn't. Well, thanks for telling me, Jordo.;NM35AAJORD10022_.mp3
Sure, no problem. Good to see you again, Carth. Hope everything works out with Dustil.;NM35AAJORD10023_.mp3
Dustil... Dustil is alive! We have to go to the Korriban academy and find him!;NM35AAJORD10024_.mp3
We have other priorities, Carth.;
You think I don't know that? I just... if there's a chance we can try to find him... I don't want to wait to track him down, if possible.;NM35AAJORD10026_.mp3
All this time I've thought he was... he must be a man by now...;NM35AAJORD10031_.mp3
I understand. We'll go as soon as possible.;
Thank you. I... I just have to see him. I have to know what happened to him.;NM35AAJORD10028_.mp3
Are you sure that's wise?;
I don't know. I don't know why Dustil would be with the Sith... but I... I have to find out. There's simply no choice.;NM35AAJORD10030_.mp3
Yes, of course. I saw him at my last stop, on Korriban, though he didn't recognize me. You... didn't know he was there?;NM35AAJORD10017_.mp3
You're a friend of Carth's, I take it?;
Sure am. We joined the militia together back on Telos. That was a lot of years ago, of course.;NM35AAJORD10010_.mp3
Nice to meet you, Jordo.;
Must have something to do with your pretty friend, here, hey? How do you do, miss?;NM35AAJORD10006_.mp3
Excellent work, my young Sith. Your enemy lies dead at your feet and you are victorious... the final test is complete.;NM39AAUTHA03000_.mp3
I must say that... unnhh! What... what is happening?! My strength is... fading! What have you done?!;NM39AAUTHA03001_.mp3
Oh. That must be the poison kicking in, finally.;
You... you fool! You will never... never be a Sith, now!!;NM39AAUTHA03003_.mp3
I got what I came here for. The Star Map.;
You... I will destroy you, mongrel! I will rip the flesh from your bones!!;NM39AAUTHA03005_.mp3
Never? I'm hurt by that. Really, I am.;
That's the idea! Time to die, scum!;
My mission is to recover the Star Map, not become a Sith.;
You are as evil and twisted as Malak. You Sith deserve to die!;
I did what I had to to wipe your kind of evil from the galaxy!;
You didn't think I actually wanted to be a Sith, did you?;
What?! But, but... why did... you come?! Why... are you here, if not to become Sith?!;NM39AAUTHA03012_.mp3
You two were pathetically easy to turn on each other.;
I must say that it is quite disappointing that you must die now, as well, seeing as you didn't inform me earlier of Yuthura's plans.;NM39AAUTHA03014_.mp3
What? But I passed your test!;
So you did. And now I shall destroy you as I would any other Sith who betrayed me.;NM39AAUTHA03016_.mp3
So let's get this over with, shall we? I have a new batch of candidates arriving tomorrow.;NM39AAUTHA03021_.mp3
Don't be a fool, Sith. I'll destroy you.;
Destroy me? I am not Yuthura, young one. I am a Sith Master... and I tire of foolish upstarts.;NM39AAUTHA03018_.mp3
It's okay. I'm not here to join the Sith anyway.;
Is that so? So you were a spy all along? How interesting.;NM39AAUTHA03020_.mp3
It figures. You are as evil and twisted as Malak.;
I am not here to join the Sith, anyway. My mission is done.;
I must say that it is quite disappointing that you must die now, as well, since there's no telling how far your scheming with Yuthura went.;NM39AAUTHA03024_.mp3
You are truly a Sith in spirit, and one gifted with great power. Of this I no longer have any doubt. There is much more for you to learn, perhaps... but not here.;NM39AAUTHA03025_.mp3
There is... something very strange about you, young one. Something I cannot place. You are like no other student I have ever met.;NM39AAUTHA03026_.mp3
Why that is, I cannot say. Your path takes you elsewhere, however, and soon.;NM39AAUTHA03027_.mp3
Go on to your destiny, then, and return here afterwards... if that is what you still desire.;NM39AAUTHA03028_.mp3
So am I a Sith now or not?;
You have passed the final test, but I see it is not yet your destiny to join the order. Perhaps that will come in time, young one.;NM39AAUTHA03030_.mp3
There is much you must accomplish, first. The dark side has plans for you. As I said... return once that is done, if you desire.;NM39AAUTHA03031_.mp3
Perhaps we shall meet again.;
May the Force serve you well, young one.;NM39AAUTHA03033_.mp3
Alright, I'll go.;
My desire is to see you dead, actually.;
My desire is to see all evil such as yourself defeated.;
Is it... is it possible that you are not what you seem to be? Tell me, young one... tell me what you really are.;NM39AAUTHA03037_.mp3
I am Darth Revan. Bow before me.;
Ah, I see. So it is... Darth Revan, not dead as we were led to believe.;NM39AAUTHA03043_.mp3
And yet... and yet you are *not* Revan, are you? What has occurred between the time of your reported death and now I can only guess at, but you have changed much.;NM39AAUTHA03044_.mp3
Regardless, your destiny does take you away from here... to confront your old pupil, without a doubt. Yes... that is what lies before you.;NM39AAUTHA03045_.mp3
Go to your destiny, then, my Dark Lord. I shall say nothing of what you have done here. Should you prove victorious and wish to return, then I and all Sith shall be your servants.;NM39AAUTHA03046_.mp3
I was once Darth Revan.;
Who or what I am is not important.;
I see. No matter what you might be, then, I am certain that your path takes you elsewhere... and soon.;NM39AAUTHA03041_.mp3
If you were not blind, you would already know.;
Do not let your attention waver! Strike her down!!;NM39AAUTHA03047_.mp3
So you return to us with the lightsaber in hand, as I knew you would.;NM39AAUTHA03048_.mp3
The Force has served you well.;NM39AAUTHA03049_.mp3
You took a great risk in acquiring the artifact. You used your mind and your power... no peaceful meditation, no pacifism.;NM39AAUTHA03050_.mp3
Sometimes you must fight in order to achieve. This gives you your passion, this makes you stronger. This is what makes you superior.;NM39AAUTHA03051_.mp3
That is the lesson we teach with that part of the final test. Do you understand?;NM39AAUTHA03052_.mp3
The Sith are not the only ones who fight and take risks.;
True, but most would say they fight only when they must... or not at all. We are the ones who know that struggle is what makes us superior.;NM39AAUTHA03054_.mp3
Are you saying a Jedi couldn't have gotten the lightsaber?;
When a Jedi acts, it is with skill, true. But the Jedi teach you that your passions are counter-productive. That strength is only found in peace.;NM39AAUTHA03056_.mp3
Did you not feel a moment of excitement in the tomb? Did your passions not flow and make you feel stronger and more alive?;NM39AAUTHA03057_.mp3
What purpose would be served by restricting yourself from such? I would say only the purpose of the Jedi. Through this they would control you and restrict your potential.;NM39AAUTHA03058_.mp3
I wouldn't say I exerted myself getting this.;
Perhaps not, to someone of your natural strength. The point is in the recognition of the nature of the act rather than its sheer difficulty.;NM39AAUTHA03060_.mp3
I don't believe you. I don't feel superior to anyone.;
If you came to the academy, you must have felt the stirrings within you that cry out for the freedom of the dark side, that cry out for release.;NM39AAUTHA03062_.mp3
I can only show you the path that will lead to power and superiority. You have followed it this far... you must decide if you are capable of continuing.;NM39AAUTHA03063_.mp3
And if I'm not?;
This is where your path ends, young one. There is no turning back once you have embarked on it.;NM39AAUTHA03065_.mp3
I think I understand.;
Good. The last part of your test will now commence. Here you will learn the lesson of competition.;NM39AAUTHA03067_.mp3
All life must compete in order to flourish. Such is the natural way of the universe. To stand still is to know death... one must always be moving forward.;NM39AAUTHA03068_.mp3
So is it the same amongst the Sith. Compete or die. Mercy is irrelevant.;NM39AAUTHA03069_.mp3
So it behooves you in this final test to strike down one you are familiar with, for no other reason than to prove you are superior and without mercy.;NM39AAUTHA03070_.mp3
Normally this would be against another student. You, however, get a special treat. You will fight Yuthura, here... my own apprentice.;NM39AAUTHA03071_.mp3
You talk too much, old fool.;NM39AAUTHA03072_.mp3
So... you know, do you? Well, it makes no difference. You have become too ambitious, Yuthura... it is time for you to die.;NM39AAUTHA03073_.mp3
No, it is time for *you* to die, master. My pupil stands with me.;NM39AAUTHA03074_.mp3
Oh? Is this true, young one? You wish to join Yuthura in her foolish scheme?;NM39AAUTHA03075_.mp3
Sorry, Uthar... I'm with Yuthura on this one.;
Do you hear that, my master? That is the sound of a new leader rising to replace you.;NM39AAUTHA03078_.mp3
So the time has come, has it? I... I will... ugh... no! My... strength leaves me!!;NM39AAUTHA03079_.mp3
You are weak, Uthar, and the Force has abandoned you. We have made sure of it!;NM39AAUTHA03080_.mp3
So the time has come, has it? You both wish to stand against a Sith Master and perish, do you? THEN SO BE IT!!;NM39AAUTHA03081_.mp3
I'm with you, Master Uthar.;
You fool! You have no idea what you've done!;NM39AAUTHA03083_.mp3
The final test continues as it should. Proceed and be rewarded, young one.;NM39AAUTHA03084_.mp3
The only 'reward'... you... no! My strength... is leaving me!!;NM39AAUTHA03085_.mp3
It appears, my dear, that some tests are fairer than others. I wish you luck.;NM39AAUTHA03086_.mp3
You... betrayed me?! I thought... we were friends! Damn you!!;NM39AAUTHA03087_.mp3
The only 'reward' you will get is death!!;NM39AAUTHA03088_.mp3
You're both mistaken. I choose me.;
You are indeed a fool if you think to oppose us both, young one.;NM39AAUTHA03090_.mp3
To think I actually believed for a moment that you and I were friends. So be it.;NM39AAUTHA03091_.mp3
Do not fret, my dear. All will be... ugh... no! My strength... leaves me!!;NM39AAUTHA03096_.mp3
The poison! You will pay for this, you... you... damn you! My blood burns!!;NM39AAUTHA03097_.mp3
What can I say? I'm no fool.;
You will never leave here!!;NM39AAUTHA03099_.mp3
You were too easy to turn on each other.;
Your evil was all too eager to turn on each other, remember?;
I did what I had to. Time to die, Sith.;
The poison! You will pay for this! We will destroy you!!;NM39AAUTHA03103_.mp3
Do not fret, my dear. All will be as it was quickly enough.;NM39AAUTHA03104_.mp3
You will pay for this, you... you... Damn you! My strength... it's... poisoned!;NM39AAUTHA03105_.mp3
You will pay for this, fool! We will destroy you!!;NM39AAUTHA03106_.mp3
Hmph. To think that I actually hoped you could be of use to me.;NM39AAUTHA03092_.mp3
This makes no sense. You will never become a Sith if you turn on us both! What could you hope to accomplish?;NM39AAUTHA03093_.mp3
"I have the power to kill you both; I am the true Sith here!";
Betrayed! He *is* a spy!;NM39AAUTHA03095_.mp3
Betrayed! She *is* a spy!;NM39AAUTHA03107_.mp3
You think I wish to be a Sith? I am a spy for the Jedi, fools!;
I used you both to complete my mission.;
I would never become an evil Sith. I came for the Star Map.;
My mission is to defeat Malak, as well as all you Sith.;
I did what I had to, to wipe your kind of evil from the galaxy!;
I'm tired of playing along with you Sith scum! You both die!!;
Sadly, Yuthura, it is you who are mistaken. Your pupil is more ambitious than you realize... isn't that so, young one?;NM39AAUTHA03076_.mp3
What?! So this is what you had planned all along. You wish me killed.;NM39AAUTHA03114_.mp3
Indeed. You have become too ambitious, Yuthura. It is time for you to die and someone more... talented... to take your place.;NM39AAUTHA03115_.mp3
You must locate the ceremonial lightsaber and return here to us. Yuthura and I cannot help you in this, young one.;NM39AAUTHA03116_.mp3
[A day passes in preparation. Uthar then takes you and Yuthura to the Sith tomb. Your companions are not permitted to join you.];
Very well. We are now ready for your final test, young Sith. You have earned the right to see if you shall become one of us.;NM39AAUTHA03117_.mp3
Indeed you have.;NM39AAUTHA03118_.mp3
I dislike your tone, Yuthura. What are you up to, now?;NM39AAUTHA03119_.mp3
Nothing of course, my master. I was merely agreeing with you. Should we not get on with the test?;NM39AAUTHA03120_.mp3
Yes. Yes, of course. We are in the sacred tomb of Naga Sadow, young one, the one discovered by Darth Malak and Darth Revan years ago.;NM39AAUTHA03121_.mp3
You are to follow in their footsteps and reach the ancient Star Map that lies deep within. There you will find a lightsaber, amongst other things.;NM39AAUTHA03122_.mp3
The lightsaber is for you: your initiation present. Return to us once you have it, for you the test does not end there.;NM39AAUTHA03123_.mp3
Be very cautious, here. This tomb is like the others in this valley, and many of its old defenses remain active.;NM39AAUTHA03124_.mp3
Do you understand what I have told you? Are you ready to begin?;NM39AAUTHA03125_.mp3
I don't understand... why not just give me the saber?;
If you do not strive to achieve something, then it will be meaningless to you, wouldn't you say?;NM39AAUTHA03127_.mp3
Can you tell me anything about what I will face?;
No. That is part of the test. Overcome the obstacles that lie ahead on your own.;NM39AAUTHA03129_.mp3
Can I leave the tomb?;
You cannot. No one enters and no one leaves until your test is complete.;NM39AAUTHA03131_.mp3
Find the Star Map. Return with the lightsaber. I understand.;
Good. Yuthura and I will await your return.;NM39AAUTHA03133_.mp3
Is that a tone of mischief in your voice, dear Yuthura? You should know by now that no scheme is certain.;NM39AAUTHA03134_.mp3
As should you, my master. But I was only agreeing with you. Should we not get on with the test?;NM39AAUTHA03135_.mp3
I... I don't know what you're talking about, master. I am not... scheming. Should we not get on with the test?;NM39AAUTHA03136_.mp3
[This man fearfully avoids your eyes. He couldn't say anything to you even if he wanted.];
You again? Oh no, you can just keep walking. I'm not dealing with you again.;NM17AA05ME02000_.mp3
Something you want? I don't have a lot of time for talk, so please make it quick.;NM17AA05ME02001_.mp3
I just want to ask some questions.;
Of course, I always have time for a pretty face... any face, really. What do you need?;NM17AA05ME02003_.mp3
Describe your job and who you work for.;
I repair the sandcrawlers when they return from the mines. They get pretty banged up, even without the attacks.;NM17AA05ME02005_.mp3
What attacks do you mean?;
The Sand People attack them pretty regularly. Czerka Corporation is getting pretty sick of it, I hear.;NM17AA05ME02007_.mp3
They have offered bounties on Sand People for a while now, but few hunters take them up on it. Too dangerous.;NM17AA05ME02009_.mp3
Where can I learn about these bounties?;
Try at the Czerka offices right here. They'd know.;NM17AA05ME02011_.mp3
When do the sandcrawlers head out?;
Oh, the big crawlers head out at dawn. That's so they avoid the bigger predators. The wraid, I mean.;NM17AA05ME02014_.mp3
Doesn't help avoid the Sand People though. They attack pretty regular, no matter what Czerka Corporation tries.;NM17AA05ME02016_.mp3
Do you know where the attacks come from?;
I have no idea. I don't go out on the desert if I can help it. I'm sure the Sand People will find you if you walk far enough.;NM17AA05ME02022_.mp3
What can you tell me about Tatooine and Anchorhead?;
Well, it's a hole in the galaxy, as far as I'm concerned. I doubt this outpost will last much longer.;NM17AA05ME02028_.mp3
But, that's happened before and will happen again. Anchorhead has been resettled a few times now.;NM17AA05ME02030_.mp3
Why have previous settlements failed?;
Well, Tatooine fools people. It looks like it might have a good supply of resources, but it doesn't.;NM17AA05ME02032_.mp3
Before a company learns this, they've already set up communities to support operations they now can't afford.;NM17AA05ME02034_.mp3
Company pulls out, cities dry up, and after a few years, someone that doesn't know why it failed tries again.;NM17AA05ME02036_.mp3
Czerka Corporation isn't doing well here?;
No one is. I guess it looked like a promising mining planet, but the metal... I tell you, it just isn't right.;NM17AA05ME02038_.mp3
I've been a mechanic my whole life, and I've never seen anything corrode as fast as Tatooine metal.;NM17AA05ME02040_.mp3
It's why whoever was here before left, and why Czerka will leave, and why whoever comes next will leave.;NM17AA05ME02042_.mp3
That's all I need. Goodbye.;
All right then. Back to work, I guess.;NM17AA05ME02065_.mp3
I've signed on to try and stop the Sand People attacks.;
Have you? Not many hunters have tried in the past. Good luck to you, is all I can say. The Sand People are vicious.;NM17AA05ME02018_.mp3
I see the damage on the crawlers when they come back... if they come back.;NM17AA05ME02020_.mp3
The attacks will stop. I've dealt with the Sand People.;
I guess they have been happening a lot less frequently lately. If you did have anything to do with that, thanks.;NM17AA05ME02024_.mp3
I hope Czerka paid you well for it. Whatever it was, it wouldn't have been enough for me.;NM17AA05ME02026_.mp3
Nothing. Goodbye.;
Hey... aren't you a swoop-jock? I can't help with bike problems. I work with the heavy stuff.;NM17AA05ME02043_.mp3
Hmm? All right, but I'm not sure what I could say to interest you. I just work on the crawlers.;NM17AA05ME02044_.mp3
I'll take however long I want. Understand?;
Uh, is there some kind of a problem? I'm just doing my job, I don't want any trouble from you.;NM17AA05ME02046_.mp3
I think you're my problem. Maybe I should do something about it.;
Hey... why are you threatening me? I just repair the crawlers. It's not like I'm packing away the credits.;NM17AA05ME02048_.mp3
Is there a point to this? This man is no danger to us.;
I don't need this. What are you trying to prove?;NM17AA05ME02052_.mp3
[Force Persuade] Never speak to me again, worm. Never.;
[Success] [His face turns an ashen white. He is suddenly very, very afraid of you, and could not speak even if he wanted to.];
[Persuade] I'll leave you alone... for a few credits.;
[Success] What, is this a mugging or are you begging? Look, here's a few creds, now leave me alone.;NM17AA05ME02054_.mp3
I know I'm just an old codger, but in my time I've learned what goes around comes around. These things have a way of coming back to you in the end.;NGLOBEJOLE09759_.mp3
Don't need some crazy surge-slime threatening me. Got Sand People for that. Hmph!;NM17AA05ME02058_.mp3
You are a representative of the Jedi Order. When you behave this way you disgrace us all!;NM17AA05ME02071_.mp3
[Failure] Look, you can just get lost, all right? I have to get the crawlers ready for the morning.;NM17AA05ME02056_.mp3
[Force Persuade] I'm not a threat. You like me and want to give me credits.;
*whisper* The Force is not a thing to be trifled with. Continue to use it frivolously and you may find yourself straying down the dark path.;NGLOBEBAST06898_.mp3
[Success] I suppose I do like you. Here's a few creds. Was there something else?;NM17AA05ME02060_.mp3
I'm no Jedi, but are you really supposed to be using the Force for things like this?;NGLOBECART04932_.mp3
Maybe I don't like your face. Maybe I should remove it!;
What do you want? Credits? Here, take some! Just leave me alone. I've got work to do.;NM17AA05ME02062_.mp3
Hello again? Is there something else you wanted? I really have to get back to work.;NM17AA05ME02066_.mp3
Sorry, but your kind aren't welcome in here. The Hidden Beks don't care much for you Sith.;NM03AAHIDB15000_.mp3
You better change your tone if you know what's good for you!;
The swoop gangs rule down here, not you! You may have conquered Upper Taris, but you don't have enough troops to sweep the whole Lower City.;NM03AAHIDB15002_.mp3
You come down here in force and we'll pick you off in hit and run battles, then vanish like smoke into the back alleys and hidden tunnels where you'll never find us!;NM03AAHIDB15004_.mp3
"Stick to the Upper City where people are actually scared of you; your threats don't count for much down here.";NM03AAHIDB15006_.mp3
Let me in or I come back with a hundred Sith troopers!;
I'll be going now.;
Yeah, you do that. Go back to the Upper City where your shiny uniforms will make the citizens quake in their boots.;NM03AAHIDB15010_.mp3
Hey, you can't just walk in here! This is the Hidden Bek base. How do I know you're not a Vulkar spy sent to kill Gadon Thek?;NM03AAHIDB15012_.mp3
I'm no spy!;
Maybe so, but this door is locked and it's going to stay that way until I'm satisfied you're no threat to Gadon or the Hidden Beks.;NM03AAHIDB15014_.mp3
I have to speak to Gadon. It's important.;
A lot of people want to go inside and speak to Gadon. He's a hero of the common folk. But the days of the Hidden Bek's open door policy are gone.;NM03AAHIDB15017_.mp3
Between the Sith conquest and the Vulkar gang war Gadon has more enemies than he used to. We're being careful about who we let in now.;NM03AAHIDB15019_.mp3
[Persuade] Maybe a bribe could get me in?;
[Failure] My loyalty's not for sale! I've been with the Hidden Beks for years, and I'm not going to desert Gadon now just because everyone is turning against him!;NM03AAHIDB15021_.mp3
Maybe I could be an ally against all those enemies.;
Well, we do need all the help we can get. And you don't look like you're with the Vulkars or the Sith.;NM03AAHIDB15023_.mp3
Besides, it's not like you can do anything to harm Gadon in the heart of his own base. Not with Zaerdra watching his back.;NM03AAHIDB15025_.mp3
So you're going to let me in?;
Go in and speak to Gadon if you want. Just remember to be on your best behavior... the Hidden Beks are watching you.;NM03AAHIDB15027_.mp3
Sorry. I'll be going now.;
Fair enough. But here's some free advice: get off the streets. The Black Vulkars are taking shots at anyone wandering the streets of the Lower City.;NM03AAHIDB15031_.mp3
I need Gadon's help. I was told to speak to him.;
I go wherever I want!;
Hey - I recognize you! You're the one who won the swoop race!;NM03AAHIDB15032_.mp3
You were racing for those damn Vulkars! You'll pay for that!;NM03AAHIDB15034_.mp3
You better be careful out here. Those damn Vulkars will be looking to get even with you for winning that race and killing Brejik.;NM03AAHIDB15036_.mp3
Canderous! I haven't seen you since the Republic broke our ranks at the battle of Malachor!;NM26AAMANM07000_.mp3
Ergeron, I see you've got some new guns to add to your collection. Times must have been profitable for you since the war.;NM26AAMANM07002_.mp3
Very profitable. When the Republic defeated our fleets, I learned a valuable lesson: it's far better to be a freelance mercenary in a war than to be a soldier for the losing side.;NM26AAMANM07004_.mp3
If you're here to offer me a job, I'm not interested right now. I've got so many offers I can't keep up as it is.;NM26AAMANM07012_.mp3
Maybe that Iridorian skullslacker at the bar, or the Echani nerfherder cowering in the corner is available.;NM26AAMANM07014_.mp3
Can I ask you some questions?;
Normally I'd charge you for information, but times are good right now and I'm feeling generous. So ask your questions, free of charge.;NM26AAMANM07016_.mp3
Do you know about the murder of Elassa?;
Not really. They say some Republic war hero killed her. Maybe you should check out the Republic Embassy.;NM26AAMANM07018_.mp3
Do you know anything about ancient ruins or a Star Map?;
If there ever were any ruins on this world, they've long since disappeared beneath the oceans.;NM26AAMANM07020_.mp3
Don't you hate the Republic for defeating your people?;
I'm a realist. It was war, after all. And even though the Republic destroyed my people, the leaders of the armada were Revan and Malak, so I hate the Sith just as much.;NM26AAMANM07034_.mp3
And with this war, there's plenty of opportunity to take bloody vengeance against both sides and make a nice profit along the way. We Mandalorians are always practical. Not like those blood-thirsty Iridorians, or those honor-bound Echani.;NM26AAMANM07036_.mp3
Is there anything else you want?;NM26AAMANM07038_.mp3
What do you have against the Echani and the Iridorians?;
Nothing, except the Echani are a bunch of fey dancers, prancing into battle with tiny weapons not fit for Mandalorian children. They hardly wear any armor because it slows them down when they run away.;NM26AAMANM07026_.mp3
But the Echani are better than the Iridorians. Those savages keep hacking at fallen foe even after death, mutilating the corpse out of pure blood lust.;NM26AAMANM07028_.mp3
I even heard they'll turn on each other when the battle fever hits. Who wants to work with someone like that? I can pretty much name my price right now, especially since the Republic is so desperate for mercs all of a sudden.;NM26AAMANM07030_.mp3
Why is the Republic hiring so many mercenaries?;
They ain't saying, but the price sure is right. Of course, I haven't heard of anyone coming back, so I'm guessing the job ain't easy.;NM26AAMANM07032_.mp3
I'll be going now.;
So why are you telling me? If you're going, go. I don't need a status report.;NM26AAMANM07040_.mp3
Do you know anything about the young Selkath who have gone missing?;
Not really. I have no interest in the Selkath other than the fact that they are charging me an exorbitant amount to stay on this world.;NM26AAMANM07022_.mp3
The Iridorian over there, however... He, I believe, may know more. He has been seen with several of them before.;NM26AAMANM07024_.mp3
So the Sith smoked a Jedi outpost on Dantooine. No survivors, or so they say. First Taris, now Dantooine. Wouldn't surprise me if the Republic starts hiring mercs to make a counter attack.;NM26AAMANM07006_.mp3
They might even hire some Echani or Iridorian mercenaries, if they're desperate. I bet a Mandalorian could make some good money working for the Republic right now.;NM26AAMANM07008_.mp3
All of a sudden the Republic isn't hiring mercenaries anymore.;NM26AAMANM07009_.mp3
And now the kolto harvest is at an all time low. More than just coincidence, if you ask me.;NM26AAMANM07011_.mp3
You with the Selkath? You here to see me about the murder too?;NM26ACFIRI02000_.mp3
I told the damn fish everything I knew, what more do you all want from me?;NM26ACFIRI02002_.mp3
What do you know about Sunry and Elassa?;
Sunry I only heard of once or twice in passing. Some sort of old-time war hero against the Sith. Seen him around in the hotel too. Going to Elassa's room always of course.;NM26ACFIRI02004_.mp3
Kept the rest of the building up half the night with their damn antics usually!;NM26ACFIRI02006_.mp3
You mean Sunry was having a relationship with Elassa?;
I'm not saying anything like that. What they did in that room, in private, is their business.;NM26ACFIRI02008_.mp3
And there isn't any rule against Sith and Republics seeing each other for personal reasons. Although if you think her Sith Master didn't know, heh, you must be fooling yourself.;NM26ACFIRI02010_.mp3
Sith Master?;
Uh... well Elassa was a Sith... so of course she'd have to have someone above her... yeah. I didn't see anything!;NM26ACFIRI02012_.mp3
[Persuade] What did you see?;
[Success] Well... one time... I saw Elassa coming in wearing this big cloak. I was on my way to my room, and she normally wears stuff like that so I didn't pay her too much attention.;NM26ACFIRI02014_.mp3
But this time I accidentally brushed up against her - accidentally of course! - and her cloak fell open...;NM26ACFIRI02016_.mp3
Now I don't have no qualms about the Sith! I leave them alone and they leave me alone. And seeing as how Elassa had a Sith lightsaber under her cloak, I'm not going to poke that hornet's nest.;NM26ACFIRI02018_.mp3
She was a Dark Jedi?;
Seems so... But I'm not getting myself in any further with the Sith. I know how ruthless they are.;NM26ACFIRI02020_.mp3
Now that's all I'm going to tell you. I'll testify it to the court, but you aren't going to get anything else out of me.;NM26ACFIRI02025_.mp3
A lightsaber does not mean anything.;
I don't know what it means to you, but to me it kind of screams 'Dark Jedi'. And I'm not getting myself in any further with the Sith. I know how ruthless they are.;NM26ACFIRI02023_.mp3
I have a lightsaber too, you know.;
I know, I know, but you're a Jedi. Elassa never claimed to be.;NM26ACFIRI02028_.mp3
[Failure] I didn't see anything and there's no way you can make me say otherwise! Now quit asking!;NM26ACFIRI02030_.mp3
[Persuade] Maybe if I tossed in 100 credits?;
[Success] Since you put it that way...;NM26ACFIRI02032_.mp3
[Failure] 100 credits isn't enough for the kind of trouble I'd be having if I told you. Sorry, you're gonna have to look somewhere else.;NM26ACFIRI02034_.mp3
[Force Persuade] You know you want to tell me.;
[Success] You know, I think I could trust you. Heck, I don't know why I shouldn't tell you.;NM26ACFIRI02036_.mp3
Okay, okay, I'll ask something else.;
Thanks...;NM26ACFIRI02039_.mp3
What did you see the night of the murder?;
I was in my room, minding my own business with the lastest copy of Pazaak Weekly - checking out the listings for the big tournament that's gonna be held here soon - when I heard a blaster shot.;NM26ACFIRI02043_.mp3
Being still alive - and therefore smart enough not to stick my head out immediately - I didn't go out right away. I looked out after a minute and saw Gluupor in the hall by Elassa's room, and Sunry running like the wind.;NM26ACFIRI02045_.mp3
You can't tell me that someone who was running like that - and he was pretty fast for a cripple! - isn't guilty.;NM26ACFIRI02047_.mp3
I have nothing more to ask for now.;
Yes, well I'll be right here... Not like they're letting me go anywhere else...;NM26ACFIRI02050_.mp3
Elassa roomed here often?;
Yes. She rented a room every week or so. Coincidentally it was right about the same time that Sunry would show up. They didn't seem all that discreet either.;NM26ACFIRI02041_.mp3
Nothing for now.;
You again... didn't I tell you people everything I knew? So why do you keep coming back to me?;NM26ACFIRI02052_.mp3
Nothing more for now.;
You Sith don't scare me. Down here the swoop gang's are in charge and you don't have enough troops on Taris to do anything about it!;NM03AAHIDB14000_.mp3
Hey - I recognize you! You're the one who won the swoop race!;NM03AAHIDB14002_.mp3
You were racing for those damn Vulkars! You'll pay for that!;NM03AAHIDB14004_.mp3
You better be careful out here. Those damn Vulkars will be looking to get even with you for winning that race and killing Brejik.;NM03AAHIDB14006_.mp3
Brejik is nothing but a punk! I don't know why those Vulkars follow him - Gadon's ten times the man he is!;NM03AAHIDB14008_.mp3
The swoop race coming up will show those Vulkars who's in charge here! When we win half the people following Brejik will desert him!;NM03AAHIDB14010_.mp3
You need to get inside - the Black Vulkars are gunning down everyone they find on the streets! You should go to Javyar's cantina, you'll be safe there.;NM03AAHIDB14012_.mp3
You should get off the streets - those Black Vulkars will take a shot at anybody!;NM03AAHIDB14016_.mp3
Greetings, fellow student. Have you heard the news? Master Uthar reports that his apprentice, Yuthara, is dead. How unsettling.;
You return to the academy in an odd time. Master Yuthara has just taken over leadership. No doubt there will be many other changes to come.;
Have you seen Master Uthar and Yuthara? There are many in the academy who seem to be searching for them.;
Greetings, fellow student. Are you planning on going to the Valley of the Dark Lords? I am headed there soon, myself.;
Who are you?;
I am known as Tariga, a student here at the academy. It is my pleasure to be assigned to the Sith ruins, to study their past and unearth new relics.;
You're human, but you speak like a Twi'lek...;
I was raised on a planet in the Outer Rim. We were not part of the Republic, so we never adopted their language. I can understand Basic, but I am not fluent in speaking it yet.;
I am, however, quite fluent in the Twi'lek tongue, so I prefer to use it when dealing with others. It is nearly as well known as Basic, and no one will make fun of my accent.;
I think I made the right choice. I doubt I would have been assigned to the Sith ruins in the Valley of the Dark Lords if I was stuttering and stumbling over an unfamiliar language.;
How do I get to this valley?;
The exit at the end of this hall will bring you to the surface. There you merely follow a natural path through the rock and you will come to the valley, itself.;
You will find many Sith working on the dig at the southern end of the valley. If you head into the northern end where the strange pillars are, do beware of the tuk'ata beasts.;
What are these tuk'ata?;
Local beasts that hunt in packs and are not at all afraid of attacking students... or even armed patrols. They have proven to be a hindrance to our progress.;
Arrogant hunters always assume the animal knows how important they are.;
Several attempts have been made to destroy their nests in the tombs, but their numbers have proven to be too great.;
What can you tell me about the valley?;
There are four tombs that have been uncovered so far, each holding the remains of a Sith Lord from a time long ago when the Sith were first on Korriban.;
We have found evidence that there were larger structures underground, a veritable ancient fortress... but it appears to have been destroyed. The tombs are all that remain intanct.;
Currently we are allowed access only to three tombs... the one furthest to the left may only be entered by Master Uthar and those he brings with him.;
Fortunately there is still much else for us to find. I am pleased that you have joined us.;
Anything I should be watchful for?;
Yes, indeed. Shortly before entering the valley, you will pass by a cave entrance. Do not enter it... it is full of dangerous creatures we call shyrack.;
The only other danger to speak of is the tuk'ata. There are guards that will protect you if you remain in the south part of the valley, however.;
What are these shyrack?;
Flying creatures that lay webs in their tunnels. The webs can only be burned or moved by explosives I believe. Best to avoid them entirely.;
I'll be going.;
I wish you well, fellow student.;
I wish you well in your explorations.;
Greetings, Padawan. You must be the one Master Bolook has enlisted to help him with this problem.;NM14ACIDRO06000_.mp3
I am an information retrieval droid. I can assist you by accessing the records of both the Jedi Enclave and the central government facilities here on Dantooine.;NM14ACIDRO06004_.mp3
If you have any need of my services, please do not hesitate to talk to me.;NM14ACIDRO06006_.mp3
I have already retrieved some information from the archives on Calder Nettic, Rickard Lusoff and Handon Guld. I have also had time to examine the body of Mr. Nettic.;NM14ACIDRO06008_.mp3
Is there any information you require?;NM14ACIDRO06010_.mp3
What did you find out about the body?;
My preliminary analysis of the body indicates that he was killed approximately 3 hours ago by a single energy blast to the torso.;NM14ACIDRO06025_.mp3
Is there any other information you need?;NM14ACIDRO06023_.mp3
Tell me about the blood sample.;
I have just received back an analysis of a sample of the blood found on the weapon. It had been sent back to the Enclave just before you arrived.;NM14ACIDRO06011_.mp3
The blood on the weapon is definitely not Calder's. Unfortunately there was a bacterial contaminant in the sample that had been taken back to the laboratory, and it had become degraded.;NM14ACIDRO06013_.mp3
We cannot get any more specific analysis from that sample other than the fact it did not belong to Calder.;NM14ACIDRO06015_.mp3
Is there a report of Handon's blaster being stolen?;
I am sorry, but I seem to be failing you. I have searched and searched, but I cannot seem to come up with anything at all.;NM14ACIDRO06043_.mp3
I thought to find the record of the missing weapon report Mr. Guld filed with the authorities, but there does not seem to be one.;NM14ACIDRO06045_.mp3
Tell me about the weapon found at the scene.;
What can you tell me about Calder and Handon?;
The Southwood speeder rental business has records that, over the past several weeks, a speeder had been rented by Mr. Nettic and Mr. Guld.;NM14ACIDRO06028_.mp3
What can you tell me about Calder and Rickard?;
According to the municipal authorities near the Garang spaceport, there had been news of violent drunken activity in a cantina attached to the port.;NM14ACIDRO06031_.mp3
Apparently a Mr. R. Lusoff was making accusations at a Mr. C. Nettic about cheating him in a business deal. Jedi Tooka was dispatched to the scene and restored order.;NM14ACIDRO06033_.mp3
Tell me about these plains.;
These plains are rife with wild animals, not all of them benign. The iriaz are mostly docile, but can easily be provoked to violence. Kath hounds, on the other hand, are much more deadly...;NM14ACIDRO06036_.mp3
There have been over 35 catalogued attacks on settlers by kath hounds in the last 2 weeks. A general advisory was given out three days ago to carry a weapon at all times when on the plains.;NM14ACIDRO06038_.mp3
Small farms and holdings dot the plains, and can provide safe refuge for those in need.;NM14ACIDRO06040_.mp3
I will have more questions later.;
Very well. I will be here to assist you.;NM14ACIDRO06053_.mp3
Greetings, apprentice. You must be the one Master Bolook has enlisted to help him with this problem.;NM14ACIDRO06002_.mp3
Congratulations, Stranger. I never thought anyone would beat Starkiller. Did you know it was because of him that I became a duelist in the first place?;NM02AEICE017000_.mp3
As a little girl I used to dream of meeting him one day. When I finally did, the guy was a complete slime ball. Made me realize I had to be cold and ruthless to survive, like him.;NM02AEICE017002_.mp3
And now he's dead. There's probably a lesson in there somewhere. Something for me to think about, at least. Congratulations again, Stranger... and goodbye.;NM02AEICE017004_.mp3
I heard you're going to fight Bendak Starkiller, Stranger. I'm not one to mince words, so let me just say this: you're dead. He'll kill you, end of story.;NM02AEICE017006_.mp3
You think I'm cold and hard, wait until you step into the ring with him. He's a natural born killer. You had great potential, Stranger. Too bad you're going to throw it all away.;NM02AEICE017008_.mp3
I've never been one to shy away from the cold, hard truth so I'll just come right out and say it: I can't compete with the likes of you, Stranger. I know when I'm overmatched.;NM02AEICE017010_.mp3
You're good - very good. But you're wrong if you think that means I'm suddenly going to warm up to you. Truth is, I really don't have anything more to say, so you might as well move on.;NM02AEICE017012_.mp3
What do you want? Wait, let me guess - now that you're a duelist you figure we have something in common? Something to chat about, right?;NM02AEICE017014_.mp3
Wrong! Just because we're both duelists doesn't mean we're suddenly friends. So give me some space, Stranger. I've got nothing more to say to you.;NM02AEICE017016_.mp3
Back again? Didn't you get the message last time - I'm not here to make friends. Talk to the Duel Organizer if you want a match, otherwise leave me alone.;NM02AEICE017018_.mp3
Wait, I know what you're going to say: I'm so beautiful, I'm so attractive, how can someone who looks so hot with a weapon in her hand be called Ice? Well, I've heard it all before.;NM02AEICE017020_.mp3
I'm here to take care of business in the dueling ring, not to have some slack-jawed, goggle-eyed man slobber all over me. So back off!;NM02AEICE017022_.mp3
Wow - that was cold!;
Now you know why they call me Ice. If you're looking for a match, go talk to the Ajuur. He's that big Hutt over there in the corner. Otherwise, just go away.;NM02AEICE017024_.mp3
Dueling ring? What are you talking about?;
You don't know about the dueling ring? This is unbelievable! Then why are you even here? Wait - never mind. I don't really care.;NM02AEICE017027_.mp3
You know what? I'm not one for friendly chit-chat, so I'm just going to deliver the cold, hard facts: I don't want to waste anymore time with you.;NM02AEICE017030_.mp3
I just want to ask you some questions.;
Wait, I know what you're going to say: it's great to see a woman in the duel ring, strike a blow for equality, I'm a credit to my gender, blah, blah, blah. Just save it, okay?;NM02AEICE017031_.mp3
I'm just here to take care of business in the dueling ring. For some reason every woman who comes in here thinks we should have some kind of female bond. Guess what? We don't!;NM02AEICE017033_.mp3
Oh, thank you! Thank you!;NM14AAELIS09000_.mp3
I don't know what I would have done if I had lost him!;NM14AAELIS09001_.mp3
It's...;
It's just soo great to have him back!;NM14AAELIS09003_.mp3
We're just going to go right home, right now, and celebrate, aren't we, my lovely little droid?;NM14AAELIS09004_.mp3
Don't worry, I'm going to hug you and oil you and care for you and make sure you never ever get away again.;NM14AAELIS09005_.mp3
Please kill me...;NM14AAELIS09007_.mp3
I don't think I've ever felt so bad for a droid before.;NM14AAELIS09008_.mp3
[sadly] Beep boop-oop.;
I agree. Completely.;
Ha! Better get used to it, droid!;NM14AAELIS09011_.mp3
I...;
No...;
Greetings, young Jedi, I wonder if you could assist me. I seem to have lost my... companion, you see.;NM14AAELIS04000_.mp3
Your companion?;
We were working on my farm to the north of here. I was working in the garden outside, and he was working inside.;NM14AAELIS04002_.mp3
I heard the door to the house open, but not close. I went to see and found it wide open!;NM14AAELIS04003_.mp3
I searched everywhere, and could not find him! I worry so much. I need him back so badly. I wonder if he... Could he have been kidnapped?;NM14AAELIS04004_.mp3
It is possible...;
Maybe it was the Mandalorians... or maybe kath hounds. But... no...;NM14AAELIS04006_.mp3
Kath hounds are not intelligent enough to open doors. Although they have been more vicious lately...;NM14AAELIS04008_.mp3
No, it must have been someone who could open the door by himself. Come to think of it, the door was locked!;NM14AAELIS04009_.mp3
Did someone break it down?;
No, the door was undamaged and showed no signs of tampering...;NM14AAELIS04011_.mp3
Could it have been opened from the inside?;
Well... Yes, it could have. But he had no reason to run away! His programming...;NM14AAELIS04014_.mp3
Your missing companion is a droid??;
Well... yes... he is a droid.;NM14AAELIS04029_.mp3
But he is very valuable to me all the same! He is the last piece of my poor, passed-away husband that I have left.;NM14AAELIS04030_.mp3
He is very dear to me, my precious is. I don't know what I'd do without him!;NM14AAELIS04031_.mp3
Beep! Beep-beep boople boop!;
Yes, Teethree, I understand that you're concerned about him, too...;
He's the only companionship I have on all of Dantooine!;NM14AAELIS04034_.mp3
You live alone with this... droid?;
He is a personal assistance droid. My husband was a genius at constructing droids. He made this one capable of taking care of me for the rest of my life.;NM14AAELIS04036_.mp3
As the last legacy of my husband, for my own personal ease of mind, I need him back! His absence gnaws at me like a gaping wound.;NM14AAELIS04037_.mp3
Wow. She really misses her droid, doesn't she?;NM14AAELIS04038_.mp3
There is no need for you to make fun of her. She is obviously desperate.;NM14AAELIS04039_.mp3
I'll say.;NM14AAELIS04040_.mp3
Carth! Enough!;NM14AAELIS04041_.mp3
Please, I beg of you, return my droid to me!;NM14AAELIS04042_.mp3
I will help you find your droid.;
Thank you! Thank you, master Jedi! If you find him, please send him home to me. I need him so much!;NM14AAELIS04045_.mp3
If I happen to see him, I will send him back to you.;
I am not interested.;
Please! Should you find him, send him home to me!;NM14AAELIS04047_.mp3
What exactly did you use him for again?;
A droid?!?;
You expect me to run off to find some stupid droid??;
He was supposed to be completely loyal! To serve me after my husband died!;NM14AAELIS04015_.mp3
Please, if you come across my droid, bring him to me. I need him so much...;NM14AAELIS04061_.mp3
Could someone have bypassed the lock?;
Could it have been kath hounds?;
Does anyone hold a grudge against him?;
Not that I know of... Er... *ahem* None of my neighbors really know he's there.;NM14AAELIS04019_.mp3
Who are you?;
Oh, I'm sorry, master Jedi, I did not give you a proper introduction. I am Elise Montagne. I own the farm to the north of here.;NM14AAELIS04021_.mp3
But I really am in need of your assistance. Time may be critical with so many kath hounds about. Oh, and those Mandalorians! Please, will you help me find him?;NM14AAELIS04022_.mp3
Alright, I will help you. Tell what happened.;
I am sorry, I have no time for this.;
Please, I beg of you, I must find him. How can you leave him out there with so many dangerous beasts and predators? Have you no humanity?;NM14AAELIS04024_.mp3
No means no.;
Please, if you do see him, return him to me. He is so far from home... He is a C8 model droid about a meter and a half tall...;NM14AAELIS04027_.mp3
My droid is still missing. I can feel him like a hole in my aching heart.;NM14AAELIS04052_.mp3
[Lie] I found your droid... but he had been destroyed by kath hounds.;
[Success] My droid... destroyed? No, no! This cannot be happening! I can't bear to live without him!;NM14AAELIS04054_.mp3
I am afraid your droid had to be destroyed.;
My droid... destroyed? No, no! This cannot be happening! I cannot bear to live without him!;NM14AAELIS04054_.mp3
Your droid escaped and is nowhere to be found. He's still out there somewhere.;
He is out there still? I must find him!;NM14AAELIS04057_.mp3
Hey, why'd you have to do that? That was just mean!;NGLOBEMISS13302_.mp3
Your actions disturb me. Among my kind, those who take pleasure in the suffering of others are considered dangerously unstable.;
The dark side dwells in us all, but you cannot give in to your baser instincts like this!;NGLOBEJUHA11852_.mp3
Nice. Real nice. Maybe later we could find some insects to pull the legs off, huh?;NGLOBEJOLE09762_.mp3
It troubles me to see you behaving this way. Such acts can lead to the dark side.;NGLOBEBAST06897_.mp3
Why did you do that? Sometimes... sometimes I just can't understand how you can be so cruel.;NGLOBECART04933_.mp3
Could you tell me what happened to him?;
Do not worry, I will find him.;
I am sorry, I must be going.;
Want to take an unofficial run around the track? You've beat everyone, I know, but it's good to keep your skills sharp. 20 credits.;
I'll pay for a recreational run.;
Very good. We'll have your bike put in position for the next time trial. Get ready, it won't take long.;
Why is there a fee?;
Well, Motta pays for timing on official runs, but rec-runs are staffed by volunteers. They deserve a little something.;
Besides, paying for runs keeps usage down. That way we don't crowd the pros off the track.;
I'd like to try an officially timed race.;
You'll have to go through Motta for that. He keeps track of all official standings at this track.;
There's money in it too. He pays riders for good times to encourage competition.;
No thanks. Goodbye.;
All right. Anyone else want to step up?;
Can I hear what the track records are?;
We keep tabs on all active racers. Currently we have information on you, Garm Totryl, Yuka Rill, and Zoriis Bafka. Nico has withdrawn for the time being.;
What do you have on me?;
Nothing yet. You'll have to put in some track time before we can record your results.;
What do you have on Zoriis?;
She is the current track leader with a time of <CUSTOM29>.;
What do you have on Yuka Rill?;
His best time was <CUSTOM28>, which you have beaten.;
What do you have on Garm?;
You have made short work of his best time of <CUSTOM27>.;
Let's go back to my other questions.;
Just don't keep me too long. Other racers might want to have a run down the track. Do you want a race?;
His current best time is <CUSTOM27>.;
Yuka Rill's best time is currently <CUSTOM28>.;
Her best time is <CUSTOM29>, which you have beaten.;
Your best time is <CUSTOM25>. Your first time was <CUSTOM24> and the last time we have for you is <CUSTOM26>.;
You are the current track leader. Your best time was <CUSTOM25>. Your first time was <CUSTOM24> and the last time we have for you is <CUSTOM26>.;
Well, another swoop-jock come to give the track a try? It's just a 20 credit timing fee for recreational runs.;
Sorry, the track is only for racers that Motta has accepted and signed up. He pays for track upkeep, so it's his choice.;
Go talk to him and we'll see about setting you up.;
Well raced. You would do well in our local tournament. Did you want to have another go? The fee is 20 credits, as you know.;
A good result. I can see how you beat everyone in the official races. Did you want to have another go? The fee is 20 credits, as you know.;
I heard you challenged Bendak Starkiller. I'll probably watch the fight... but forgive me if I don't go to your funeral.;NM02AEDEAD06000_.mp3
This is great! You beat Bendak - you're a legend! Whenever anyone asks I can say I was the first duelist the Mysterious Stranger ever beat in the ring! I'm going to be famous!;NM02AEDEAD06002_.mp3
Wow - you're the new champ. Congratulations, I guess. You know, when you started out I actually thought I'd be able to crawl up from my last place ranking for a while.;NM02AEDEAD06004_.mp3
Shows what I know. Enjoy your time at the top, Stranger. Sooner or later someone will come along to knock you down here with the rest of us grinders!;NM02AEDEAD06006_.mp3
You beat Ice! I've been trying to beat her for years, and you do it just like that! Heh. I can't believe how lucky you are!;NM02AEDEAD06008_.mp3
That's right - I said lucky! Lucky to be born with the kind of talent I've spent a life time trying to build. It isn't fair, I tell you!;NM02AEDEAD06010_.mp3
What do you want? Oh, let me guess - you beat me in the dueling ring and now you're here to rub it in my face! Yeah well, I'm used to it. So pardon me if I ignore your gloating.;NM02AEDEAD06012_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;
Questions? I don't have to answer your questions just because you beat me in the ring!;NM02AEDEAD06014_.mp3
Look, I admit it - you're better than me. Everyone is better than me! A blindfolded, one-legged tach with a rusty knife could probably beat me, okay?;NM02AEDEAD06016_.mp3
Is that what you wanted to hear? You satisfied yet? Are you happy now that you've taken the last shred of dignity I have?;NM02AEDEAD06018_.mp3
Yeah, I'm happy now.;
Slime-rat.;NM02AEDEAD06020_.mp3
Uh... I'll just be going now.;
Oh. Well... okay. Goodbye, then.;NM02AEDEAD06026_.mp3
Wow - you sure have a bad attitude.;
Gee, I wonder why? Couldn't have anything to do with being the WORST duelist on Taris, could it? Even a rookie like you got the better of me!;NM02AEDEAD06023_.mp3
Back for more, eh? I thought you would have learned your lesson by now: don't step into the dueling ring with Deadeye Duncan!;NM02AEDEAD06028_.mp3
I want a rematch!;
I may have lost 54 consecutive matches before I beat you, but I figure I've got your number! You want to step into the ring again, just tell the duel organizer to set it up!;NM02AEDEAD06030_.mp3
Goodbye.;
Yeah yeah, off you go. Run away like the coward you are!;NM02AEDEAD06034_.mp3
What are you looking at, fresh meat? You want a piece of me? You want to step into the dueling chambers with me?;NM02AEDEAD06036_.mp3
Who are you?;
I'm Deadeye Duncan, the number five ranked duelist in this cantina. You must have seen me in the dueling chambers, right?;NM02AEDEAD06038_.mp3
Dueling chambers?;
You know - the dueling chambers: two people in combat, loser gets carried out unconscious on a stretcher. It's the only reason people come into this part of the cantina.;NM02AEDEAD06042_.mp3
"Look, I'm the number five ranked duelist around here; I don't have time to explain all this. Go talk to the Duel Organizer if you're interested. He's that Hutt over there in the corner.";NM02AEDEAD06044_.mp3
You're the number five ranked duelist? Out of how many?;
Uh... five. But it's an elite group, okay? It's not like just anyone can step into the dueling chamber! Well, actually anyone can... but not many do!;NM02AEDEAD06040_.mp3
You don't look so tough. I think I could beat you in a duel.;
Big talk. Go speak with the Hutt in the corner to back it up - he's the Duel Organizer. I'll look forward to our match. Fresh meat is just what I need to end my losing streak!;NM02AEDEAD06046_.mp3
Yeah, what do you...? Oh, I apologize Master Jedi, I should not have been rude.;NM26ADREPA01000_.mp3
It is alright.;
No really, I should apologize. I should try to control myself... as you Jedi do.;NM26ADREPA01002_.mp3
Is there anything I can help you with?;NM26ADREPA01003_.mp3
Why do the Sith upset you so much?;
These damn Sith are everywhere on Manaan, pushing us Republic citizens around, trying to goad us into breaking the law somewhere.;NM26ADREPA01005_.mp3
Breaking the law?;
The Selkath want to maintain their neutrality in this war we're fighting with the Sith and they enforce it VERY strictly.;NM26ADREPA01007_.mp3
So we have to sit here and let the Sith insult us and we can't raise a hand against them otherwise the Republic will face severe kolto export restrictions. That could lose us the war altogether.;NM26ADREPA01013_.mp3
What is kolto?;
You're joking... right?;NM26ADREPA01027_.mp3
Sorry, but everyone knows what kolto is. The most powerful healing agent in the galaxy. I would've died several times myself if we didn't have this stuff handy.;NM26ADREPA01028_.mp3
But the reason it's important here is that kolto is only found naturally on Manaan, and all of our attempts to synthesize it have failed miserably.;NM26ADREPA01029_.mp3
So we sit here on the surface, the Selkath harvesting what kolto bubbles up from the bottom of the ocean, and we buy it from them.;NM26ADREPA01030_.mp3
Us and the Sith of course. The Selkath don't want to play favorites.;NM26ADREPA01031_.mp3
The Republic and Sith both stay here?;
The Selkath think that by staying neutral they can play both sides, selling kolto to everyone that needs it, and making themselves too valuable to be worth conquering.;NM26ADREPA01033_.mp3
Well, that, and they threatened to destroy the only natural source of kolto on the planet if anyone tries to attack them.;NM26ADREPA01034_.mp3
But I think they're underestimating the lengths the Sith will go to get what they want... They're probably planning something already.;NM26ADREPA01035_.mp3
Is there anything else you require?;NM26ADREPA01036_.mp3
Have you seen an ancient Star Map?;
A Star Map? Like an ancient artifact or something?;NM26ADREPA01040_.mp3
No, sorry, never heard of it.;NM26ADREPA01041_.mp3
Is there anything else I can do for you?;NM26ADREPA01042_.mp3
Why are there Sith on Manaan?;
Well, for the kolto, of course. Really that's the only reason anyone would want to be here. It's the only reason the Selkath built Ahto City in the first place: to export kolto.;NM26ADREPA01021_.mp3
Why haven't they joined the Republic?;
Tell me about Ahto City.;
Um... It's big. Real big. Actually it's pretty much the only real city on the entire world. The only place for us air-breathers anyway.;NM26ADREPA01023_.mp3
Manaan is a water world - which you may have noticed on your way down to land here - inhabited natively by a species of fish-people called the Selkath.;NM26ADREPA01024_.mp3
They built this city to cater to us off-worlders and as a base of operations to export kolto, which is the only real thing they have to trade here.;NM26ADREPA01025_.mp3
Never mind, I must go.;
Of course. If you have any other questions you should probably see Roland Wann, he's the Republic diplomat here. He's by the Republic enclave near the visitor residences.;NM26ADREPA01044_.mp3
If you don't know where that is, go north from here, then south past the port official and the first courtyard, east into the second courtyard, then north then east again. You got that?;NM26ADREPA01045_.mp3
Have a pleasant stay, Master Jedi.;NM26ADREPA01046_.mp3
Why don't you run them off Manaan?;
There's nothing we can do, though. The Selkath want to maintain their neutrality and they enforce it VERY strictly.;NM26ADREPA01012_.mp3
The Sith and the Republic coexisting peacefully? Well... relatively...;
Peacefully? Not hardly. Just look in their eyes. You can see they'd like nothing more than to kill each and every one of us, personal-like.;NM26ADREPA01010_.mp3
Yeah, I know the feeling...;
They mean well, but are misguided.;
You're... you're joking, right? The smug Hutt-spawn push us every chance they can get and enjoy it.;NM26ADREPA01015_.mp3
It is the work of the dark side.;
If you say so, Master Jedi. It's very aggravating. Sometimes I just want to take one of them and... *grrr*;NM26ADREPA01017_.mp3
I would like to ask a few questions.;
Of course, I'm always willing to help a Jedi. What do you require?;NM26ADREPA01019_.mp3
Who are the Selkath?;
If you have any other questions you should probably see Roland Wann, he's the Republic diplomat here. He's by the Republic enclave near the visitor residences. Have a pleasant stay, Master Jedi.;NM26ADREPA01047_.mp3
Another Sith patrol? I'm telling you, you're wasting your time here.;NM02AADIA004000_.mp3
Go ahead and search my apartment again, if you want. You'll find the same thing as last time... nothing.;NM02AADIA004002_.mp3
Who are you? What are you doing in here? You can't just come barging into someone's home!;NM02AADIA004004_.mp3
I spoke to Holdan, Dia. He'll remove the bounty on your head if you pay him off.;
I have nothing... I barely make enough credits to get by. I can't afford to pay that pig off!;NM02AADIA004057_.mp3
I guess I have no choice but to stay here and hope Holdan cools down. With that bounty on my head it's too dangerous to go outside.;NM02AADIA004063_.mp3
I spoke with Holdan. I convinced him to remove the bounty on your head.;
He... he called the bounty off? That's wonderful! I only wish I had something to give you as a reward.;NM02AADIA004006_.mp3
Wait a minute... I know! I don't have many credits, but there is something I can give you. It's a family heirloom. It's not much, but it's something.;NM02AADIA004008_.mp3
Keep your reward, Dia. Helping you was thanks enough.;
I can never truly repay you for helping me, but you'll always have my thanks for what you did.;NM02AADIA004053_.mp3
Thank you, Dia. This reward will be fine.;
I save your life and all I get is some family trinket?;
If I had more I'd gladly give it to you, but this is all I've got. I'm sorry.;NM02AADIA004012_.mp3
I'm here to collect the bounty on your head, Dia!;
Wait! Think about what you're doing. If that pig had just kept his hands to himself, I wouldn't have had to give him that scar with my vibroblade.;NM02AADIA004015_.mp3
He gets drunk and tries to force himself on me, and I get a bounty put on my head for defending myself? Where's the justice in that? Holdan's the one to blame, not me.;NM02AADIA004017_.mp3
Is there anything I can do to help?;
I doubt it. Holdan is one of Davik's men. When you work for the local crime lord the authorities tend to turn a blind eye. I'm afraid this is between me and Holdan now.;NM02AADIA004031_.mp3
Maybe I could speak to Holdan for you.;
You could try, I guess. He usually hangs out at the cantina in the Lower City. It probably won't do any good. Holdan's used to getting his own way.;NM02AADIA004033_.mp3
That's one of the fringe benefits of being a goon for Davik. Working for the local crime lord lets you get away with things. Still, I appreciate the offer.;NM02AADIA004035_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;
I can't help you there. Since this thing with Holdan I've been scared to leave my apartment. I don't know anything about what's going on in the outside world anymore.;NM02AADIA004049_.mp3
Holdan? Who's that?;
Just one of Davik's men who can't keep his hands to himself. But all he got for his trouble was a nasty scar from my vibroblade! Too bad I'm the one still paying the price.;NM02AADIA004023_.mp3
What do you mean?;
I... I don't want to talk about it. I'm in enough trouble already. Besides, I don't know if I can trust you.;NM02AADIA004025_.mp3
[Persuade] You can trust me. Maybe I can help.;
[Success] Well, I suppose you seem like an alright sort. When I cut Holdan it made him back off, but it also embarrassed him in front of his friends.;NM02AADIA004027_.mp3
Holdan's a spiteful little Hutt-slug. He went and put out a bounty on my head for what I did! That's why I'm hiding out here.;NM02AADIA004029_.mp3
I think I'll just collect that bounty on your head!;
I'll be going now.;
Goodbye. Thank you again for all your help. I don't know what I would have done without you.;NM02AADIA004038_.mp3
Goodbye, and good luck. I hope you can talk some sense into Holdan.;NM02AADIA004040_.mp3
Good. I don't much like strangers in my home.;NM02AADIA004042_.mp3
[Failure] No, I don't think so. I can't afford to trust anybody right now. Please, just leave me alone.;NM02AADIA004044_.mp3
Tell me what's going on or I'll end all your problems... permanently!;
Okay, I'll tell you... just try and stay calm. The last thing I need is trouble with you and Holdan.;NM02AADIA004046_.mp3
I don't care about justice. I just want the credits!;
What's wrong with you? She doesn't deserve this!;NM02AADIA004066_.mp3
She sliced that guy up. She's only getting what she deserves!;
Then you're going to learn the same lesson I taught Holdan: I'm not as helpless as I look!;NM02AADIA004060_.mp3
Fine, this is between you and Holdan. I don't want to get involved.;
Yeah, I guess Carth's right. Maybe we could help you out.;
I'm not getting involved in this. What you do now is your concern, not mine.;
I'm sorry. I was just investigating the area.;
That's no excuse. You can't just go around barging into people's apartments because you're curious! But at least you're more polite than that pig, Holdan.;NM02AADIA004021_.mp3
I'm just looking for something to steal. Stay out of my way and you won't get hurt.;
You're as bad as that pig Holdan! I'll stay out of your way, but you're wasting your time. I don't have anything worth stealing.;NM02AADIA004051_.mp3
You're back. Did you... did you manage to get Holdan to withdraw the price on my head?;NM02AADIA004055_.mp3
Actually, I've decided to collect that bounty myself!;
No, not yet.;
You again? Why do you keep bothering me?;NM02AADIA004065_.mp3
I welcome you back. Czerka Corporation would like to extend its thanks to you for representing its interests so thoroughly.;
Chuundar is very interested in furthering our exchange of labor for weapons. We've begun expanding our operations, as I'm sure you've seen.;
I think Zaalbar will have something to say about this.;
The time for objections is long since passed, if there ever was one. You brought about this change. You have no one to blame.;
I have no objections. Chuundar showed me the way things must be. There is nothing for me here. The old ways are dead.;
Er, the tone of your Wookiee's muttering seems agreable. He likely agrees that this was the gentlest outcome possible.;
What are your plans for Kashyyyk?;
Czerka Corporation will begin an extensive examination of the commercial potential of this world. The Wookiees will aid us in this.;
I'm certain there are ample resources for us to export. I doubt we will encounter much more resistance. We will be here for quite some time.;
I need supplies. What do you have available?;
Czerka Corporation maintains a well-stocked armory, although for general goods you will need to speak with the vendor in the docking area.;
Can I expect a reward for what I have done?;
I would think that the thanks of Czerka Corporation would be enough, especially after your previous actions. You have caused us significant difficulty.;
I have reports about you meddling with our operations in the Shadowlands. I think we will consider this agrement with Chuundar to be fair compensation. Yes, that is what we will do.;
Perhaps I could persuade you otherwise?;
Perhaps that is exactly why I have instructed the guards to watch your every action, and how I react to you. I have taken precautions reagrding your... capabilities.;
No, I don't believe we will be extending any financial compensation to you today. Thank you for your assistance.;
I'm looking for something called a Star Map.;
I have no information about that. You appear to have explored deeper than any of our current expeditions. I certainly can't expand on what you've seen.;
Goodbye.;
Very well. Thank you again for your assistance.;
Czerka will be operating here for quite some time. All things considered, this was the gentlest outcome possible.;
I don't approve of this.;
It's not my concern.;
It was the gentlest outcome possible. I am sure that everyone will come to see this in time.;
It was the only outcome possible.;
Thank you again for your assistance. Is there anything further you need?;

Hey - this street is for Sith only. You got to pay a 20 credit toll to walk down this street.;NM26ABSITH16000_.mp3
Fine, here's your 20 credits.;
Thanks for the credits, nerf-herder!;NM26ABSITH16002_.mp3
This is a public street!;
Hiding behind the Selkath laws - typical Republic cowardice!;NM26ABSITH16005_.mp3
You can have your credits when you take them from my cold, dead hand.;
You talk big - but remember what we did to Taris. Maybe you're next on our list.;NM26ABSITH16008_.mp3
Hey, you working for the Republic? You look like a Republic agent - I can see the cowardice in your eyes.;NM26ABSITH16010_.mp3
Your taunts are nothing to me. There is no emotion, there is peace.;
You think you can impress me by spouting a bunch of Jedi garbage? If it wasn't for the Selkath neutrality laws, I'd add your name to the list of Jedi I've killed.;NM26ABSITH16012_.mp3
You better change your attitude, or the Selkath might find your body floating in the ocean!;
Are you threatening me? It's illegal to try to start a fight in Ahto City! Constable - over here! This Republic scum is trying to break the peace!;NM26ABSITH16015_.mp3
Is this true human? Are you threatening this woman with violence?;
She started it! She's insulting me.;
Insults are one thing, human. Threats of physical violence are quite another. They are expressly forbidden by the laws of Ahto City.;
[Persuade] I'm sorry, constable. It won't happen again.;
[Success] Very well, I shall overlook this infraction. But you would be wise to watch your words in the future, human.;
The Selkath claim neutrality, but you're always giving preferential treatment to the Republic! I'm going to report this incident to the Sith Embassy!;NM26ABSITH16023_.mp3
[Failure] Apologies are not sufficient. The law must be upheld.;
[Force Persuade] This argument was the fault of the Sith. She should be arrested.;
[Success] Yes - you are correct, human. The Sith is the one at fault.;
Me? I didn't do anything! This is an outrage! A travesty of justice!;NM26ABSITH16030_.mp3
Come with me to the Ahto City prisons. We will alert your Embassy and you shall be released when they pay the fine.;
Though I've known the Sith to let their people languish in the prison for many months before securing their release.;
I'll get you for this, Jedi! The Sith won't stand for this!;NM26ABSITH16036_.mp3
[Failure] A strange interpretation of these events, human. One I do not share. Clearly you are the one at fault here.;
Human, you are fined 100 credits for disturbing the Manaan peace. If you do not pay, you will be taken to the Manaan prisons.;
I don't have that much.;
Then you shall be imprisoned until you can pay the fine.;
Here are your credits.;
Further disturbances will be dealt with in a similar manner.;
Your laws are nothing to me!;
Perhaps a 500 credit fine and a stint in the Ahto City jails will teach you to respect our laws.;
What are you going to do?;
The Sith and I are exchanging meaningless taunts.;
I am not deaf, human. I heard your words, and threatening physical violence is not permitted in Ahto City.;
... And? You want a piece of me, too?;
Out of my way - unless you want to feel the wrath of the Sith!;NM26ABSITH16053_.mp3
Your words are all sound and fury, signifying nothing.;
You dare mock me? If it wasn't for the Selkath laws I'd teach you proper respect!;NM26ABSITH16055_.mp3
I've seen the wrath of the Sith. I wasn't impressed.;
The wrath of the Sith is a terrible thing! Remember Taris! You'll see - you'll all see!;NM26ABSITH16058_.mp3
Maybe I should just split you open from head to toe! How's that for wrath?;
You're back. The Council said you might return to Dantooine... I'm glad you did. I wanted to thank you.;NM13AAKELA14000_.mp3
Do I know you?;
Maybe you don't remember me? I'm Kel... Kel Algwinn. We, uh, met in the academy on Korriban.;NM13AAKELA14002_.mp3
You told me I should leave the Sith and seek out the Jedi. Well, I did. Everyone's been very nice... much nicer than I thought they would be.;NM13AAKELA14004_.mp3
I almost didn't think the Jedi Council would give me a chance, but they said everyone was welcome to return to the light side.;NM13AAKELA14006_.mp3
I guess I never *really* believed in the dark side. This just feels so right. I can't remember the last time I felt at peace like this.;NM13AAKELA14007_.mp3
They said I have a long road ahead of me, but they made me a proper Padawan and I have a Master, now. I... I just can't thank you enough.;NM13AAKELA14008_.mp3
You were too weak to be a Sith anyway.;
I... guess, if that's how you want to look at it. The Sith don't support each other like the Jedi do... and I don't think that's a weakness at all.;NM13AAKELA14010_.mp3
Well, at any rate, I wish you well. May... may the Force be with you.;NM13AAKELA14015_.mp3
The decision was yours, Kel.;
I guess so. You pointed me in the right direction, though, and I have to be grateful for that. The Sith certainly didn't have my best interest at heart.;NM13AAKELA14012_.mp3
I'm glad I could help.;
I'm glad you were there. I don't think I ever would have made it through the academy alive. And now I might actually become a Jedi someday.;NM13AAKELA14014_.mp3
Thank me for what?;
You're certainly welcome.;
Thank you again. I hope your mission for the Council goes well.;NM13AAKELA14016_.mp3
Your destiny does not lie with the Sith... at least, not yet. The academy is mine, now... I trust you won't be remaining long, correct?;NM35AAYUTH24000_.mp3
Ah, there you are... my favorite prospect for the year.;NM35AAYUTH24001_.mp3
Your favorite prospect?;
Absolutely. By my estimation, you are far more likely to achieve the prestige necessary to join the Sith than any of the others.;NM35AAYUTH24003_.mp3
As a matter of fact, I am so certain of that that I'm willing to offer you an opportunity of the once-in-a-lifetime variety. Would you like to hear it?;NM35AAYUTH24004_.mp3
Absolutely.;
Good. I do so adore someone who's willing to take a chance.;NM35AAYUTH24006_.mp3
As I said, you're no doubt going to be the one whom Uthar chooses to become a Sith. With my help, of course.;NM35AAYUTH24007_.mp3
Once that occurs, he will take you into the Valley of the Dark Lords to the tomb of Naga Sadow to administer the final test.;NM35AAYUTH24008_.mp3
There you and I will be alone with him. The perfect time to, shall we say, arrange for a change in the academy's leadership?;NM35AAYUTH24009_.mp3
What's so important about this tomb?;
The tomb is an ancient ruin on the surface that was visited years ago by Darth Revan and Darth Malak. They discovered a Star Map there of great importance.;NM35AAYUTH24011_.mp3
That --;NM35AAYUTH24012_.mp3
Quiet!;
Reaching that map, as they did, is part of the final test. At any rate, it is not the tomb that is important. That Uthar will be alone is what is important.;NM35AAYUTH24016_.mp3
You want me to kill Master Uthar?;
Is that such a daunting prospect? It is not as if I am asking you to perform the task alone, or as if you will get nothing out of it.;NM35AAYUTH24018_.mp3
Master Uthar cannot prevail against us both. That's all there is to it. It is a very simple matter.;NM35AAYUTH24019_.mp3
Pupil against master. Sounds familiar.;
And so it should. It is central to our beliefs. It is my responsibility to replace my master when I am strong enough.;NM35AAYUTH24021_.mp3
What's to stop me from telling him about this?;
I suppose you could do that. Even the hint of betrayal from his pupil and Uthar would move to eliminate me.;NM35AAYUTH24028_.mp3
But this is a very good opportunity for you... you can start off your Sith career as the right hand of the head of the academy: me. Uthar will not offer you that.;NM35AAYUTH24029_.mp3
Do you believe Uthar would not be aware of this? He would quickly figure out what you have to gain by betraying him... and would never believe someone would pass that up.;NM35AAYUTH24030_.mp3
Tell Master Uthar what you wish. Were I you, I would think first of what the consequences of such an action might be.;NM35AAYUTH24031_.mp3
And what's your part in this?;
My 'part' in this is to help you gain enough prestige... and slow down the progress of the other hopefuls. I want you in that tomb when the time is right.;NM35AAYUTH24033_.mp3
We destroy Master Uthar together and I take his place... and you take your place at my side. A beautiful plan in its sheer simplicity.;NM35AAYUTH24034_.mp3
How do I know this isn't some test?;
*chuckle* You must not know much about the Sith, yet. If Uthar were to even suspect that I might be trying to supplant him, true or not...;NM35AAYUTH24036_.mp3
Well, let's just say that he wouldn't likely stop to ask too many questions before ensuring I was dealt with.;NM35AAYUTH24037_.mp3
Very well. I agree.;
I'm so glad you see it my way.;NM35AAYUTH24023_.mp3
I will begin to make preparations for your final test. Your only worry now is to get there... don't disappoint me.;NM35AAYUTH24024_.mp3
How do I get more prestige?;
You must impress Master Uthar... go to him with news of your deeds or artifacts you have discovered.;NM35AAYUTH24088_.mp3
The first and easiest way would be for you to learn the Code of the Sith and speak it to him. I can teach you that, if you like.;NM35AAYUTH24089_.mp3
Shall I go on?;NM35AAYUTH24090_.mp3
Can you tell me about the Code of the Sith?;
I can help you to understand it. Would you like to hear it?;NM35AAYUTH24109_.mp3
"""Peace is a lie, there is only passion. Through passion, I gain strength. Through strength, I gain power.";NM35AAYUTH24110_.mp3
"Through power, I gain victory. Through victory, my chains are broken. The Force shall free me.""";NM35AAYUTH24111_.mp3
Simple words, yet easily misunderstood. Would you care for me to explain anything?;NM35AAYUTH24112_.mp3
'Peace is a lie, there is only passion'?;
The Jedi would have you believe that peace is a desirable goal. That peace of the spirit is the way the Force is mastered, that a lack of conflict betters man.;NM35AAYUTH24114_.mp3
We know different. It is our passion... our hate and our desire... that fuels the Force. It is conflict that improves the lot of civilization and single being both.;NM35AAYUTH24115_.mp3
Conflict forces one to better oneself. It forces change, growth, adaption... evolution... or death. These are not our laws, but the universe's. Without conflict you have only stagnation.;NM35AAYUTH24116_.mp3
'Through passion, I gain strength'?;
What fuels your power with the Force but your passion? The stronger, darker emotions. Anger, hatred, fear... these passions empower us.;NM35AAYUTH24118_.mp3
What about love?;
Love is more dangerous than all those things. Love leads to anger and hatred more often that not... but it also leads to mercy, which is far worse. That, however, is a lesson for another time.;NM35AAYUTH24120_.mp3
Those seem like awfully negative passions.;
Negative? Compared to what? What keeps even the most rudimentary creature alive? Fear to run, anger to fight... without it a creature would most surely die.;NM35AAYUTH24122_.mp3
Are you saying we aren't anything more than a rudimentary creature?;
We are far more than them, perhaps, but in some ways we are little different. To think us creatures beyond the need of simple passions is a delusion.;NM35AAYUTH24124_.mp3
The Jedi say the opposite. How can both be right?;
The Force gives us all power, even the Jedi. It is our mastery of our passion that gives us the strength they lack.;NM35AAYUTH24126_.mp3
I see.;
It is our goal to be stronger, to achieve our potential and not rest upon our laurels. We are the seekers, not the shepherds.;NM35AAYUTH24128_.mp3
'Through strength, I gain power'?;
The stronger you become in the Force, the more power you will achieve. But always must you fight for your power.;NM35AAYUTH24130_.mp3
Without strife, your victory has no meaning. Without strife, you do not advance. Without strife, there is only stagnation.;NM35AAYUTH24131_.mp3
'Through power, I gain victory'?;
How many sorts of victories can you imagine? Peaceful victory? Victory by sacrifice? A truce, an achievement?;NM35AAYUTH24133_.mp3
Unless the victory is achieved by demonstrating that your power is superior, it is only an illusion. Temporary at best. We seek more.;NM35AAYUTH24134_.mp3
'Through victory, my chains are broken'?;
This... has been argued over, and often. The chains represent our restrictions, both those placed upon us and those we place upon ourselves.;NM35AAYUTH24136_.mp3
Ultimately the goal of any Sith is to free herself from such restrictions. In a way, it is so we may do whatever we wish... but it is much more than that.;NM35AAYUTH24137_.mp3
One who has freed themselves from all restrictions has reached perfection. Their potential fulfilled. Perfect strength, perfect power, perfect destiny. Imagine it.;NM35AAYUTH24138_.mp3
That is our ideal, at any rate. It is said in Sith legend that the 'Sith'ari'... the perfect being... will one day lead us. But perhaps that is just a legend.;NM35AAYUTH24139_.mp3
You don't think the Sith'ari can exist?;
I... wonder what a being would be like. The legends say the Sith'ari will destroy us... and make us stronger than ever.;NM35AAYUTH24141_.mp3
But perhaps that is just a legend. Perfection is... a goal, I think, rather than a state of being. The Jedi would argue that, no doubt.;NM35AAYUTH24142_.mp3
'The Force shall free me'?;
The Force is our servant and our master. Our teacher and our companion. A weapon and a tool.;NM35AAYUTH24144_.mp3
Know it and you know the universe. Master it and you master the universe. Strive for perfection and the Force shall reward you.;NM35AAYUTH24145_.mp3
I think I got it.;
I am not surprised. The Force is strong with you... master it and it shall serve you well.;NM35AAYUTH24147_.mp3
I have some news about Uthar...;
What? What's happened? Our plan is still intact, I hope.;NM35AAYUTH24064_.mp3
He plans to have me fight you in the final test.;
Ahhh. How very clever of him. Normally you would face some other student in the tomb, preferably one of the failed ones.;NM35AAYUTH24066_.mp3
Obviously Uthar has decided to get rid of me. But why...? Did you say something to him?;NM35AAYUTH24067_.mp3
Yes, I did.;
What?! You fool! While I respect your attempt to play both sides of the fence, you are playing a dangerous game.;NM35AAYUTH24069_.mp3
If you think Uthar will truly be so grateful to you for double-crossing me, think again. Your only chance lies with me.;NM35AAYUTH24070_.mp3
In the end, it works out better that it is only the two of us in the tomb with him. So long as we refuse to fight. Is there anything else I should know?;NM35AAYUTH24073_.mp3
He wants you poisoned. I'm supposed to give this pad to Andrenas.;
Let me see that. Hmm... so it's true. Thank you for bringing this to me... now I will be far stronger than Uthar expects.;NM35AAYUTH24075_.mp3
Here... this passcard will allow you access to Uthar's quarters. It's at the far end of the passages with the other quarters.;NM35AAYUTH24081_.mp3
Take this device as well and put it inside his cot. No-one should see you do it. Then Uthar will be too weak to stand up against us.;NM35AAYUTH24082_.mp3
Don't even think of failing me. You and I are too far into this now to back out.;NM35AAYUTH24083_.mp3
[Lie] He wants you poisoned. I don't know how, though.;
Hah! He's a fool. I can make preparations to resist any poisons. Thank you for telling me... now I will be far stronger than Uthar expects.;NM35AAYUTH24077_.mp3
[Lie] No. I don't know anything else.;
Good. I'm not about to rest on my laurels, however.;NM35AAYUTH24080_.mp3
[Lie] No, that's it.;
[Persuade/Lie] No, of course not.;
[Success] Then how could he suspect? Unless one of the others... never mind. It is not important, now.;NM35AAYUTH24072_.mp3
[Failure] Hmph. I truly doubt that. You are attempting to play both sides of the fence, I think. I respect that. You are playing a dangerous game, however.;NM35AAYUTH24084_.mp3
It's nothing. Our plan is fine.;
Good. Let's keep it that way.;NM35AAYUTH24086_.mp3
I want to ask more about the Code.;
I want to know more about these ruins on the surface.;
I have been involved in the work there over the last couple of years, but not often. Most of the excavating is left to the students. What did you wish to know?;NM35AAYUTH24150_.mp3
Is there any way into the tomb of Naga Sadow?;
Not unless you are accompanied by Master Uthar, no. It is strictly forbidden... and I truly doubt you could bypass the doors to the tomb with anything less than ship blasters. Even then, perhaps.;NM35AAYUTH24152_.mp3
There's no other way inside?;
None. I do not even know how Master Uthar gains entrance, to tell the truth, though I look forward to discovering that fact.;NM35AAYUTH24154_.mp3
I have searched many times, so do not bother... there is no other way. Do not fret, however. Simply get the prestige you need and you will see the tomb soon enough.;NM35AAYUTH24155_.mp3
Why are the Sith so interested in these ruins?;
We could learn much about the history of the ancient Sith... why they were on Korriban and why they left.;NM35AAYUTH24333_.mp3
Perhaps we could learn more about the origin of the Force, itself. With that knowledge could come great power.;NM35AAYUTH24157_.mp3
I've heard enough.;
As you wish.;NM35AAYUTH24159_.mp3
Do you know anything about Darth Revan?;
Revan? You mean Darth Malak's former master?;NM35AAYUTH24161_.mp3
That's the one.;
Very little. I never met him personally, though I hear he was a powerful man. Very charismatic.;NM35AAYUTH24163_.mp3
In the end, Revan was outshone by his pupil. Such is the way of the Sith. Why? Is this dead man of importance to you?;NM35AAYUTH24164_.mp3
Do you think it's possible Revan might be alive?;
Anything is possible. Uthar's former master still lives... though he is in no condition to challenge his former pupil for leadership.;NM35AAYUTH24168_.mp3
Perhaps the same is true for Revan. Perhaps Revan is out there, somewhere, waiting to take revenge upon Malak.;NM35AAYUTH24169_.mp3
More likely what we were told is the truth: Revan is dead. Malak would be foolish to leave his old master alive, considering all the knowledge Revan held.;NM35AAYUTH24170_.mp3
So you wouldn't recognize Revan if the two of you met?;
Is there any reason I should? Beside the fact that I did not know Revan in life, Revan was known for wearing a full helmet and cape.;NM35AAYUTH24172_.mp3
Perhaps Revan's body had been disfigured by the power of the Force... it is not unheard of. Regardless, I doubt I shall be meeting Revan anytime soon.;NM35AAYUTH24173_.mp3
You mentioned that Revan came here before?;
Both Revan and Malak came to Korriban when they discovered the tomb of Naga Sadow. That was before my time.;NM35AAYUTH24175_.mp3
That's all I have to ask.;
Fair enough.;NM35AAYUTH24093_.mp3
Do you know a student named Kel?;
Yes... vaguely. The boy burdens himself with doubts and anxieties. It is sad to watch, really, for he does possess a certain flair with the Force.;NM35AAYUTH24178_.mp3
Kel will not survive long. Someone will betray him soon enough, and he will be dead. If you are smart and you know something, that person should be you.;NM35AAYUTH24179_.mp3
Tell me about yourself.;
About myself? I am originally from Sleheyron, if you must know. I was a slave to a cruel master, Omeesh the Hutt. I am sure you don't need to know more.;NM35AAYUTH24181_.mp3
I'll be going.;
I hope to see you again.;NM35AAYUTH24231_.mp3
Come back soon... my friend.;NM35AAYUTH24232_.mp3
You are very close to succeeding... work quickly!;NM35AAYUTH24233_.mp3
You have had an excellent start... go, gain more prestige!;NM35AAYUTH24234_.mp3
You have much to do.;NM35AAYUTH24235_.mp3
You mentioned you were from Sleheyron...;
I did. I also said that you didn't need to know more. Why are you asking?;NM35AAYUTH24183_.mp3
[Persuade] I just would like to know more about you, that's all.;
[Success] I... see. Very well. I suppose there's no harm in the tale.;NM35AAYUTH24185_.mp3
As I said, I was originally a slave to one of the Hutts. The Hutts control everything on Sleheyron, and a slave is nothing to them.;NM35AAYUTH24186_.mp3
I was determined not to be 'nothing'. One night when the drunken worm had me alone in his chambers I stabbed him and escaped the compound.;NM35AAYUTH24187_.mp3
I stole onto a cargo ship and was not discovered by the crew until they reached the next system. They left me for dead on a desolate planetoid, alone... but that was fine by me. I was glad to be anywhere other than Sleheyron.;NM35AAYUTH24188_.mp3
It was not luck that I was eventually rescued, of course. The Force was strong with me, though I didn't know that at the time. Not until the Jedi told me, that is.;NM35AAYUTH24189_.mp3
The Jedi found you? What happened?;
I'd... rather not discuss it. Perhaps another time.;NM35AAYUTH24191_.mp3
Is there something else you needed?;NM35AAYUTH24194_.mp3
[Failure] You know all that you need to. We can exchange niceties once Uthar is gone, if you desire.;NM35AAYUTH24192_.mp3
Alright, forget I asked.;
How did you become a Sith?;
I... would prefer not to discuss that.;NM35AAYUTH24196_.mp3
I'd really like to hear the tale.;
Why? There is no point. Have I asked you about your past?;NM35AAYUTH24198_.mp3
[Persuade] I just thought we could become friends, is all.;
[Success] You... have odd notions for someone hoping to become a Sith.;NM35AAYUTH24200_.mp3
Let's see... after escaping from Sleheyron I was found by the Jedi. They took me in and trained me even though I was a bit older than most Padawans.;NM35AAYUTH24201_.mp3
You were a Jedi?;
Not really, no. I never progressed beyond Padawan. I had discipline, but no peace... and after my treatment at the hands of the Hutts there was little room in me for the ways of the Jedi.;NM35AAYUTH24203_.mp3
You sound much like... someone I know.;NM35AAYUTH24204_.mp3
Yes, well... I imagine I am not unique. Things very easily could have been very different for me.;NM35AAYUTH24205_.mp3
I wanted to use the Force to free the other slaves I knew, to fight for what I knew was right. The Jedi restrained me until I couldn't stand it any more.;NM35AAYUTH24207_.mp3
They claim the dark side is evil, but that isn't so. Sometimes anger and hatred are deserved and right. Sometimes things change because of it.;NM35AAYUTH24208_.mp3
But not always. Mostly it makes things worse.;
Any failure to get the results I want is due to a lack of power on my part. That can change, in time. As a Sith, my mettle is tested far more than when I was a Padawan.;NM35AAYUTH24210_.mp3
I know this may sound strange, but only my compassion stands in my way, now. Once that is gone let the slavers beware.;NM35AAYUTH24215_.mp3
But... if you lose your compassion, will you still care about those slaves?;
I... yes, of course. I mean losing my compassion as in... holding back...;NM35AAYUTH24217_.mp3
But enough of that. I've talked about myself too much, surely you are tired of it.;NM35AAYUTH24224_.mp3
How long before you begin this fight, do you think?;
I... well, there is much training to do. I... may be a long time...;NM35AAYUTH24219_.mp3
It's a commendable goal. I admire your spirit.;
Thank you. I only wish I was as strong with the Force as you are. You could change much, yourself, if you wanted to.;NM35AAYUTH24221_.mp3
I find it hard to think of any Sith with compassion.;
I suppose I shouldn't be telling you these things... sharing my weaknesses with you. Being a Sith doesn't make me a monster, however.;NM35AAYUTH24223_.mp3
But has anything changed?;
No... not yet. But my anger has not diminished, nor my desire to see change. The more time I spend with the Sith the more I am certain that one day I will be able to fight as I must.;NM35AAYUTH24212_.mp3
I agree.;
There is suffering and injustice in the universe. I am surprised the Jedi can even stand the stench of it, much less stand by and do nothing.;NM35AAYUTH24214_.mp3
You sound very much like... someone I used to know.;NM35AAYUTH24206_.mp3
[Failure] Friends? We can be friends once Uthar is dead. Until then, a 'friend' is a weakness.;NM35AAYUTH24225_.mp3
[Persuade] I just thought we could become friends... or maybe something more.;
[Success] I see. You... certainly have odd notions for one hoping to become a Sith. I'll play along... for now.;NM35AAYUTH24227_.mp3
[Persuade] Is there any harm in telling me?;
[Failure] There is always harm in becoming too vulnerable. I will not be as weak as you desire.;NM35AAYUTH24229_.mp3
Very little. I never met her personally, though I hear she was a powerful woman. Very charismatic.;NM35AAYUTH24165_.mp3
In the end, Revan was outshone by her pupil. Such is the way of the Sith. Why? Is this dead woman of importance to you?;NM35AAYUTH24166_.mp3
Yes, go on.;
There are a group of students who refused an order by Master Uthar to execute a group of civilians in the colony.;NM35AAYUTH24095_.mp3
Uthar declared that they were to be executed, themselves, but the students escaped and fled before the order could be carried out.;NM35AAYUTH24096_.mp3
We are certain that they have not left Korriban. No doubt they have not gotten far and are simply in hiding... we just do not know where, exactly.;NM35AAYUTH24097_.mp3
If you were to locate them and carry out Uthar's order, I am sure he would be most appreciative.;NM35AAYUTH24098_.mp3
The rebel students I told you about must still be found and dealt with... Master Uthar would be greatly impressed by their deaths, I am sure.;NM35AAYUTH24101_.mp3
I would suggest you talk to the other prospective Sith and find one that you can gain an advantage with.;NM35AAYUTH24102_.mp3
I believe Lashowe would be an excellent choice. She is too trusting. I have little doubt you could talk her into letting you 'help' her somehow.;NM35AAYUTH24103_.mp3
Just make sure that it is you who gains the advantage, not her. Be ruthless, if you must. That is the only thing that will impress Uthar.;NM35AAYUTH24104_.mp3
The only other idea I can suggest to you is that you head into the Valley of the Dark Lords on the surface. There are ancient ruins there which can be explored.;NM35AAYUTH24106_.mp3
It's possible you might find some artifacts or information in them which would please Uthar... it's difficult to say for certain.;NM35AAYUTH24107_.mp3
I still think that approaching Lashowe would be your best move. She is too trusting and can no doubt be talked into aiding your cause.;NM35AAYUTH24105_.mp3
No, I've heard enough.;
The Code of the Sith is the easiest way, to start. I have told you all that you need to know of it, already.;NM35AAYUTH24094_.mp3
Forget it. I don't want to be a part of this.;
You are already a part of this. Don't be a fool.;NM35AAYUTH24026_.mp3
You don't say? Well, the master loves tombs, don't you master?;NM35AAYUTH24014_.mp3
Darth Malak went there? Very interesting... isn't it, master?;NM35AAYUTH24015_.mp3
Do I have a choice?;
Not really. Oh, don't worry... what I have in mind will benefit us both, you can be sure of that.;NM35AAYUTH24039_.mp3
But I don't even have any prestige, yet!;
'Yet' being the operative term. As I said, you have my utmost confidence.;NM35AAYUTH24041_.mp3
What are you doing here? Go back to Uthar and tell him you're ready to take your final test! Our moment is at hand, go!;NM35AAYUTH24042_.mp3
Hmmm. You're a rather tricky human, aren't you? However did you manage to convince Kel Algwinn to reveal himself to you?;NM35AAYUTH24043_.mp3
No matter. I applaud you for the maneuver, at any rate. An act worthy of a Sith, surely.;NM35AAYUTH24044_.mp3
I rather enjoyed it. He was a fool.;
Now that's what I like to see... the flash of ambition in a young human's eyes. Your species has such remarkable retinal coloring, did you know that?;NM35AAYUTH24046_.mp3
You have other things to turn your attention to, however, I'm sure. What do you need?;NM35AAYUTH24051_.mp3
He wouldn't have lasted. I just put him out of his misery.;
Yes, I... suppose so. The weak can surprise you sometimes with their strength, however. He could have surprised us.;NM35AAYUTH24048_.mp3
I... suppose so.;
What's this? Regrets? Not to worry, dear pupil, it... gets easier with time.;NM35AAYUTH24050_.mp3
I understand you managed to kill Lashowe. Well done! She was devious, but I knew her trust could be turned against her!;NM35AAYUTH24052_.mp3
One less opponent is an excellent result regardless of how it occurs, correct? Now, then... something you needed?;NM35AAYUTH24055_.mp3
So... you managed to kill Shaardan, did you? Good news travels quickly. Well done... he wouldn't have made a good Sith, anyway.;NM35AAYUTH24053_.mp3
You killed Mekel, I hear? Well... I suppose it is just as well. He was far too devious to be allowed to live.;NM35AAYUTH24054_.mp3
You've been doing well... I hear you've almost enough prestige to be declared the victor. Somehow I just knew you were the one who would succeed.;NM35AAYUTH24056_.mp3
I hear that you have gained even more prestige. You are closing in on victory... this is good.;NM35AAYUTH24057_.mp3
Were I you, I would not get too excited just yet. You still have plenty left to do.;NM35AAYUTH24059_.mp3
I understand you have impressed Master Uthar at least a little. That is good... we are one step closer towards completing my plan.;NM35AAYUTH24058_.mp3
Greetings, my friend. *chuckle* I do rather enjoy saying that.;NM35AAYUTH24060_.mp3
Hello, again. I trust all is going smoothly?;NM35AAYUTH24061_.mp3
What do you wish? I am eager to get this over with.;NM35AAYUTH24062_.mp3
I have heard a disturbing rumor, <FullName>. A hunter matching your description is reported to have slain a Krayt dragon on Tatooine. Please, tell me it wasn't you.;
It was me. Why?;
I do not mean to pry, <FullName>. But the Krayt dragon is a fierce and deadly beast, a monster even one of your power would be smart to avoid!;
If something should happen to you - if you are injured or even slain by such a beast - then Malak will never be toppled!;
I can look after myself.;
I suppose if there is anyone in the galaxy who could reasonably expect to survive such an encounter, it would be you, <FullName>.;
But if you are going to continue with such reckless escapades, I would strongly recommend you stock up with weapons and armor from my inventory.;
Let me see your premium items.;
Yes, of course. I'm sure you'll find my selection to be very interesting.;
I have some questions for you.;
Of course. I will help you with whatever I can.;
Do you know a lot about the Ebon Hawk and its previous owners?;
I know very little about the owners of the Ebon Hawk. Most were affiliated with the Exchange, and they only revealed enough to enable us to do business with them.;
But the ship itself is very well known, especially here on Korriban. Some say it is the finest smuggling vessel in this sector. Others say it is a cursed vessel, bringing doom to its owners.;
Cursed? What do you mean?;
None deny the Hawk is a fine vessel with a long history of successful smuggling runs to its credit. But the owners have not fared nearly as well the ship itself.;
Take Davik Kang. He was the last owner I know of before you. His home world was the planet Taris - a world the Sith utterly destroyed. Few would call that a fortunate occurence.;
And even if Taris hadn't been destroyed, would Davik still be around? It seems doubtful he *sold* the ship to you. And I know Davik didn't *buy* it from the previous owner.;
These events have more to do with the type of owner than the Hawk itself.;
Yes, I suppose a Sith Lord has little time for curses. You are probably far beyond such things. In any case, I meant no offense. I am only telling you what I know of the Hawk's reputation.;
Is there anything else you are needing from me?;
Ziagrom says you sell... special items.;
Yes, to the right buyer. Traditionally, the owner of the Ebon Hawk has been the contact for all my transactons. But in the past, the owner was always affiliated with the Exchange.;
That was why Ziagrom did not approach you earlier. We had no idea who you were, or if we wanted to do business with you. Of course that has all changed now, Lord Revan.;
I'm glad you've seen the light.;
The light? A fine jest, though it contains a crystal of truth. We have allied with you in this conflict, and we trust you will remember us once victory is yours, Revan.;
What kinds of things do you have for sale?;
Yes, let's get right to business. I carry only the rarest of items. Expensive, yes - but worth every credit! Weapons, armor, equipment: I carry a little of everything.;
The previous owners of the Ebon Hawk would often resell the items they purchased, but in your case I imagine you might find more than a few of them quite useful against your old apprentice.;
I'll be going now.;
Of course. Remember to return whenever you desire to see my inventory of permium items. We are eager to help you against your old apprentice.;
Your motives seem very self-serving.;
Of course. How else are we to survive? Now, do you wish to see the premium items I have for sale? Or is there something else you need?;
I'm not who you think I am. I'm not Revan anymore.;
No? Ziagrom's information is never wrong. Are you saying that you don't want to revenge on your former apprentice? Are you saying you don't plan to kill Malak?;
I will stop Malak and his Sith, but not for revenge.;
In truth, your reasons matter little to me or my partner. But we do believe in your power. We believe you will bring Malak down - and we want to help you, in our own small fashion.;
Anything interesting going on here?;
Since Malak stole the Order from you, the Academy here on Korriban has become all but impossible to deal with. The Sith there care for nothing but their own plots and schemes.;
I hope that once you destroy your old apprentice things will return to the way they were before. The Sith and the Exchange should work together: it could benefit both sides.;
What do you know about the Sith academy?;
Only what I have heard from others: Uthar Wynn is dead, by your hand. I am hoping this will bring about a change in how the Sith will deal with others here on Dreshdae.;
The Sith built their academy here to train students. Many go to train there, though I know not why. Most are not permitted to train and many die in their attempt to be admitted.;
Many of their students and sometimes the Sith, themselves, come to my cantina. Look around and you will see them. I have little choice as to their presence.;
What can you tell me about the Sith's excavations?;
Very little. None are allowed in their ruins other than the Sith themselves, as I understand it.;
Surely there must be some way to go there.;
The Sith do have a passage that leads to their valley from within the monastery. Only they may use it, however.;
I doubt they would let you in, even if you could somehow convince them of your true identity. Most of the Sith at the Academy are loyal to Malak, now. They see him as the true Master.;
I am afraid not. The Sith have a passage that leads to their valley from within their monastery, but only they may use it.;
Do you know anything about a Star Map on Korriban?;
Could you be more specific, sentient? What manner of Star Map do you seek?;
The very old kind. Perhaps you know of some ruins on Korriban?;
There is a place on the surface of this planet called the Valley of the Dark Lords, I believe, where the Sith dig amongst such ruins. Perhaps what you seek is there.;
What do you know about the Ebon Hawk?;
Only what I hear from rumors, sentient. The Hawk has been a frequent visitor to Korriban in the past, though often with a different owner.;
In all fairness, I should tell you that many of the past owners were suspected of being smugglers, slavers and pirates. It was even whispered that some worked for the Exchange.;
But I always found the Hawk's owners to be excellent citizens of fine character. The kind of people I prefer to do business with. Much better than the Sith, at least.;
That's all for now.;
As you desire, sentient.;
The very old kind. Perhaps the Sith's excavations involve something like it?;
It may be possible, sentient. The only artifacts I have ever heard mentioned are in relation to the Sith and their Valley of the Dark Lords.;
This cantina has been provided by the Czerka Corporation, and it is a quiet place. This is as I prefer it. Elsewhere in Dreshdae it is not always safe or quiet. Dreshdae is run as the Sith wish.;
The Sith are not always pleasant in their dealings with others. If I had a say, I would prefer they and their academy were not present here. But I do not.;
I don't believe in curses.;
And what do you say?;
I didn't have a choice, really.;
I'm not scared of anything - not even a Krayt dragon!;
[Lie] It wasn't me.;
Please, I am not a fool. I understand your power, <FullName>. You are, after all, the Dark Lord of the Sith. But Krayt dragons are terrible monsters!;
What business is it of yours if I hunt Krayt dragons.;
The Czerka people here in Dreshdae are saying the wookiees of Edean have had their spirits broken. They claim all thoughts of freeing themselves from Czerka have been crushed.;
I sense your hand in this, <FullName>. The full might of Czerka hadn't been able to break the will of those hairy beastsl... until you arrived.;
You might want to browse my inventory, <FullName>. I have many items you could use to help crush your enemies as easily as you crushed the wookiee rebellion.;
The talk among the Czerka people is of a rebellion on the planet of Edean. It appears the wookiees have turned on their masters.;
I have to assume you are the one responsible for this, <FullName>. I can think of no other who could bring about the collapse of Czerka's operations so spectacularly.;
I only hope your actions don't draw the attention of your old apprentice. I'd suggest you stock up from my inventory in anticipation of your next meeting with Malak.;
People are saying the Kolto supply on Manaan has been destroyed. Of course when I heard the news I immediately thought of you, <FullName>.;
Why did you think of me?;
Who else could have caused such a catastrophic change? You are a force of destiny, <FullName>. The galaxy is changed forever by even your slightest of actions.;
But such actions have consequences, including drawing the attention of old enemies. You should probably look at my stock, <FullName>. It might come in useful in the coming battles.;
It was an accident, I swear.;
Perhaps. Perhaps not. In any case, the galaxy has been forever changed by your actions. You are a force of destiny, <FullName>.;
[Lie] I don't know anything about it.;
"I find that hard to believe. Who else could have caused such a catastrophic change? You are a force of destiny; the galaxy is changed forever by your actions. Few can claim such power!";
I destroyed the Kolto. So what?;
"I am not making any judgements. But I marvel at how the galaxy is trembling at the power of your touch; how it is changed forever by your actions.";
Greetings, sentient. You are the owner of the Ebon Hawk, yes? Or its latest owner, at least. I am honored to meet you.;
I am Mika Dorin, manager of this establishment. Is there something you are needing, sentient? The owner of the Ebon Hawk is always welcome in the Dresdae Cantina.;
You know something about the Ebon Hawk?;
Just some questions answered.;
What would you like to know, sentient?;
No, nothing.;
Welcome again, sentient. It is always a pleasure to serve the owner of the Ebon Hawk... it reminds me of old times.;
Is there something you are needing now?;
Your honor, the Republic is clearly in violation of Manaan's laws!;NM26AASITH24000_.mp3
These wild Sith accusations have no basis, your honor. Where is the proof?;NM26AASITH24002_.mp3
I must admit, these charges are hard to believe without proof. If the Republic are using submersibles to explore the ocean floor, surely there would be some evidence.;
The evidence has been covered up, your honor - by your own people! I believe high level Ahto City officials are conspiring with the Republic.;NM26AASITH24006_.mp3
You go too far, off-worlder! I will not listen to unfounded charges against Selkath officials in my court!;
But, your honor - these charges cannot be ignored!;NM26AASITH24010_.mp3
Enough, my decision has been made. If you find proof I shall reopen this case. Until then, I find no evidence of these alleged crimes. This court is dismissed.;
One day soon the Selkath will pay for the indignities they have inflicted on the Sith!;NM26AASITH24014_.mp3
They say everyone on Manaan is equal. But it seems the Republic is a little more equal than the Sith. Neutrality? Ha! That's a laugh!;NM26AASITH24016_.mp3
Manaan should treat us Sith better - their day of reckoning approaches.;NM26AASITH24018_.mp3
The Selkath have forgotten the lesson of Taris. Perhaps we should remind them.;NM26AASITH24020_.mp3
Are you the buyer I'm supposed to meet?  Wait a minute: where's Vek? What's going on here!;
Vek's not on your payroll anymore, Ithorak!;
I knew I couldn't trust that Twi'lek. Some security advisor: he lets an assassin walk right in on me!;
Vek's going to pay for this betrayal... after I'm done taking care of you!;
Vek didn't want to be around when I gutted you, Ithorak!;
Beep. Click. Whirr. Grind. Beep.;
Hey, man, clear out. You're cramping my style with the ladies.;NM26AAVIGL28000_.mp3
Say, you must be new around here. My name is Viglo. You don't look like those Republic scum, and you aren't one of us Sith. So, what brings you to Manaan?;NM26AAVIGL28001_.mp3
I'm <FullName>. I'm just here to check out the swoop races.;
Some of the other soldiers like to go and bet on the swoops on their days off, but this planet is bad enough without mingling with the locals.;NM26AAVIGL28003_.mp3
It isn't easy here, you know. Not with all the Republic soldiers walking the streets while we sit and do nothing. Malak should send a fleet in and conquer this whole sector, kolto or no!;NM26AAVIGL28009_.mp3
But I don't really want to talk about that right now. I'm just here to have a couple drinks and try to unwind, you know?;NM26AAVIGL28010_.mp3
I'm searching for some ancient ruins, or maybe a long forgotten Star Map.;
You some kind of historian? You should look to the future, not the past. That's why I joined the Sith. And then I get stuck on Manaan - worst post in the galaxy!;NM26AAVIGL28008_.mp3
I'm investigating the recent murder.;
I hope the Selkath fry that Sunry for what he did. Elassa was a real looker, and nobody kills a Sith and gets away with it!;NM26AAVIGL28038_.mp3
Why are the Sith so interested in the Selkath youth?;
We Sith are interested in lots of stuff. You'd be smart to keep your nose out of Sith business.;NM26AAVIGL28040_.mp3
I'll be going now.;
Oh... I get it. I get a little too forward and you want to hold it against me.;NM26AAVIGL28042_.mp3
Hey, I just thought of something! If I said you had a great body, would you hold it against me? Ha ha ha!;NM26AAVIGL28043_.mp3
Barkeep, I sense I've offended my lady friend. Bring me another round so I can drown my sorrows in the sweet nectar of the Selkath people.;NM26AAVIGL28044_.mp3
I'm just passing through.;
Well, you picked a real stinkhole to stop at. Republic soldiers are everywhere, those arrogant Selkath treating us Sith like we're second-class citizens.;NM26AAVIGL28005_.mp3
I wish we could bomb this ocean world into a desert, but we need that kolto for our Sith troops. Man, I hate this place.;NM26AAVIGL28006_.mp3
Oh, you're back. You going to stick around this time? Or did I offend you?;NM26AAVIGL28065_.mp3
I probably should cut back on the drinking, but it's a good way to relax. There's a lot of tension here on Manaan.;NM26AAVIGL28066_.mp3
Malak will show you Republics how a war is really waged!;NM26ACSITH30000_.mp3
You! You're the one! You beat Zoriis Bafka's time? I have to get your autoprint.;
What? My autoprint? Are you serious?;
Sure I am! You are fast for a human, and once the races are running regular again, you'll be famous. Well, maybe you will.;
If you start winning on the real tour, I want to be able to say I saw you when you were just starting out. How about it?;
Sure, why not? Scan away.;
Really? That is great of you. You will be a fan favorite. Some of the racers sell their prints, but that is just rude.;
Here, just put your hand on this pad. Thanks again. I know I'll be seeing more of you, human.;
Go away, I don't have time for you.;
No? Why not? I just wanted to get a mark from the best new racer on the circuit. What is wrong with that?;
If you are so full of yourself now, I would hate to see what you would be like if the pro tour was back up. Keep your print, then.;
Do you... do you have the cure, up-worlder? Have you come to save us from the horrible fate of the others?;NM04AAINFE09000_.mp3
I have brought you a serum to cure the rakghoul disease.;
You... you have a cure? Please, give it to me. Please. Quickly, before it's too late.;NM04AAINFE09007_.mp3
Here, take this rakghoul serum. I have enough for both of you.;
Quickly - I must inject it before it is too late. Yes... I feel it working!;NM04AAINFE09009_.mp3
I feel the disease burning away! It... it is like a miracle! I am cured!;NM04AAINFE09011_.mp3
Thank you, up-worlder. You have saved us from a fate worse than death. I only wish I had some reward to give you. Maybe you can find something worthwhile in the wreckage of that Republic escape pod.;NM04AAINFE09013_.mp3
Republic escape pod? What are you talking about?;
Not long ago an escape pod crashed in the Undercity, far to the northeast of the village. We were going to try and salvage equipment from it but we were attacked by the rakghouls and infected.;NM04AAINFE09015_.mp3
I'd tell you more if I could, but our salvage team never reached the pod. It's probably still there, unless some of the other up-worlders already found it and picked it clean.;NM04AAINFE09017_.mp3
We should go now, up-worlder. We're anxious to return to the village and see our families again. Thank you once again for everything you have done.;NM04AAINFE09019_.mp3
I was just happy to help.;
What will you give me in exchange for this cure?;
We... we have nothing, up-worlder. We are Outcasts. All we have are the clothes on our backs.;NM04AAINFE09023_.mp3
Please, up-worlder. Show us mercy. Give us the cure out of the goodness of your heart!;NM04AAINFE09025_.mp3
Forget it. I'm not wasting the cure on an Outcast!;
Go then, up-worlder. Leave us here to die, abandoned by everyone!;NM04AAINFE09038_.mp3
Don't worry - I'm here to help you.;
You... you will help us? Bless you, up-worlder! Bless you. But... you must hurry!;NM04AAINFE09028_.mp3
We have the rakghoul disease. It is only a matter of time until we are transformed into terrible creatures like those who attacked you when you first came into the pen.;NM04AAINFE09031_.mp3
It is too late for them. Soon it will be too late for us and we will transform into those horrible rakghouls ourselves!;NM04AAINFE09033_.mp3
Don't worry... I'll be back when I find a cure for you!;
Please hurry, up-worlder. We don't have much time until the transformation.;NM04AAINFE09035_.mp3
Don't forget about us, up-worlder. If you find any way to cure this disease, please come back and help us.;NM04AAINFE09041_.mp3
I think I'll kill you so you don't infect anybody else!;
Goodbye.;
Why have you come back, up-worlder? Do you come to mock us in our suffering as the disease destroys us?;NM04AAINFE09001_.mp3
Get away from me you diseased mongrels!;
When the rakghouls infected me I never thought I'd see my family again. Thank you for all your help, up-worlder.;NM04AAINFE09003_.mp3
Please... you have to help us. We beg you. We don't want to end up like the others. Please help us. We can't end up like them.;NM04AAINFE09005_.mp3
Who are you? Why are you locked away from the rest of the village?;
Hey, you're not bad... maybe if you win a couple races, I might be glad to have talked to you.;
Wow! You're, like, sooo great! I can't believe you actually spoke to me. Like, wow!;
What do YOU want? If you aren't a racer, you're nobody, so just leave me alone.;
I shall answer questions pertaining to the case and those questions only.;
What do you think of Sunry?;
I find the idea that some half-human cripple could murder someone as obviously competent as the Sith Elassa questionable at best.;
A man who can barely walk killed a Sith warrior in her prime? Preposterous!;
But I wouldn't put it past the Republic to try and arrange such circumstances to see her dead. The Sith are much more straight forward about their intentions.;
Is that all?;
Is there anything suspicious about this case?;
I find it presumptuous to assume that the cripple Sunry could kill Elassa. I think that there must have been another there who killed her. Perhaps one of the 'witnesses'.;
I do not know the reason for the medal clutched in Elassa's hand either, but it may have been that she fought them off even as she died.;
I think this may be the work of some Republic conspiracy and I am not afraid to say so! If the only means I have of hurting the Republic is through Sunry, then so be it!;
What do you think of the Republic and the Sith Empire?;
I think the Republic is an institution in sore need of change. It has gone on too long and the Sith are the fresh wind of change blowing across the galaxy.;
I do not believe in the false stories of the evils of the Sith Empire. They are nothing compared to the oppression and stagnation that the Republic represents at its core.;
If I was given the power to decide, Manaan would join with the Sith, forcing the Republic to accept the new face of the future.;
But sadly, it would appear that I am wiser and more farsighted than my immediate superiors. I am relegated to civil judicial matters.;
I will judge this case. And I will find Sunry as guilty as he is charged to be.;
So nice to meet an impartial judge, for a change.;NM26AASELJ21028_.mp3
Impartiality is one thing. Blindness is another entirely.;
You said it, not I.;NM26AASELJ21032_.mp3
Are you finished?;
I have no more questions for now.;
Do not bring frivilous topics to discuss. I deal only with trial information.;
Hey! I thought you Selkath judges were supposed to follow the law! You can't already have decided that Sunry is guilty!;NM26AASELJ21034_.mp3
If you had listened, Carth, you would know that that *is* the law. Sunry is guilty until proven innocent.;NM26AASELJ21036_.mp3
That's a stupid law for any civilized world to have.;NM26AASELJ21038_.mp3
Angering the judge won't get us a more impartial decision, Carth.;NM26AASELJ21040_.mp3
It is up to you off-worlders to prove the human's innocence. I simply doubt that you will be capable of doing so.;
I don't waste time on individuals who are not involved in my legal jurisdiction. Do not disturb me.;
We were watching you on the cameras, and I want you to know that you did the right thing. Killing that shark probably saved us all.;NM28ACSUR303000_.mp3
I'm sure the kolto will be fine. A few impurities that may have got in should be flushed out in no time.;NM28ACSUR303001_.mp3
Just hurry up and get back to the surface and get the Republic to send down a real rescue team. We'll be waiting here for you.;NM28ACSUR303002_.mp3
I saw what happened on the camera... and I can't believe what you did.;NM28ACSUR303003_.mp3
How could you willfully destroy the kolto harvesting machinery?! That will set us back years!;NM28ACSUR303004_.mp3
I will have you know that when we get back to the surface I'll have the Republic do a full inquiry into your actions!;NM28ACSUR303005_.mp3
Now go back to the surface and get the Republic to send a REAL rescue team down for us.;NM28ACSUR303006_.mp3
No - no, you can't come in here! You'll let the firaxa and the Selkath in! No - stay out! Stay out!;NM28ACSUR303007_.mp3
I won't let you open the door for those monsters to get in! I'll stop you! I'll suck all the pressure out of the chamber! That'll stop you!;NM28ACSUR303008_.mp3
Kill them! Kill them now!;NM28ACSUR303009_.mp3
What - what do you want? Go away! You'll let the firaxa and the Selkath in! They'll get us like they got all the others!;NM28ACSUR303010_.mp3
No - I'm <FullName> and I'm here to help you. But first you have to stop the depressurization sequence.;
No... the firaxa... the... the Selkath... I... I can't let you in. They'll get us!;NM28ACSUR303012_.mp3
[Persuade] I'll keep you safe. I promise. But you have to let me in.;
[Success] I... I don't want to hurt you. I don't want to hurt anyone.;NM28ACSUR303014_.mp3
I'll unlock the door, but you have to come in quickly!;NM28ACSUR303015_.mp3
No, no, no. Don't do it!;NM28ACSUR303016_.mp3
[Failure] No... I can't. The Selkath will get me! The firaxa will eat us! I can't! I can't!;NM28ACSUR303017_.mp3
[Force Persuade] I'm a friend. You want to let me in. You want to stop the depressurization sequence.;
[Success] Yes. You are a friend. You'll protect us. You won't let the firaxa eat us. You'll keep the Selkath away.;NM28ACSUR303020_.mp3
Open this door or you'll wish the Selkath had got you!;
No... I can't. The Selkath will get me! The Firaxa will eat us! I can't! I can't!;NM28ACSUR303017_.mp3
Please - we're going to die if you don't stop the sequence!;
I... I'm sorry for what I did. I don't know what came over me. I... I just panicked when I heard someone outside the door. *Sigh* Please, forgive me. I'm just so scared.;NM28ACSUR303022_.mp3
We're both just scared.;NM28ACSUR303023_.mp3
When the Selkath went crazy I thought everyone else except me and Sami went mad. We had a few people outside the station when it happened...;NM28ACSUR303024_.mp3
The... firaxan sharks just tore them apart... It was like they were frenzied...;NM28ACSUR303025_.mp3
The next thing we knew our Selkath researchers started screaming and... and clawing at everything around them. My team... my team was torn apart and eaten before my eyes!;NM28ACSUR303026_.mp3
How horrible! I can only imagine how frightened you were.;NM28ACSUR303027_.mp3
Sami and me... I... I thought we were the only ones left. We heard the Selkath outside at the doors every once in a while... and those strange noises echoing through the base.;NM28ACSUR303029_.mp3
We... thought everyone was dead... dead or insane.;NM28ACSUR303030_.mp3
I must have been hysterical, I... I don't know what I can say... I truly apologize for the horrible mistake I was making.;NM28ACSUR303031_.mp3
I am Kono Nolan, and this is Sami. We were scientists working here on the Hrakert Rift project.;NM28ACSUR303032_.mp3
You have a lot to answer for!;
Look, I'm sorry! I've just been under a LOT of strain recently. You know, the whole thing about having my entire research team DEVOURED BEFORE MY EYES!!;NM28ACSUR303044_.mp3
Kono. Kono, calm down.;NM28ACSUR303045_.mp3
Don't talk to him like that! We've gone through a lot, and we said we're sorry for the mistake we made!;NM28ACSUR303046_.mp3
Just... I am sorry for my actions. But... but what are you doing here?;NM28ACSUR303047_.mp3
I'm on a mission for the Jedi Council to find pieces of a Star Map.;
A Star Map? I don't know of anything about a Star Map down here.;NM28ACSUR303049_.mp3
But... there were some ruins that were excavated when we were digging the foundations for the last section of the kolto harvesting machine.;NM28ACSUR303050_.mp3
But we can't go anywhere near those now! Maybe... maybe that's why it all happened in the first place...;NM28ACSUR303051_.mp3
What happened?;
We don't know! Not for sure...;NM28ACSUR303060_.mp3
The work teams were outside in the Rift near the vent. Then there was this rumbling and my head felt like it was splitting open...;NM28ACSUR303061_.mp3
This... this monster rose up from the Rift...;NM28ACSUR303062_.mp3
It was a firaxa shark I think... bigger than any I'd ever seen before. Bigger than our submersibles.;NM28ACSUR303063_.mp3
It was like it was screaming inside my head...;NM28ACSUR303064_.mp3
Then all the Selkath started screaming too... and they turned on us.;NM28ACSUR303065_.mp3
Turned on you?;
It was like they couldn't control themselves... like the sound that the monster was making in our heads drove them insane.;NM28ACSUR303067_.mp3
Well... maybe it was protecting the ruins by the Rift.;NM28ACSUR303069_.mp3
It could have been. It might have a lair in the Hrakert Rift near the kolto vent. Hm... that may explain a few things, too...;NM28ACSUR303070_.mp3
Like what?;
Like why it reacted so violently when our construction efforts got closer to the vent.;NM28ACSUR303072_.mp3
And also why it is so large. It must be feeding off the kolto. It would have to be ancient indeed for it to reach that size. But with kolto as a food source...;NM28ACSUR303073_.mp3
And all those other firaxan sharks! Those might be its offspring!;NM28ACSUR303074_.mp3
Which would be why they all swarmed when it called out to them... Children coming to protect their mother.;NM28ACSUR303075_.mp3
So what can I do about it?;
The firaxan sharks have always been a serious problem. We had some blasters and projectile cannons to defend against them, but they still got some of our workers from time to time.;NM28ACSUR303077_.mp3
We were working on a soluble chemical compound that would drive them away. Something that smelled or tasted repulsive to them, but we never got it working right.;NM28ACSUR303078_.mp3
Oh, I think not! Even flawed like it is, it should be ideal for this situation.;NM28ACSUR303079_.mp3
No! It's not working right! You don't know what it will do!;NM28ACSUR303080_.mp3
What are you talking about?;
The repellant we made was supposed to drive firaxan sharks away, but we never got very far in its development.;NM28ACSUR303083_.mp3
The one we tested instead was violently toxic to them, rupturing their outer skin in seconds and preventing them from drawing oxygen from the water by clogging their intakes.;NM28ACSUR303084_.mp3
Which is exactly what we need in this situation! Something to kill that monster shark that destroyed our station!;NM28ACSUR303085_.mp3
But we don't know how else the chemical reacts! We only tried it in a controlled environment. In the open ocean, who knows what it could do... it could even affect the kolto.;NM28ACSUR303086_.mp3
We know exactly what it will do: it will kill the shark. That's what we designed it to do.;NM28ACSUR303087_.mp3
How would I poison the shark?;
You can take this cannister of toxin. We were working on it just before the giant shark drove all the Selkath insane.;NM28ACSUR303089_.mp3
All you need to do is insert it into the main kolto harvester and have it vent it.;NM28ACSUR303092_.mp3
Get away as soon as you can. We don't know how much worse it will affect the giant firaxan shark.;NM28ACSUR303093_.mp3
OK. I'll vent the toxin into the Rift to kill the giant shark.;
Wait! Don't! We don't know what effect the toxin will have on the ocean environment around the Rift!;NM28ACSUR303095_.mp3
It could poison the water against all life. It could poison the kolto itself, even! There is another way...;NM28ACSUR303096_.mp3
Well, the monster seems to have been driven out by the machinery we installed at the edge of the Rift. We've seen it out there on the cameras bashing itself against the machines.;NM28ACSUR303098_.mp3
I think if you could destroy the machinery we installed, the shark would calm down and retreat back into its lair inside the Rift.;NM28ACSUR303099_.mp3
How would I do that?;
You can reprogram the harvesting machines to overpressure their self-oxidizing fuel, so that the fuel tank cannisters will rupture and the entire machine will destroy itself.;NM28ACSUR303101_.mp3
The Hydrolium gas we use is a gas at 1 to 3 million sangen, a liquid at about 4 million sangen, and a solid above that. When it's a liquid it's VERY explosive.;NM28ACSUR303102_.mp3
If you inject enough of the Hydrolium gas into the tank, the pressure will be so great that it will turn to liquid form and start a chain reaction inside the machine.;NM28ACSUR303103_.mp3
But we'll lose everything we've built here! All those years of work!;NM28ACSUR303104_.mp3
It's better than whatever your chemical will do to the water!;NM28ACSUR303105_.mp3
I will try to poison the shark.;
You know it's the right thing to do. It can't go wrong.;NM28ACSUR303107_.mp3
Just put the cannister into the machine and have it vent it into the Rift. The firaxan shark should die in no time.;NM28ACSUR303108_.mp3
No! You shouldn't do that! It could poison everything!;NM28ACSUR303109_.mp3
Just reprogram the harvesting machine's computer to overpressure the fuel tanks. Once it's destroyed, the shark should just leave.;NM28ACSUR303110_.mp3
You know what you have to do.;NM28ACSUR303111_.mp3
I just hope you make the right choice.;NM28ACSUR303112_.mp3
I will try to destroy the harvesting machine.;
Good! Destroying the machinery will be better in the long run. We can't risk damaging the environment or the kolto.;NM28ACSUR303114_.mp3
You'll have to break into the computer on the harvesting machine and fiddle with the fuel injectors to get the tank pressure up to the point where the Hydrolium will liquidize.;NM28ACSUR303115_.mp3
Once the machinery is gone, the shark should leave.;NM28ACSUR303116_.mp3
That won't work and you know it! We have to vent the toxin from the harvesting machine. Once the shark is dead, we can get back to mining the kolto.;NM28ACSUR303117_.mp3
I'll do what I want... and kill both of you as well!;
What? No!;NM28ACSUR303119_.mp3
Run, Kono! He's one of them!;NM28ACSUR303120_.mp3
Run, Kono! She's one of them!;NM28ACSUR303121_.mp3
I am not so sure...;
I AM sure.;NM28ACSUR303123_.mp3
What other choice do I have, though?;
What else could I do?;
You don't need to do anything else. We have a cannister of the toxin here right now. We were working on it before the giant firaxan drove all the Selkath insane.;NM28ACSUR303091_.mp3
What compound?;
What does this compound do?;
Where is this monster firaxan now?;
I don't know. It must still be out there.;NM28ACSUR303126_.mp3
Out there waiting for us...;NM28ACSUR303127_.mp3
I have to get to the kolto machinery.;
That would be suicide... It's out there still.;NM28ACSUR303129_.mp3
The Star Map I'm looking for is out there. I need to get past.;
How could you miss something that big living there?;
I don't know. It seems impossible, but...;NM28ACSUR303132_.mp3
Maybe what ever sort of power it used to drive the Selkath insane masked it from us somehow... or maybe it was lying dormant deeper in the Rift.;NM28ACSUR303135_.mp3
I think it might live there. Live there because of the kolto.;NM28ACSUR303136_.mp3
Hm... maybe. That would explain more...;NM28ACSUR303137_.mp3
And no one knew about this thing?;
We had no clue at all... until it came out.;NM28ACSUR303134_.mp3
What did the shark have to do with that?;
It was protecting something?;
It may... It may have been. Maybe it was protecting the ruins by the Rift.;NM28ACSUR303139_.mp3
Something happened in the ruins?;
What are you babbling about?;
The Republic wants me to find out what happened here.;
Well, we're not too clear ourselves just exactly what happened...;NM28ACSUR303056_.mp3
How about I ask the questions.;
Oh.... okay. What is it you want to know?;NM28ACSUR303058_.mp3
What was the Republic doing here?;
We had a secret agreement with moderates in the Selkath government. They knew that Manaan could not survive independently if the Sith were victorious.;NM28ACSUR303035_.mp3
Those thugs would wipe out the whole damn planet just to get at the kolto.;NM28ACSUR303036_.mp3
So the Republic approached them about making this secret installation to harvest more kolto where the Sith couldn't see us.;NM28ACSUR303037_.mp3
But that all went horribly, horribly wrong...;NM28ACSUR303038_.mp3
Did this have something to do with a Star Map?;
Did the Sith do something?;
Have you seen a Star Map?;
Why did the Selkath all go crazy?;
You tried to kill me!;
I suppose that explains a lot. You've been under a lot of strain, here.;NM28ACSUR303028_.mp3
No! No! The firaxa will get us! No! The Selkath are coming! No!;NM28ACSUR303140_.mp3
No! No!;NM28ACSUR303141_.mp3
Calm down... everything will be okay.;
I'm a friend. I'll protect you. You're both safe now.;
Stop screaming!;
Eeeee! No!;NM28ACSUR303145_.mp3
You... Sami! Sami, calm down! I don't think they're here to kill us.;NM28ACSUR303146_.mp3
Eee... Kono.... Are... are they?;NM28ACSUR303147_.mp3
Yes. I think they're here to help us.;NM28ACSUR303148_.mp3
We're not leaving this room. We're safe here, and there's plenty of food and water. If you manage to reach the kolto harvesting machinery you can put the poison cannister in it and trigger it to release it into the Rift.;NM28ACSUR303149_.mp3
After you've made it past the monster safely you can look for this Star Map of yours and unlock the door to the submersible docking bay.;NM28ACSUR303150_.mp3
You can use the submersibles to get back to the surface and report what happened. The Republic will send down a proper rescue crew for us.;NM28ACSUR303151_.mp3
No offense, but we'd rather wait for them than go with you - even if we're stuck here a few more days. Just get back to the surface afterwards, and the Republic will take care of us.;NM28ACSUR303152_.mp3
Ah, greetings. You must be assisting Master Bolook in his investigation.;NM14ACHAND05000_.mp3
I am Handon Guld, perhaps you've heard of me?;NM14ACHAND05002_.mp3
No.;
Well, I presume you wish to hear my story then? I shall tell you, of course, but there is not much to it. I am sure that you'll agree that Rickard is quite obviously guilty of murder.;NM14ACHAND05004_.mp3
You see, I was out here running earlier today - yes, running, I do that a lot. Can't stand speeders, never use them. Keeps me in shape too, you know! Anyway, I was out running on the other side of that bridge there...;NM14ACHAND05006_.mp3
When all of a sudden I heard a shot coming from over here. I ran over and found this man Calder lying on the ground dead!;NM14ACHAND05008_.mp3
Did you see the killer?;
I saw Rickard come skulking out of the shadows of the rocks south of the river, and I knew something was wrong. I hit my emergency button and called the Enclave right away.;NM14ACHAND05010_.mp3
Well... there, that's my story. Now please hurry this up and arrest Rickard so I can get on with my day!;NM14ACHAND05030_.mp3
Go on.;
Should I have?;
Um... I guess, under the circumstances, no.;NM14ACHAND05036_.mp3
[Lie] Ah, yes of course, Mr. Guld.;
[Success] Really? *Ahem* Well, then, I assure you on my reputation I had nothing to do with the killing. I will help you with the case as best I can, though.;NM14ACHAND05039_.mp3
How can I be of further assistance?;NM14ACHAND05041_.mp3
What do you know about the weapon found by the body?;
That blaster was stolen from my house last week! I never knew what happened to it.;NM14ACHAND05087_.mp3
I hardly have enough money to afford a single blaster, let alone another. I can't tell you how important it is to have a weapon on hand with all these ravenous kath hounds around.;NM14ACHAND05089_.mp3
Even an iriaz can take a man down if it gets in the mood. Every settler has a weapon. It's our most prized possession.;NM14ACHAND05091_.mp3
I would most appreciate it if I could have that back after you determine that Rickard is the killer.;NM14ACHAND05093_.mp3
You knew Calder better than you admit. You rented a speeder with him!;
But I... I realize this must seem like a motive to you, but I assure you it isn't. I dislike Calder, true. I would punch his face in, given the opportunity. But I would not kill him!;NM14ACHAND05080_.mp3
Punch his face in? Why?;
My wife was cheating on me with him. They slept in my own bed while I was in the next room!;NM14ACHAND05024_.mp3
But... as much as I may hate him for that, I could not kill him.;NM14ACHAND05026_.mp3
It may have been my own fault for driving my wife away. I must try not to take the law in my own hands.;NM14ACHAND05028_.mp3
I was just out running, trying to clear my head for the divorce proceedings, not stalking him to kill him. Running is not a crime.;NM14ACHAND05082_.mp3
I want to ask you something else.;
That's all for now.;
Of course, of course. Listen, if you need anything I shall be glad to assist.;NM14ACHAND05099_.mp3
You better come clean!;
I want the truth - now!;
You wanted to kill Calder for having an affair with your wife!;
Knock his block off, sure, but not kill him! Oh my... I hope you don't find that incriminating...;NM14ACHAND05016_.mp3
Normally I am not prone to outbursts like that, but Calder... Mr. Nettic, he was not a very nice person. Not a very nice person to me or my family.;NM14ACHAND05072_.mp3
I had had my suspicions for several weeks, but had no proof until two days ago. It seems Calder was seeing my wife. Right under my nose, no less!;NM14ACHAND05074_.mp3
Well, if you can't keep her, it's your own fault.;NM14ACHAND05076_.mp3
She may have had her reasons, Mandalorian!;NM14ACHAND05078_.mp3
Did you know the victim?;
I knew him a little bit, but I was not any sort of great friend to him or anything.;NM14ACHAND05061_.mp3
I never really associated with him that much. In truth, I didn't really want to. He had a... reputation. Very inconsiderate of family, I heard.;NM14ACHAND05063_.mp3
But merely having heard unkind things about someone wouldn't make me want to kill him!;NM14ACHAND05065_.mp3
Liar! You wanted to kill him for having an affair with your wife!;
No one says you killed him... yet.;
I'm sorry, I'm... I'm getting a bit agitated. Why must we remain here? Can't... Can't you see that Rickard must have shot him?;NM14ACHAND05067_.mp3
What did you see happen?;
Actually, I didn't see anything. I was over across the bridge, I heard a shot and came over. I can tell you I was sure surprised to see Calder's body lying there!;NM14ACHAND05043_.mp3
I just got here when I saw Rickard coming out of the rocks, holding his blaster! I was terrified!;NM14ACHAND05045_.mp3
I had no idea what he was going to do so I hit my emergency button and called the Enclave.;NM14ACHAND05047_.mp3
Master Bolook came out here with his droid and started questioning us. I think he really doesn't understand what's going on.;NM14ACHAND05049_.mp3
I hope that you'll be able to make a more informed decision and get me out of here soon. I have things I have to do!;NM14ACHAND05051_.mp3
Why would someone want to kill him?;
Um... well, you see, Calder was involved in some pretty sordid business from time to time. More often than not, I've heard.;NM14ACHAND05018_.mp3
Disreputable business practices, even more disreputable clients. I've even heard he had dealings with... a Hutt! A Hutt here on Dantooine!;NM14ACHAND05020_.mp3
Now I bet you're wondering if I had any reasons to kill the man, but I tell you I hardly knew him! Saw him once or twice, yes, and I have heard some pretty unkind things about him, but...;NM14ACHAND05012_.mp3
Certainly nothing that would make me want to kill him!;NM14ACHAND05014_.mp3
Why were you out here?;
I was taking my daily constitutional. I just happened to be running by when I heard a shot. I ran over and found Calder's body lying there.;NM14ACHAND05054_.mp3
Do you often run around the plains?;
Yes, quite often. I generally prefer running to anything else. Can't stand speeders.;NM14ACHAND05056_.mp3
A healthy body will breed a healthy mind, as I always say! Ha ha!;NM14ACHAND05058_.mp3
You're holding your side. Are you injured?;
In... injured? No, of course not! Why would I have been? Fit as a bantha! Har har! Yes... I run. I don't know if I mentioned that.;NM14ACHAND05096_.mp3
Nothing more right now.;
Hold here, spacer. Czerka Corporation doesn't recommend traveling in wild Edean. Katarn attacks are especially bad right now.;NM22AACZER03000_.mp3
Wookiee hunters usually keep numbers down, but I think they leave certain areas infested, just hoping a Czerka guard will get killed.;NM22AACZER03002_.mp3
What do you know about the Wookiees?;
You're the Wookiee-lover, why don't you tell me about them? I'm sure you're real close friends.;NM22AACZER03004_.mp3
Grraarrr!;
Keep your pet on a leash or you'll be wearing him. I've no love for these animals. I've seen guards ripped to shreds.;NM22AACZER03008_.mp3
Maybe I should just let him rip your arms off.;
I don't take kindly to threats. Don't test me, spacer, we've more than enough firepower to bury you here.;NM22AACZER03025_.mp3
[Persuade] I'm just trying to get my bearings. I don't mean any harm.;
[Success] Ah, you ain't so bad. Was there anything else you needed?;NM22AACZER03029_.mp3
What can you tell me about Czerka Corporation?;
I don't talk to Wookiee-lovers. Get rid of your rug and maybe I won't have you shot.;NM22AACZER03023_.mp3
Don't get in my way. You'll wind up dead.;
I'm going past you. I paid the landing fee.;
I won't stop you, but you leave this area at your own risk. We're here to protect the company, not you.;NM22AACZER03038_.mp3
That's all. Goodbye.;
Watch yourself out there. There won't be any rescue missions if you go missing.;NM22AACZER03021_.mp3
Go to Janos for company policy. I just man the gate to make sure people like you know you're on your own on the other side.;NM22AACZER03035_.mp3
[Failure] What are you doing? Are you making fun of me? Don't push your luck, fool.;NM22AACZER03027_.mp3
[Force Persuade] You haven't warned me. I'm a nice person. You like me.;
I meant nothing by it. Could you answer my questions?;
Make it quick. I'm getting tired of you.;NM22AACZER03031_.mp3
Should I care? You are nothing to me.;
Yes, yes, you're big and tough. I'll leave.;
That's right you will. Now get moving.;NM22AACZER03034_.mp3
So the Wookiees are fighting back?;
Not anymore. Look, you want to know why the Wookiees are acting compliant, you go ask them.;NM22AACZER03017_.mp3
When they rip your head off, we'll fish it out of the Shadowlands and give it a proper burial. How about that?;NM22AACZER03019_.mp3
What's to tell? They're big, powerful, difficult, and worth the most when caged and shipped off this forest-covered rock.;NM22AACZER03009_.mp3
That's horrible! You wouldn't talk like that if Big Z was here!;NM22AACZER03011_.mp3
You're not some anti-slaver, are you? If so, go talk your crud somewhere else. I've seen guards ripped to shreds. They're animals.;NM22AACZER03015_.mp3
Shipped as slaves to work as soldiers and heavy laborers in Czerka camps, no doubt.;NM22AACZER03013_.mp3
Still here? Why do you keep bothering me? All our services are up near the docking area.;NM22AACZER03039_.mp3
I have questions for you.;
Make it quick. I'm no information booth. Talk to Janos in the Czerka office.;NM22AACZER03041_.mp3
Never mind. I'm leaving.;
Fine then, move along.;NM22AACZER03043_.mp3
[Focused on the nearby enemy, Zaalbar is in no mood to talk right now.];
Is there something you want?;
How do you feel about me being Revan?;
You rescued me from the Gammorean slavers. It does not matter to me if you are called <FullName> or Revan: I have sworn a life debt to you.;
I will stay with you to the end, <FullName>. And I will judge you on your actions as I see them, not on a history I have never known.;
Do you know anything about the planet we're on?;
I have been away from Kashyyyk a long time, but things look the same as I left them. Slavers still hold my people prisoner.;
I'm not sure what I could tell you. Or even what I would want to. You are an outsider here too. It angers me.;
I wonder if you could help me with a problem.;
Unless you want someone threatened or a door bashed in, you should ask someone else.;
I want you to make me a grenade.;
You've got a bunch already. You really don't want these things banging around together. Use some up first.;
I want to know a little more about you, Zaalbar.;
You have seen more than I would have allowed, and taught me some things too. I am grateful for that.;
It will be a while before I know what my role will be in making Kashyyyk truly free. I have a lot to learn.;
Why did you request to take Bacca's Sword?;
I'm not sure I really know. Father expects much of me... I guess I do as well.;
I think, when I've learned enough, I'll bring it back to Kashyyyk. What happens then... we'll see.;
I'm sorry we can't stay on Kashyyyk longer.;
You and I have important things to do, and I don't feel bad about leaving this time. I know I'll be welcomed back.;
This nostalgia won't interfere with your service to me, I hope.;
I should get mad, but I won't. Your comment was callous, but you have shown you respect my people.;
And it is that harshness of you outsiders that I must try to understand. I will follow undistracted while I observe.;
Never mind. Let's just get moving.;
I will follow.;
I wish you well. Let's get going.;
I will fulfill my life debt with you, but I don't think outsiders are worthy of knowing about me or my people.;
I don't think I have to explain why. You witnessed what happened on Kashyyyk, what is still going on.;
The slavers are responsible for what happened, not me.;
Chuundar showed me that you are all the same, all greedy, but I also learned that outsiders can be used.;
As long as you think you are leading, you don't care what those beneath you do. I will use this to my advantage.;
I owe you a life debt, and I will honor it, but I will also serve myself. That is all I have to say.;
Perhaps the outsiders are to blame, but your people are complicit.;
Did we ask to be enslaved? Suffer like we have and then you can criticize how we dealt with this.;
Chuundar has done what he must to ensure we survive. I see it now. He has shown me you can be used.;
Your attitude better not interfere with your service to me.;
I am only a slave to you, just like my people are slaves. Well, Chuundar has shown me how to use you anyway.;
Then I will leave you be.;
Thank you.;
I am sorry, but I don't feel like talking. All I have seen tells me that my home is just as I left it. We are still enslaved.;
For now, just let me think of what must be done. When I learn something new I will comment.;
I will honor my life debt, but I don't feel we share more than that. Mission may say more, but I will not.;
You don't trust me?;
It is nothing personal, but I just don't feel you could understand anything about me.;
The ways of my people are not for outsiders to know. You'll have to be content with that.;
You'll have to tell me more eventually.;
That may be, but not today.;
Maybe we'll talk later.;
Very well.;
I saved you. I deserve respect.;
A life debt is the greatest respect. I just don't think you could understand anything about me.;
Have anything more to say about yourself, Zaalbar?;
I have said all I am going to. I will follow you as my life debt commands, but you are just another outsider to me.;
All right, let's see what I can do. I think I have enough parts for something. Just a moment.;
There you are. One grenade. Careful with it.;
So many things have changed on Kashyyyk. I'm not sure what my place is. I must learn more about you outsiders.;
When I know enough, I will understand how to best serve my people. I will travel with eyes open this time.;
But, I leave with good feelings. My father will do what is right until I can return. And I will, when my life-debt is paid.;
Chuundar has told me much about our failures here. I think learning how to really live elsewhere will help.;
And maybe... maybe I'll come back to fight... but not now.;
I know that it isn't my homeworld. That is all I care about. There is nothing here to interest me.;
I don't know much about the planets we visit, but... I suppose I should learn.;
When you ask someone else, I will listen as well.;
I have a little stowaway problem, actually.;
I cannot help you with that.;
Do you know anything about dealing with gizka?;
I know nothing of what you speak.;
Nothing. Never mind.;
Your actions disturb me. Among my kind, those who take pleasure in the suffering of others are considered dangerously unstable.;
Had I known you were so cruel, I might have thought twice before swearing my life-debt to you.;
I am proud to call you my friend, <FullName>. You have a noble and generous spirit.;
I know you. You're the Arbiter in the murder trial. Elassa was a friend of mine. If there's any justice in the galaxy, they'll feed Sunry to the firaxans.;NM26ABSITH11000_.mp3
Shouldn't you be preparing for the trial? What are you doing here?;NM26ABSITH11002_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;
You can ask - but I doubt you'll get many answers you'll like.;NM26ABSITH11011_.mp3
Do you know about the Sunry case?;
I know he'd already be tried, convicted and executed if the Selkath knew anything about justice! But the fish people are as weak as the Republic when it comes to such matters.;NM26ABSITH11013_.mp3
Is there anything else?;NM26ABSITH11015_.mp3
Why is the Republic hiring so many mercenaries?;
Who knows? Some scheming plot, no doubt. Hopefully the Selkath uncover it and ban the Republic from the planet.;NM26ABSITH11017_.mp3
Why have the Sith taken such an interest in the Selkath youth?;
I haven't the faintest clue as to what you're talking about.;NM26ABSITH11020_.mp3
I'll be going now.;
Go. Stay. Doesn't matter to me. If you want to, you can even wander up to the embassy gates. Heh. But don't expect to get inside.;NM26ABSITH11033_.mp3
I have business with the Sith.;
Ha! We know who we have business with. If you don't know how to get in, then we don't want anything to do with you. Now back off!;NM26ABSITH11023_.mp3
I have this passcard.;
If you have a pass, why are you bothering me with it? Just go in.;NM26ABSITH11025_.mp3
I know the pass code.;
Oh, really? You mean someone like you actually has some real purpose inside? Well, then, what is it?;NM26ABSITH11028_.mp3
Zeta 245698 Alpha.;
Hmph. Yes, well, I suppose you really do have some business here. Head on in.;NM26ABSITH11030_.mp3
I can't believe you let that murderer Sunry go free! If the Selkath are so neutral and unbiased, why can't the Sith find any justice on this planet?;NM26ABSITH11003_.mp3
But we Sith have long memories. Soon there will be a day of reckoning - very soon. So what are you doing here?;NM26ABSITH11005_.mp3
Allow me to thank you for helping put that killer Sunry in prison. Elassa was a friend of mine, and the thought of her murderer going free enraged me!;NM26ABSITH11006_.mp3
But thanks to you, justice was served. So what can I do for you?;NM26ABSITH11008_.mp3
Only people who have business with the Sith are allowed inside the Embassy.;NM26ABSITH11009_.mp3
I am not for hire. Perhaps the Mandalorian or the Echani can help you - though they lack the stomach for certain jobs.;NM26AAIRIM06000_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;
Ask whatever you wish - though you may find some of my answers distasteful.;NM26AAIRIM06002_.mp3
Why is the Republic hiring so many mercenaries?;
Perhaps you should ask them. The Republic prefers not to deal with my kind... though maybe they need an Iridorian to finish the job.;NM26AAIRIM06004_.mp3
The mercenaries they hire must be failing, as they are never heard from again. That is all I know. Is there more you wish to ask?;NM26AAIRIM06005_.mp3
Have you heard anything about young Selkath going missing?;
Perhaps - but my business with the Selkath is my own.;NM26AAIRIM06007_.mp3
[Force Persuade] But I am your friend. You want to tell me what's going on.;
[Success] An Iridorian has no friends! Though I feel a strange kinship with you - you do not seem like the others of this world. Even the Sith here do not understand our kind.;NM26AAIRIM06009_.mp3
The Sith sought to buy my loyalty with credits... as if wealth could somehow quench my burning bloodlust! They would have been better off hiring an Echani for the errands they had me running.;NM26AAIRIM06022_.mp3
What were you doing for the Sith?;
The task paid well, but was boring and beneath me. I was told to lure the Selkath youth to the Sith Embassy, nothing more. I lied, I threatened, I promised... and I brought the most promising youth of the fish people to the Sith.;NM26AAIRIM06024_.mp3
What then? What happened to the youths?;NM26AAIRIM06025_.mp3
And there I left them. To what purpose I neither know, nor care. Perhaps when the Sith learn I have betrayed their secret they will try to kill me. I would welcome the excitement.;NM26AAIRIM06026_.mp3
Sounds like a recruiting drive to me. We used to use it on planets we had conquered. Get 'em while they're young and impressionable.;NM26AAIRIM06063_.mp3
Is there more you would ask of me, human?;NM26AAIRIM06027_.mp3
Do you know about the murder of Elassa?;
On my world those too weak to defend themselves deserve to die. A murder is justified if you have the strength to kill your victim. Is there anything else you would know?;NM26AAIRIM06032_.mp3
I am seeking an ancient Star Map or some alien ruins.;
Manaan has no such things, unless the Selkath have them hidden away at the bottom of the ocean. Is there more you would know?;NM26AAIRIM06034_.mp3
I'll be going now.;
I am not surprised. There are few on this watery world who feel comfortable in my presence.;NM26AAIRIM06042_.mp3
Sounds like the Sith are trying to win this planet by corrupting the Selkath youth. Much more subtle than their usual methods.;NM26AAIRIM06064_.mp3
I bet they're twisting the minds of those Selkath youth, trying to trick them into joining the Sith!;NM26AAIRIM06065_.mp3
So you brought these youths to the Sith. And then what did you do to them?;NM26AAIRIM06061_.mp3
So you tricked these innocents into going to the Sith base. And then what did you do with them?;NM26AAIRIM06062_.mp3
Maybe the Selkath would be interested in your activities?;
I have no fear of the fish people or their laws. There is no evidence I have done anything wrong. You will not learn my business this way.;NM26AAIRIM06011_.mp3
How many credits would it take to make your business my business?;
This is the way of this water world, is it not? Pathetic creatures bargaining with credits for what they cannot seize through strength. My people are warriors, not snivelling merchants.;NM26AAIRIM06013_.mp3
But perhaps this world has made me soft. I will play this role, distasteful as it is. For 500 credits, I will tell you what you wish to know.;NM26AAIRIM06014_.mp3
Here are the credits. Tell me who hired you.;
I don't have that much.;
I humble myself to change information for mere credits, and you insult me with this game of offers and counter offers? On my home world such insult would result in death!;NM26AAIRIM06017_.mp3
I tire of this conversation and I tire of your company, human. In fact, I tire of this entire weakling world - the air reeks of sea salt and the fawning cowardice of the fish people!;NM26AAIRIM06030_.mp3
Make it 200 and we have a deal.;
[Persuade] Maybe I'll just gut you like a Selkath preparing an Orchana ray for lunch.;
[Success] You speak the blunt and brutal language of my people. We share the love of death and bloodshed. But we are a rare breed on this planet. Even the Sith here are as weak as the cowardly fish people.;NM26AAIRIM06021_.mp3
[Failure] Your threats are mere words, nothing more. Here on Manaan such bloodshed is not permitted - as I have been told time and time again.;NM26AAIRIM06028_.mp3
[Force Persuade] But we are not your enemies... we are your friends. Tell us what you know.;NM26AAIRIM06029_.mp3
I am of sterner stuff, human. I seek blood and death and my reward is the taste of my enemy's fear. Take your credits elsewhere... my price is too high for the likes of you.;NM26AAIRIM06019_.mp3
On second thought, I don't really want to talk to you.;
What do you have against the Echani and the Mandalorians?;
They lack the resolve to do what needs to be done. The Echani believe in a non-existent warrior code of honor, and the Mandalorians prize credits above bloodshed.;NM26AAIRIM06036_.mp3
But I am Iridorian. Honor comes from slaying your opponent, and the true reward of any job is the taste of your foe's dying blood on your tongue.;NM26AAIRIM06037_.mp3
A mercenary who's not for hire. That's strange.;
Why do you care? There are other mercenaries you can hire. Though I suggest you act quickly - the Republic seems to be in desperate need of mercenaries right now.;NM26AAIRIM06039_.mp3
Though not so desperate they have asked for my help as of yet. They prefer the simpering, submissive type - like the Mandalorian and the Echani.;NM26AAIRIM06040_.mp3
I'm not here to chat. I just finished a long shift at the military base and now I'm just looking to relax.;NM02AESITH30000_.mp3
Let me enjoy my drink in peace, and I won't have to run you in for questioning.;NM02AESITH30002_.mp3
If you're here to complain about the quarantine don't waste your breath. There's nothing I can do about it. I just follow the orders I'm given.;NM02AESITH30004_.mp3
What are you doing? Don't go in there! That door is for employees only!;NM02ACZELK11032_.mp3
What's going on here?;
The Sith governor said I could keep this medical facility open. I have the proper permits. Please... I don't want any trouble.;NM02ACZELK11000_.mp3
N-nothing. This... this isn't your concern. Just... just forget you saw anything, okay?;NM02ACZELK11034_.mp3
[Persuade] I'm a friend of the Republic. You can trust me.;
[Success] I guess... I guess I better tell you what's going on. I only hope the Sith don't find out what I've done.;NM02ACZELK11041_.mp3
Since the space battle overhead, people have been secretly bringing in these Republic soldiers who crash landed on the planet. I had to take them in. What choice did I have?;NM02ACZELK11002_.mp3
Their injuries are terrible, most won't survive. But at least I can make their last days more comfortable. And at least here they are hidden away from the Sith.;NM02ACZELK11004_.mp3
Well, for that you have my thanks. It's good to know that at least some of these men ended up in compassionate hands.;NM02ACZELK11006_.mp3
I hate to imagine what the Sith would do if they discovered these soldiers here. But since their initial questioning the Sith have not returned, so it may be my fears are unfounded.;NM02ACZELK11010_.mp3
Is there anything I can do to help?;
I'm afraid there is nothing more anyone can do for these soldiers. Now, if you'll excuse me I should return to the front in case anyone comes in needing medical attention.;NM02ACZELK11012_.mp3
Don't worry. Your secret is safe with me.;
Thank you for keeping my secret. I only wish there was more I could do, but medical science has only come so far.;NM02ACZELK11015_.mp3
It's going to cost you if you want me to keep this information secret.;
No, it's *not*. The Sith would torture these men, or worse. You're not threatening this man while I'm present.;NM02ACZELK11018_.mp3
Sorry, I was just making a bad joke. Your secret is safe with me.;
I don't take orders from you. Either Zelka pays up, or I tell the Sith.;
Fine, take these credits to seal your tongue, then leave this place. I don't want to have anything to do with a monster like you!;NM02ACZELK11024_.mp3
I understand some extra credits might help us in our mission, but I don't approve of your methods. Zelka's a good man... you shouldn't have done that.;NM02ACZELK11026_.mp3
You've got your credits, now please show yourself out. You are no longer welcome here.;NM02ACZELK11030_.mp3
I am outraged! I understand we might need credits to help us get off the planet, but that was unacceptable. In the future please try to remember that we are on the side of justice!;NM02ACZELK11028_.mp3
Don't be absurd. Indulge your darker impulses if you wish, but not at the cost of hurting helpless men. We will not betray this man.;NM02ACZELK11020_.mp3
What? You're threatening to turn me in? But... the Sith will torture these soldiers! They'll shut me down! They might even kill me! You can't really mean to turn me in!;NM02ACZELK11021_.mp3
Not my problem, doc. Hand over some credits or explain all this to the Sith!;
You have taken a great risk to care for these men. I wish we could aid you more, but you have my thanks.;NM02ACZELK11008_.mp3
[Persuade/Threat] Either tell me what's going on, or you can explain it to the Sith!;
[Success] What? No! Don't tell the Sith. Please. I... I can explain all this.;NM02ACZELK11036_.mp3
Hey... I recognize these men. They're Republic soldiers!;
You... you recognize these soldiers? But how? Unless... unless you're a friend of the Republic.;NM02ACZELK11039_.mp3
What... what do you want? Are you here to threaten me again? Well, it won't do you any good. I don't have anything left for you to steal. Can't you just leave me alone?;NM02ACZELK11043_.mp3
I need to see your inventory.;
Well, I did set this facility up to help those in need, so I suppose I can't really turn you away. Very well, you can see what I have in stock.;NM02ACZELK11045_.mp3
I need healing.;
"I guess I can't turn you away in good conscience. Very well, I will tend to your injuries; but then I expect you to leave my facility.";NM02ACZELK11048_.mp3
Fine, I'm going.;
I don't want any trouble, I'm just trying to keep my medical facility up and running. Please, just go away and let me do my job.;NM02ACZELK11051_.mp3
I see from your appearance that you are an off-worlder. Still, you are welcome here. I'll not have it said that Zelka Forn refused to help somebody just because they weren't a citizen of Taris.;NM02ACZELK11053_.mp3
Do you require healing or medical supplies? I can treat almost any injury or ailment right here at the medical facility, except the rakghoul disease, of course.;NM02ACZELK11055_.mp3
Rakghoul disease? What's that?;
The terrible affliction has plagued Taris for many generations. It is spread by the rakghouls, horrible monsters that live in the Undercity below Taris' great skyscrapers.;NM02ACZELK11057_.mp3
Prolonged exposure to the Undercity breeds the disease and those infected will eventually mutate into rakghouls themselves, becoming mindless beasts that feed on the flesh of others.;NM02ACZELK11059_.mp3
Is there no cure?;
There is no antidote for the disease, though I heard the Republic scientists at the military base here on Taris were close to perfecting a cure. Then the Sith arrived.;NM02ACZELK11061_.mp3
They overran the military base and now they refuse to allow anyone access to the laboratories inside. The Sith are keeping all the serum for the patrols they send into the Undercity.;NM02ACZELK11063_.mp3
If I could just get my hands on a sample of that serum the rakghoul disease could be wiped from the face of Taris forever. But I don't see how that's going to happen.;NM02ACZELK11065_.mp3
Maybe I could find a way to get my hands on that serum for you.;
I don't see how anyone could get their hands on the serum. The military base is crawling with Sith guards. Breaking in there would be a suicide mission.;NM02ACZELK11067_.mp3
I suppose the Sith patrols in the Undercity might have a sample of the serum on them, if they hadn't already used it because of a rakghoul infection.;NM02ACZELK11069_.mp3
But I doubt a patrol would just hand the serum over. And nobody's stupid enough to attack one of the Sith patrols, even in the Undercity.;NM02ACZELK11071_.mp3
I have the serum to cure the rakghoul disease.;
You have the serum? Impossible! How did you get this? No, wait... I don't really want to know.;NM02ACZELK11153_.mp3
Can... can I see it? The serum, I mean? I need to see if there is enough for me to analyze it so I can start producing it in mass quantities.;NM02ACZELK11155_.mp3
Here you go.;
Hmmm.... let me see... yes, this is it! A cure for the rakghoul disease! With this sample I can make enough serum for everyone!;NM02ACZELK11160_.mp3
The people of Taris owe you a debt they can never repay. Please, take this small reward. It isn't much, but it's all I can afford: a few credits and two spare medpacs.;NM02ACZELK11162_.mp3
Keep your reward, Zelka. You need it more than I do.;
You truly have a noble and generous spirit, but you deserve something for your effort. Tell you what, I'll give you a discount whenever you shop at my store. It's the least I can do.;NM02ACZELK11164_.mp3
That is very kind of you. We are just glad we were able to bring some relief to the suffering of these people.;NM02ACZELK11166_.mp3
Now, is there anything else I can do for you?;NM02ACZELK11168_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;
I am quite busy maintaining the facility, but I suppose I could spare a bit of time to answer some questions. What would you like to know?;NM02ACZELK11085_.mp3
Tell me about the rakghoul disease.;
How do you feel about the Sith?;
I know enough to be scared of them. I've heard about the brutality of the Sith. I know what they do to the planets they conquer.;NM02ACZELK11087_.mp3
So far all they've done is ask me some general questions, but I'm afraid they might one day decide to shut this facility down simply out of evil spite.;NM02ACZELK11089_.mp3
I guess there's not much I can do about the Sith, except hope that the Republic finds a way to stop their conquest of the entire galaxy.;NM02ACZELK11091_.mp3
I want to ask you something else.;
I could use some healing.;
It will just take me a moment while I examine your injuries, and then I'll administer the proper treatment.;NM02ACZELK11133_.mp3
Let me take a look at what you've got for sale.;
Of course. Just step over here and I'll show you what I have in stock. My prices are very reasonable, just what I need to keep this facility operating.;NM02ACZELK11136_.mp3
I'll be going now.;
Goodbye and good health to you. If you ever need any medical aid or treatment, you know where to find me.;NM02ACZELK11139_.mp3
I just want some general information about Taris.;
I don't know much, but I'll tell you what I can. Do you want to know about Upper Taris? Or are you more interested in Lower Taris and the Undercity?;NM02ACZELK11093_.mp3
Tell me about Upper Taris.;
The people here in the Upper City generally like to think they're better than the rest of Taris, but we're no better than anyone else.;NM02ACZELK11095_.mp3
The people here can be selfish, greedy, arrogant and even prejudiced. That's why aliens need special permission to leave the Lower City.;NM02ACZELK11097_.mp3
Maybe if more people in the Upper City weren't so self-centered things wouldn't be so bad in the Lower City and the Undercity.;NM02ACZELK11099_.mp3
Tell me about the Lower City.;
The Lower City has been overrun by swoop gangs and thugs. If you're going to travel down there you better go armed.;NM02ACZELK11101_.mp3
If you don't get attacked by one of the swoop gangs, you'll probably end up beaten and robbed by one of Davik's thugs! Soon it will be as bad as the Undercity.;NM02ACZELK11103_.mp3
What do you know about Davik?;
"Davik is the resident crime lord of Taris. He deals in stolen goods, he trades in slaves and contraband, and it would take a month to list all the people he's made ""disappear"".";NM02ACZELK11105_.mp3
His slimy grasp even reaches here into Upper Taris. Most of the shops pay him protection money so he'll leave them alone. Yeah, the man's nothing but a thug!;NM02ACZELK11107_.mp3
I guess I'm lucky. Since my medical facility doesn't make any profits Davik doesn't bother me. But if you ask me he's no better than the Sith!;NM02ACZELK11109_.mp3
Tell me about the Undercity.;
The Undercity is a wasteland crawling with flesh eating mutants called rakghouls. I feel sorry for the Outcasts that are forced to live there.;NM02ACZELK11111_.mp3
Outcasts?;
Justice here on Taris is swift and harsh. There are only two punishments - execution, or banishment to the Undercity.;NM02ACZELK11113_.mp3
Anyone banished can never return on pain of death. Even their descendants are forced to live in the depths beneath our great cities.;NM02ACZELK11115_.mp3
Whenever I can I send supplies to the Undercity to help ease the misery of their lives, although there is nothing I can do to help those infected with the rakghoul disease.;NM02ACZELK11117_.mp3
Whenever I can I send supplies to the Undercity to help ease the misery of their lives - food, medpacs and serum to cure the rakghoul disease, mostly.;NM02ACZELK11118_.mp3
Do you know anything about the Republic escape pods that crashed in the Undercity?;
All I know is what I was told by the people who brought these Republic soldiers here for treatment. They found the wreckage of two escape pods down in the Undercity.;NM02ACZELK11121_.mp3
Republic escape pods? Uh... no... why would you ask me that? I don't know. Those pods crashed in the Undercity. I'm not involved in any way!;NM02ACZELK11122_.mp3
You seem awfully defensive about this.;
I'm not defensive! I just don't like being accused of knowing something about those Republic pods. This is as bad as an interrogation by the Sith!;NM02ACZELK11124_.mp3
[Persuade] Don't worry, I'm not with the Sith. I won't betray your secret if you tell me.;
[Success] Well, you don't look like you're with the Sith. I guess... I guess I can tell you my secret. Or rather, I can show you.;NM02ACZELK11126_.mp3
[Failure] The Sith were already here, asking these same questions. I'll tell you what I told them. I don't know anything about those pods. Now, is there something else you need?;NM02ACZELK11128_.mp3
[Persuade] If you know something, you better tell me - unless you'd rather talk to the Sith!;
[Success] There's no need to get the Sith involved! I guess... I guess I can tell you my secret. Or rather, I can show you.;NM02ACZELK11130_.mp3
Medical facility? Is this some kind of hospital?;
This is a hospital of sorts, though my resources are quite limited since the Sith quarantined the planet. I provide basic medical services to all citizens of and visitors to Taris.;NM02ACZELK11080_.mp3
I have extensive medical training, and even with the lack of resources I can treat most injuries or ailments right here at the center - except for the rakghoul disease, of course.;NM02ACZELK11082_.mp3
Thank you, Zelka. That would be fine.;
I appreciate everything you've done. There are many who would have sold the serum to the crime lord Davik for a much higher sum.;NM02ACZELK11170_.mp3
[Persuade] Are you sure you couldn't spare a little something extra?;
[Success] I suppose I could give you a discount here at my shop, in addition to the credits and medpacs. Other than that there is really nothing else I can offer.;NM02ACZELK11174_.mp3
[Failure] I'm sorry, but all my credits are spent trying to keep this medical facility operating. I can't spare anymore.;NM02ACZELK11176_.mp3
You better come up with something extra or I'll put a smoking blaster hole right between your eyes!;
You're threatening me? I... I don't want this to become violent. Look, here's an extra fifty credits. That's all I have, I swear!;NM02ACZELK11178_.mp3
You mention this to anyone and you're a dead man!;
I won't tell anyone. I promise. Now please, just leave me alone.;NM02ACZELK11180_.mp3
That was unworthy of you. Zelka has the serum, certainly, but only because of your extortion. Were the few extra credits truly worth it?;NM02ACZELK11182_.mp3
So you twisted a few extra credits out of him. Hope it was worth it.;NM02ACZELK11184_.mp3
Hand it over. And don't mention this to anyone!;
[Persuade] That's it? After all the trouble I went to?;
Hold on. What about my reward?;
I'm not a wealthy man. All I can offer is a handful of credits and a few extra medpacs.;NM02ACZELK11158_.mp3
Fine, take the serum.;
I think I should find another buyer who'll pay more.;
"The only other buyer would be the crime lord Davik; but he would charge exorbitant fees for the serum if he got his hands on it! Nobody would be able to afford a cure!";NM02ACZELK11188_.mp3
Consider giving the serum to this man... surely we do not have such a dire need for credits that you would prize them over mercy?;NM02ACZELK11190_.mp3
Please, if you have any compassion at all you'll give the serum to me and not to Davik. Don't let him get a monopoly on this cure.;NM02ACZELK11192_.mp3
Forget it - I'm going to see Davik.;
Then I guess there's nothing I can do to stop you. I only hope you'll change your mind later on.;NM02ACZELK11194_.mp3
Don't worry, Zelka - I'll get that serum for you!;
Please don't say that! If the Sith hear you they might think I'm suggesting you start attacking their patrols. They could shut me down!;NM02ACZELK11073_.mp3
I only mentioned the serum because you asked. I don't actually expect anyone to get me the serum. Now, is there anything else I can do for you?;NM02ACZELK11075_.mp3
I might be able to help you out... for a price.;
I couldn't afford to give you more than a few medpacs and a handful of credits. The medical center can barely afford to stay open as it is. But it hardly matters, anyway.;NM02ACZELK11077_.mp3
Welcome to my medical facility. Do you require healing or treatment? I can treat almost any ailment right here at the facility.;NM02ACZELK11141_.mp3
I even have supplies of the rakghoul serum in my inventory, as I have already told you. So what do you need?;NM02ACZELK11143_.mp3
I even have a cure for the rakghoul disease now, thanks to you. With the sample you've brought me I've been able to extract hundreds of vials that will cure the horrible affliction.;NM02ACZELK11144_.mp3
Of course I sell them at a very reasonable price. Just enough to cover the cost of processing the sample.;NM02ACZELK11146_.mp3
I can even provide a cure for the rakghoul disease, though it is very expensive. Davik has a monopoly on the antidote, and he's selling the serum for a ridiculous fee.;NM02ACZELK11147_.mp3
Davik's doing everything he can to protect his monopoly. All the samples he provides are treated, making it impossible to analyze their composition and create my own stores of the serum.;NM02ACZELK11149_.mp3
Welcome back. Are you in need of healing or medical supplies? I can treat you right here at the center for almost any condition, except the rakghoul disease, of course.;NM02ACZELK11150_.mp3
What is this place again?;
I have to stop talking to Sith... they make me want to break so many laws just to pound the smirk off their faces!;NM26ACREPS33000_.mp3
With the secrets of the Temple in our grasp, we can at last complete our conquest of the world!;
The Elders have held us up here long enough. Now, with your help, we can at last break this stalemate.;
The war against the Elders will soon be over with you on our side.;
When we have defeated the Elders, then at last can we leave this cursed island.;
Hold it right there - who are you and what is your business with Gadon?;NM11AAZAER09000_.mp3
Calm down, Zaerdra. Nobody is going to try anything here in the middle of our own base. It would be a suicide mission.;NM11AAZAER09002_.mp3
You're too trusting, Gadon. Brejik and his Vulkars want you dead. Anyone we don't know is a potential threat, and it's my job to make sure you're safe!;NM11AAZAER09004_.mp3
Do you want us to start attacking strangers on sight, Zaerdra - like the Vulkars do? I will never let it come to that! Now step aside and let them pass.;NM11AAZAER09006_.mp3
As you wish.;NM11AAZAER09008_.mp3
"You can speak to Gadon if you want, but I've got my eye on you! You try anything and you'll be vaporized before you can say ""Vulkar spy""!";NM11AAZAER09041_.mp3
On behalf of Gadon, I want to offer the thanks of all the Hidden Beks. You rode like a true champion in the swoop race.;NM11AAZAER09020_.mp3
I'm sorry Gadon can't be here to thank you in person, but he has retired to the safety of his private chambers. I'm afraid he's grieving over Brejik's death.;NM11AAZAER09022_.mp3
But Brejik betrayed him!;
Even so, I think Gadon hoped that somehow Brejik could be made to realize the error of his ways. Despite everything he had done, Gadon probably would have forgiven him.;NM11AAZAER09024_.mp3
Gadon always was too soft on Brejik. I just wish I'd been there when that scum got what was coming to him!;NM11AAZAER09026_.mp3
Brejik violated the customs and traditions of Taris. He dishonored himself by refusing to honor his wager. He got what he deserved - even Gadon has to realize that.;NM11AAZAER09028_.mp3
Gadon sounds like the kind of person who you'd want in charge down here. At least to me.;NM11AAZAER09030_.mp3
But he isn't out of danger yet. The survivng Vulkars will still want him dead. He's a prime target now - as are you. You better be careful out on the streets.;NM11AAZAER09032_.mp3
I hope Gadon doesn't blame me for Brejik's death.;
Gadon can't speak to you right now. Brejik's put a price on his head, so I ordered him to stay in his private chambers until we find the assassin.;NM11AAZAER09010_.mp3
I've got the prototype accelerator to give him.;
You have the accelerator? This is excellent news! I'll send for Gadon right way!;NM11AAZAER09012_.mp3
If I see anything suspicious I'll let you know.;
Yes. Good. The more people who keep an eye out, the better we'll catch this assassin in time.;NM11AAZAER09015_.mp3
I'm the assassin - time to die!;
I knew we couldn't trust you!;NM11AAZAER09018_.mp3
It's Zaerdra here. I hope you're reading me. Your swoop run is about to begin. Remember: just hold on tight and try not to smash into anything.;NM11AAZAER09043_.mp3
"The prototype accelerator should last about 60 seconds before it overheats and explodes; that should be enough time for you to finish your run. Good luck, the Beks are counting on you!";NM11AAZAER09045_.mp3
I can't talk now. I have to get this kolto loaded up before my shift is over.;NM26ACREPK10000_.mp3
If you got a problem go talk to our diplomatic representative. Don't bother me with it.;NM26ACREPK10002_.mp3
People are saying the Republic did something to cripple the kolto production here on Manaan, but I don't believe it. Sounds more like something the Sith would do.;NM26ACREPK10004_.mp3
Hello there, I... it's you! I remember you! You're the one that gave me the credits to leave Tatooine! I could never forget your face.;NM13AAZZSH24000_.mp3
Thank you so much for what you did. Here on Dantooine, we've got a chance.;NM13AAZZSH24001_.mp3
Sharina, wasn't it? What will you do here?;
Well, I may be able to get hired as a servant for one of the influential families here. I haven't yet, but I'm sure I will.;NM13AAZZSH24003_.mp3
At least there's hope here. Tatooine was just dying, all of it.;NM13AAZZSH24004_.mp3
Where are your children?;
I found a small apartment for now. They're resting now. They're still getting used to the new surroundings.;NM13AAZZSH24006_.mp3
Once I'm working I'll see about getting them into school. There are opportunities here they would have never had on Tatooine.;NM13AAZZSH24007_.mp3
I'm glad I could help.;
Thank you. I won't trouble you any more, but... thank you.;NM13AAZZSH24009_.mp3
Yes, yes, I have to go.;
Er... all right then. But thank you again. I couldn't have made it here without you.;NM13AAZZSH24011_.mp3
Thank you again. We've got a chance now, and it's all because of you.;NM13AAZZSH24012_.mp3
You've helped so much. It's good that I can tell my children that there are nice people in the galaxy.;NM13AAZZSH24013_.mp3
I wish Ward could have come here with us. I miss him.;NM13AAZZSH24014_.mp3
It's so different here, so alive. I can't remember seeing green on Tatooine;NM13AAZZSH24015_.mp3
Ithorak is waiting for you inside the hangar. As you probably know, there are no security cameras there: the better to conduct our business away from prying eyes.;
However, before we go in I'll point out this rather large assault droid standing beside me. I and the droid will both accompany you in to see Ithorak, just to make sure there is no trouble.;
My business with Ithorak is private.;
Ithorak is an important man with access to the rich and powerful. He is not about to let himself become an easy target for a kidnapping or an assassination.;
When you meet Ithorak, I and the droid will both be there. It is my job to protect my employer, and I intend to do that regardless of my personal feelings toward him.;
Personal feelings? Do you mean you don't like Ithorak?;
Ithorak can be as tempermental as his clients. Combine that with his arrogance and the way he treats his underlings and you can understand why I might soon consider seeking other employment.;
But despite all Ithorak's faults, he does pay well. So I serve my employer faithfully, for now.;
[Persuade] What if I gave you 500 credits *not* to protect him?;
[Success] 500 credits to betray Ithorak? 500 credits to abandon the man who insults and belittles me on a daily basis? How could I refuse such a generous offer?;
Ithorak never appreciated me while I was around, so let's see how he likes dealing with you alone! But before I go, one last warning, human.;
Whatever your plan for Ithorak is, be careful. I've always suspected he was more than just a simple merchant. I've heard people who cross him are rarely heard from again.;
I don't want to risk his vengeance, so I'm going to disappear for a long while. Just in case Ithorak gets the better of you in this, you understand. Goodbye, human... and good luck.;
[Force Persuade] You should quit on him right now. Leave and find another job.;
[Success] You're... you're right. He's never treated me with the respect I deserve. Yelling at me, insulting me, belittling me. I don't know why I stayed with him as long as I did!;
Okay, let's go in and see Ithorak.;
Excellent. Follow me.;
Greetings, human. I am Ithorak. Vek tells me you represent a wealthy buyer, and I am always interested in new clients. So tell me, who do you represent?;
My buyer wishes to remain anonymous.;
Oh? I don't like not knowing who I'm working for, but exceptions can sometimes be made.  Well, if you won't reveal your patron, at least tell me what pieces of art they're interested in.;
Nothing specific. I'm just browsing on behalf of my patron.;
"One does not ""browse"" the types of items I deal in! You may have fooled my moron of a security advisor, but you don't fool me! You're an assassin!";
Vek, you idiot! What kind of security advisor are you? You lead this assassin right to me!;
I... I'm sorry, Ithorak. I just thought...;
Shut up, Vek! Just do your job and kill them!;
Uh... I represent the Organa family from Alderaan.;
I happen to know the art acquisitions agent working on behalf of the Organa family quite well, and you are definitly not her! Vek may be a blind fool, but I know an assassin when I see one!;
I'm just here to kill you, Ithorak!;
You don't need to do that. I won't cause any trouble.;
*hushed* You, Jedi! I hear you are investigating the Sunry murder trial, are you not? Hmm. This case is not at all that it appears to be. Many currents, might I say, flow beneath the surface.;NM26ACMMAN05000_.mp3
What do you mean?;
This murder is much more complicated than it may first appear. Sunry and Elassa are proxies for their governments and both sides want the other to fail.;NM26ACMMAN05002_.mp3
You can see the journey, heh, by the footprints. You understand, yes?;NM26ACMMAN05004_.mp3
Um... I think so... kinda...;
Hmm, dear dear. I'm saying they both had something to do with it! They've both kept their hands in this from the start!;NM26ACMMAN05006_.mp3
If you want to get to the bottom of this murder, you might seek information from both the Sith and the Republic, likely in their Embassies.;NM26ACMMAN05008_.mp3
They'd just give it to me?;
No, of course not! You think state secrets are for sale on the common market?;NM26ACMMAN05010_.mp3
You would have to be, heh, devious to get what you want.;NM26ACMMAN05012_.mp3
Heed my advice, Jedi, and you may yet find the truths in this murder.;NM26ACMMAN05022_.mp3
Why should I believe you?;
Because you have no one else to trust? Not Sunry, not the witnesses, and certainly not the judges!;NM26ACMMAN05015_.mp3
And if you take my advice, what have you to lose?;NM26ACMMAN05017_.mp3
I've heard enough of you!;
And I've been seen speaking to you for far too long.;NM26ACMMAN05020_.mp3
Huh?;
You're talking crazy talk.;
Why are you telling me this?;
Let us just say that I am an interested party, and that I have, heh heh... concerns.;NM26ACMMAN05027_.mp3
I don't have time for this!;
Oh, but I think that you do!;NM26ACMMAN05030_.mp3
Greetings, student.;
I'm no student. I'm Darth Revan!;
I have heard you have gained much prestige, student. Why you would want to throw it away by making ridiculous claims is beyond me.;
The Sith aren't big on such jokes, human. You would do well to remember that. Now, if your sorry attempt at humor is over, is there anything else you need?;
Who are you?;
My name is Adrenas. I am the chamberlain of the academy... generally I look after maintenance and supply, here.;
Master Uthar gave me this datapad for you.;
He did? Allow me to see that for a moment...;
Ah, yes, I see. I will do as Master Uthar requests, of course. Thank you for bringing this to me.;
So you aren't a Sith?;
No, not truly. I serve the Sith, but I do not study and train in the Force as you do.;
Can I ask you some questions?;
I am sure there is nothing I can help you with. I am only a servant to the academy.;
How come you don't speak Galactic Basic?;
Galactic Basic is the language of the Republic, but I come from a world beyond the edges of Republic space. There the Twi'lek language of interstellar trade and commerce is the most common dialect.;
I can speak your language, but my accent is still very pronounced. Some at the Academy would mock me for this, and I am not eager to become the subject of ridicule.;
There are many humans here who come from worlds beyond Republic space. We seem to be more sympathetic to the Sith cause. Some of them are even training at the Academy, unlike me.;
I have to go.;
May the Force serve you well.;
If you wish. Good luck with your training.;
You are one of the hopefuls who look to gain prestige, yes? I am afraid there is little that I could help you with.;
I am sure you would prefer to speak to one of the students, here, or perhaps the trainers.;
Darth Revan? Remarkable, considering Lord Revan was killed. If this is a joke, student, it is one I do not understand at all.;
Bendak Starkiller's dead! I don't believe it! Bendak never loses... that was an amazing duel! Best duel I've ever seen!;NM02AEDUEL12000_.mp3
Glad you enjoyed it. Now where's my share of the purse?;
You've done well, Stranger. I'm pleased. Very pleased. Here are your credits. Plus, I'll give you Bendak's blaster pistol as bonus as a sign of my appreciation.;NM02AEDUEL12002_.mp3
Thank you Ajuur. That's very generous of you.;
Everyone will be talking about you now, Stranger. They're all going to know you were the one who killed Bendak Starkiller. You're famous now.;NM02AEDUEL12004_.mp3
[Persuade] I think I deserve a little extra for putting my life on the line.;
[Success] Very well, Stranger. I like you, and this was a special fight. Biggest purse I've ever handled! I'll give you a little bonus this one time only.;
[Failure] I always pay my debts, but if you get more then all the duelists will want more. We had a deal - ten percent. I expect you to honor it.;
Okay, I'll take the ten percent.;
Pay up, you overgrown slug, or I'll tell people you went back on our deal! Your reputation will be ruined!;
You'd lie about me? Maybe it would have been better if Bendak had killed you in that ring. But you're still alive, and I can't afford to have a new legend disparaging my reputation.;
"Okay, you win. Here's another 200 credits... more than fair. Now don't be accusing me of not paying my fighters; I've got a reputation to protect!";
I know, I know - I'm a living legend. Now, what about my cut?;
Cut the flattery - just get to my credits.;
I've heard the news, Mysterious Stranger. You and Bendak are planning a death match. This is excellent news... people will bet a fortune on this fight!;NM02AEDUEL12014_.mp3
Not too many people want to fight a death match anymore. Some are scared, others think it's wrong to kill someone else for credits. I guess that's why they're illegal now.;
Maybe it is wrong to take a life just for credits.;
What? What are you talking about? No, no, no. I was just making idle chatter, it doesn't mean anything! Bendak is an evil, evil man. Killing him would be a good thing.;
You're right - let's do this!;
This fight is different than most, of course. We'll turn off the energy suppressor, so weapons won't be limited - they can kill. Anything goes. So, you ready to fight this match now?;
I'm ready!;
Good. Excellent. High wagering means lots of credits for the winner on this match. Come see me after the fight to collect your credits - if you're still alive.;
I'm not ready yet.;
You're not ready? What are you waiting for? Are you scared? Look, don't worry about it. I'll wait. You just come back when you're ready to fight.;
Sounds like your just trying to rationalize this. I need to think this over.;
Why don't you think this over? Think about all those credits you'll get if you kill Bendak. Then come back and talk to me. I'm confident you'll want to step into the ring.;
Let's get on with the match!;
But why are you here now? A death match takes time to get ready. I have to bribe officials so they don't break it up. You might as well leave the cantina for now and come back later.;
Congratulations, Mysterious Stranger. You're the new duel champion. Twitch had a good run, but you took him down! Here's the purse for beating Twitch.;
The bad news is that I don't have anyone left who wants to fight you - you're too good for your own good. Nobody wants to go in the ring with you.;
The only one who'd fight you was Bendak Starkiller, but you killed him. Now I'll never find anyone to fight you. I'm sorry to say, but your dueling career is over, Stranger.;NM02AEDUEL12030_.mp3
The only one left who'll fight you is Bendak Starkiller, but he's retired. Too bad. People would pay a fortune to see you fight Bendak.;NM02AEDUEL12031_.mp3
Mysterious Stranger - why are you here? I don't have anyone who wants to fight you - you're too good for your own good. Nobody wants to go in the ring with you.;
Good fight, good fight. People like you, Mysterious Stranger. They bet a lot when you fight. It makes me happy... and rich.;
Too bad you lost, though. I don't pay you for losing. But I'll give you a rematch if you want one. What do you say?;
Give me a rematch.;
Yes - rematch! People always bet lots on a rematch! And who knows, Stranger... maybe you'll even win this time.;
No - not right now.;
I hope you're not giving up, Stranger. You lost this time, but maybe next time you'll win. You come speak to me if you ever want a rematch.;
I always pay my debts. You won, so you get paid. Ten percent of the purse - that was the deal. Here's your credits. You come see me when you're ready to fight again.;
I'm sorry, human - the betting window's closed. No more fights right now. People are sick of seeing the same duelists all the time. It's bad for business. Unless...;
My name is Ajuur. I organize all the duels here. We need a new face in the dueling game, human. Maybe you want step into the duel ring? It can be a highly profitable venture.;NM02AEDUEL12040_.mp3
What are you talking about?;
I can arrange for you to fight in the duel ring. If you win, you get the standard contract: 10% of all wagers. And don't worry, nobody dies in the duel ring anymore. Death matches are illegal now.;
Most fighters in the duel ring use vibroblades or stun sticks because the ring's pretty small, but a few of the duelists use blasters. Use whichever you prefer.;
Vibroblades and blasters? And nobody ever dies? How come I get the feeling you're trying to take us for a ride?;NM02AEDUEL12121_.mp3
The duel ring has energy suppressor fields to make sure nobody dies. Weapons are limited so they hurt, but don't kill. And we've got a medic droid in case of serious injuries. Are you interested?;
Okay, I'll do it.;
Good - new blood for the ring! But you need a nickname, like Ice or Deadeye or Twitch. Good nicknames make people bet more. Hmmm... what's a good name for you?;
You're an off-worlder. You're new here, people won't recognize you... I know! From now on in the duel ring you'll be the Mysterious Stranger!;
The Mysterious Stranger. I like it.;
The Mysterious Stranger is a perfect name for you. You've got no past, no history... it makes you seem like you have some big, dark secret. People like that. Makes them bet more.;
This is for the best. We could use the credits from these duels, but using your real name is too risky. The Sith might have come across a crew manifest back on the Endar Spire.;NM02AEDUEL12122_.mp3
You ready for a duel now? You want step into the ring right away? I'll set you up with Deadeye Duncan to start. I'll tell you the rules if you're ready.;
I'm ready for a duel.;
You lost last time, but maybe this time fortune will smile on you. I'll give you a you rematch and a chance to redeem yourself.;
Let's do it.;
I've changed my mind.;
You say you're ready, then you change your mind? Is this a joke to you? I don't have time for jokes - they don't make me any money! Come back when you'r ready to fight.;
Yes! You fight and people bet and I make money! It's all good. Only one rule - nobody dies. Your opponent goes down, you don't finish them off. Death matches are illegal now.;
You new at this, so I'll start you off easy. You get to fight Deadeye Duncan. Are you ready to go into the ring now?;
You handled Duncan pretty well. I think you're ready to fight Gerlon Two-Fingers. Just remember - Gerlon uses blasters in the ring sometimes. You ready to step into the arena?;
I think you're ready to go against Ice, human. She's tough, but so are you. There'll be lots action on this fight... a huge purse! You ready?;
You've got a real talent for this game, Stranger. I think it's time you fought Marl. He's getting up there in years, but he's still very, very good. He used to be the duel champion.;
You've beaten almost everyone, human. I think you ready to fight Twitch. Twitch might be crazy, but he's the best in the game. If you can beat him, you'll be the new champion.;
I'm not ready for the match yet.;
Not ready? You look ready to me! Why are you here if you don't want to fight? You don't get paid if you don't fight! Come on... are you sure you don't want to step into the ring?;
I want to ask you some questions.;
Questions? Bah - I don't have time for questions. They don't make me any credits! I want you to fight, not to ask questions. So, are you ready to step into the ring?;
Goodbye.;
I have big plans for you next match, tiny human. You come back when you want to fight.;
That's a terrible name!;
Bah - what do you know about nicknames? I've been giving names for twenty years! Mysterious Stranger - that's your name now.;
My name is <FullName>. I think that sounds better than a nickname.;
[Persuade] I'll do it, but I want more than ten percent.;
[Failure] Ha-ha-ha! You're joking, right? If I pay you more, then everyone wants more.;
No, you get the same as all the others - ten percent. That's my final offer.;
Sorry, I'm not interested.;
Don't pass this opportunity up, human. You fight for me and I'll make you rich. If you change your mind you come back and talk to me again.;
I might be interested - what's in this for me?;
I just want to ask you some questions.;
Questions? Bah - questions don't make me money! But if you want to fight, it would could be very profitable for both of us. You interested?;
Ah, Mysterious Stranger... I knew you'd be back. They all come back.;
You fought well last time. People like you, Stranger. They bet lots on your last fight. They'll be more on your next fight. You get ten percent, same as always.;
You want to step into the ring now? Are you ready to prove yourself against the best duelists on Taris?;
"You want to set up another fight, right? The ring is in your blood now, like a virus. You need to hear the cheers of the crowd; you need the rush of battle... you need to fight again.";
"My latest find; my new rising star. We make good team. I'm making money, you're getting famous... it's all good.";
You're getting quite the reputation, Stranger. Everyone's excited, they all want to bet on your next match. I'm excited, too... more bets means more credits for me!;
You've come for a duel, right? I can set up a match and we'll make some money, yes? You get ten percent of the purse if you win.;
You're back, human. Does this mean you want to step into the duel ring? It could be very profitable for both of us. Ask around - everyone knows Ajuur treats his fighters well.;
Greetings once again. I trust you have been discrete concerning the events at the Hrakert Rift.;NM26ACREPD07055_.mp3
Should the Selkath obtain proof of what occured down there the consequences for the Republic would be severe. For both our sakes, I hope you are smart enough to keep silent on this matter.;NM26ACREPD07056_.mp3
Truth be told, I am uncomfortable even with us being seen together. The rumors are already plentiful enough among the Selkath about the Republic's role in this.;NM26ACREPD07057_.mp3
I have some questions about Ahto city.;
A beautiful place, Ahto city - a paradise on the water. But remember, within the city itself the Selkath have absolute authority. They are a tough race, but fair.;NM26ACREPD07007_.mp3
Obey the Selkath laws, keep the peace and you should encounter no problems. I assume you received a visitor guide to the city when you docked your ship.;NM26ACREPD07008_.mp3
I regret there is little I can tell you that is not in the visitor guide, my good Jedi. My duties rarely permit me to venture beyond the walls of the Republic Embassy.;NM26ACREPD07009_.mp3
Why are your soldiers loading so much kolto?;
Kolto is a precious resource - it's healing powers are near miraculous. During times of war, kolto becomes even more valuable.;NM26ACREPD07002_.mp3
As long as we have the permits, we will continue to harvest kolto and ship it to our Republic soldiers battling against the Sith. Of course, the Sith enjoy the very same privileges.;NM26ACREPD07003_.mp3
If there was some way we could gain an edge over the Sith in our kolto supply...;NM26ACREPD07004_.mp3
But the Selkath are fiercely protective of their neutrality in this conflict. They do not want to grant either side an advantage.;NM26ACREPD07005_.mp3
I am on a mission from the Jedi Council, perhaps you can help me with it.;
Uh... of course, of course. I will do whatever I can. But I am only a simple diplomatic representative of the Republic. I doubt I can be of any use to the Jedi Council.;NM26ACREPD07011_.mp3
I seek a Star Map, the remnant of an ancient and forgotten race.;
An ancient and forgotten race... and you think it may be here on Manaan? Hm...;NM26ACREPD07013_.mp3
You know something?;
Well... perhaps. But if you want to get information about that, you'll have to do something for me first.;NM26ACREPD07015_.mp3
What do you want me to do?;
We were using a submersible reconnaissance droid in the ocean surrounding Ahto City and it was... damaged. It took a data recording of the outside of the city before being driven off by the firaxan sharks.;NM26ACREPD07017_.mp3
But while it was returning to the surface it encountered difficulties and was disabled. Its automatic systems floated it to the surface, but we could not retrieve it in time.;NM26ACREPD07018_.mp3
The Sith were applying subtle pressure to the Selkath authorities for some reason we have not determined, and were able to delay us long enough that they could retrieve the droid before we did.;NM26ACREPD07019_.mp3
The droid's data centers are heavily encrypted, so it will take the Sith several days, we believe, to get to its data. It was captured 12 hours ago. It is imperative that we get it back!;NM26ACREPD07020_.mp3
Where is the droid?;
It is heavily guarded, we are sure, in the Sith Embassy here on Manaan. Since we have no remaining soldiers to spare, and certainly not our elite ones, we have no one capable of entering the Sith base and retrieving it.;NM26ACREPD07022_.mp3
That is what we would ask you to do.;NM26ACREPD07023_.mp3
How do I get in the Sith base?;
There are several leads we have been working on to get into the Sith base. Any of them should work for you, although it might be wise to concentrate your efforts on just one.;NM26ACREPD07067_.mp3
The first method that's possible is to help us interrogate a Sith prisoner we managed to catch after he tried to infiltrate our base. He is being held just inside our enclave.;NM26ACREPD07068_.mp3
We think he may be able to give us the passcode that the Sith give their informers to enter the base.;NM26ACREPD07069_.mp3
He has proved most resilient so far...;NM26ACREPD07070_.mp3
Interrogating the prisoner sounds good.;
Good. It's a logical place to start. But you should also hear about the other options available to you.;NM26ACREPD07072_.mp3
We managed to pick up a crate of blank Sith data cards the type they use for passcards.;NM26ACREPD07074_.mp3
The encryption system to unlock them is very difficult however, but if you are more skilled than our technicians, you may be able to gain access that way.;NM26ACREPD07075_.mp3
Decrypting the passcard sounds good.;
Good. It is a very intelligent and skilled individual who can crack the matrices of a Sith encryption system.;NM26ACREPD07077_.mp3
But there is one last method you should know about in case all other options fail.;NM26ACREPD07078_.mp3
The Sith have got the Selkath to give them exclusive use of one of the main hangar bays.;NM26ACREPD07080_.mp3
Visiting Sith masters use this bay to land, then take a speeder over the water to an external entrance to the Sith enclave.;NM26ACREPD07081_.mp3
The luckless spy we mentioned earlier had a passcard to that hangar on him. While it is surely well guarded, it may prove to be the most direct route. Here is the card.;NM26ACREPD07082_.mp3
The Sith base itself is very heavily guarded. If they became aware of your presence, I fear you would be quickly outnumbered and killed.;NM26ACREPD07083_.mp3
Here is a passcard to get you inside our facility. You should find all you need to get started in there.;NM26ACREPD07084_.mp3
You can choose whichever of the methods you want as long as you get in the base and get the data recording back. Which method do you think you would like to try first?;NM26ACREPD07085_.mp3
I think I'll interrogate the prisoner.;
Good call, just make sure you don't push him too hard or we might lose him.;NM26ACREPD07087_.mp3
I wish you luck in your task. Should you retrieve the data recording from the droid, return it here to me and we can see about getting you that information.;NM26ACREPD07088_.mp3
I think I'll decrypt the passcard.;
Good choice. We've been working at that for a while, but it's been too difficult so far. Maybe you'll have better luck.;NM26ACREPD07090_.mp3
I think I'll raid the landing bay.;
You'll need luck for that one - odds are they have some pretty strong guards in there. But it's also the way most likely to succeed.;NM26ACREPD07092_.mp3
Is there another way?;
Can I get back to you on this?;
If you want to find information about ancient ruins or your 'Star Map' or whatever it is, I think this is your best choice.;NM26ACREPD07027_.mp3
But you will have time to consider your options. And when you come to the only conclusion possible, I will be here to tell you how we can work together.;NM26ACREPD07028_.mp3
I do not want to get involved.;
I'm not your errand runner!;
But you need our information, and I guarantee you that you will never be able to get it unless we have our secrecy guaranteed against the Sith.;NM26ACREPD07031_.mp3
What is this recording?;
It's intelligence information about Sith activities on Manaan, as well as some oceanographic reports on the local marine life.;NM26ACREPD07033_.mp3
[Persuade] Come on, tell me.;
[Failure] No, no. You do what I want and maybe I can help you out. Until then: nothing.;NM26ACREPD07035_.mp3
[Force Persuade] You want to tell me.;
[Failure] Don't think you can manipulate me, Jedi! The Republic Diplomatic Corps has to deal with the Sith all the time, so we are very resistant to mental influence.;NM26ACREPD07037_.mp3
Your only real choice is to help me, so I can help you.;NM26ACREPD07038_.mp3
I think I'll be going now.;
Then I shall wish you good day. On behalf of the Republic, I hope you enjoy your time here on Manaan.;NM26ACREPD07054_.mp3
I'm investigating the Sunry case.;
I don't know much about the facts of the case, but I find it hard to believe. I never met Sunry, but he's a hero of the Republic - not a murderer.;NM26ACREPD07040_.mp3
The so called evidence against him is an obvious frame up - it has to be! The Sith must have plotted Sunry's downfall to embarass and discredit the Republic!;NM26ACREPD07041_.mp3
That's one possibility.;
If you want to solve this mess, I would focus on the Sith. That, or check out the murder scene at the hotel. Talk to the other guests - maybe they know something.;NM26ACREPD07043_.mp3
I regret I could not be of more assistance in your investigation. Is there anything else?;NM26ACREPD07044_.mp3
I found this recording in your computers.;
You mean you sliced into our... That is a very serious crime! We could have you executed for treason if that information caused any harm!;NM26ACREPD07050_.mp3
But... I may just be willing to overlook this transgression if you NEVER EVER TELL ANOTHER LIVING BEING ABOUT IT.;NM26ACREPD07051_.mp3
And that is all I will ever tell you on the matter.;NM26ACREPD07052_.mp3
Are you so sure it was the Sith?;
Who else? Sunry's conviction will be a blow to Republic-Selkath relations. Who would benefit from this other than the Sith?;NM26ACREPD07046_.mp3
Any chance the Republic is involved?;
The Republic? That makes no sense. Sunry has no enemies in the Republic, and his conviction will make all of our jobs more difficult.;NM26ACREPD07048_.mp3
Maybe a bribe would ensure my silence.;
Don't be foolish! If the Republic's role in this is discovered, I will be sure the blame rests on your shoulders as well. We share a secret - and we will share the consequences if the secret is revealed.;NM26ACREPD07059_.mp3
For both our sakes you should move on. Our conversation attracts undue attention.;NM26ACREPD07060_.mp3
You have returned! I was beginning to fear that you, too, might have been lost. Did you find out what had happened down there at the facility?;NM26ACREPD08000_.mp3
The Selkath went insane.;
Insane? What did they do? And why?;NM26ACREPD08002_.mp3
They killed almost everyone on the Station.;
They killed... everyone? And the mercenaries we sent later? That is... horrible. What caused them to all go insane at once like that?;NM26ACREPD08004_.mp3
Your construction woke something up.;
Something was down there? Living in the Rift by the kolto?;NM26ACREPD08006_.mp3
A gigantic firaxan shark that drove all the Selkath insane.;
That's... horrible. The entire operation wasted by a disaster we could never in a thousand years have foreseen.;NM26ACREPD08008_.mp3
What has happened to the facility itself? Were there any survivors?;NM26ACREPD08010_.mp3
A few scientists have survived.;
Well, that is good to know. Good to know indeed. But... What has happened to the facility? Was it damaged?;NM26ACREPD08012_.mp3
The harvesting machine was destroyed.;
No! That is terrible. That will set our work back years... *sigh* It may even cost us the war.;NM26ACREPD08014_.mp3
While I am glad that you were able to solve our problems, the cost may have ended up being much too high.;NM26ACREPD08016_.mp3
But you have done your job and helped us in our time of need, and for that I thank you.;NM26ACREPD08018_.mp3
Oh, and did you end up finding your Star Map?;NM26ACREPD08020_.mp3
Yes I did.;
As you can see, by helping us you helped yourself. Perhaps we can work together again in the future.;NM26ACREPD08022_.mp3
None of your business!;
I'll assume that means yes. As you can see, by helping us you helped yourself. Perhaps we can work together in the future.;NM26ACREPD08025_.mp3
The kolto seems to have been contaminated.;
Contaminated? That's... That's much worse than I would ever have thought possible. It might have been better to lose the entire facility rather than damage the kolto supply.;NM26ACREPD08028_.mp3
This must remain entirely secret. We cannot allow anyone to find out that we damaged the kolto production or we would be banned permanently from the planet.;NM26ACREPD08030_.mp3
We can only hope that the damage that was caused will go away in time.;NM26ACREPD08032_.mp3
I haven't finished my investigation.;
Please, continue your investigations and find out what happened to our facility.;NM26ACREPD08035_.mp3
When you are ready to explore the Hrakert Rift, enter the Republic base. In the kolto packing room there is a door leading to the Republic submarines.;NM26ACREPD07061_.mp3
The sub will have a course to the Hrakert Scientific Research facility charted in. It will take you to the Hrakert Rift.;NM26ACREPD07062_.mp3
I wish you luck on your quest. Hopefully a Jedi can succeed where so many others have failed.;NM26ACREPD07063_.mp3
Ah, you're back. Have you decided to assist us and, at the same time, yourself?;NM26ACREPD07064_.mp3
I'll get your recording for you.;
Good. I'm glad that you have come to accept the inevitable. Now we can really get down to work.;NM26ACREPD07066_.mp3
Not right now.;
Very well.;NM26ACREPD07094_.mp3
Quit bothering me, imbecile.;
There is no need to be so rude.;NM26ACREPD07096_.mp3
Have you managed to retrieve the data from our droid in the Sith base?;NM26ACREPD07097_.mp3
Yes, here it is.;
Excellent! It does not appear to have been tampered with, so the Sith did not manage to copy its contents yet.;NM26ACREPD07099_.mp3
And now for your information... We are not supposed to speak of this, but since you are a Jedi, and we have exhausted all the other options, I think I can entrust you with this.;NM26ACREPD07100_.mp3
As you know, the Republic is fighting for its very existence against the evil of the Sith Empire. As you also undoubtedly know, we are doing very poorly.;NM26ACREPD07101_.mp3
We need much in the way of supplies and material to stem the tide of battle and bring us victory.;NM26ACREPD07102_.mp3
Manaan is the sole source of kolto, the most powerful medical substance in the galaxy. Frankly, we need as much of it as we can get.;NM26ACREPD07103_.mp3
What has the Republic done?;
The Selkath conservatives with their neutrality treaties seek to treat the Sith and the Republic equally. This includes kolto exports.;NM26ACREPD07105_.mp3
But a few more far-sighted Selkath see that if the Sith are ever allowed to win, the galaxy will be plunged into darkness and there would be nothing to stop them from taking Manaan anyway.;NM26ACREPD07106_.mp3
So we made a deal...;NM26ACREPD07107_.mp3
What sort of deal?;
We recently began construction of a secret underground facility to harvest kolto directly at its source. We also hope to one day be able to synthesize it effectively.;NM26ACREPD07109_.mp3
Current techniques are insufficient for the task, so we must mine it for now. The amount we take would hardly be noticed, since most is lost naturally before it reaches the surface anyway.;NM26ACREPD07110_.mp3
We were nearing completion of the base when the digging teams reported some sort of obstruction... an ancient building or artifact. Possibly your 'Star Map'.;NM26ACREPD07111_.mp3
Transmissions from the base were cut off abruptly after that, and we haven't heard from the station since.;NM26ACREPD07112_.mp3
Why have you not investigated?;
As you may have noticed, we are hiring a lot of mercenaries around here. Ostensibly they're to be shipped off-world to aid in our fight against the Sith, but they are really for another purpose.;NM26ACREPD07114_.mp3
When we lost contact with the station in the Hrakert Rift, we sent our contingent of Republic soldiers down to investigate. None returned...;NM26ACREPD07115_.mp3
We have tried hiring mercenaries and sending them down as well, but none of those expeditions have returned either.;NM26ACREPD07116_.mp3
The reason we really sent that droid underwater - and the reason we needed its data back so badly - was to find out what had happened to the Hrakert Rift station.;NM26ACREPD07117_.mp3
But now that we have the data back, our operation is in no danger of exposure to the Sith. And now I must live up to my end of the bargain.;NM26ACREPD07118_.mp3
How will I get down there?;
I took the liberty of having a submarine prepared for your departure. Merely use this card to get past the door behind our kolto packing room and enter the sub therein.;NM26ACREPD07120_.mp3
It has been programmed to take you down to the station, and also to take you back up should you need something.;NM26ACREPD07121_.mp3
I would send soldiers to assist you, but we have lost many of ours, and nearly exhausted the mercenary population of this planet. The soldiers we have are barely enough to keep this base secure!;NM26ACREPD07122_.mp3
The Sith have also noted our interest and begun to bribe mercenaries away from us...;NM26ACREPD07123_.mp3
Please, find out what happened to the facility. There may be some survivors left down there, perhaps even the head scientist - Kono Nolan.;NM26ACREPD07124_.mp3
Good luck in your efforts.;NM26ACREPD07125_.mp3
What will you do for me?;
What happened down there?;
*Sigh* We don't know. We just don't know.;NM26ACREPD07128_.mp3
What does this have to do with me?;
Please, just let me explain.;NM26ACREPD07130_.mp3
You violated the treaty?!?;
Shhh! Not so loud! Yes, it is a technical violation of the treaty, but it is sanctioned by elements of the Selkath government. We need only keep it hidden from the Sith.;NM26ACREPD07132_.mp3
This is dangerous...;
I know... but to the senators, it seemed to outweigh the risks.;NM26ACREPD07134_.mp3
Yeah, yeah, get to the point.;
No I have not.;
Time is a critical factor. We cannot allow the Sith to decode that data recording or our operations on Manaan would be compromised.;NM26ACREPD07137_.mp3
Welcome to Manaan. I am Roland Wann. As the official representative of the Republic Embassy on this planet, I am here to help all citizens of the Republic should they require aid.;NM26ACREPD07000_.mp3

Wookiees settle down a lot once they're caged.;NM22AAXGCZ12000_.mp3
You know, every Czerka outpost is expected to double the number of Wookiees they take in the next year.;NM22AAXGCZ12001_.mp3
Hey, we just got word that shipments will be increasing. This Chuundar really knows how to do business.;NM22AAXGCZ12002_.mp3
Hey, business is better than ever. These animals will pay our way for years.;NM22AAXGCZ12003_.mp3
I hear the Wookiees seem to be cooperating even more than usual now. Czerka can pretty much do whatever it wants.;NM22AAXGCZ12004_.mp3
I heard the Wookiee leader is saying we can increase the number of slaves we take. I think Czerka will be here a long time.;NM22AAXGCZ12005_.mp3
You know, I hear Czerka has negotiated to increase its presence here by six more outposts.;NM22AAXGCZ12006_.mp3
Hey! Don't get too close to the cages. Even these cowed Wookiees will take your arm off if they get the chance.;NM22AAXGCZ12008_.mp3
Don't bother me, now. I've got twice as many Wookiees to process as usual.;NM22AAXGCZ12009_.mp3
Still around the starport, I see. Heading off, soon?;NM33AAMECH12000_.mp3
Who are you?;
Oh, nobody special. I just do the routine maintenance work for the ships that come in. I used to see the Hawk here all the time.;NM33AAMECH12004_.mp3
How do you know about the Ebon Hawk?;
Oh, I've seen this little ship before plenty of times. Used to make runs for the Exchange, didn't it? Korriban's nice and remote, the kind of place the Exchange likes.;NM33AAMECH12006_.mp3
I knew we'd run into some of Davik's old associates sooner or later. No matter where you go somebody's working for the Exchange!;NM33AAMECH12007_.mp3
You don't need to worry about me saying anything. I don't give a whit what you do with your ship. Smuggling's what the Hawk was made for, though.;NM33AAMECH12008_.mp3
Can I ask you some questions?;
You sure can.;NM33AAMECH12010_.mp3
What can you tell me about Korriban?;
Not much. It's a pretty barren planet, to tell the truth. Not of much interest to anyone. Unless you're a Sith, I guess... they seem to think this place is something special.;NM33AAMECH12012_.mp3
Why do the Sith think Korriban is special?;
Probably all them ruins they found on the surface. That's the reason they built their academy here, I guess, to dig all them ruins up.;NM33AAMECH12014_.mp3
There's a Sith academy here?;
There's people that come here from all over Sith space to try and join the academy. Most of them die, I hear. Pretty gruesome business, that.;NM33AAMECH12016_.mp3
How does someone get to the ruins?;
You don't. Not unless you're a Sith in the academy. They're the only ones allowed on the surface. They pay Czerka to ship things in and out, I guess, but that's all closely monitored.;NM33AAMECH12018_.mp3
So how does someone get into the academy?;
I don't know. There's all kinds of hopefuls in the colony trying to get in... why don't you ask one of them?;NM33AAMECH12020_.mp3
Have you ever heard of a Star Map?;
A Star Map? You mean like a navigation chart?;NM33AAMECH12022_.mp3
Yes, but much older. Perhaps in the ruins?;
If them Sith found a Star Map in those ruins, nobody's ever mentioned it.;NM33AAMECH12024_.mp3
What can you tell me about the Sith Academy?;
Do you know how to reach the ruins on the surface?;
Thanks, I'll be going.;
Yep. Take care, now.;NM33AAMECH12030_.mp3
Yes, but much older. Are there ruins on Korriban?;
There's a whole bunch of old Sith ruins up on the surface of the planet. That's why they put one of their academies here, to dig them all up.;NM33AAMECH12026_.mp3
I have to go.;
Nice to see the Hawk's still in one piece. Beauty of a ship, that.;NM33AAMECH12002_.mp3
This job is not fair trade.;
You were not here first, yet Jawas serve.;
Better here than with People of Sand.;
Jawas will dig the sand for you one day.;
Move to the sides, out of serving way.;
[Unintelligible];
The Star Forge... I've never seen anything like it.;NM12AAC03001000_.mp3
I'm transmitting these coordinates to Admiral Dodonna.  Maybe a quick strike by the Republic can cripple the Sith fleet.;NM12AAC03001001_.mp3
Message is away. Now we can just wait for the Republic to show up. We should be safe here - we're outside their sensor range.;NM12AAC03001002_.mp3
What's that?;
A small vanguard of Sith fighters, coming in hard!  Someone needs to get on those gun turrets. ## Take those fighters out before they report our position to the main fleet!;NM12AAC03001004_.mp3
ALARM;
[Compared to the warriors that you have encountered, the Sand People Storyteller is relatively calm in his movements and speech, but he still regards you coldly.];
Translation: He identifies himself as the Storyteller, master. He has been told of your warrior skills and will speak the history to you.;NM20AAXSTO07002_.mp3
I am honored. Ask him what he records.;
Translation: [Unintelligible];
Translation: There is only one accepted history, passed orally to each successive generation.;NM20AAXSTO07005_.mp3
Translation: A book or datapad can be taken away, cheapening the value of what it contains. To commit it to paper or storage is to remove it from the people.;NM20AAXSTO07009_.mp3
Continue the history from where we left off.;
I want to ask questions about what I've heard.;
"Cautionary: Remember my warning, master. They may consider certain questions to be ""speaking the words in error,"" a blasphemy they would attempt to kill you for.";NM20AAXSTO07023_.mp3
I want to ask something about the outsiders.;
Clarification: They appear to hate humanity with a passion only rivaled by their hatred of the Builders. For some reason, you resemble what they once were.;NM20AAXSTO07027_.mp3
Perhaps there is a lingering fear that you are their tainted selves returning from exile among the stars.;NM20AAXSTO07028_.mp3
Is it a physical or societal similarity?;
Cautionary: Master, if you mean to suggest that humanity is ancestrally linked to ancient Tatooine, you will strain his belief system to its pitiful meat-bag maximum.;NM20AAXSTO07030_.mp3
Just pose the question.;
I want to ask something about a different part of the history.;
Cautionary: I should warn you, master, that any questioning of their interpretation may be seen as trying to change the meaning of what was said.;NM20AAXSTO07024_.mp3
"Clarification: They may consider this to be ""speaking the words in error,"" a blasphemy they would attempt to kill you for.";NM20AAXSTO07025_.mp3
I want to ask something about the long walk.;
Impatience: Master, I refuse to inconvenience you with this. He spouted names of petty tribal fights in deserts so distant they might as well be across the galaxy.;NM20AAXSTO07033_.mp3
Really, master, I'm sure it's important to him, but it has nothing of value that you could ever put to use.;NM20AAXSTO07034_.mp3
We'll have to discuss this impudence, HK-47.;
Agreement: Of course, master. Just no more of their inane wandering.;NM20AAXSTO07036_.mp3
I want to ask something about the great war.;
Clarification: The occupying force suffered some sort of species-wide plague that lowered their numbers over time. His people used this extended weakness to sabotage their larger ships.;NM20AAXSTO07038_.mp3
The response of the Builders appears to have been to lay waste to the entire surface of Tatooine.;NM20AAXSTO07039_.mp3
How could they repel such a powerful species?;
Doubting: They didn't, master. They struck a blow, but the Storyteller only believes they won because the Builders were gone when they emerged from their caves.;NM20AAXSTO07041_.mp3
That does not mean they defeated anyone. It seems clear that the Builders simply sterilized their problem and left. The enemy judged them not worthy to fight.;NM20AAXSTO07042_.mp3
Ask him if that is a possibility.;
Cautionary: Master, this line of questioning may be interpreted as attempting to change the story. He may react poorly.;NM20AAXSTO07044_.mp3
Just do it.;
What kind of weapon could do so much damage?;
Clarification: I may not have properly conveyed how long they fought with the Builders. Given time, any number of armaments could destroy a world.;NM20AAXSTO07046_.mp3
Hypothesis: Perhaps this is another distortion. Their climate may have begun to fail due to their unrestrained development even before the Builders arrived.;NM20AAXSTO07047_.mp3
Looking back thousands of years later, such a shift could easily be attributed to the much-hated conquerors.;NM20AAXSTO07048_.mp3
Suggest that possibility to him.;
How could they survive such an attack?;
Hypothesis: If his people were moving away from technology for a long time under the Builders, they may have had extensive cave systems that could grant shelter.;NM20AAXSTO07052_.mp3
I would also suggest that, given the evidence of the massive shift in the nature of their society, most of them did not survive.;NM20AAXSTO07053_.mp3
Let's return to my other questions.;
Obedient: I will ask whatever you wish, master.;NM20AAXSTO07083_.mp3
Begin the history.;
Oral histories are often inaccurate.;
I'll return later.;
I want to ask something about the time of enslavement.;
Clarification: I believe they were occupied by this technologically superior species for a substantial period. Stripping an entire planet of useable resources would have taken generations.;NM20AAXSTO07055_.mp3
How many of his people were taken off-world?;
Why would the invaders have done this?;
Obvious: The same reason Czerka Corporation is attempting it now. Expanding empires need tremendous amounts of resources.;NM20AAXSTO07064_.mp3
I want to ask something about the ancient times.;
Clarification: It would appear that they once had a thriving technologically advanced society, but were wiped out by a much more sophisticated alien species.;NM20AAXSTO07066_.mp3
Is there anything in the galactic record that would verify this?;
Negative: I am no library, but since there is no Republic record of this planet having sentient life before Czerka colonization, I doubt you will find such evidence.;NM20AAXSTO07068_.mp3
"Ask him if these ""Builders"" resemble any modern species.";
"Can he clarify how long ago Tatooine was ""green with life""?";
Doubting: I don't believe he can, master. Even if their stories are exact and unchanged, it is likely they were first told thousands of years after these events occured.;NM20AAXSTO07079_.mp3
"This has become very much like a creation myth for his people. There is no date; it simply was.";NM20AAXSTO07080_.mp3
What topics can I choose from?;
He will speak it? They don't write it down?;
What good will these histories be to me?;
[You have no chance of understanding him without HK-47 present. He senses this and dismisses you, not wanting to waste his time.];
"[The Sand People Storyteller regards you as he did before; as an outsider. He is obviously used to being the most important figure in the tribe.]";
Translation: The Storyteller waits for your questions, master.;NM20AAXSTO07137_.mp3
We have done it... I am saddened that it had to come to this, but I couldn't let it continue.;
Zaalbar, my son. I am truly sorry. You have suffered a great shame. I was blind. I have no excuse.;
I can forgive, father. I have learned a lot over the years.;
I have a few questions about Kashyyyk, Freyyr.;
Could they wait? I will answer what I can later, but we need to settle our current business. There is much that needs to be done.;
What will you do about the slavers?;
We will fight them. It will be difficult, but I swear they won't take another one of my people without bloodshed.;
I'll send quick-climbers to other villages and try to rally a defense. We must guard against this ever happening again.;
You will be the last outsider welcome here for a very long time. That is a change for the better, I think.;
What will you do now, Zaalbar?;
Returning home has lifted a great weight from my mind... but it has been painful as well.;
You have a place by my side, Zaalbar. I would be honored if you would take it.;
I... I can't. Not yet. I'm just getting used to being free... and not just from the slavers.;
And I have a life-debt. Now that my life is truly my own again, honoring that agreement is all the more important.;
Listen to my son! His insight humbles me. Take that good judgment with you and all the planets will come to revere Wookiee wisdom.;
I think it's time I was leaving.;
Perhaps, but before you go, <FullName>, I must see to your reward. You have done us a great service. Kashyyyk will remember you well past your lifetime.;
Because of you, I am reinstated as Chieftain. We will return to the old ways, when honor and trust of kin ruled above all else.;
I'm not sure there is a reward that accurately reflects the value of what you have done. Our world is changed because of you.;
I have a request, father. I have thought about it a great deal. I would like Bacca's Sword.;
That would be fitting, I think.;
Well... That is quite a request. I am tempted to say no but... perhaps I should consider it an investment.;
Zaalbar, do you understand what this will mean? It is the legacy of our people, held by chieftains... and future chieftains.;
I understand. I want this, father. I'll bring it back one day.;
I have no doubt. Let the two halves of the blade be made one. My son shall hold Bacca's Sword.;
Zaalbar, shut up. I want some credits.;
Look, Big Z may owe you a life-debt but you've got to cut him some slack!;NM23ADFREY02031_.mp3
I have gone through a lot here. I don't think it's too much to ask that I choose the reward.;
Now, you just close your hole, child. It's a shock, I'm sure, but this isn't about you.;NM23ADFREY02033_.mp3
You should not be so self-serving, lest you fall to the dark side.;NM23ADFREY02035_.mp3
Enough. I want my reward and then I'm leaving.;
I have not forgotten you, <FullName>. You don't need to make demands. You have done us a great service. Kashyyyk will remember you well past your lifetime.;
I believe you have taken advantage of my good will. If you wish to talk, bring my son with you. I will speak out of respect for him, not you.;
Welcome back, <FullName>. Much is happening, but I can spare a moment. Our fight against the slavers will be a long one.;
Greetings father. It is good to see you again.;
I want to ask about the reward you gave.;
Yes, Bacca's Sword. It promises a great future for my people in my son's hands.;
Yes, sure, but I've got bills to pay.;
What? Wait, I won't have you demean the gift of Bacca's Sword by asking for money as well.;
I mean it, I don't want to hear you ask my father about this again.;
I saw a strange computer in the Shadowlands.;
Yes, I remember seeing it during my exile. It wouldn't do much for me. I imagine it's some Czerka cast-off.;
It's older than the forest. It created the trees.;
You are saying nonsense. I'm not sure why you have made this jest but I would ask that you stop.;
These are difficult times. I don't want you threatening our traditions while I am trying to unite my people under them.;
I will investigate your claims at a more appropriate time. Until then, don't speak of this again.;
I encountered some Mandalorian hunters in the Shadowlands.;
I am surprised that such a thing escaped my attention. Was their camouflage so great, or was I simply too struck by grief to see anything?;
If more are encountered, we will deal with them in short order. My people will never be weak again.;
I'm looking for something called a Star Map.;
I have no knowledge of anything like that. Wait... there was something...;
In my exile I encountered a strange computer in the depths of the Shadowlands. I thought it was a Czerka cast-off.;
You might find something of use in it. It was northwest of the area where you encountered me.;
I should be going.;
Yes, goodbye, father.;
Farewell to you. I thank you again.;
Oh, this isn't wise. An angry Wookiee can't be reasoned with.;NM23ADFREY02062_.mp3
What did you just say?;
[Lie] Zaalbar doesn't want the sword. Take it back and give me money.;
By all the lower lands, did you just have the gall to try and sell me the sword I gave to my son? I am outraged!;
[Persuade] Credits will help more than this sword. I'll buy better equipment.;
Oh, I don't think that will work this time.;NM23ADFREY02081_.mp3
[Failure] I... I am outraged! Such disrespect! I've seen gorryl slugs with more honor than you!;
For the sake of my son I won't have you beaten senseless with your own legs, but I want you out of here!;
You want me to talk, you bring Zaalbar. I'll speak out of respect for him, not you!;
[Force Persuade] You want to trade me credits for Bacca's Sword.;
Oh boy, now you've done it. No way he'd say okay to that.;NM23ADFREY02083_.mp3
Cautionary: As predicted, this Wookiee has reacted poorly to your offer.;NM23ADFREY02085_.mp3
Now you've done it. There's no way you could convince him of that.;NM23ADFREY02087_.mp3
I did warn you this wouldn't work.;NM23ADFREY02089_.mp3
I'm sorry, forget I said anything.;
I will let this pass and treat you with due respect for the sake of my son, but *never* speak to me of this again.;
I want some credits in addition to the sword.;
I see. So the gift of our greatest symbol is not enough for you?;
[Force Persuade] You want to pay me credits. Many, many credits.;
[Success] I... I want to... give you some credits as well. Here... something we salvaged from Chuundar's Czerka bribes.;
Yes, I think that is fair. I think. Better not mention it to anyone. It's just between you and me.;
[Failure] No I don't, you gorryl slug trail! How dare you suggest that Bacca's Sword is insufficient!;
Nothing. Let's just go back to my questions.;
I will answer if I can. Be brief.;
Careful, I've seen Zaalbar get this mad too. There's no persuading him when it happens.;NM23ADFREY02064_.mp3
Don't push him too much or we'll have a berserk Wookiee on our hands...;NM23ADFREY02066_.mp3
Observation: You are angering this Wookiee beyond reasoning. Caution would be best.;NM23ADFREY02068_.mp3
Careful. He'll be impossible to reason with if you get him any madder.;NM23ADFREY02070_.mp3
This Wookiee does not like this line of questioning. You'll anger him past reasoning.;NM23ADFREY02072_.mp3
Your should not press him too far. It may have unfortunate consequences.;NM23ADFREY02074_.mp3
Have you questions? I will try to answer.;
[This twi'lek appears to be looking for someone... maybe even one of your companions back on the Ebon Hawk.];
Mission? Is that you? It's me, Lena. Remember? I was dating your brother back on Taris!;NGLOBELENA12000_.mp3
Lena? What... what are you doing here? Where's Griff?;NGLOBELENA12002_.mp3
I'm just passing through. Griff and I broke up a few months after we left Taris together. Probably for the best. Your brother can be charming, Mission, but he's bad news.;NGLOBELENA12004_.mp3
Don't you start trashing my brother, you cantina rat! Take that back or I'll smack you so hard your head-tails will pop off!;NGLOBELENA12006_.mp3
Wha-?? Mission, what's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?;NGLOBELENA12008_.mp3
You took her brother away and left her all alone on Taris!;
You've got your facts a little backwards. Mission could have come with us if she wanted to! It was her choice to stay behind!;NGLOBELENA12010_.mp3
You liar! Griff told me you didn't want his little sister tagging along - that's why he had to leave me behind!;NGLOBELENA12012_.mp3
Is that what the Hutt-spawn told you? I wanted you to come with us, Mission. I even offered to pay for your ticket! Why not? I paid for everything else while I was with that freeloader.;NGLOBELENA12014_.mp3
But he told me you didn't want to leave Taris. I said we shouldn't even go then, but he said we'd come back and get you after we struck it rich on Tatooine - just another one of his lies!;NGLOBELENA12016_.mp3
No - you're the one who's lying! Griff wouldn't... he wouldn't try to leave me behind!;NGLOBELENA12018_.mp3
Why should we believe you, Lena?;
Think about it. If Griff wasn't trying to ditch you, Mission, then why didn't he tell you where we were going?;NGLOBELENA12021_.mp3
After we left Taris he told me looking after you was holding him back - Griff's always looking to blame other people for his own problems. That's why he abandoned you.;NGLOBELENA12023_.mp3
He did the same thing to me, too, as soon as I ran out of money. He started blaming me for all his problems. Like it's my fault his get-rich-quick schemes never work out!;NGLOBELENA12025_.mp3
Sounds like you're better off without him.;
You damn well know it! He's nothing but a sleazy scam artist. If Mission knew what was good for her she'd forget he ever existed.;NGLOBELENA12027_.mp3
But Griff is my brother! I can't just pretend he doesn't exist! If he was here to defend himself Lena wouldn't be saying all this bad stuff about him!;NGLOBELENA12040_.mp3
Hey, if you want to talk to Griff go ahead. Last I heard he was going to make a fortune working the Czerka Corp mines on Tatooine. But as far as I'm concerned he's out of my life forever!;NGLOBELENA12030_.mp3
Griff's better off without you anyway, you table-dancing, brother-stealing home wrecker!;NGLOBELENA12032_.mp3
*sigh* I guess that's my cue to leave, then. I didn't mean to upset you, Mission. But one day you'll see I'm right about your brother. I only hope it's not too late by then.;NGLOBELENA12034_.mp3
I'd like to hear Griff's side of things before I judge him.;
So where is Griff now?;
Still on Tatooine, as far as I know. Not that I really care anymore. And if Mission was smart she'd forget about that no-good con artist!;NGLOBELENA12037_.mp3
This isn't my problem.;
Maybe he thought you were better off on Taris, Mission.;
Maybe your brother isn't the man you thought he was.;
Mission gets a little worked up when it comes to her brother.;
Yeah, I know how she feels. Griff can be pretty frustrating. I guess that's why Mission didn't want to come with us when we left Taris.;NGLOBELENA12044_.mp3
You guys are behind with your payments. What do you uh, you think just 'cause you're in some gang you don't have to give Davik his cut?;NM03AACAND06000_.mp3
I don't see Davik doing anything for his share. We do all the work. Davik claims he's part of the Exchange, so let's see him prove it.;
Yeah, let's see the big crime lord come and get his money from the Black Vulkars!;
Ah, so you want to play this the hard way? Haha. OK. *sharp whistle*;NM03AACAND06006_.mp3
Oh, hey... Canderous. We didn't know you was working for Davik now.;
Yeah, we were just goofin' around here. We don't want no trouble with a Mandalorian. Here's Davik's cut.;
I knew you boys would see reason. Now get out of here.;NM03AACAND06012_.mp3
Too bad. I was looking forward to cracking some heads.;NM03AACAND06014_.mp3
Maybe next time, Canderous. I better get this over to Davik. I'll call you if anyone else gets behind on their payments.;NM03AACAND06016_.mp3
[This Sand People warrior ignores you. It seems your presence here is a barely tolerated event.];
Ah, you have come, young apprentice, at Master Zhar's bidding. He sees great promise in you... as do I.;NM13AADORA08000_.mp3
The time has come for you to choose the color of your lightsaber. This color also reflects your demeanor and position within the Order.;NM13AADORA08001_.mp3
What colors are there?;
Blue is the color of the Jedi Guardian. This Jedi battles against the forces of evil and the dark side. They focus more on combat training and use of the lightsaber.;NM13AADORA08003_.mp3
Yellow is the color of the Jedi Sentinel. This Jedi ferrets out deceit and injustice, bringing it to light. They focus less on combat and more on other skills and abilities.;NM13AADORA08004_.mp3
Green is the color of the Jedi Consular. This Jedi seeks to bring balance to the universe. They mediate between other groups, using their powers to end conflict and preserve peace.;NM13AADORA08005_.mp3
I want to be a Jedi Guardian!;
Indeed. We shall see. I will now ask you questions, and your responses will indicate which class you lean most towards.;NM13AADORA08008_.mp3
A woman and her small child are beset by a desperate-looking group of thugs. They are menacing her with weapons and she screams to you for help. What do you do?;NM13AADORA08009_.mp3
Help them flee.;
Hm... Indeed. Very well, on to the next question.;NM13AADORA08011_.mp3
You are in combat with a Dark Jedi allied with the Sith. There is a pause in the combat. What do you do?;NM13AADORA08012_.mp3
Attack him again.;
Yes, I suspected as much. Now for the next question.;NM13AADORA08014_.mp3
There is a locked door and your goal lies on the other side. What do you do?;NM13AADORA08015_.mp3
Smash the door down.;
I am beginning to see a pattern here, apprentice. I have a feeling about what you would be best at. But first, the final question.;NM13AADORA08018_.mp3
You are the head of an Enclave on a contested world. The Dark Jedi have infiltrated and are causing unrest across the planet. What do you do?;NM13AADORA08019_.mp3
Hunt them down.;
Yes, I thought as much.;NM13AADORA08021_.mp3
As I suspected, you would be most suitable as a Jedi Guardian.;NM13AADORA08022_.mp3
Which color and path do you believe yourself most suited to, apprentice?;NM13AADORA08006_.mp3
Blue. The path of the Jedi Guardian.;
Here is a blue crystal for your lightsaber. Go speak to Master Zhar again and he will instruct you in how to construct it.;NM13AADORA08023_.mp3
Yellow. The path of the Jedi Sentinel.;
Here is a yellow crystal for your lightsaber. Go speak to Master Zhar again and he will instruct you in how to construct it.;NM13AADORA08025_.mp3
Green. The path of the Jedi Consular.;
Here is a green crystal for your lightsaber. Go speak to Master Zhar again and he will instruct you in how to construct it.;NM13AADORA08027_.mp3
As I suspected, you would be most suitable as a Jedi Sentinel.;NM13AADORA08024_.mp3
As I suspected, you would be most suitable as a Jedi Consular.;NM13AADORA08026_.mp3
Try to lure them out into a trap.;
Coordinate with the planetary government to identify the infiltrators.;
Try to pick the lock.;
Knock.;
Find out why he turned to the dark side and try to turn him.;
Try to see a weakness in his technique.;
Attack the thugs.;
Stop the thugs and find out why they are attacking her.;
I want to be a Jedi Sentinel!;
I want to be a Jedi Consular!;
What positions are there?;
Why do I get set with a single color?;
A Jedi is not restricted to a single color. Rather, that color is a badge of pride for the Jedi path it signifies. Should you have an appropriate crystal, you may change your blade to anything you desire.;NM13AADORA08039_.mp3
But first you should learn of the different paths a Jedi may take.;NM13AADORA08040_.mp3
Padawan, I must speak with you. You are now one of the Jedi, an Order with a long and glorious past... a past we should all be aware of.;NM13AADORA08041_.mp3
As a chronicler of the Academy here on Dantooine, I feel it is my duty to share the history of our Order with the newly initiated. Unfortunately, our recent history is one of tragedy and bloodshed.;NM13AADORA08042_.mp3
The Mandalorian Wars, the fall of Revan and Malak, the rise of the Sith: there are important lessons to be learned from these events if we do not wish to repeat the mistakes of our past.;NM13AADORA08043_.mp3
I am eager to learn, Master Dorak.;
"Of course I could not tell you the entire history of our Order; the Jedi have existed for thousands upon thousands of years. We are as old as the Republic itself.";NM13AADORA08045_.mp3
Instead, I will begin forty years ago with the war of Exar Kun. Like Malak and Revan, Exar Kun was a Jedi who fell to the dark side and led an army against the Jedi and the Republic.;NM13AADORA08046_.mp3
Exar Kun was defeated, but the war left both the Republic and our own Order severely weakened. For twenty years we struggled to rebuild, trying to erase the scars of the terrible conflict.;NM13AADORA08047_.mp3
What does this have to do with Revan and Malak?;
All things in time. You shall learn that history is an intricate weaving of many events. No one thing can be understood without the proper context.;NM13AADORA08049_.mp3
Twenty years ago the Mandalorians, aware the Republic was in a weakened state, began conquering small worlds on the Outer Rim. They were careful to choose only planets outside the Republic's jurisdiction.;NM13AADORA08051_.mp3
After much debate, the Senate chose not to intervene. As long as the Mandalorians avoided planets that were members of the Republic itself, there would be no retaliation.;NM13AADORA08052_.mp3
That sounds like a big mistake.;
Well, you can hardly blame the Republic. The memory of war was fresh in everyone's mind, nobody was eager to relive the horrors in a campaign against the Mandalorians. But in the end it was unavoidable.;NM13AADORA08054_.mp3
The Mandalorians stockpiled resources from their conquered worlds, preparing for a massive assault. Seven years ago they launched a simultaneous attack in three separate sectors of Republic space.;NM13AADORA08057_.mp3
The Senate had no choice but to retaliate with the entire Republic fleet. The Mandalorian Wars had begun.;NM13AADORA08058_.mp3
Did the Jedi join in?;
The Republic petitioned the Jedi Council for aid, but there were many factors to consider before we allowed ourselves to be drawn into another conflict so soon after the war with Exar Kun.;NM13AADORA08060_.mp3
While the Jedi Council preached patience, there were many among our Order who were eager for us to join the battle. Two young Knights in particular demanded immediate action: Revan and Malak.;NM13AADORA08061_.mp3
They rallied many of the Jedi to their cause and, against the wishes of their Masters, joined the Republic fleet battling the Mandalorians.;NM13AADORA08062_.mp3
Revan was a brilliant military leader, and the Republic fleet began to win victory after victory. Four years ago the Mandalorians surrendered unconditionally.;NM13AADORA08063_.mp3
So Revan did the right thing.;
No one is denying that Revan was one of the keys to defeating the Mandalorians... but something happened out there on the Outer Rim.;NM13AADORA08065_.mp3
Instead of returning after the war's end, the ships under Revan's command went deep into unexplored space. They claimed to be searching for the last remnants of the Mandalorian fleet.;NM13AADORA08066_.mp3
All contact was lost. For many months it was assumed some great disaster had befallen the entire fleet. Everyone thought they were dead.;NM13AADORA08067_.mp3
There were unsubstantiated rumors of Revan and Malak being seen on a number of different planets during these months - scattered sightings that were never confirmed.;NM13AADORA08068_.mp3
Where did they disappear to?;
Perhaps they simply went far beyond the edges of Republic space. Maybe they found previously undiscovered hyperspace routes to the ends of the galaxy. Nobody knows for certain.;NM13AADORA08070_.mp3
"Three years ago, Revan and Malak returned at the head of a massive invasion fleet. Revan had assumed the title of Sith Lord; the hero had become a conqueror.";NM13AADORA08071_.mp3
Where did Revan get the ships for the Sith fleet?;
Some of the ships in the Sith fleet are those that were under Revan's command during the Mandalorian Wars. But many more are of an alien design we have never seen before.;NM13AADORA08073_.mp3
The source of this massive fleet is one of the many things about the Sith we cannot explain. It seems impossible to have created it in such a short time, yet we cannot deny its existence.;NM13AADORA08074_.mp3
The source of the Sith soldiers is, unfortunately, much easier to understand. Initially the bulk of the force were former Republic soldiers who had served under Revan.;NM13AADORA08075_.mp3
With each conquest thousands more flocked to join the invaders, swelling their numbers. Even many of our own Order have betrayed us, lured by Sith promises of riches and power.;NM13AADORA08076_.mp3
So what happened next?;
For two years the Sith were all but invincible. Fortunately, Bastila and her Battle Meditation allowed the Republic to win a few key victories and kept the Sith from total triumph.;NM13AADORA08078_.mp3
In desperation we set a trap for the Dark Lord. Bastila was with the strike team that tried to capture Revan, as you probably know. She was there at Revan's end.;NM13AADORA08079_.mp3
That was nearly a year ago, but things have not improved. Malak has stepped in and assumed the mantle of Dark Lord for himself, though he is far from Revan's equal in strategy or tactics.;NM13AADORA08080_.mp3
Still, his fleet continues to grow in both ships and soldiers. If we do not find some way to stop the Sith soon, Malak will overwhelm us with sheer numbers.;NM13AADORA08081_.mp3
What can I learn from Revan's history?;
Revan's tale shows us how even the greatest of Jedi can fall to the dark side. You must always be on guard against the evil that dwells within you. Think hard upon this lesson.;NM13AADORA08083_.mp3
I will think on this, Master Dorak.;
May the Force be with you.;NM13AADORA08085_.mp3
Where are the Academy's archives?;
This facility is a training academy. The archives here are restricted to those who have attained the rank of Master. We must protect overeager Padawans from being exposed to dangerous knowledge.;NM13AADORA08107_.mp3
The pursuit of knowledge is a noble goal, but there are some things that require the wisdom of a Master to truly understand.;NM13AADORA08108_.mp3
"You should ponder the history of Revan; it contains many lessons you may need if we hope to defeat Malak and the Sith.";NM13AADORA08121_.mp3
What am I supposed to learn from this?;
Don't worry. I'll find a way to stop the Sith!;
Your confidence is admirable, but you must guard against pride and arrogance. These lead to the dark side.;NM13AADORA08127_.mp3
I'll be going now.;
If you are seeking information on Revan, Malak and the Sith, I will gladly recount the recent history of our Order to you.;NM13AADORA08109_.mp3
Very well... tell me the history of the Jedi.;
I seek knowledge of the Jedi code.;
All Jedi must know the code, its tenets are the fundamental teachings of our Order. Think and meditate on these truths, apprentice:;NM13AADORA08103_.mp3
"There is no emotion; there is peace. There is no ignorance; there is knowledge. There is no passion; there is serenity. There is no chaos; there is harmony. There is no death; there is the Force.";NM13AADORA08104_.mp3
Knowledge of the code will lead you to the rank of Padawan, and knowledge of the Order and its history will guide you down the path of the light.;NM13AADORA08105_.mp3
I don't have time for this right now.;
As you wish. I will not force you to hear what I have to say, though I think it is unwise to ignore the lessons of the past. Perhaps you can return when you have more time.;NM13AADORA08111_.mp3
How can anyone hope to stop the Sith?;
How did Revan get so many followers?;
Initially the bulk of the Sith force were former Republic soldiers who had served under Revan. With each conquest thousands more flocked to join the invaders, swelling their numbers.;NM13AADORA08091_.mp3
Even many of our own Order have betrayed us, lured by Sith promises of riches and power. But what is more disturbing is the size of the Sith fleet itself.;NM13AADORA08092_.mp3
What happened next?;
How did Revan fall to the dark side?;
Revan and Malak were heroes, the great saviors of the Republic. A third of the Republic fleet was under their direct command... and then something happened.;NM13AADORA08097_.mp3
Where did the Sith come from?;
What about Malak and Revan?;
They should have protected them!;
But we ended up in a war anyway.;
What about the Mandalorian Wars?;
I bid you welcome once more. I assume you have come so that I might continue my recounting of the recent history of the Jedi Order.;NM13AADORA08112_.mp3
Yes, continue the tale.;
It pleases me to see a student who understands the value of history. I shall resume where we last left off.;NM13AADORA08114_.mp3
I have already told you of the war against Exar Kun and the damage it wrought upon the Republic and the Jedi Order. Even now we are still rebuilding from that terrible conflict.;NM13AADORA08115_.mp3
When we last spoke I had just told you of the Mandalorian invasion of seven years ago. The Republic sent their entire fleet to do battle with this new threat.;NM13AADORA08116_.mp3
I was telling you how Revan and Malak returned three years ago, at the head of a massive invasion fleet.;NM13AADORA08117_.mp3
Greetings, young apprentice. Have you come seeking knowledge of the past? Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it, or so they say.;NM13AADORA08118_.mp3
As Chronicler of the Academy here on Dantooine, I find your quest for knowledge admirable. But I do not want to overwhelm you with the long history of the Jedi Order.;NM13AADORA08120_.mp3
Greetings, young Padawan. Have you come seeking knowledge of the past? Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it, or so they say.;NM13AADORA08119_.mp3
Uh... we aren't in your way, right? We don't want to... uh... get you mad or nothing.;
Shh, Gurke! Your voice maybe annoys them!;
Sorry boys, I've changed my mind. I'm going to hurt you now.;
I knew we were getting set up! Cut them up! We gots no choice!;
See you later, boys.;
I hopes not. *snort*;
Yeah, that would be bad.;
Ha! Why you come back here, humee fool? You are no hunter! You gots no toughness at all!;
Yeah, maybe you kills a dragon, but you are scared of us!;
Go on, you get lost now.;
I've changed my mind. I think I'll have to hurt you now.;
What? No, no, yous is scared, right? Run away now.;
[Force Persuade] Run away, piggie. Run away screaming.;
[Success] What... we... we gotta run! Gotta run real fast! *squee!*;
Gurke? Uh... we gotta... uh... gotta go somewhere and... wait for me!;
[Failure] Why you wave your arm like that? No flies in here. Go away, scaredy.;
You're out of time, piggies. I'll cut you limb from limb!;
They gots some fight in them, boys! Cut them up fast!;
I'm leaving.;
Yeah, you leave. Run away, scaredy-tail!;
Ha! *snort*;
Yeah, maybe you pay so we gots drinks, too! That is all you is good for.;
Hey, don't push your luck, fellas.;NM17AD03GU03016_.mp3
Statement: At your command, master: Gamorrean stew!;NM17AD03GU03018_.mp3
What you want, humee? We said no more talking, and we meant it. Go away.;
Ugh. Must we stand so close to them? I'd forgotten what Gamorreans smelled like.;NM17AD03GU03038_.mp3
Yeah, you don't talk to Gurke no more.;
Watch your tongues, piggies, or I'll rip them out!;
What! You talk pretty big. Maybe yous should take that back. Gurke and boys tough!;
*squee* Yeah! Gurke right!;
Maybe we chase you out of system, maybe dump you in the dunes!;
Or I slaughter you where you stand! Want to risk it?;
Er... now wait a minute. Easy now. *snort*;
Gurke, we have to... uh... go do that thing.;
What? Oh! Yeah, you lucky, humee. We got to go do some business... somewhere... yeah.;
We see you again, though. Just you wait. *snort*;
Now, no need for us to fight. This is just friendly bravado.;
Yeah, we thought you was coward and stuff. *snort* Go on, you leave us. We got no times for you.;
Yeah, you not worth time.;
How about I buy you a drink? Will that keep you happy?;
Ha! You roll over like a bellyscratched dewback. Go away, humee, you not worth us talking to.;
Sharina Nal thinks you may have killed her husband.;
Er... who?;
Fizark's mate.;
Bah! *snort* Her snout lies. Fizark got lost. You leave now, or maybe you get lost in the dunes too.;
I'm inclined to believe her. You won't escape justice.;
The dunes gots no justice.;
Fine, I'll just leave.;
Yeah, you leave. That's good.;
Maybe we see you out on the dunes. Maybe before you see us!;
Shhh! Shuts up, stupid!;
Statement: They are not too much for us, master. Blasters on ready...;NM17AD03GU03040_.mp3
*snort* What do you want, dragon-killer? Gurke and the boys don't have time for you. We are big hunters too.;
Yeah, you nothing. *squee*;
I wanted to ask questions about you and hunting.;
Go reads a book or get a yappy droid. Gurke and the boys don't train babies.;
Yeah, we hunt the wraid best out of everybody. We don't have time to train you or anyone.;
Some of the other hunters say you don't know how to hunt.;
Bah! They know we are just as good as them, and that's for sure.;
Yeah, we prove it because some of them don't come back, but we always do.;
Shut up, stupid.;
Why don't you let him speak?;
What, you deaf? Because he's stupid, and talks too much. You leave us alone now.;
I am not stupid. You are stupid.;
"Aw, geez! I hope this doesn't take too long; Gamorreans like to throw insults around, but they just don't have the smarts for it.";NM17AD03GU03078_.mp3
You are stupid one, not me! You too stupid to even know you are stupid!;
No, you are stupid one, stupid! You so stupid everyone see you and say look at stupid!;
Shut *UP*, stupid! *snort*;
So, can I ask what you do?;
Gurke and his boys hunt! That's what we do and who we are, but we don't train babies like you!;
I'm looking for something. Are you good scouts?;
Oh, we are best among everybody, but not for you. We hunters know more than everybody.;
Yeah, you go learn the dunes yourself. Then maybe you tough enough to talk to us. Probably not though.;
Heh, yeah, probably not. *snort* Bet you don't come back.;
The other hunters say you shouldn't be trusted.;
What they say about us? Huh? Liars, every one of them.;
Yeah, they is just jealous of us and stuff. It's not our fault some of them die out in the dunes.;
*snort* Ha ha, boys, it talk to me! What you want, humee? Gurke has no time for you.;
Warning: You'll pay attention to the master, meatbag, or suffer the consequences!;NM17AD03GU03047_.mp3
Ooo! Humee has big enforcer! *snort* We scared now!;
Ha! Yeah, you tell 'em, Gurke. *snort*;
What if I wanted advice? I'm sure you are very smart.;
Whu...? Hmm... you trying to get my secrets, I bet. Trying to find where I hunt, huh? I tell you nothing!;
Yeah, you get nothing! *snort*;
Keep your temper, I just want to ask some questions.;
You don't tell me what to do. Nobody does. We the best hunters, and we does what we wants.;
There's only one language you Gamorreans ever understand. A blaster to your forehead.;NM17AD03GU03051_.mp3
You back again? Why you come back to Gurke and the boys? You should keep walking.;
Statement: The master walks where the master wants. Interfere and die, aromatic meatbags!;NM17AD03GU03139_.mp3
Yeah, swoop fool, go away. Let people watch you like some animal show. Hunters like us, we don't want you.;
Yeah, you not learn so good if you are back. We don't want you here.;
These... things... are just looking for trouble. Be careful.;NM17AD03GU03141_.mp3
[Bastila isn't in the mood to talk right now - not with enemies so close by.];
You will have to disable the energy shield around this temple before we can leave. There is a computer here on the Temple summit that has access to the power generators.;NM44ACEXIT03000_.mp3
You can also use it to disable the disruptor field that protects the Star Forge. Otherwise, the Ebon Hawk will not be able to leave the planet without crashing.;NM44ACEXIT03001_.mp3
With each passing moment your old apprentice becomes stronger, Master. We must act quickly to exact your vengeance. Malak will pay for stealing the mantle of Dark Lord from you!;NM45AABAST06902_.mp3
If you have questions, you should direct them towards the Jedi Council members.;NM13AABAST04000_.mp3
The Star Forge is under assault from the entire Republic fleet! If I don't use my Battle Meditation to turn the tide, Admiral Dodonna's capital ships will destroy the Star Forge.;NM45AABAST01166_.mp3
I have to stay here in the command center so that I can best use my Battle Meditation against our enemy. If I don't the Star Forge will be lost!;NM45AABAST01167_.mp3
You must go to face Malak without me. Find him, kill him and reclaim the title of Dark Lord of the Sith!;NM45AABAST01168_.mp3
I know we have not spoken often during our time together, despite my best efforts. And to this point I have respected your privacy. But there is something we must discuss.;NM35AABAST06000_.mp3
"I feel the end of our quest is near. Soon we will discover the location of the Star Forge; though what will happen next is... uncertain.";NM35AABAST06005_.mp3
I've been watching you. I've seen how you have resisted great temptations and continue to walk the path of the light side. Very commendable.;NM35AABAST06006_.mp3
I've been watching you. I've seen you give in to temptation and indulge your baser emotions on many occassions. I'm afraid you are on the path that leads to the dark side.;NM35AABAST06011_.mp3
[Bastila seems to have something on her mind. Perhaps you should talk to her about it.];
How can I help?;NM35AABAST06014_.mp3
I am confident that you can deal with that on your own.;NM35AABAST06617_.mp3
I wish I could help you with that.;NM35AABAST06618_.mp3
*whisper* The Force should not be used for profit and personal gain. As Jedi we should be above such things.;NGLOBEBAST06896_.mp3
It troubles me to see you behaving this way. Such acts can lead to the dark side.;NGLOBEBAST06897_.mp3
*whisper* The Force is not a thing to be trifled with. Continue to use it frivolously and you may find yourself straying down the dark path.;NGLOBEBAST06898_.mp3
We should guard and protect those weaker than ourselves... not bully and exploit them!;NGLOBEBAST06899_.mp3
That was beneath you. I hope in the future you will strive to be better than this.;NGLOBEBAST06900_.mp3
That was a truly noble act. The Jedi Council would be pleased.;NGLOBEBAST06901_.mp3
Please, don't take me in for questioning... I don't know anything! I swear!;NM02AAMAN006000_.mp3
Don't - don't hurt my family! Just take what you want and get out.;NM02AAMAN006001_.mp3
I've got a ton of things to do today. I can't talk to you.;NM02AAMAN006003_.mp3
I heard the gangs have overrun the Lower City. Why don't the Sith go down there and restore order?;NM02AAMAN006005_.mp3
I heard the Sith are sending salvage teams down into the Undercity to recover those Republic escape pods.;NM02AAMAN006007_.mp3
I'm tired of waiting, Komad. How big can this dragon of yours be? I'm going in!;NM18ADHUNT03000_.mp3
AAAAHHHHHHH!!!;NM18ADSCRE04002_.mp3
I hear you beat out the others to get the prestige you needed. Congratulations. You deserve it.;NM35AAMEKE08000_.mp3
You spared me. I don't know why you did it... maybe you aren't even a real Sith. Either that or you're a far better one than me.;NM35AAMEKE08002_.mp3
At any rate, where I come from folks honor their debts. I won't oppose you in the contest. If getting into the academy's what you want, go right ahead.;NM35AAMEKE08004_.mp3
Alright, fine, you won. Big deal.;NM35AAMEKE08006_.mp3
It's a bad year to try and become a Sith, you know... I've got it all wrapped up.;NM35AAMEKE08008_.mp3
Who are you?;
The name's Mekel. I'm one of the hopefuls up for Sith-hood, just like you. Well, I'm the one that's going to make it, that is.;NM35AAMEKE08010_.mp3
You better change your tone with me. I'm Darth Revan!;
Funny. Say that after I'm a full Sith and I'll ground your face into the dirt just for fun.;NM35AAMEKE08016_.mp3
What makes you so sure?;
You think I would tell you? Have my brains started dribbling out of my nose, or something?;NM35AAMEKE08014_.mp3
It would be an improvement.;
[Persuade] You can at least give me a hint.;
[Success] Hmph. I guess there's no harm in it. Word has it that Master Uthar gives big points for Sith artifacts that are brought back from the valley.;NM35AAMEKE08019_.mp3
The valley?;
The Valley of the Sith Lords. You know... where the academy does all its excavating. If you really don't know, just go out the east exit and you'll see.;NM35AAMEKE08021_.mp3
You just found that out, did you?;
Hmph. Well, if you've known for so long, why haven't you taken advantage of it, yet? Yeah, just like I thought.;NM35AAMEKE08024_.mp3
Thanks for the tip.;
Well, you're free to go wander out there, if you like. Me, I'll be seeing you later.;NM35AAMEKE08027_.mp3
[Failure] I could, but what would be the point in that? See you around, chump.;NM35AAMEKE08029_.mp3
Maybe we can trade information?;
There's nothing you know that I could possibly want. Thanks anyhow.;NM35AAMEKE08032_.mp3
I got my own plans.;
Well, you keep working on that.;NM35AAMEKE08035_.mp3
Yeah... so I see. I'll be keeping my eye on you.;NM35AAMEKE08037_.mp3
I've got to go.;
Yes, I imagine you've got some scurrying around to do, don't you?;NM35AAMEKE08050_.mp3
You've got some prestige already. Relax, why don't you?;NM35AAMEKE08052_.mp3
Go ahead: gloat. I'll catch up to you, yet.;NM35AAMEKE08054_.mp3
Whatever. I'm the one who's going to make it.;
Well, you're off to a super start. You've got no more prestige than I do, at the moment. Thing is: I know how to get some.;NM35AAMEKE08040_.mp3
You know the Code of the Sith?;
Uhhh... no. Nobody here will tell you anything about that. I've got a better plan, though.;NM35AAMEKE08042_.mp3
How do you plan on getting prestige?;
You're lying. I can tell.;
Think what you like. Just remember: only one of us gets to become a Sith.;NM35AAMEKE08045_.mp3
I don't need prestige. I'm Darth Revan - Lord of the Sith!;
Maybe. You're not doing too bad, I suppose. I know something you don't, though.;NM35AAMEKE08047_.mp3
And what's that?;
I remember you. Mekel, right?;
That's right. You might as well just go home, you know. There can only be one Sith this year, and that's me.;NM35AAMEKE08012_.mp3
You hanging around, still? Don't you have your own plans? Not that they'll help you... I'm in for sure, you know.;NM35AAMEKE08056_.mp3
Mekel, right?;
Greetings, fellow sentient! I notice that you are not heavily armed... or at least, not heavily armed, enough!;
Please allow my self to introduce myself. I am Adum, a simple merchant with a much noble purpose!;
Purpose?;
Yes! Purpose!;
The settlers and noble humans of Dantooine have been plagued by kath hounds, raiders and other fearsome troubles of late.;
It is much, much too sad to see these things happen to such people as this. Therefore, I have made this my mission to be!;
Er.. mission?;
To overcome their troubles, they must be able to defend themselves. Therefore, I shall offer the highest of quality of weapons at the lowest of low of prices for them!;
I am here, offering you much in the way of weaponry at low, low prices! How can any sentient pass up such a bargain? They cannot!;
Weaponry it is, and weaponry I have! What is it you would like from me this fine day?;
Let me see what you're selling.;
Yes, yes! Here is the best you can find anywhere on this world!;
Do you happen to have any maps of the area?;
Maps? Why yes, yes I have.;
What areas would you like a map to? I am afraid I do not have all areas of maps, though.;
I would like a map to this area.;
Maps for little, maps for cheap! Only 2 credits for this fine, fine map.;
I'll take it.;
Here then, is that map I have. Is there anything else you would like?;
I would like to ask you some questions.;
Of course I shall endeavor to be of service to whatever endeavor you are on. What is it you wish to ask?;
What do you know of the Mandalorian raiders?;
A plague on this world... a plague that must be cleansed with fire!;
Fire generated from a sterling example of weaponcraft such as this fine Blaster Rifle right here. Can't do better, you know!;
Um... yeah, hold it. I'd like to ask something else.;
I'd like to take a closer look at your weapons.;
I think I should be going now.;
Not everyone can have the best... but I can offer it! Come back if there is ever any need.;
What do you know about the Sandral-Matale feud?;
I am sorry, but I have not been on this world long. I am not familiar with the names of all the sentients who dwell here.;
Is there something else you wish to ask?;
What do you know about the kath hounds?;
Fearsome beasts! Predators! A danger that the settlers of this world must constantly face and do battle with!;
And what better way to battle them than with this handy Blaster Pistol! Crafted from the finest, sturdiest materials, it can stop a kath hound dead in its tracks at fifty paces!;
What do you know about ancient ruins here?;
I am sorry, but I have not been on this world long. I am not familiar with the rich cultural history of its hardy peoples.;
What do you know about the corrupted grove?;
I am sorry, but I have not been on this world long. I am not familiar with any specific locales in this area.;
Actually, I'd like to see what you have in stock.;
I don't have enough.;
Come back, then, when enough money is there, and the map I'll have.;
Well then, yes, what is it that you want?;
I'd like to ask something else.;
I would like a map to the area south of here.;
You're trying to sell me something, aren't you...;
I really don't think I have time for this.;
Noble, are you...;
Yes! Noble it is!;
Talk to the captain, not me.;NM22AACZER02000_.mp3
I just carry a blaster. The captain does the talking.;NM22AACZER02001_.mp3
I'm not paid to talk. Take it to the captain or the stiffs in the office.;NM22AACZER02002_.mp3
Don't bother me. You're on your own here.;NM22AACZER02003_.mp3
Hey, what do you think you're doing? You can't go into the cantina while you're on duty!;NM02ACSITH07000_.mp3
I'm not on duty right now.;
Then you shouldn't be in full uniform! If you're off duty go change your outfit. If not, get back to your patrol route!;NM02ACSITH07002_.mp3
Sorry, I'll be going now.;
Good. Get back to your patrol route. We need to keep a strong presence in the streets to maintain order here.;NM02ACSITH07005_.mp3
Don't bother me - I'm here on official Sith business!;NM02ACSITH07007_.mp3
Revan - I knew you'd come for me. Malak thought you might be afraid to enter the Temple again, but he doesn't know you like I do. Not anymore. Not since you've changed.;NM44ACEVIL01001_.mp3
Quickly, Bastila - come with us! We have to escape before Malak arrives!;NM44ACEVIL01002_.mp3
"Escape? You don't understand. I have sworn allegiance to Lord Malak and the Sith; I am no longer a pawn of the Jedi Council.";NM44ACEVIL01003_.mp3
No, Bastila! Don't go over to the dark side!;
You say that as if the dark side is some terrible entity. The Jedi Council has brainwashed you like all the others. Like they once did with me.;NM44ACEVIL01005_.mp3
They speak of the dark side as if it something to be feared. But in reality their only goal is to manipulate those who are strong in the Force. The fear of the dark side is a tool to maintain control.;NM44ACEVIL01006_.mp3
Why do you think the Jedi forbid you and Malak from joining the Mandalorian Wars? They knew you would realize your true potential and break free of their domination.;NM44ACEVIL01007_.mp3
Malak has shown me how the Jedi Council have been using me the same way they once tried to use you. They've been holding me back because they knew one day I would surpass them all.;NM44ACEVIL01008_.mp3
No - I don't believe it! How could you betray us like this, Bastila?;
I resisted at first. I endured the Sith torments with the passionless serenity of a true Jedi, emptying my mind. But after a week of endless tortures I finally saw the truth.;NM44ACEVIL01012_.mp3
Malak forced me to acknowledge my anger and pain. He showed me the liberating power of these emotions. Then he made me see how the Jedi Council has denied me what is mine by right!;NM44ACEVIL01013_.mp3
The Jedi Council gladly used my Battle Meditation in their wars, but they still treated me like a child - like an inferior. They were jealous of my power... of what I could become!;NM44ACEVIL01014_.mp3
They wanted me to bow and call them Master and follow their Code and obey their every order. But all the while they were exploiting my Battle Meditation for their own use!;NM44ACEVIL01015_.mp3
Don't do this, Bastila! Fight it! I'll help you!;
You are a sad little fool. You speak as if I were the same Bastila that you've known all along. But freed from the control of the Jedi Council I've become much, much more.;NM44ACEVIL01017_.mp3
I almost wish you could see things as I do now. I wish you could join me and taste true power once again. Sadly, I doubt you are even capable any longer.;NM44ACEVIL01018_.mp3
With the power of the Star Forge Malak will destroy the Republic and conquer the galaxy. And I will be the apprentice at his side - after I prove my worth by killing you!;NM44ACEVIL01027_.mp3
I like this side of you, Bastila. Now we can truly be together.;
You think so, do you? You style yourself the Master of the Sith that you once were? To think I once envied you your passion, your power.;NM44ACEVIL01020_.mp3
Don't be lured in by these Sith lies, Bastila!;
"Lies? You are the one living a lie, Revan. The Jedi Council made you into something you are not; they programmed you to be their slave.";NM44ACEVIL01022_.mp3
You used to be Revan, Master of the Sith, but no longer. You are simply a pawn of the Jedi Council and the Republic they serve... like I was until Malak freed me from their shackles!;NM44ACEVIL01024_.mp3
A pity the power you once had is so diluted in you. You could have been strong as I am now... stronger, even. But that will never happen, now.;NM44ACEVIL01026_.mp3
I am Revan, the Dark Lord! Bow down to me, Bastila!;
If you've fallen under Malak's control you must die!;
It's not too late, Bastila! You can still turn away from the dark side!;
It didn't take long to convert you, did it? I always knew you were weak!;
A pawn of the Jedi Council? What are you talking about?;
"Surely you know what I mean, Revan. Look at what the Council did to you; they turned you into their puppet. The same thing they do to all who are truly strong in the Force.";NM44ACEVIL01029_.mp3
Come on, Bastila. We have to escape before Malak shows up!;NM44ACEVIL01030_.mp3
You are stronger than I would have thought possible, after what the Jedi Council did to you. Seems that Malak was wrong - the power of the dark side is not lost to you after all, Revan.;NM44ACEVIL01031_.mp3
I draw my power from the light now, Bastila.;
You can deny what you are, Revan, but you are only fooling yourself. I know the truth. I have seen the shadows inside your mind.;NM44ACEVIL01033_.mp3
Remember: I was there when you nearly died in the trap set by the Jedi Council. I used the Force to preserve your life, Revan. We are forever linked by my actions on that bridge!;NM44ACEVIL01034_.mp3
That is how I know you will come back to the light.;
These are not your true feelings, Revan. You are speaking as a tool of the Jedi Council - as I once did. But now I see how the Jedi used us both!;NM44ACEVIL01036_.mp3
The Council tried to exploit the bond between us. They hoped I would draw out your memories to lead them to the Star Forge. We were slaves to their will - like all who follow the Jedi Code!;NM44ACEVIL01037_.mp3
But in our shared visions of the Star Maps I also felt the so called taint within you. I resisted it at first, but now I embrace the power of the dark side - your dark side!;NM44ACEVIL01038_.mp3
Learn from my mistakes. It is not too late to come back to the light!;
Mistakes? No, Revan - the only mistake you are making is the one you are making now! You deny yourself the power that is yours by right! Only now do I realize how strong you are.;NM44ACEVIL01040_.mp3
You deserve to be the true Master of the Sith, not Malak. I see this now. Together we can destroy your old apprentice. Join with me and reclaim your lost identity!;NM44ACEVIL01041_.mp3
I'm not Revan anymore. I don't even remember those days.;
Your mind was too badly damaged to ever fully restore your memories, Revan. But your power, your strength of will, the essence of who and what you are: these things still remain!;NM44ACEVIL01043_.mp3
Once long ago you defied the Jedi Council, freeing yourself from their control. You claimed your rightful title of Dark Lord of the Sith. Together we can defeat Malak and take back what is yours!;NM44ACEVIL01044_.mp3
Please, Bastila... if you feel anything for me, you won't do this!;
I... I don't. The only Revan I could respect is one who would break free of the Council's slavery. One who would grasp the power that lies before him... not the weak fool I see.;NM44ACEVIL01046_.mp3
Bastila, it is not too late for you to be saved. The teachings of the Jedi can lead you from the dark side back into the light and a true understanding of the Force.;NM44ACEVIL01048_.mp3
You are beneath my contempt, Juhani. When you felt the power of the dark side you fled to a cave like some cowering animal! You know nothing of the Force or its true potential!;NM44ACEVIL01049_.mp3
But you, Revan - the power of the dark side is yours to command! You can use it to destroy Malak! With my help you could rule over the entire galaxy!;NM44ACEVIL01050_.mp3
I don't want to rule the galaxy. I want you to return to the light.;
You are a pathetic fool, Revan! Together we could have defeated Malak and ruled over an Empire, but now I will be at Lord Malak's side instead!;NM44ACEVIL01081_.mp3
You will be crushed with the Republic and all the fools who bow down to the Jedi Council! No one can stand against the power of the Star Forge and the Sith fleet!;NM44ACEVIL01082_.mp3
The Dark Lord Revan is dead. I am a servant of the light now.;
Yes! Together we can rule the galaxy!;
Listen to me... the dark side leads to death and destruction. I've seen the horrors the Sith have unleashed on the galaxy. Turn away from this path.;NM44ACEVIL01056_.mp3
Shut up, old man. Your time is over! The age of the Jedi and the Republic is no more! This is the age of Darth Revan and the Sith!;NM44ACEVIL01057_.mp3
Don't do this, kid. I don't want to, but I'll fight you if I have to. Even if it costs me my life.;NM44ACEVIL01058_.mp3
I am the Lord of the Sith! Bow down before me!;
A true Jedi will never bow down to the Sith. If this is your decision I have no choice but to do battle against you.;NM44ACEVIL01060_.mp3
Kill her! Rend her flesh! Show her the fate of all who dare stand against us! Embrace the power of the dark side!;NM44ACEVIL01061_.mp3
No, I will not kill my friend. I reject the power of the dark side.;
Death to the Jedi!;
Yes! The sacrificial blood will consecrate this ancient temple in the name of the Sith! With the death of the Jedi the rebirth of Darth Revan will be complete!;NM44ACEVIL01067_.mp3
I'm a Jedi... I'll never bow down to the Sith. If you go through with this I have no choice but to do battle against you.;NM44ACEVIL01064_.mp3
Kill him! Grind his old bones to dust! Show him the fate of all who dare stand against us! Embrace the dark side!;NM44ACEVIL01065_.mp3
Then you must die!;
You... you're right. I cannot do this. I reject the dark side!;
No! Do not walk down this path... it can only lead to destruction! I know of what I speak!;NM44ACEVIL01069_.mp3
Shut up, Juhani! You know nothing of the dark side's true potential! When you felt its touch you fled to a cave and cowered in terror!;NM44ACEVIL01070_.mp3
I have no wish to fight you and Bastila, but if you choose to walk down this path you know I must stand against you... even at the cost of my life.;NM44ACEVIL01071_.mp3
How do I know you won't betray me?;
I need deny my passions no longer, Revan. I would stand by your side gladly, as your lover and apprentice!;NM44ACEVIL01073_.mp3
I swore allegiance to Malak only because I thought you had lost the power you had once wielded. But this... this would be much better.;NM44ACEVIL01074_.mp3
I would be utterly yours, master! Together we would destroy Malak and you would reclaim the mantle of Dark Lord!;NM44ACEVIL01075_.mp3
No, I... don't want you like this. I want the woman I knew.;
Turn away from this path, Bastila. The dark side leads only to destruction.;
It's not to late for you, Bastila. The dark side is evil but it isn't all powerful. You can still fight against it. Don't let it consume you.;NM44ACEVIL01053_.mp3
You are beneath my contempt, old man! You hid like a coward for decades on Kashyyyk! You know nothing about the true potential of the Force!;NM44ACEVIL01054_.mp3
I don't trust you. I think I'll just kill you instead!;
No! This is the way of the dark side! Do not give in to the anger and hatred!;NM44ACEVIL01083_.mp3
No! Don't give into your anger. Remain calm, remain focused. Don't let her twist your mind like this!;NM44ACEVIL01080_.mp3
It is your power that will keep me as your loyal apprentice, Revan. I swore allegiance to Malak only because I thought you had lost the power you once wielded.;NM44ACEVIL01077_.mp3
"But you have proven yourself in our battle; I see you possess the strength to destroy Malak and reclaim the mantle of Dark Lord. Now I see you will make a worthy Sith Master.";NM44ACEVIL01078_.mp3
How can I reclaim my identity if I can't even remember it?;
No! This isn't the Bastila I knew!;
Of course not! I have been reborn in the wake of destiny... *your* destiny! The power of the dark side is yours by right!;NM44ACEVIL01086_.mp3
What are you saying, Bastila?;
If I am so powerful, then why do you serve another master?;
Then why don't we join our power together, as it was meant to be?;
There is no link between us, Bastila! Not anymore!;
Our bond is not easily broken, Revan. Even when your mind was destroyed and reprogrammed with a new identity the bond between us endured.;NM44ACEVIL01091_.mp3
We are linked by more than just a bond, Bastila.;
Do not mistake the power of the Force for love, Revan. It does not exist. Power is what forged our bond, and power is what made us both tools of the Jedi Council!;NM44ACEVIL01093_.mp3
Don't call me that. I'm not Revan anymore. I'm <FullName> now.;
Now you see the power of the true Dark Lord!;
"Yes, Revan! I was there when you almost died in the trap set by the Jedi Council; I used the Force to preserve your life. We are forever linked by my actions on that bridge.";NM44ACEVIL01096_.mp3
The Council tried to exploit our bond. They hoped your memories would lead me to the Star Forge. But in our shared visions of the Star Maps I also tasted the power of the taint within you!;NM44ACEVIL01097_.mp3
Beep beep beep-oop!;NM35AADROI01000_.mp3
You have returned at last, Revan. I was beginning to wonder what had happened to you in the Temple.;
You know me?;
We had met previously when last you entered our enclave, many years ago. You inquired as to my research then as well.;
You came here and gained access to the Temple, and were never heard from again. Some thought you might have betrayed us to the others, but they were never able to penetrate our defenses.;
But if you will help us now, then the time taken is nothing. Is there anything else you require?;
What are you doing?;
What am I doing? You mean, the purpose of my research here?;
What is your research?;
As you may have heard from our historians, in our distant past we melded technology and the Force to create truly wondrous effects.;
We guided ships across the galaxy using our power, and incorporated its use into all aspects of our society.;
But... something happened somewhere.;
What happened?;
There are a variety of theories on what happened. Perhaps we became immune to the effects of the Force from overuse. Perhaps our breeding habits rendered our species insensitive to it over time. None truly know.;
The only discernable result was that we could no longer command the Force as we had. Its power had escaped us.;
With its loss, our technologies could no longer hold us as far above the subjugated races we ruled, and our empire began to crumble. The races we subjugated rose up, plagues swept our worlds... we could do nothing against all these calamities.;
In the end, only the members of our race left here, on our homeworld, survived.;
So what is your research then?;
Every once in a while, there is an individual born who has an affinity for the Force. Maybe not the ability to use it directly, but at least the ability to remain open to it.;
I believe this is a sign that whatever genes our species had that gave us the ability to use the Force are not completely gone. Perhaps when the ancestors of the current tribes fled beneath the surface, some retained this trait.;
We have been working for years to isolate this gene in an attempt to resurrect it in our species as well.;
We of the Elders do not have Force sensitivity ourselves, but by harnessing the genetic structure of other tribes, we hope to be able to breed the gene back into our species.;
You're capturing prisoners... for their genes?;
You make us seem like monsters... Truly we are not.;
We capture them, yes, but only because the tribes have become extremely xenophobic in their millenia trapped on this world. They would not aid us willingly, and killed our messengers when we asked.;
We believe that if we get a large enough genetic sample, we can reintroduce the recessive Force sensitive genes back into our people, allowing us to once again access the heritage of our past.;
Heritage... You mean the Temple?;
Yes, the Temple. It can only be entered by those sensitive to the Force, so it has been barred to us for ages.;
What we may find inside will allow us to lift the other tribes out of the barbarism into which they have fallen and restore us as a productive force in the galaxy.;
You're trying to restore your empire, aren't you!;
No! We do not want to fall down the path that so twisted our people before.;
This time, perhaps we can redeem ourselves in the eyes of the galaxy, and become a force of good.;
How close are you to finishing your research?;
We are quite far along, having had centuries to work already, but with the arrival of another tribe on our island, we have been restricted in our movements to just our enclave.;
We have captured a few of their warriors, but the one that really interests us is their leader... the One.;
The One? What's special about him?;
Those with the genes we seek seem to be marked... Marked with a destiny that causes them to rise above others as we did as a species early on.;
In hearing the stories his warriors tell of the One, we believe that he may hold some of the genes we seek. He may be nearing Force sensitivity.;
Unfortunately, he and his people are much too aggressive and violent for us to ever get close enough to study him. His corpse would not do either, as only a living, working body is of use to us.;
Maybe in time, though, the differences between our peoples will lessen enough that we may study one another and gain the information we need.;
What kind of information do you need?;
Genetic data on drifts and changes over the many millenia we have been here. Specific data on exceptional individuals.;
If only we had access to the knowledge of our ancestors... They must have known much, much more than us. They had a much greater population sample to work with.;
I believe that in the Temple there may be the information we seek. Perhaps in old archives or scrolls... maybe even in an ancient computer if any is still functioning.;
This information would help us greatly in our work, and we would be very grateful to you for it.;
Is there anything else I can help you with?;
Tell me about your research again.;
What do you know about the Temple?;
It is ancient, that we know. And it is guarded by advanced technology that only Force sensitive races can penetrate.;
Recently we have seen ships coming and going from it, similar in design to ones that came at about the same time you did many years ago.;
Other than that, we do not know... although we would dearly like to find out.;
I have to go now.;
Very well then. Come and go as you please.;
How could I help with your research?;
I don't know if your eugenics program is a good thing...;
We would not revert to our old ways, rest assured, Revan. We merely seek data on genetic drifts and changes in the millenia of our imprisonment here.;
How can you find these genes?;
Do any of these warriors have what you're looking for?;
You want to reunite the tribes?;
Unite the tribes and take our place in the galaxy at large.;
I don't know how the Republic and the Sith would see you...;
That is a worry, but we hope that our good intentions will let them accept us...;
You're trying to rebuild your genetic structure?;
Why don't you just ask them for help?;
No Rakata can use the Force?;
I don't need to hear this.;
Perhaps not, but it is critical to my explanation of my work.;
When my species began to lose control over the Force, the power we had held over the subject races began to decay, along with our empire. The races we subjugated rose up, plagues swept our worlds... we could do nothing against all these calamities.;
I've heard this before.;
Yes, likely you have.;
Why do you have these prisoners?;
You know damn well what I'm asking!;
Yes, yes, my research.;
I don't have time to talk.;
Nothing much happened...;
Indeed... Nothing much happened for many years it seems.;
You have done our people a great service here, Revan, but your destiny lies elsewhere. May the blessings of the Elders go with you.;
Yes, Revan? Is there anything I can help you with?;
I have found data on the genetic structure of your species.;
You... you have! Thank you! Thank you, Revan!;
This data will aid us greatly in our research.;

I...;NM14AAC86901000_.mp3
Aren't you just a sweet little droid, yes you are!;NM14AAC86901001_.mp3
I demand justice! The Sandral family is a blight upon Dantooine! They must be punished!;NM13AAAHLA03000_.mp3
The Council will look into this matter, Mr. Matale. You must be patient. Your accusations have no proof, and we do not want you stirring up trouble with the Sandrals if there is some mistake.;NM13AAAHLA03001_.mp3
Mistake? My son Shen is missing! How can there be any doubt the Sandrals are to blame?;NM13AAAHLA03002_.mp3
There are other possible explanations for your son's disappearance.;NM13AAAHLA03003_.mp3
Bah! You Jedi are good for nothing but talk! I shall only wait so long before I take action on my own!;NM13AAAHLA03004_.mp3
As dangerous as the threat from Darth Malak and the Sith may be, we Jedi cannot simply abandon our other responsibilities. The Council has promised Alhan Matale we will look into his son's disappearance.;NM13AAAHLA03005_.mp3
Should you have time, Padawan, you may want to investigate this matter.;NM13AAAHLA03006_.mp3
I shall look into it at once.;
If Shen Matale is not returned to his father it may ignite a savage and bloody feud between the Matale and Sandral estates. We must not allow that to happen.;NM13AAAHLA03008_.mp3
Your study and training are important, of course. But the Jedi are not a cloistered Order. Our influence and teachings must spread beyond the walls of our Academies.;NM13AAAHLA03011_.mp3
It is in the real world that we truly prove ourselves worthy of the title Jedi. You would do well to remember this, young Padawan.;NM13AAAHLA03012_.mp3
Not to mention that I wouldn't mind getting out of this enclave for a bit. I mean, come on, how bad could it be?;NM13AAAHLA03013_.mp3
This task has its own importance. It may also serve to divert our minds for a short time... something which carries its own rewards.;NM13AAAHLA03014_.mp3
But what about my Jedi training?;
I have more important things to do!;
Is there anything else I should know?;
These two families have been settled here for some years now...;NM13AAAHLA03016_.mp3
And causing me no end of trouble!;NM13AAAHLA03017_.mp3
Indeed. They have been settled here for some time and feuding ever since.;NM13AAAHLA03018_.mp3
What caused this feud?;
I do not know how the original feud started, but they want nothing to do with each other.;NM13AAAHLA03020_.mp3
As you may have heard, Ahlan Matale believes that his son, Shen, has been kidnapped by Nurik Sandral.;NM13AAAHLA03021_.mp3
Curiously, Nurik's son Casus has been missing for some time as well... I fear Nurik may suspect Ahlan in this...;NM13AAAHLA03022_.mp3
Is there anything else you wish to know?;NM13AAAHLA03023_.mp3
Which families are involved?;
The Sandral and Matale families are involved.;NM13AAAHLA03025_.mp3
The Sandrals live far to the south. The head of that family is Nurik Sandral. He is a stern man, but I believe him fair. Under the present circumstances, though... who knows?;NM13AAAHLA03026_.mp3
Ahlan Matale can be much more unstable. He is convinced of his own importance and can be a most... oppressive individual at times. He lives closer to the enclave, but still to the south.;NM13AAAHLA03027_.mp3
Where are they settled?;
Both families have settled to the south of this enclave. The Matales are the closer of the two.;NM13AAAHLA03030_.mp3
Both have similar estates, but Ahlan is much more paranoid about his and guards it quite heavily.;NM13AAAHLA03031_.mp3
Is there anything else you wish to know?;NM13AAAHLA03032_.mp3
I shall investigate this immediately.;
I will investigate if there is time.;
I must continue on my main mission.;
Why are you bothering me? I am here to speak with the Council, not some servant! Please leave or I shall be forced to tell the Council of your rude behavior!;NM13AAAHLA03036_.mp3
Greetings human, and welcome to the Ahto City Visitor's Provisional Stand. We are here to provide visitors with all manner of indigenous treats and products produced right here on Manaan.;
We carry all manner of foods and provisions, and have contacts with resellers across the world to provide you, the customer, with the best shopping experience possible.;
How is it that the Ahto City Provisional Company can help you today?;
Tell me about Ahto City.;
Ahto City is the center of trade and commerce for all of Manaan. Indeed, for this entire sector! It is the only known source of kolto in the galaxy, and thus one of its most important worlds.;
This city was constructed by we Selkath so that other races and cultures could experience the wonders that Manaan has to offer.;
Tell me about Manaan.;
Manaan is the homeworld of we Selkath. It is here that our race has lived and thrived for uncounted millenia. With our valuable supply of kolto, we have become an important player in intragalactic politics.;
We have taken a neutral stance in the current galactic war between the Sith and the Republic as we believe that violence is not a permanent solution.;
Is there another way in which I can assist you?;
Let me see your inventory.;
Of course. The Ahto City Visitor's Provisional Stand is here to service you, the customer.;
Nothing for now.;
Rest assured that as long as Manaan is here, the Ahto City Provisional Company will be here to serve your needs. Good day to you, sentient.;
I will be leaving now.;
You are not welcome in this city anymore, human, but we cannot deny you entry either.  Therefore, I am obliged to treat you as I do my other customers.;
You're that friend of Griff, right? He gave me a message for you.;
I don't like the sound of this.;NM17AG01GR02001_.mp3
He told me to tell you that he made a mistake brewing the Tarisian ale. It didn't work out right for some reason.;
What kind of mistake?;
He told me the tach gland was ruined. And he said he wasn't going to stick around and have to face his Exchange contact.;
You mean he's gone?;
He hopped on board the last shuttle. I don't know where he was heading, but I can't say I'm sorry he's gone.;
He was one of the worst employees I ever had. He was always on a break, he mixed up orders and I think he might have been stealing from me.;
I have to go after him!;
People like Griff, they know how to disappear when they get in too deep. You won't hear from him again any time soon. Waste of time to even bother looking for him.;
Damn it, Griff - won't you ever learn? How can my own flesh and blood be so stupid!;NM17AG01GR02012_.mp3
There was one last thing. He said to tell his sister goodbye. And to tell her he's sorry.;
That cheapskate owes me credits!;
You and a dozen others. I was smart enough not to give him an advance on his wage, but you can kiss your credits goodbye.;
Good riddance!;
You just let him go?;
Did he say where he was going?;
I'm not surprised. Anything else?;
Yes? What is it? If this is about mining or Sand People, you go to the Czerka officers. I just manage the storehouse.;
What do you have available for purchase?;
Was there something specific you were looking for? You seem like you are looking for unique things.;
Do you have any moisture vaporators?;
I may, but that is not something I usually sell to spacers. You don't look like a moisture farmer. What do you want them for?;
To exchange with Sand People to stop their attacks.;
Ah, exactly the kind of appeasement that Czerka Corporation doesn't like to support in their policies. I like it.;
Well, I have two of the finest vaporators that Czerka Corporation produces. Of course, they only produce one model right now.;
The price is 200 for the pair. I'm not sure how you talked me into that ridiculously low bargain, but there it is.;
200 for the moisture vaporators sounds fine to me.;
Fine, fine, I assume you'll be able to handle the deployment of them? They are surprisingly light.;
It's a pleasure doing business with you. Do come again.;
Could you be persuaded to lower the price?;
I really don't think so. I don't know how, but you've already convinced me to lower it as much as I can. It's a good deal.;
I can't pay you right now.;
I'm sorry, but that is as low as I can go. There's nothing I can do about it. Czerka regulations, you know.;
Well, I don't think that's very likely. I have to cover my costs, you know.;
[Persuade] Czerka's costs, not yours. Who cares about their money?;
[Success] Well, I don't have much love for the company, not like little miss Protocol Officer over there.;
I'll lower the price to 200 credits, but that is it. Don't even ask again.;
[Failure] I can't do it. I just can't. You'll have to come up with the money.;
I'll take the moisture vaporators for 400.;
Perhaps I could try to persuade you once more?;
[Force Persuade] You want to lower the price.;
[Success] Of course I want to lower the price, but Czerka regulations... ah, who cares about those, right?;
You'll do as I say. I'm the biggest threat in the room.;
You're a big something, but not so much a threat. That won't work on me, not in the heart of Anchorhead.;
If you did anything in here you wouldn't be safe anywhere. There are guards everywhere. Look, let's just do some honest business.;
The price is 400 credits for the pair. I won't break them up. They function best when linked together.;
That's not really your concern, is it?;
No, I suppose not. It wouldn't have mattered. Well, let me tell you what I have, then.;
You just show me what you have. Don't risk angering me!;
Of course, of course, I'll show you what I have, but don't push your luck with those threats. It's not polite.;
No, just your normal fare.;
Take a look. The best stocked storehouse on Tatooine. Not that that's saying much.;
Mostly just standard Czerka provisions and supplies. Not enough to keep the locals happy. Have a look.;
I want to ask about bounties.;
Not my affair. You want to hunt for Czerka Corporation you talk to the Protocol Officer.;
I want to ask about Czerka Corporation.;
Then go ask a Czerka officer. I just collect my credits at the end of the day, just like the miners or guards.;
Do you know about their operations on Kashyyyk?;
Their operations on Kashyyyk are in more trouble than you or I could ever give them. Of course, they would never admit that.;
I don't much care about how Czerka operates, but I get a chuckle out of anything that gives them grief.;
How do you think they are doing here on Tatooine?;
It doesn't matter what I think. Maybe they'll pull out, maybe they won't. I'll man the store on the next rock.;
Let's go back to my first questions.;
Very well, though I do have work to get back to.;
Anything out of the ordinary happening?;
I hear the Sith are wasting their efforts fighting among themselves when they should be getting things done. Like they did on Taris.;
Okay, what about local events?;
Don't care about them. I stay in the Czerka compound. We could be on a pleasure world, for all I care or know.;
What about your opinions on Taris?;
You know what? At least the Sith seem to make things happen. How old is the Republic? 15,000 years? It's stagnant.;
Every year ships get a little faster, droids get a little smarter, and people get a little fatter. That's about it for progress.;
I suspect I'd do just as much grunt-labor under them as I do now. They'll at least shake things up.;
Even if it means the deaths of innocents?;
Nobody's innocent once their mother has left the room. That's just my view.;
I have to go. Goodbye.;
Bye then. Come back if you need any supplies.;
"You like change; that's good.";
You say that like you know something. Well, keep it to yourself. I like to watch this change from a distance, thanks.;
Well, it's odd that I'm talking to the Manaan Sector Champion, but with Taris gone you likely don't have much choice about where to race.;
Well, the cost increase of kolto is downright weird. Maybe the Selkath think the destruction of Taris scared people enough they will pay inflated prices for medical supplies.;
Is that a coy way of referring to Taris going down? You don't want my views on that.;
Look, it's not my business what Czerka Corporation does somewhere else. I don't even care what they do *here*.;
And that absolves you of all responsibility?;
Now, what would the officers say? Oh yes. Go talk to the Kiosk on Coruscant. You want to buy something or not?;
Oh, a swoop-jock, hmm? I know I don't have the crazy suicide parts you're looking for.;
You again? You want to buy something? If not, go bother the officers.;
Hold on. The Sith commanders have said I can't let any of you troopers into the cantina while you're on duty.;
I'm not on duty right now.;
No? Then why are you in uniform? Sorry, but you aren't the first trooper to try and sneak in for a quick drink while out on patrol.;
You can come back after your shift if you want. Just remember our rule:;
Don't cause any trouble in Javyar's cantina. You leave your problems and your attitude at the door.;
I'll be going now.;
I can't thank you enough for saving me, up-worlder. If I had anything but these rags on my back it would be yours. But we have nothing.;NM04AAHEND06000_.mp3
I still have you, Hendar. That's all I need. Let's go back to the village.;NM04AAHEND06002_.mp3
Thank you once again for saving me from the rakghouls, up-worlder. I owe you everything.;NM04AAHEND06004_.mp3
As do I, up-worlder. I don't know what I would have done if anything had happened to Hendar.;NM04AAHEND06006_.mp3
Help! It's right behind me! Help!;NM04AAHEND06008_.mp3
You got authorization, you talk to Billan. Otherwise, leave the gate area.;NM17AA11BG03000_.mp3
Don't know why anyone would want to leave. Nothing but sand and death out there.;NM17AA11BG03001_.mp3
If you're fool enough to want to leave, talk to Billan.;NM17AA11BG03002_.mp3
Make sure you are well-armed if you plan to leave. Trust me.;NM17AA11BG03003_.mp3
If you must leave, I wouldn't go out at night. Krayt hunt at night.;NM17AA11BG03004_.mp3
The wraid predators are dangerous out there, but the Sand People are worse.;NM17AA11BG03005_.mp3
The sandcrawlers always come back with damage. Sand People are a constant threat.;NM17AA11BG03006_.mp3
The gate is closed to anyone without authorization.;NM17AA11BG03007_.mp3
I've had enough out of you. You either get Czerka authorization to leave or get out of my space.;NM17AA11GU04000_.mp3
I have proper authorization.;
Well, let's see it. Come on.;NM17AA11GU04004_.mp3
Here is my hunting license.;
All right, I'll just scan that and you're off. I'll keep it on file, too. Good luck out there.;NM17AA11GU04006_.mp3
You'll need it.;NM17AA11GU04007_.mp3
Sorry, I was mistaken.;
Don't waste my time.;NM17AA11GU04009_.mp3
Goodbye.;
No one leaves Anchorhead without proper authorization.;NM17AA11GU04002_.mp3
Where would I get authorization?;
Only one place, and it means dangerous work. Go to the Czerka office for a hunting license. They sell them for Fazza's lodge.;NM17AA11GU04011_.mp3
Tell me about the Czerka office.;
The Czerka Corporation office is in the center of Anchorhead. The Protocol Officer will sell you one. She might offer you other work too.;NM17AA11GU04013_.mp3
What do you know about Fazza's lodge?;
Fazza's is north of the Czerka office. You'll need a hunting license to deal with him. He'll just send you to the Czerka office to get one.;NM17AA11GU04015_.mp3
[Persuade] If it's my risk, why not just let me pass?;
[Success] You know, I agree with you, but Czerka Corporation just doesn't want the headache.;NM17AA11GU04027_.mp3
Besides, I couldn't let you pass if I wanted to. The gate lock needs to be swiped with your authorization. Sorry.;NM17AA11GU04028_.mp3
Why do I need authorization?;
Czerka Coperation does not want the complications or expense that come with people wandering the dunes. It's too dangerous.;NM17AA11GU04019_.mp3
Running this installation is difficult enough without fools wandering around getting themselves killed by Sand People.;NM17AA11GU04020_.mp3
Why does Czerka Corporation think that will cost them?;
Don't get cocky, it has nothing to do with how much *you* are worth. Workers to man the ion shovels are cheap.;NM17AA11GU04022_.mp3
What they don't want is Sand People salvaging your weapons. Their raids cause enough damage as it is.;NM17AA11GU04023_.mp3
[Force Persuade] You want to let me pass. It's my risk.;
[Success] I... I want to let you pass... I really do... but I can't. You can't imagine how sorry I am.;NM17AA11GU04031_.mp3
It's just that... and I'm sick about this... I have to swipe the gate lock with your authorization. I haven't got a choice.;NM17AA11GU04032_.mp3
I'll just go then.;
See the Czerka office for authorization.;NM17AA11GU04037_.mp3
[Failure] That's what you say now, but when the Sand People attack you you'll be screaming for help.;NM17AA11GU04029_.mp3
Let's go back to my first questions.;
Hurry it up, will you? You're not getting through here until I see the proper authorization.;NM17AA11GU04017_.mp3
I go where I want. Show me respect.;
Look, it's for your own good. Czerka Corporation will not accept liability if Sand People run you down.;NM17AA11GU04025_.mp3
Let me pass or this gets bloody!;
Eh, no need for that. I'm just doing my job. Besides, your threats won't help. I need to swipe the gate lock with your authorization.;NM17AA11GU04034_.mp3
I've got no choice, which means you've got no choice. Get authorization from the Czerka office or don't come back.;NM17AA11GU04035_.mp3
Hmm? Oh, it's you again. I'll just let you pass. The boys in the office may need authorization in triplicate, but not me.;NM17AA11GU04038_.mp3
Good hunting out there.;NM17AA11GU04039_.mp3
Is there something specific you wanted?;NM33ABMEKE02000_.mp3
Are you Mekel?;
And what if I am?;NM33ABMEKE02002_.mp3
You have to do something about those men! They're dying!;
That is the whole point! Personally, I think it's wonderful fun... those fools actually think that if they stand there long enough, I'll let them become a Sith.;NM33ABMEKE02004_.mp3
Idiots. A Sith is not a bantha, all endurance and no brains. A Sith would fight for his life, no matter the odds. If these rotgrubs are as stupid as they seem, then they deserve their fate!;NM33ABMEKE02005_.mp3
So this isn't a real test for them?;
Oh, it's a test all right. It's a test to see if they're actually fool enough to die. If they don't, however, I certainly wouldn't admit them just for that accomplishment.;NM33ABMEKE02007_.mp3
Disgusting and barbaric. That these men chose to do this willingly astounds me to no end.;NM33ABMEKE02008_.mp3
Well, you should know better than anyone what some people will do for power, Bastila.;NM33ABMEKE02009_.mp3
And what is that supposed to mean?;NM33ABMEKE02010_.mp3
Well, just that the dark side is quite tempting... or so you always say. What did you think I meant?;NM33ABMEKE02011_.mp3
Never mind what I thought. Just be quiet.;NM33ABMEKE02012_.mp3
Hmm. It is a bit boring standing out here all day, however. I think I'll go for some dinner... it will be fun to think of them while I gorge myself.;NM33ABMEKE02020_.mp3
They'll still be here in an hour or two, surely. I suggest you run along before I decide to make you part of the fun.;NM33ABMEKE02021_.mp3
You should not toy with people's lives!;NM33ABMEKE02013_.mp3
Oh, what a sweet guy. He should get the Sith congeniality medal.;NM33ABMEKE02014_.mp3
He victimizes them, but they are trying to join his vile kind. I'm not sure I would save them.;
Why not just shoot them where they stand? It would at least be more direct.;NM33ABMEKE02016_.mp3
That's what I would do.;NM33ABMEKE02017_.mp3
Of course that's what *you* would do.;NM33ABMEKE02018_.mp3
Observation: Yes, very efficient. It is what I would do.;NM33ABMEKE02019_.mp3
Then I demand you stop this at once!;
*You* demand? Why would I listen to you? I'll do as I please, and if watching these fools starve themselves amuses me, that's what I'll do.;NM33ABMEKE02023_.mp3
Wouldn't it be more merciful just to kill them?;
Perhaps, but where does it say I should be merciful? There'd be no sport in it, anyhow. I want to see if they are really as foolish as I suspected.;NM33ABMEKE02025_.mp3
Sounds like fun.;
Oh, it is. I wonder which one will be the last standing? Should I tell him then that his hopes are in vain, do you think?;NM33ABMEKE02027_.mp3
Why are you making those men stand there?;
Nothing. Never mind.;
Then I trust you'll leave. I think another one of these fools is about to drop, and I don't want to miss it.;NM33ABMEKE02031_.mp3
No, not really.;
Leave me be. Can't you see that I'm busy?;NM33ABMEKE02032_.mp3
Are you one of the Sith from the academy?;
Isn't that obvious? You must be very sharp to possess such an astute sense of perception. Obviously deaf, however, since I asked you to leave.;NM33ABMEKE02034_.mp3
Can I ask you some questions?;
No you may not. I'm busy amusing myself and I'm not going to miss any of the fun. Now get lost before I teach you a lesson.;NM33ABMEKE02036_.mp3
Fine, I'll leave you alone.;
Good. I don't want to miss this for anything, heh...;NM33ABMEKE02038_.mp3
You are not welcome here, human. You have disrupted our production severely and I have no wish to speak to you.;
You are not welcome here, human. You have threatened our world with your actions and I have no wish to speak to you.;
You kind is too disruptive and agressive to speak to, human. We have heard of the incident at the Sith Embassy and wish no further disruptions here.;
Why are you disturbing me? Can you not see I am overseeing the packaging of this kolto?;
I just want to ask you questions.;
I have far more pressing matters than any questions you might have, off-worlder. This kolto is the backbone of Manaan's economy.;
You obviously are in the wrong place, off-worlder. I suggest you visit the courthouse west of here - there you may be of some use to the Selkath instead of a hinderance.;
I'd like to buy some of your kolto.;
The kolto is not mine - I am merely coordinator of this shipment. And you cannot simply 'buy' unrefined kolto!;
Such negotiations are worked out between intergalactic governments and the Ahto City Export Authority. We transact deals in the billions of credits.;
You obviously are in the wrong place, off-worlder. I suggest you leave.;
I think I'll be going now.;
Good! Your intrusion has already wrought havoc upon my hectic schedule.;
Pet the gizka.;
Kill the gizka.;
[Force Choke];
[Force Kill];
[Force Wound];
[Force Drain Life];
[Force Shock];
[Force Lightning];
Leave it alone.;
At last we can regain our place in the galaxy! Our thanks, Revan.;
I hope that you find what you seek in the Temple, Revan, and that you help us as well.;
If you wish to know more about us, speak to our keeper of history.;
There are many unanswered questions about your last trip into the Temple, Revan... but those shall have to wait.;
The other Rakata assaulted us mercilessly... but our defenses drove them back.;
In time, I hope our tribe can unify our race once more.;
I have to thank you again. You really didn't have to save my sorry carcass out there. I appreciate it.;NM17AD03TA06000_.mp3
You know, darling... if there was anything I could do to make it up to you... anything? No, huh?;NM17AD03TA06001_.mp3
I want to ask about you and hunting.;
I don't hunt anymore. I made a deal with you, and I'll stick to it. The others will have to help you.;NM17AD03TA06022_.mp3
Besides... without the wife I can't keep my droids going. But I don't need her. You can tell her that. Yeah.;NM17AD03TA06023_.mp3
I want to ask who you are and what it is you do.;
Sure you do. Tanis can tell you all about the thrill of the hunt, man versus beast. It's all very exciting.;NM17AD03TA06024_.mp3
I'll do my best to make you happy. Ask away.;NM17AD03TA06025_.mp3
Where is the best hunting?;
You're the one that took down a dragon! What could I possibly tell you? My battle droids can't even fight that good.;NM17AD03TA06032_.mp3
You hunt with battle droids? Is that sporting?;
I'm more the practical type, beautiful. I keep myself fed and make sure everything I have is taken care of.;NM17AD03TA06036_.mp3
Some guys will talk about honor and stuff, but they still sell their plates to Fazza. I guess honor needs creds too?;NM17AD03TA06038_.mp3
Don't you need to take more kills to keep your droids running?;
I suppose, but so what? When that resource goes belly-up, I'll just move on. I'm just a wandering spirit, I guess.;NM17AD03TA06040_.mp3
Hmph. Hunting a species to extinction. Now there's a logical way to make a living.;NM17AD03TA06041_.mp3
I'm not real popular with the others, but they just fool themselves. They're in it for the credits too.;NM17AD03TA06042_.mp3
How long have you been at this?;
Too long, but it beats smuggling. You ever run into a Sith dreadnaught in the desert? No, you haven't.;NM17AD03TA06044_.mp3
You crossed paths with a Sith dreadnaught?;
Hell, I married her. Ha ha ha! No, no, seriously now, I had this friend that crossed Sith-space and got stripped of everything.;NM17AD03TA06046_.mp3
It's not like I have much now, I guess, but I still prefer Sand People to getting ambushed on unproven trade routes.;NM17AD03TA06047_.mp3
You go on about your wife a lot. What's the deal?;
"Ah, she doesn't understand me. You know the drill. It's not my fault; she knew who I was when she married me.";NM17AD03TA06049_.mp3
What can you tell me about the other hunters?;
Uptight and cold, like my wife. They don't like me streamlining the hunt with droids. I don't fit in, but I don't let it bug me.;NM17AD03TA06051_.mp3
You know how it is, you don't take any backtalk either. I heard about you and Gurke. I should have you deal with my wife.;NM17AD03TA06052_.mp3
What about the hunters besides the Gamorreans?;
Dorak is reasonable. Komad is a pain, but he keeps his distance. I can tell he doesn't like me much.;NM17AD03TA06062_.mp3
Ask around the lodge if you want information about the other guys. I don't really talk to them much.;NM17AD03TA06063_.mp3
Let's go back to my first questions.;
Fine, fine, whatever you want.;NM17AD03TA06065_.mp3
I'm looking for something. Who knows this planet best?;
Well, darling, old Tanis might be just what you need. Unless you mean the dunes. I suppose only the Sand People really know them.;NM17AD03TA06070_.mp3
I'm sure I can help you. Ask away.;NM17AD03TA06071_.mp3
Have you ever seen the Sand People with anything odd?;
Uh, sure, my blood. They almost got me last year. Tore up two of my battle droids. The wife was mad about that. Heh. Took her weeks to fix.;NM17AD03TA06081_.mp3
Where they got weapons to cut battle armor, I don't know. They act like animals, but they can surprise you.;NM17AD03TA06082_.mp3
Where did this happen?;
I don't know. Pick a dune and walk, they'll get you soon enough.;NM17AD03TA06084_.mp3
What about the Jawas?;
Smart traders. They've salvaged and sold me my own damaged droids once or twice.;NM17AD03TA06086_.mp3
They don't say much I can understand. I think they're a little slow, but who am I to judge, huh? Ha!;NM17AD03TA06087_.mp3
I have to leave. Goodbye.;
You hurry back any old time, darling. Anytime.;NM17AD03TA06089_.mp3
Good hunting.;NM17AD03TA06090_.mp3
It's serious business. I'm sure I can help you through it.;NM17AD03TA06072_.mp3
You are pretty forward for a married man.;
He seems pretty forward, period.;NM17AD03TA06074_.mp3
Ooh, you're a sour one. Loosen up, we're all friends here.;NM17AD03TA06075_.mp3
Perhaps you had best turn your thoughts back to your wife, sir.;NM17AD03TA06076_.mp3
Ah, the old girl doesn't understand me. Her loss. Now, you have questions about Sand People or something?;NM17AD03TA06077_.mp3
Relax, loverboy. Just answer my questions.;
Who knows the planet? I don't know. I guess the Sand People. I'm usually running when I see them, though.;NM17AD03TA06079_.mp3
But I suppose you would want me to do whatever they say. I heard how you rolled over for Gurke and his boys.;NM17AD03TA06055_.mp3
That's not the way to establish yourself, you know? It's hard to earn respect here.;NM17AD03TA06056_.mp3
The Gamorreans are different. Good rowdy drinking buddies. Gurke and his boys, they understand that hunting is a business.;NM17AD03TA06057_.mp3
Of course, they hunt... other things than wraid too. Just don't turn your back on them. Ever.;NM17AD03TA06058_.mp3
What are you suggesting?;
Nothing, nothing at all. Just keep your eyes on them. That's all.;NM17AD03TA06060_.mp3
What do I care? I need to eat. I also need to pay for parts so the wife can keep the droids running. It's all about the credits.;NM17AD03TA06037_.mp3
There isn't any. Too many hunters, not enough prey. I can barely keep expenses covered. Maintenance on battle droids is expensive.;NM17AD03TA06033_.mp3
Of course, it's better than going alone. What if I stumbled on a bunch of Sand People? These solo hunters are crazy.;NM17AD03TA06034_.mp3
What, specifically, would you like me to cover?;NM17AD03TA06026_.mp3
You're pretty forward for a married man.;
Well, the wife doesn't really take much of an interest in my work. Not like you. Now, you have questions?;NM17AD03TA06028_.mp3
Keep your cool, loverboy. Just answer my questions.;
Well, my name is Tanis and what I do is hunt. I'm sure you've heard of me... well, actually, I hope you haven't.;NM17AD03TA06068_.mp3
Hunting is a dirty and tough business. What can old Tanis tell you about it?;NM17AD03TA06030_.mp3
Again? Nothing has changed. It's all just as dirty and tedious as it was before.;NM17AD03TA06066_.mp3
Not that it puts me in debt to you. Because I believe I mentioned how little this job pays.;NM17AD03TA06002_.mp3
What can I do for you, hmm? Did my wife send you? This ain't about credits, is it?;NM17AD03TA06003_.mp3
I'm looking for experts. You seem knowledgeable.;
Well of course, darling, whatever Tanis Venn can do. You know, very few human females come to Tatooine...;NM17AD03TA06005_.mp3
[Force Persuade] Just answer the lady's questions.;NM17AD03TA06006_.mp3
[Success] I should just answer the lady's questions.;NM17AD03TA06007_.mp3
Jolee! Why did you do that?;
I thought it obvious. Should he act like that after mentioning his wife? Greasy little wrench-rat. He asked for it.;NM17AD03TA06009_.mp3
Ask your questions. Please.;NM17AD03TA06018_.mp3
Ha! Thanks, Jolee, but I'm sure I can handle him.;
I have no doubt. I just don't like him. Mentions his wife and then acts like that.;NM17AD03TA06011_.mp3
Jolee! Leave him alone! I'll talk to him myself!;
I only meant to help him clear his thoughts. He's confused if he'll mention a wife and then act like that... the greasy little scavenger.;NM17AD03TA06013_.mp3
Hey! You talk to her with a bit of respect in your voice or you'll end this conversation minus a few teeth! Got it?;NM17AD03TA06014_.mp3
Hey, hey, hey, let's calm down, shall we? No offense was meant. You just go ahead and ask your questions.;NM17AD03TA06015_.mp3
Grrrr!;
Uh, and even fewer accompanied by Wookiees. Whoa big fella. You related to my wife? Now, w-what did you say you wanted?;NM17AD03TA06017_.mp3
Ooh, candy words from a swoop racer. Well, I just feel all warm inside. Save it for the ladies, what do you want?;NM17AD03TA06019_.mp3
Oh, of course. Who put you up to this? My wife? I meant what I said about having no credits.;NM17AD03TA06020_.mp3
I'm just looking to ask a few questions.;
I'll answer, but since when do you swoop riders show much interest in anything besides speed?;NM17AD03TA06092_.mp3
Everyone is looking for something, I suppose one of us should get it. Ask away.;NM17AD03TA06093_.mp3
Maybe it is. What is your life worth?;
Whoa, what did you say? You know, I come here because the guards stop your kind of trouble before it starts.;NM17AD03TA06095_.mp3
[Force Persuade] You aren't worth my time. Leave.;
[Success] [His mind is simple to manipulate. His face goes blank, then recovers as he assumes the suggestion was something he wanted to do anyway.];
I'm not wasting ammunition on a fight with you. I've wraid to hunt. We meet on the dunes... you watch out.;NM17AD03TA06103_.mp3
[Force Persuade] You like me. You want to give me credits.;
[Success] You seem like a good sort. Here, how about I buy you a few rounds?;NM17AD03TA06097_.mp3
Wait... I never do that. Why... why does my head hurt? Something strange is going on here.;NM17AD03TA06098_.mp3
I'm leaving. I don't much like newcomers anyway.;NM17AD03TA06099_.mp3
[Failure] Uh, no I don't and no I don't. What do you think you are, a Jedi? Heh. That's a laugh.;NM17AD03TA06100_.mp3
Not fast enough to stop me killing you.;
Well, actually, they probably are, but I'll save you the trouble of testing it. I'm leaving.;NM17AD03TA06102_.mp3
I didn't mean anything. Just scaring you.;
It's more annoying than anything. You shouldn't make threats you don't want returned. Bad move.;NM17AD03TA06105_.mp3
Well, hello dragon killer! I should have you deal with the wife. You know, because she's scary? Like a dragon? Ah, forget it.;NM17AD03TA06106_.mp3
Give me credits before I kill you.;
Hello again. Tired of the swoop track? What can I do for you?;NM17AD03TA06108_.mp3
You can give me credits before I decide to kill you.;
Hello again. Something else I can do for you? Slow night? Day? Whatever?;NM17AD03TA06110_.mp3
Greetings again to you, human. It would seem the call of the hunt has brought us both to this troubled world.;
I have not been here long, but I can already see I will not be as welcome here as I had hoped.;
What are you doing here, Komad? Following me?;
While I'm sure you would prove an interesting hunt, I don't track sentient prey. Two-legged animals do a fine job of killing each other without me.;
I have come here to seek even greater prey than what we faced on Tatooine, but the climate here is politically cold, and I don't know if I will be allowed to hunt.;
Whose permission are you looking for?;
An astute question. Czerka Corporation seems in control here, but they don't care if I wander the Shadowlands, so long as I have paid their docking fee.;
"Instead, I hope to gain the trust of the native Wookiee population. I'm not here to just kill the biggest thing I can find; I want to understand how they hunt.";
What are you doing to gain their trust?;
Very little. I'm sure they have had enough of off-worlders like the Czerka claiming good intentions. I will simply try to stay out of their way.;
I have heard of an off-worlder that has gained respect by living in the Shadowlands for some years. Perhaps I will attempt the same. It could just be hunter tales, though.;
What do you know of Kashyyyk?;
I know that I don't know enough. Even from this docking area I can see this world is a true wonder. My desert-dimmed imagination didn't do it justice.;
It's just a shame to see Czerka Corporation here. They lack an appreciation for the wild nature of this world. I don't like having to deal with them.;
I'm looking for a Star Map here. Have you heard anything?;
No, but I wasn't listening for such talk. I'm sorry that I can't help you.;
If not Czerka, who would you prefer to deal with?;
The native leadership of the Wookiees, of course. This is their world, after all. I can't understand why thy have allowed it to be misused.;
Perhaps they had no choice.;
There is always the option to fight, even if there is no option to win. Of course, that is easy for me to say, being an outsider.;
I would hope they are not complicit in the enslaving of their world, but it is not my place to judge. I have only just arrived.;
I have to leave. Goodbye.;
Farewell. Perhaps we will meet again. A great hunt on this world would be glorious.;
Why did you leave your home on Tatooine?;
It was a hard decision, but I felt I had no other choice. I had done a disservice to the apex predator of that world. It was time to go.;
Another time, human. I wish you well on this world.;
Greetings, friend. I think I can safely assume you are a member of the Jedi Order. Has the Council agreed to hear our petition?;NM14AASETT11000_.mp3
I am merely an apprentice, not a Jedi.;
Ah. I'm sorry. I was mistaken.;NM14AASETT11002_.mp3
Does the Council require our presence?;NM14AASETT11003_.mp3
Yes, they are waiting for you now.;
Ah! Yes, thank you, Master Jedi.;NM14AASETT11005_.mp3
Stay here Rilka, I'll be back in an hour or so.;NM14AASETT11006_.mp3
Yes, dear. Good luck.;NM14AASETT11007_.mp3
I am sorry. I do not know.;
Oh, I see. I am mistaken.;NM14AASETT11009_.mp3
How may I be of assistance?;NM14AASETT11015_.mp3
Who are you?;
My name is Gar. Me and my fine wife Rilka here...;NM14AASETT11017_.mp3
A pleasure.;NM14AASETT11018_.mp3
... live on one of the northern farms. But the kath hounds and the Mandalorian problem has been getting really bad of late, and we're here to ask the Jedi Council to help.;NM14AASETT11019_.mp3
You mentioned kath hounds?;
Recently the kath hounds have been acting much more aggressively. They've even attacked some of the settlers!;NM14AASETT11021_.mp3
Those Mandalorian raiders have been milking the outlying farms dry, too... I hear Jon got hit really bad. Too bad about his daughter.;NM14AASETT11022_.mp3
He should have been protecting her better if he wanted to keep her.;NM14AASETT11023_.mp3
Don't be so heartless, Mandalorian.;NM14AASETT11024_.mp3
I'm not sure exactly what the Council will do about it, but we need some help with this. I only hope they'll listen to me...;NM14AASETT11026_.mp3
Is there anything else you require?;NM14AASETT11027_.mp3
Mandalorians? Here?;
Ever since the Republic beat them years ago, little groups have been roaming all over the place.;NM14AASETT11032_.mp3
They're pathetic. They're taking scraps when they should be taking worlds.;NM14AASETT11033_.mp3
With the Sith invasion, the Republic doesn't have the manpower to hunt them down.;NM14AASETT11034_.mp3
The Jedi are even worse off because Malak has been hunting them specifically.;NM14AASETT11035_.mp3
They're worried that he might even be supporting these raiders, so don't want to face them directly. That puts us in a kind of hard situation.;NM14AASETT11036_.mp3
Is there anything else I can help you with?;NM14AASETT11037_.mp3
What can you tell me about Dantooine?;
Well, as you can see here, Dantooine is mostly plains and grassland, but it has nice hearty soil. A lot of new people have come in the last generation or so.;NM14AASETT11039_.mp3
Hm... the ones you'll most likely hear about are the Sandrals and Matales. Big, wealthy land-owners, both of them.;NM14AASETT11040_.mp3
But Ahlan Matale and Nurik Sandral just can't seem to get along, and now Ahlan wants to get the Council to do something.;NM14AASETT11041_.mp3
Do something? Has something happened?;
Well... from what I hear it started about a week ago. See, Nurik's son Casus is an archeologist, bright lad too, but he disappeared. Nurik of course blamed Ahlan, but even he didn't take it before the Council.;NM14AASETT11043_.mp3
But now Ahlan's son Shen has disappeared as well... and no one knows where he's gone. Ahlan blames Nurik. He thinks he's kidnapped his son.;NM14AASETT11044_.mp3
I don't know exactly what he wants to ask the Council, but from what I know of Ahlan, he's probably going to be after blood...;NM14AASETT11045_.mp3
I would like to ask you something else.;
I must be going now.;
Farewell, then. May the Force be with you, is that how it goes? Yes, may the Force be with you.;NM14AASETT11049_.mp3
What about Jon and his daughter?;
His daughter was killed by Mandalorians when their farm was raided. He's been taking it pretty hard. If you want to ask him about it, he's just north of here. It's not my place to say anything else.;NM14AASETT11029_.mp3
Mandalorian beast! Some of us don't like fighting and killing and butchering as much as you!;NM14AASETT11025_.mp3
Are there many farms here on Dantooine?;
I don't know anything. Leave me alone.;
Ve... very well. Thank you, Master Jedi.;NM14AASETT11011_.mp3
How may I be of assistance, Master Jedi?;NM14AASETT11012_.mp3
I am not a Jedi Master yet.;
Ah, but you are still a Jedi.;NM14AASETT11014_.mp3
I can't thank you enough for saving me, up-worlder. If I had anything but these rags on my back it would be yours. But we have nothing.;NM04AAOUTW22000_.mp3
I still have you, Hendar. That's all I need. Let's go back to the village.;NM04AAOUTW22002_.mp3
Thank you once again for saving me from the rakghouls, up-worlder. I owe you everything.;NM04AAOUTW22004_.mp3
As do I, up-worlder. I don't know what I would have done if anything had happened to Hendar.;NM04AAOUTW22006_.mp3
Don't speak to me, up-worlder! You could have saved Hendar. You just stood and watched him die!;NM04AAOUTW22008_.mp3
You're as selfish as all the rest from the surface! Please, just leave me alone with my grief.;NM04AAOUTW22010_.mp3
No! Hendar - no!;NM04AAOUTW22023_.mp3
Please, make him open the gate. Hendar will die if he doesn't!;NM04AAOUTW22012_.mp3
I can't open the gate... not while the rakghouls are so near.;NM04AAOUTW22014_.mp3
Open the gate... I will kill the rakghouls.;
You would risk your life for a stranger? Heh. You are brave, up-worlder.;NM04AAOUTW22016_.mp3
I will open the gate for you, but you've got be quick. In a few seconds I must close and lock it again.;NM04AAOUTW22018_.mp3
You're right, it's too dangerous. Leave the gate closed.;
I'm sorry, Hester - there's nothing we can do. It's too late for Hendar now.;NM04AAOUTW22021_.mp3
Keep the gate closed. I'm not risking my life here.;
You monster! How can you say that? Somebody do something!;NM04AAOUTW22026_.mp3
Hurry - while the gate is still open! You must save Hendar!;NM04AAOUTW22028_.mp3
Hurry, Hendar, hurry! I can hear it coming!;NM04AAOUTW22030_.mp3
He'll never make it. He's doomed. Argh! I told him he was a fool to leave the village.;NM04AAOUTW22032_.mp3
He WILL make it! Run, Hendar! Run!;NM04AAOUTW22034_.mp3
Open the gate! Quickly! There isn't much time!;NM04AAOUTW22036_.mp3
Ugh... I... I can't... the rakghouls are too close!;NM04AAOUTW22038_.mp3
The mutants will kill him if you don't open the gate!;NM04AAOUTW22040_.mp3
And if I open the gate they will kill us all!;NM04AAOUTW22042_.mp3
No! You can't do this! It isn't fair!;NM04AAOUTW22044_.mp3
You're one of them Sith, ain't you? My mommy says I'm not supposed to talk to you.;NM02ADCHIL04000_.mp3
Is you one of the Sith? My daddy says the Sith are nothing but bullies. You don't look like a bully.;NM02ADCHIL04004_.mp3
My Momma says I have to stay out of the Lower City. That's where bad people live.;NM02ADCHIL04006_.mp3
You ever seen a swoop bike? I seen them at the races sometimes. They go fast and make lots of noise!;NM02ADCHIL04008_.mp3
No offence, but I could have done better than you on that last race. As a true fan, I know how to do these things right.;NM26ABSWOO25001_.mp3
You didn't look too good out there on that last run. I guess everyone has their bad days.;NM26ABSWOO25002_.mp3
You sure you're cut out for this league of racing? Maybe the stress of it is getting to you.;NM26ABSWOO25003_.mp3
I don't believe it! Who'd have thought Queedle had it in him?;NM26ABSWOO25004_.mp3
A new Champion! And it's Queedle! I knew he could do it with a decent swoop under him.;NM26ABSWOO25005_.mp3
How about that? Queedle, a local racer, showing those pros how it's done!;NM26ABSWOO25006_.mp3
I cheer for Queedle now that he's winning. It would take an amazing racer to win me away.;NM26ABSWOO25007_.mp3
You here to cheer Casandra? She's a fine racer. I hope she knocks Hukta out of the running.;NM26ABSWOO25008_.mp3
Hukta Jax is insane. He just smashes through everything to the finish. I guess we should expect that from a Gamorrean?;NM26ABSWOO25009_.mp3
We need more rules about overpowered bikes. Hukta just rides over everything. It's boring watching him.;NM26ABSWOO25010_.mp3
Queedle is the local favorite. You should cheer along with us. He needs the encouragement.;NM26ABSWOO25011_.mp3
You're pretty good. Maybe I should start putting some credits on your races.;NM26ABSWOO25012_.mp3
I guess you've got what it takes to advance. The odds against you winning are getting better.;NM26ABSWOO25013_.mp3
The second round always has experienced riders. You'll be up against some tough times.;NM26ABSWOO25014_.mp3
You're up against the second round times now. That's a hard round to beat.;NM26ABSWOO25015_.mp3
Some of the racers are having a bad time here on Manaan. Seems like you have all the luck right now.;NM26ABSWOO25016_.mp3
Some of the other fans didn't think you could reach the second round, but I knew you would all along.;NM26ABSWOO25017_.mp3
Are you sure you're up to challenging the third round time? I mean, you're good, but are you that good?;NM26ABSWOO25018_.mp3
I'm putting all my credits on you. You're a sure thing.;NM26ABSWOO25019_.mp3
Whew, that was an exciting time you turned in. Noboby else had a chance.;NM26ABSWOO25020_.mp3
Good race, Sector Champion. I guess you'll be off to the big tracks, once the circuit is back up.;NM26ABSWOO25021_.mp3
Wow, I bet you could have won on Taris with times like that. It's a shame we'll never know.;NM26ABSWOO25022_.mp3
Could I get an autoprint? You've just had the quickest rise to Sector Champion that I've ever seen.;NM26ABSWOO25023_.mp3
It's amazing what you've accomplished here, and you've done it with such style. I've never met a woman like you.;NM26ABSWOO25024_.mp3
You sure put Hukta in his place. I don't have to say that you are a much more appealing champion.;NM26ABSWOO25025_.mp3
I haven't seen a race like that in years. Well, there was Gandroff on Coruscant, but he lacked your... charms.;NM26ABSWOO25026_.mp3
You are amazing out on the course... and in person. Congratulations.;NM26ABSWOO25027_.mp3
It's really strange. Nobody seems to know where Master Uthar or Yuthura Ban have disappeared to. Some of the sensitives are claiming they're dead.;NM35AASITH14000_.mp3
Rumor has it that something has happened to Master Uthar and Yuthura Ban. Do you know anything?;NM35AASITH14002_.mp3
I heard that Yuthura Ban was dead. I suppose that means Master Uthar will be taking a new apprentice, soon.;NM35AASITH14004_.mp3
Did you hear? Yuthura is dead. Master Uthar said so. I bet she got too impatient and failed to assassinate him. Idiot.;NM35AASITH14006_.mp3
Master Yuthura has taken over the academy. Everyone's talking about it! I guess she finally got rid of Uthar, somehow.;NM35AASITH14008_.mp3
Have you heard? Yuthura... I mean Master Yuthura has taken over the academy! Well done, I say!;NM35AASITH14010_.mp3
You aren't even a full Sith. Don't bother me.;NM35AASITH14012_.mp3
Get out of my way. I don't have time to deal with hopefuls.;NM35AASITH14014_.mp3
Come back when you've taken your final test. If you survive it.;NM35AASITH14016_.mp3
If Master Uthar gives you an order, you'd better follow it. There were some students who disobeyed him and now they're hiding out on the surface somewhere.;NM35AASITH14018_.mp3
There are some students in hiding that refused to follow an order. Master Uthar wants them found and dead... and is offering a reward for it, too!;NM35AASITH14020_.mp3
Just be careful if you go into the valley. I hear there's a hermit living in the hills that kidnaps students.;NM35AASITH14022_.mp3
The former master of the academy, Jorak Uln, is supposedly hiding out in the hills on the surface as some kind of mad hermit.;NM35AASITH14024_.mp3
Word is that one of our experimental droids went mad and escaped and is hiding in the ruins. I wonder why we don't just gather it up and destroy it?;NM35AASITH14026_.mp3
One of my friends went to find that crazy droid that's hiding in the ruins in the valley. He hasn't come back, yet.;NM35AASITH14028_.mp3
Ha! It's great to be on the winning side, isn't it? We've been crushing the Republic at every battle so far!;NM35AASITH14030_.mp3
The latest reports say the Republic is on the run. Before long the Sith will be ruling the entire galaxy.;NM35AASITH14032_.mp3
Darth Malak is one of the greatest Sith leaders ever. I hope he comes back to the academy before I leave.;NM35AASITH14034_.mp3
It is my most fervent hope to serve under Darth Malak once my training is complete. Don't you feel the same?;NM35AASITH14036_.mp3
Rumor around the academy is that you had something to do with those rebel students being caught, finally. They got what they deserved, I say.;NM35AASITH14038_.mp3
I was told that you actually met the old master of the academy, Jorak. Is the hermit as mad as they say?;NM35AASITH14040_.mp3
The buzz is that you took care of that crazy droid out in the ruins. That's pretty impressive.;NM35AASITH14042_.mp3
Hmm. So you got enough prestige to win out, I hear. We'll just see if you make it through your final test.;NM35AASITH14044_.mp3
Sorry, I don't have time to speak. My training awaits.;NM35AASITH14046_.mp3

Greetings, human. I am called Bwa'lass, and I have been selected as your Arbiter for the duration of your trial.;
Arbiter?;
Yes, Arbiter. The one who defends you before the judges of the Selkath people.;
I will endeavor to prove to them that you are not guilty of the heinous crimes that you are accused of, off-worlder.;
I don't need anyone to represent me!;
While it is true that you do have that right, I would recommend against it. Due to your confinement, you have not had much of a chance to build up evidence to pursue your case.;
Also, I do not believe you off-worlders truly understand the minds of we Selkath. It would be best if you left your defence up to me.;
How will you get me free?;
I would first like to ask you a few questions regarding the events that led up to your arrest.;
I have already been given all relevant data on you and your companions, so that can be disregarded. For what reason did you enter the Sith Embassy?;
I was invited.;
Indeed... That would explain the reason a passcard for entry was found on your person.;
What is your prior association with the Sith?;
I have no prior association.;
Indeed... Since you have a passcard to their base, I can only assume you believe taking this route would lessen your sentence... Very well.;
That should be all the information I require of you, for now. If you wish, we can begin the trial whenever you are ready.;
Um... Don't you need to ask more questions?;
I have all the information I need. We should proceed now, the judges are waiting.;
How can you expect to defend me without getting more information?;
I think this trial is relatively straight forward. It should be obvious to the judges what has transpired.;
Let's get the trial started.;
Very well, we shall proceed to the courtroom.;
While your... special position bears heavily on our minds, we cannot ignore the blatancy with which you have violated our laws.;
You stand accused of the grievous murder of many Sith, and extensive property damage to their Embassy here.;
How do you plead?;
Not guilty.;
Let the record show that this trial has commenced. Presiding are judges Shelkar...;
Jhosa...;
Naleshekan...;
Kota...;
and Duula.;
This trial is to determine the culpability and punishment of this individual in the recent assault on the Sith Embassy.;
Given the severity of this trial, we can dispense with the normal formalities of the court and proceed directly.;
You have pleaded not guilty, yet there were reports of weaponsfire and detonations from within the Sith Embassy.;
You were seen entering and leaving the Embassy. The Sith have not conferred with the authorities about this matter, but from all available evidence, it would seem that you are the source of the disturbance.;
What is your explanation for being in the Sith Embassy?;
The Sith lured me inside.;
Indeed. I am most skeptical of this statement.;
But it may be true... How was it they lured you inside? What bait did they use?;
I was there for diplomatic negotiations.;
I am skeptical of this assertion... but it does seem in the character of the Sith to reneg on their commitments.;
There have been many provocations before this! Their character is well known!;
Indeed, but that is not an issue for outsiders to hear.;
We will adjourn to debate your story and the charges brought against you.;
We have reviewed your case and decided that there is not enough evidence to convict you of this crime.;
The provocations of the Sith are well known, and we will be issuing a memo of censure against them. Their Embassy is considered off-limits to all Ahto City Security personnel.;
No calls or incidents from their base will be attended to until this matter is dealt with, as they are no longer subject to the protections of Selkath law.;
You have been found innocent, and may leave as you desire. This trial is now over.;
They were secretly trying to lure me to the darkside.;
This mystical darkside you Jedi keep speaking of is a convenient excuse. Basically, they wished to hire you away from the Republic.;
How, then, did the fighting start?;
I refused and they attacked.;
Preposterous!;
That does sound like something the Sith would do...;
I am inclined to believe the off-worlder.;
They tried to double-cross me.;
I felt like showing them who was boss.;
You... attacked them?!;
I knew the off-worlder was a danger!;
You have willfully and blatantly broken our laws, and for that you shall be sentenced accordingly!;
No! I am a Republic citizen!;
For the crimes you have committed against the Sith and against the laws of the Ahto City Civil Authority, this court finds no alternative: We hereby sentence you to death.;
You will be executed immediately. This court has spoken.;
I'm innocent!;
I have this datapad as proof that the Sith are up to no good!;
Let it be noted that the court has taken this new evidence into consideration.;
Hm... This is... most disturbing.;
The court will adjourn for a brief period to verify this evidence and discuss its importance.;
We have verified that this is indeed a Sith datapad indicating their complicity in a plot to overthrow the lawful government of Manaan.;
In gratitude for having discovered this heinous offense, all charges against you regarding this incident will be dropped.;
Pending a suitable penalty against the Sith, their Embassy is considered off-limits to all Ahto City Security personnel.;
If you try to punish me, I'll let everyone know that the kolto is gone.;
You wouldn't!;
I wouldn't doubt the human... they are known for these double-dealings...;
Kolto is the lifeblood of Manaan. Our entire economy and independence rests upon it. Now that it is gone we must maintain a perilous pact secrecy with your Republic.;
We can NOT afford to jeporadize that secrecy. Not for anything.;
If we allow you to leave, you are a threat and a liability to the Selkath people. Therefore we cannot.;
Your secret will die with you, off-worlder.;
They offered me a job.;
Offered you a job? To a Jedi?;
Unlikely... but possible. How then, did the fighting start?;
I was working for the Republic.;
You were working for the Republic? So the Republic had you break in and kill the Sith? It is as I suspected...;
Do not jump to conclusions.;
Why did the Republic have you enter the Sith Embassy?;
To steal information.;
You admit that you enetered the Sith base illegally and attempted to commit crimes there!;
It is obvious that they tried to stop you and that you initiated hostilities!;
So like an off-worlder...;
To retrieve data the Sith had stolen.;
One crime does not permit the use of another to set it right!;
To stop them from learning about the secret base by the Hrakert Rift.;
It is good that you are looking out for the joint interests of the Republic and Manaan in this issue, but was is really necessary to take such extreme measures?;
They had almost found out about the station.;
The secret must be kept from the Sith, no matter the cost!;
Indeed. We will adjourn to discuss the situation and the charges brought against you.;
Station? What station?;
This is a internal matter for Selkath alone! We will adjourn immediately to discuss these things without the interference of outsiders!;
Upon review of this case, we find that there is no basis for a case against the defendant.;
Additionally, the Sith will receive a censure for provoking combat within Ahto City.;
They needed killing.;
You admit to your crime!;
I was investigating the disappearances of young Selkath.;
You believe that the Sith have had something to do with those disappearance?;
The off-worlder has probably been listening to Shaelas and his rumor-mongering.;
Most likely. Do you have any proof to back up your assumption, human? Have the Sith been implicated?;
I found this token on a dead Selkath inside the Sith base.;
I recognize that token! It is from Galas, one of the youths who went missing!;
You found that in their Embassy?!;
The Sith HAVE been taking them!;
Er... well, no...;
You will need to come up with a better excuse than that, off-worlder!;
I was killing Sith. See? Simple.;
See! I knew that the off-worlder was guilty! They all are!;
What... what possible reason could you have to justify your actions?;
The Sith are a blight upon the galaxy!;
That does not excuse your actions! The neutrality and laws of Manaan WILL be upheld!;
The Republic ordered me to go into their base.;
It was just a coincidence.;
You were clearly seen entering the Sith base. You cannot deny this fact!;
You must have had some reason for entering. What was it, human?;
Guilty.;
You... You are guilty? You admit to your crime?;
Yes.;
Well... Then I suppose we have no choice but to sentence you for your crimes.;
Er... no... I was just kidding.;
This court will not be mocked!;
It was a lot of fun, really.;
I don't plead! I tell!;
We will not tolerate insolence! You will obey the rules of our court, or you will be summarily found guilty!;
"The Sith have been using and manipulating the young among our race; we know this. It is up to us to decide what actions we should take, not vigilante justice by some human.";
While you have proven the Sith to manipulative and deceitful in their activities here on Manaan, I believe you will have a much harder time defending your actions now. Some things go too far, off-worlder.;
The familiarity you gained in your successful defence of Sunry will aid you here, human. But the charges you are faced with are far more grave.;
Your past experience as Arbiter in the Sunry case may aid in your defence now, human, but you must do a better job yourself, given the crimes you are faced with.;
While your high standing among the off-worlders on Manaan may bring you some leniency from them, being a successful swoop rider brings you no credit here, human.;
I think I'd rather represent myself.;
While that is your right, I strongly recommend against it. I am versed in all the necessary particulars of this case and Selkath law, off-worlder. You would do well to heed my advice.;
No, I'll represent myself.;
You off-worlders are not known for your mental prowess. I shall leave your demise up to you.;
Fine, represent me.;
I said no, fish-head!;
I have proof that the Sith are evil.;
Indeed? And what is that?;
This datapad proving they are kidnapping young Selkath.;
This is most... disturbing. We should take this evidence and present it before the court right away.;
I'll show it to the judges, or no one!;
You must share the evidence with me before I can release you and we can proceed to the courtroom.;
I am skeptical of that, as will be the judges. You off-worlders tend to congregate much amongst yourself. I see no inherent differences between your two groups.;
I'm on a mission to stop them from taking over the galaxy.;
The Sith are an expansionistic power, true, and at war with the Republic. You may make it your personal mission to foil them, but the authorities take a dim view of it taking place here.;
I think you will need a more thorough explanation in order to convince the judges.;
I kill them wherever I can find them.;
I am... humbled by your candor. While I'm sure that you yourself see that as a noble sentiment, I doubt that those assigning your sentence will be so generous.;
Indeed. I find that unlikely, off-worlder, but perhaps the judges will be more sympathetic to your view.;
I had authorization to enter.;
I... er... broke in.;
Illegal acts seem to be a common occurance among you off-worlders. I am not terribly surprised by your actions, but the judges will want to hear a little more convincing reason.;
What have I been charged with?;
You have been charged with initiating violence within the Sith Embassy, murdering members of the Ambassadorial Commission of the Sith Empire, and disregarding our own laws regarding violence in Ahto City.;
What can I do?;
It's all the Sith's fault!;
Be that as it may, I doubt the judges share your view. I will endeavor, however, to make them see your point, off-worlder.;
Get me out of here!;
The question of your freedom will be up to the court to decide. All I can do as Arbiter is attempt to sway their decision in your favor.;
Go away. You would regret the only other option.;NM26ABSITH14000_.mp3
What do you want, rail-rat? I don't have the time or desire to bother speaking with wandering idiots.;NM26ABSITH14001_.mp3
Go talk with your adoring fans over at the swoop races. I'm sure they fawn all over their beloved Sector Champion.;NM26ABSITH14002_.mp3
Could I ask you a few questions?;
I will get tired of your voice in short order, so make it quick.;NM26ABSITH14006_.mp3
You mentioned the races.;
"You're the Sector Champion; you know the races inside and out. Why ask me? Are you trying to worm a compliment out of me?";NM26ABSITH14008_.mp3
Nothing about the current state of the races make me want to watch. Especially if it means associating with the cattle grouped in there now.;NM26ABSITH14009_.mp3
There are no racers you like?;
I admire the mercenary spirit of Casandra Mateil. Other than that, no one.;NM26ABSITH14011_.mp3
Her mercenary spirit isn't what's selling the autoprints.;NM26ABSITH14012_.mp3
She does have... other qualities as well.;NM26ABSITH14013_.mp3
Let's go back to my first questions.;
Hurry it up. This is a poor use of my time. You should know not to annoy one of my kind.;NM26ABSITH14015_.mp3
I have some questions about Manaan.;
Grow some gills and swim the planet yourself. There's no substitute for personal experience. I have nothing else to say on the subject.;NM26ABSITH14018_.mp3
I don't like how hostile you are.;
Hostile? I would consider this the height of calm for dealing with insects like yourself. If I were hostile, you'd be dead.;NM26ABSITH14022_.mp3
A pity we can't test the theory now.;
Yes, Manaan is a very unsatisfying world for settling disagreements. The Selkath are very insistant that even words are not used as weapons.;NM26ABSITH14024_.mp3
Since we both refuse to initiate a violent event, you'll have to accept my contempt-filled dismissal, and hope we don't meet again.;NM26ABSITH14025_.mp3
I won't take that chance. Goodbye.;
Wisely played. Go away.;NM26ABSITH14027_.mp3
I have to leave. Goodbye.;
Good. This visit was dragging on.;NM26ABSITH14020_.mp3
Our Taris campaign killed the giants of the sport. The current racers are hardly inspiring. An Aqualish champion? Hmph. Laughable.;NM26ABSITH14016_.mp3
You're probably another race fan in a fool's stupor after that big win by local whelp Queedle Molta.;NM26ABSITH14003_.mp3
Go join the other transients in the swoop race area. At least you'll all be contained.;NM26ABSITH14004_.mp3
Why are you back again? I didn't show enough disinterest the first time around? You really shouldn't pester a soldier of the Sith.;NM26ABSITH14028_.mp3
Go look for fans over at the swoop races, Sector Champion. I'm sure they'll give you what your looking for.;NM26ABSITH14029_.mp3
I shouldn't expect you to listen. You're probably just another open-mouthed fool here for the swoop races.;NM26ABSITH14030_.mp3
Hey - you can't come in here! This is a restricted area! You better tell me what you're doing or I'm going to hit the alarm!;
[Persuade] I'm here for a meeting. Don't worry - I know where I have to go.;
[Failure] Nice try. What - you think that just because I'm pretty I'm also stupid?;
You better tell me why you're here or I'll hit this alarm and you'll have about three seconds before this office is swarming with Sith soldiers!;
[Persuade] Look, here's 50 credits - just don't hit that alarm.;
[Success] 50 credits? You've got a deal! The Sith have made my life a living hell ever since they took over this base.;
You know, it's about time someone stood up to these Sith! Just do me a favor and wait until I'm out of here before you start blasting the place up.;
[Failure] You must think I'm pretty stupid! If I take your bribe the Sith will have me executed!;
I don't know what you're up to, but I have the feeling it might get me in a lot of trouble. I hate to do this, but you'll have to explain yourself to the guards.;
Don't hit the alarm. I don't want to have to hurt you.;
Don't shoot! I just work here - I never wanted any part of this! I would have quit when the Sith took over, but they wouldn't let me!;
Okay - get out of here and I'll let you live!;
You're in the wrong place at the wrong time. It's bad luck, but I still have to kill you!;
You shouldn't threaten a girl who's got an alarm right at her desk!;
Touch that alarm and you're dead!;
[Persuade] I work here - look, I've got an access card.;
Greetings, human. A word, if I may. It concerns the Dark Lord of the Sith.;
You mean Malak?;
No, human. I mean the *true* Lord of the Sith. I am speaking of Darth Revan. Of you.;
How do you know who I am?;
Listen to me, and all will be made clear. My name is Ziagrom. I am a... a businessman. I and my partner deal in rare items of extraordinary value and power.;
You're with the Exchange!;
No, we are not. We are independant operators, though often our transactions involve those who represent the Exchange.;
Traditionally, we have always done business with the owner of the Ebon Hawk: Davik Kang, most recently. Ahita Othar before him. Forii Haxa before her. But we were reluctant to approach you.;
You had no ties to the Exchange, which was a problem. Even worse, you were a Jedi! Not the sort of person we normally associate with.;
Get to the point - how do you know my true identity?;
There were reports of the Ebon Hawk traveling to many different planets. We wanted to know what you were up to. At your last port, I placed a small tracking device on your ship.;
The tracking device reported back to us that you had been captured by the Leviathan. Once we had that information, we began digging into our sources within the Sith fleet.;
Sources? What sources?;
There are millions of soldiers in the Sith fleet. Surely you aren't surprised that some of them will sell information? Even high ranking officers aren't immune to the lure of easy credits.;
Your escapades on the Leviathan created quite a stir in the Sith fleet. Of course Malak tried to suppress the truth about your identity: there were more than a few summary executions.;
But even if security footage is destroyed and witnesses silenced, some bits of information always slip through. Spend enough credits to gather the tiny pieces and the puzzle becomes clear.;
We know what happened on the Leviathan. At least, we know enough. You are Darth Revan, and you are going to kill Malak for daring to claim dominion over the Sith.;
How does this involve you?;
My partner and I deal in very rare and powerful items. Weapons, armor: things you could use in your battles against Malak and the Sith.;
And you're just going to give these items to me?;
I don't carry these items with me, of course. They're with my partner. But they're yours, if you've got the credits to buy them. We do want to make a profit on this, after all.;
Just go to the Cantina here in Dreshdae. There's a Rodian there named Mika Dorin. Tell Mika that Ziagrom sent you to look at the premium items.;
I'll go check it out.;
Mika already knows to expect you. Like I said, just tell him you want to look at the premium items.;
I guess my work here is done. Goodbye, Revan. And once Malak is beaten, don't forget who helped you to victory.;
I can't be bothered with this.;
It's up to you, I guess. But you'll be missing out on the best equipment in the galaxy! Sooner or later you'll realize this deal is to good to pass up.;
Just go to the Dreshdae Cantina on Korriban. There's a Rodian in there named Mika Dorin. Tell Mika that Ziagrom sent you to look at the premium items.;
I'll check it out next time on Korriban.;
Let me see these items.;
You're wrong. I'm not in this for revenge.;
Maybe, maybe not. But whatever your motivation may be, you *do* intend to stop Malak and his followers - of that we are sure. And we want to help.;
Go on.;
So why are you approaching me now?;
Who are you?;
If you tell anyone who I am, I'll kill you!;
Your secret is safe with me, Lord Revan. At least until you chose to reveal yourself. But I have come here with an offer of aid. I want to help you defeat your old apprentice.;
I'm not Revan anymore.;
You are what you are, human. You cannot deny that you were once the Lord of the Sith. And you cannot deny that you wish to defeat Malak!;
*I* am the Dark Lord of the Sith!;
Yes, human. I know. That is why I have approached you.;
I don't have time for this!;
Please, human - this is of importance to us both! I know who you are... Revan!;
Thanks for your help, friend. I'm getting off this planet as soon as I can. I'll pay my own way, too. No more debts to anyone.;NM22AADASO07000_.mp3
No more trusting anyone, either. I've learned what that gets you.;NM22AADASO07001_.mp3
Hello again. Welcom back to Eli Gand's outpost, now under new management. What do you need?;NM22AADASO07002_.mp3
Let's see what you have for sale.;
Right you are.;NM22AADASO07004_.mp3
You're still here? I'd never be so forgiving.;
What do you mean? I don't need to go hunting Eli's family or anything. I've seen justice done.;NM22AADASO07018_.mp3
[Persuade] It's not enough. This store was his life. Let it rot.;
[Success] You know, maybe you're right. Why should I bother with this remote hole? This isn't the life I wanted.;NM22AADASO07020_.mp3
I see your point. I'll leave his shop like his corpse. I'll take what I want, buy passage on a ship, and never look back except to spit.;NM22AADASO07021_.mp3
Here, take this. Thanks for reminding me about how he misused my trust. I'll make sure it never happens again. With anyone.;NM22AADASO07022_.mp3
You have taken a good and honest man and twisted him into a bitter, hateful creature. You must be so proud of yourself.;NM22AADASO07058_.mp3
Feeding this man's hatred is an act of malice and petty evil. The Council would not approve of your actions here, and neither do I.;NM22AADASO07059_.mp3
[Failure] I'd rather move on, you know? I don't want to be mad about this for the rest of my life. I can make this work.;NM22AADASO07023_.mp3
In that case, let's see what's for sale.;
All right then. Actually, I feel I owe you something. Here, take a few credits. If you spend it here, all the better. I think things are looking up.;NM22AADASO07013_.mp3
Sounds like a boring choice to me. Goodbye.;
Safe flying to you. Hope to see you again.;NM22AADASO07016_.mp3
Well, that's your opinion, I guess, but I still owe you for helping me. Here, take a few credits with you. Spend them here, if you like.;NM22AADASO07015_.mp3
Never mind. Goodbye.;
All right then. Here, I should toss you a few credits for helping. I appreciate what you did.;NM22AADASO07028_.mp3
[Force Persuade] Remember your hatred. Don't trap yourself here.;
[Success] Working here when I was trapped was hell enough. Staying here now is just foolish. I don't want to be seen as weak.;NM22AADASO07025_.mp3
Fine, fine. Just show me what's for sale.;
I don't want anything right now, thanks.;
That Thaylian bog-slime. Do you know that I have been here 36 days, slaving to pay a debt in good faith?;NM22AADASO07007_.mp3
All for nothing. He killed my crew... who knows where my ship is. Well, there's your pay, Eli. Blaster fire, and keep the change.;NM22AADASO07008_.mp3
I suppose that closes his little outpost here.;
I suppose it does, though maybe I should keep it up for a while on my own. I've no ship at the moment anyway.;NM22AADASO07010_.mp3
It'll probably take a while to convince Eli's suppliers that I'm the new boss, but eventually I'll buy my way off this rock.;NM22AADASO07011_.mp3
If it were me, I'd wipe out all memory of him.;
And you won't owe anyone a single credit. Good luck.;
That's the idea. Actually, I should toss you a few credits for helping me out. Take them... maybe even spend them here.;NM22AADASO07030_.mp3
What will you do now?;
Well, there's not much for me to do but stay here. I've no ship, so I may as well make a few credits.;NM22AADASO07032_.mp3
Did you have to kill him?;
What did you expect I'd do? Besides, he'd have killed me. He couldn't have risked me telling everyone he was a cheat. He'd have no business.;NM22AADASO07035_.mp3
He won't last long hiding in the Shadowlands.;
I have to admit, I'm surprised you let him get away. I don't know if I could have been as forgiving.;NM22AADASO07060_.mp3
I will never understand you meatbags. He cheated you and killed your friends, but you didn't terminate him when you had the chance.;NM22AADASO07061_.mp3
If it had been me, Eli would a smoking corpse right now.;NM22AADASO07062_.mp3
Well, I could have shot out his legs and let him crawl around for a while, but I consider this far more merciful.;NM22AADASO07034_.mp3
His reputation's shot. Someone honest could take over.;
Greetings to you. Something I can get for you?;NM22AADASO07036_.mp3
Kindly direct your inquiries to me. Matton is merely an indebted employee. His opinions don't amount to much.;NM22AADASO07037_.mp3
I think you'd better talk to Eli directly. He's the boss... for the time being.;NM22AADASO07038_.mp3
Hukta says you earned a big enemy. You should have lost when you was told to lose! Now something's gotta be done!;
Not here, because Selkath cameras are watching. I's too smart for that. I get you when you least expect. You just wait.;
Yeah, you come talk to me. I got something to say to you, little racer. Hukta Jax doesn't like how fast you go.;
See, back when more people raced, I lost lots more. Now, I win pretty good. I like winning. You maybe shouldn't mess it up.;
So I says this, and you listen good. You don't win the Sector Champion race. If you win, maybe something bad happens to you.;
Can't we come to an agreement?;
Sure, you can agree with me. That's the only way this is gonna work, you understand? You do like I say, and you don't get hurt.;
I will race, and I will win.;
Then you and Hukta Jax are gonna have problems, I promise you that. You was warned, fair and square.;
I don't want any trouble...;
Then you is smarter than you look. I likes it when people are reasonable. Just stay away from the track.;
I'll think about what you said.;
Sure, you think. While you do that, stay away from the course. I's can make things very bad for you.;
Try anything and you'll end up dead!;
Maybe you end up dead first. Maybe it will be painful, too. I don't like when people don't do what they should. You win and you get hurt.;
You'd never get away with it. Cameras are everywhere.;
I am too smart to do something out in the open. Selkath gots cameras all over, and they lock everyone up without questions.;
No, I would find you when you don't know it's coming, where no cameras are. You win Sector Champion race, and I hurt you.;
You'd regret threatening me, piggie.;
I already did it, and I don't regret nothing. You don't know how much I like to race. You don't know what I can do.;
You just do as I says and you will stay safe. It's simple.;
"I told you once already, and I want you to remember; you don't win the Sector Champion spot. If you do, there will be trouble.";
Who is you? Hmm? Hukta Jax -that's me- says you should step back, because pro racers like me are important.;
You're Sector Champion, right? You only won because I gots distracted by stupid Queedle. He blew my whole strategy.;
I just want to ask a few questions.;
Yeah, okay, but you keep it short. I got no reason to talk to you.;
I want to ask about you and racing.;
Okay, maybe I say something, or maybe not. Hukta Jax don't give secrets out.;
Is Manaan a good course for racing?;
What is I going to tell you about this course? You won it already! Go let someone ask you questions instead.;
How long have you been at this?;
Lots of years. I got my swoop after we raided... I mean, I got my swoop when someone left it to me. It was sad, but happy too.;
What do you mean by that?;
Nothing, and I 'm not saying any more.;
What can you tell me about the other racers?;
You don't need nothing. You beat everybody. I got nothing to tell.;
Let's go back to my first questions.;
Why? You sure talk when you get going. Maybe we can hurry up and stop soon?;
Do you know much about Manaan?;
I know that if you do absolutely anything wrong you get locked up. Seems like fining criminals is a great way to bring in the credits.;
I'm surprised they even let us race. Wouldn't want the crowds to get too excited. Excitement make people unpredictable. Or something.;
I'm leaving. Goodbye.;
Yeah, you go then, and leave me alone.;
You'd better show me some respect, piggie.;
Haw! That's funny! You is new here, so maybe you don't know, but Manaan gots Selkath cameras everywhere. No fighting allowed.;
You got to be smart, and know the place good. You is too new for that. You just funny.;
I just know that I am better than all the rest. I'd be better even with more pros here. Casandra is okay, but she is weak and little.;
There's Queedle too, but he is the worst! I mean, what is he doing winning it all? That is just not right! He's not pro!;
Queedle is here too, but he doesn't got what we got.;
What do you mean?;
He doesn't have the best swoop. He can have skills all over the floor, but if his swoop goes slow, he goes slow, and he goes slow.;
This track is pretty good. It's too wet, but it's on the ocean, so you're gonna have that. Better to hit waves than rocks, I guess.;
I don't like the new racers here, though. Queedle stole the top round from me! How'd he get so fast so all of a sudden?;
I don't like you much, either. You come in and win everything from everybody, but you aren't a pro like me. It's not right.;
This track is all there is until the circuit is up again. Taris took the best racers. I suppose there is Tatooine...;
What's wrong with Tatooine?;
I'm not going back to Tatooine ever. Hukta Jax is better than that dust ball.;
When were you there?;
That's none of yous business, and you stop asking about it. You stop!;
What? Again? Ask and leave me alone.;
Just answer my questions, and make it quick.;
Heh, okay, I will answer, but you watch what you say. Hukta Jax don't take threats from nobody.;
Wait! You's the one that beat my time! Twice I get beaten, by Queedle and you too! This is the worst showing I had yet!;
Queedle is the big winner right now. I hate that. He should stay in the beginner races. He's not ready to beat me. It's not right.;
You that new racer, winning from nowhere, right? I like winning, so you just stay away from my times.;
So, you leave me alone so's I can get race-ready. It important. Meditation and stuff.;
What do you want from Hukta now? I don't have time for you or anyone.;
Grrr... Sector Champion. Well, that is very nice. Now how about you go away? I got to work on waterproofing my swoop.;
Go away. You and me, we don't have anything to say about nothing. Go beat someone else's time or something.;
You got one race, but that means nothing. Go bother another beginner or something, because you are no interest to me.;
You don't need to talk to me, racer. I get enough of you on the track. I see you getting wins. Go away.;
You are not permitted to enter the rest of Rwookrrorro. Our children live in the upper boughs. You will not disturb them.;
You couldn't make the climb anyway. Only a Wookiee has the skill to navigate the wroshyr trees.;

Select the bottom right inventory slot. This is your WEAPON slot. Left-click the mouse on an item in the right menu to equip that weapon.;
Can you repeat that?;
Hitting the buttons over and over again will not speed up your attacks and will not help you in combat! Combat uses a real-time, turn based system.;
Each character can only perform one action in each 3 second round. When a new round begins the character will perform the last command you selected.;
RESUME COMBAT;
What if combat gets too hectic?;
Combat uses a pause and play system. At any time you can press the Pause button to pause the game and issue commands to your characters.;
While the game is paused you can use the mouse to select a target or select icons from the TARGET and ACTION MENUs. You can switch characters by left-clicking on their portrait in the lower left corner of the screen.;

[This craft is too small for you and Bastila together. You will have to use the Ebon Hawk to leave.];
A human? There are Selkath everywhere, but you choose to speak with me. Am I so different? Do you think I have answers that others do not?;
That's a rather strange greeting.;
These are strange times. The Sith and the Republic battle to control the galaxy, but their war destroys what they both seek to possess.;
The war sows fear and confusion, people are lost. They want guidance, direction. They have questions, and they want answers. That is why I am here... I too seek answers.;
Answers? Answers to what?;
The Republic. The Sith. The war. Everything. Nothing. Answers are always hardest to find when the questions are unclear. Yet that does not stop us from searching.;
Who are you?;
A name? There is power in names, yet in the end a name alone means less than nothing. I am Hulas, a traveler from the world of Duro. And what is your name, human?;
Senni Vek gave me a message to see you.;
Senni did not think you would come, but I knew better, <FullName>. It is good that you have come alone, for if you ever come with others I will not speak to you of these things.;
I am Hulas of the Genoharadan - a secret society of bounty hunters. For a thousand generations we have existed, but always hidden beneath an impenetrable veil.;
I've never heard of you.;
Few ever have. We are shadow, darkness and night. We are less than a whisper or a thought. We have managed to keep our existence a secret far longer than most could ever imagine.;
If you are ever foolish enough to tell anyone about this meeting or the Genoharadan's existence, they would not believe you. They would probably think you were paranoid, or mentally unstable.;
Not even those closest to you can know we have approached you. If you ever speak to me around any of your companions, I will not discuss the Genoharadan. Do you understand, <FullName>?;
I understand.;
I believe you speak the truth, <FullName>. But remember this: if you ever betray us, this opportunity will be lost forever.;
Few among the galaxy have ever heard of the Genoharadan. They never see us, never know we are there. They do not even know we exist.;
If you do not follow our rules, we will vanish and you will be like all the others. You will never see us again. We will be nothing but a figment of your imagination.;
But if you swear to keep the secrets of our order, you will learn of a forbidden society known only to a handful throughout the galaxy.;
I will preserve the secrecy of your order.;
Excellent, <FullName>. We have high hopes for you within the guild... if you prove yourself worthy. Listen closely and I will give you a first glimpse into our secret world.;
We Genoharadan are an ancient guild of elite bounty hunters. For thousands of years we have been at work throughout the galaxy, eliminating our targets in near total secrecy.;
How does anybody hire you if nobody knows you exist?;
In the highest corridors of power a handful of people know we exist, and how to contact us. Of course, these people are smart enough to keep this knowledge a carefully guarded secret.;
And on very rare occasions, when we are seeking new clients, one of our guild-masters will approach a powerful political figure and offer our services when the time is ripe.;
You're nothing but common assassins!;
The Genoharadan are far from common! Even Calo Nord hadn't proven himself worthy of joining our guild, though he was getting close. Until he met you, that is.;
By killing Calo Nord, you have shown you have great potential. The Genoharadan could use someone like you, if you are willing. And your work for us could be of great aid to the Republic.;
How will killing innocent people help the Republic?;
Innocent people? Our victims are far from innocent, and the Genoharadan will only accept a contract if the target's death suits our greater goals - goals that often match those of the Republic.;
The Genoharadan have a vested interest in preserving the Republic. It is the perfect cover for our work. We operate behind the scenes, manipulating events through subtle machinations.;
Do you think the Republic has persisted for 15,000 years by mere accident? If not for our influence - distasteful as our methods may be to some - the Republic would have collapsed long ago!;
We understand the bureaucracy of the Republic, we have learned how to alter the course of political events under the existing regime. We have no wish to see the Republic fall.;
This is a little hard to believe.;
That is one of the reasons our existence has remained secret for so long. Nobody wants to believe in a secret society manipulating and controlling events on a grand scale.;
Rumors and hints of our existence are dismissed as paranoid fantasies. But we do exist, <FullName>. And we have come to ask you to join us.;
Why would I want to join you?;
As I said earlier, your efforts here will help the Republic. And by aiding us you will earn the right to join an exclusive organization with the power to alter the very course of galactic history.;
And of course there is the simplest reason of all: the Genoharadan reward their agents very, very well.;
Okay, what do I have to do to join?;
As you can imagine, joining the Genoharadan is not a simple process. To begin, we will need proof of your loyalty and your competence.;
When you feel you are ready, I will give you a task: a target who must be eliminated. Of course you will have to come alone whenever you wish to discuss Genoharadan business.;
I'm ready to prove myself worthy of the Genoharadan.;
Killing Calo Nord was an impressive display of your skills, but there is more to the Genoharadan than mere killing. To preserve the secrecy of our order our agents must be discrete.;
You must be able to find and eliminate a target without drawing undo attention. You can never mention your assignments to others - not even your closest allies.;
Also, you cannot ask people for information about your target. You must complete your mission using only the information I will provide.;
I understand. Who is my target?;
Your first mission is a simple one: eliminate a Rodian anti-Republic terrorist named Lorgal.;
Tell me about Lorgal.;
Lorgal is a radical who wants to destroy the Republic through terrorist acts. He is responsible for over two dozen bombings, leaving hundreds of civilians dead.;
He was recently captured and is being held prisoner in the Republic base here on Manaan awaiting transport to Coruscant for trial - and a chance to publicly voice his radical beliefs.;
We do not want to give him that chance. You must find a way to kill him before he leaves for Coruscant, but you must be subtle. It must look like an accident or an unexplainable death.;
The Republic would be glad to get rid of Lorgal, so they won't investigate his death closely. As long as he isn't struck down by a weapon in his cell, the Genoharadan will be satisfied.;
Tell me about Zuulan Sentar.;
Zuulan was a common inter-galactic slaver who tried to kidnap the daughter of a Coruscant Senator. He failed and the girl was recovered, but Zuulan himself escaped.;
He will probably try another similar kidnapping soon. If he succeeds, he might ransom his victim in exchange for dangerous political secrets that could threaten the Republic itself.;
The Genoharadan want to eliminate him before this happens. Our latest information places Zuulan on Dantooine - he often sells illicit goods to the wealthy settlers of that world.;
His land speeder was spotted near one of the settler's estates on Dantooine. Zuulan rarely strays far from his speeder in case he needs to make a quick escape. You should look for him there.;
Is there anything else?;
Remember - tell no one about this. If there are others with you when you confront Lorgal, make it seem as if you are acting on behalf of the Republic, not the Genoharadan.;
That is all for now. Return to me when Lorgal is dead and you will be suitably rewarded.;
Remember - tell no one about this. If there are others with you when you confront Zuulan or Lorgal, make it seem as if you are acting on behalf of the Republic, not the Genoharadan.;
That is all for now. Return to me when either Lorgal or Zuulan is dead and I will reward you. If you wish to complete both missions, feel free. You will be suitably rewarded for each.;
We will begin with something simple. Your first mission is to eliminate either of two targets: a Gran slaver named Zuulan Sentar or a Rodian anti-Republic terrorrist named Lorgal.;
What happens if I tell someone about this?;
They wouldn't believe you. They might even think you are insane. Telling anyone about the Genoharadan would be pointless: we are very good at hiding any proof of our existence.;
I'll be back later.;
I will be waiting here for you, <FullName>. The Genoharadan are eager to see the extent of your abilities.;
I've changed my mind. I don't want to be a part of this.;
As you wish. Then this is the last you will see of me, or any of the Genoharadan. Farewell, <FullName>.;
What's in this for me?;
Why would the Genoharadan protect the Republic?;
Are you saying you serve the Republic?;
What does this have to do with me?;
You can't impose your rules on me!;
If you do not comply, then this opportunity will be lost. Most people have never heard of the Genoharadan. They never see us, never know we are there, do not even know we exist.;
If you do not follow our rules, I will leave and you will be like the others. You will never see us again. The Genoharadan will be nothing but a figment of your imagination.;
If you swear to keep our existence a secret you will learn of a a forbidden soceity known only to a handful throughout the galaxy. If not, we will simply vanish. The choice is yours.;
Very well, I'll keep your secret.;
Forget it.;
Senni Vek? This name means nothing to me. Are you certain this person told you and your companions to come and see me? That is very strange.;
Obviously there must be some mistake. Or maybe this is a joke. I doubt anyone named 'Senni Vek' told you to bring your companions and come speak with me.;
He gave me this datapad. It mentions the Genoharadan.;
Genoharadan? That word means nothing to me. If you want to speak like a fool, you should at least have the sense not to do it in front of others.;
I believe we should end this discussion, before you embarrass yourself further in front of your friends.;
Never mind. I want to ask you some other questions.;
I will do my best to answer them, though I am only recently arrived to this world. Many of your questions would be better answered by others, I'm sure.;
What are you doing here on Manaan?;
I am an observer, a seeker of answers. The Sith and Republic vie for control of the galaxy, and I am anxious to know as much as I can about the eventual victor.;
On Manaan, I can observe both parties in relative safety. The Sith and the Republic co-exist here, unlike anywhere else in the galaxy. Here I watch, and study, and learn.;
You're a spy!;
No, a spy is a stealer of hidden secrets. A spy slinks in the shadows and gains entrance to forbidden rooms. I am only a simple observer.;
I watch the Sith on this world. I watch the Republic. I watch the Selkath. I see how they act and react and I can draw conclusions about their true natures. I see what drives them.;
And when an ultimate victor emerges from this war, I will know them better than they know themselves. This will give me power: the power to survive and thrive no matter what events may come.;
So that's all you do? Sit and watch?;
Sit. Watch. Study. Learn. Wait. For now, that is all. I gather knowledge and I wait for a day when this knowledge will serve me well.;
I want to ask you some more questions.;
I'll be going now.;
And so you leave, perhaps to return. Perhaps not. Yet I will remain here, for my work is not done.;
What can you tell me about the Republic here on Manaan?;
The Republic comes to Manaan with offers of alliance, but the Selkath are wary. They have no wish to join the Republic, given recent history.;
The Republic say they protect the galaxy, but they have seen much war: Exar Kun, the Mandalorians, the Sith. Why does the Republic breed so many enemies?;
Until they know the answer, the Selkath will not join. They have no wish to make the Republic's many enemies their own. More than this I cannot say.;
Do you know anything about the Sith here on Manaan?;
War is the tool of empire building. The Sith conquer world after world, taking resources as they want. They came to Manaan to plunder the most valuable resource of all - Kolto.;
But Manaan is different, it is difficult to conquer. If the Sith attack the Selkath can slip away to safety far below the oceans. They can hoard their Kolto - or give it to the Republic.;
So Manaan gives us a glimpse of how the Sith will react should they win this war. Here the Sith must use diplomacy and negotiation: tools they will need to maintain their empire.;
The Sith don't negotiate. They'll use brute force to maintain control.;
They might try, but an army can only build an empire, not sustain it. Rebellions, insurrections - in time the weight of the Sith's own policies would bring them down.;
It may take a century, or two, or even three. But eventually the Sith will learn diplomacy or their Empire will fall.;
What do you know about the Selkath?;
The Selkath are a species of secrets. They invite both the Sith and the Republic to their world, but welcome neither. They keep their true allegiance close to the vest.;
They hide their true numbers in great cities beneath the ocean that no off-worlder will ever see. They guard the secret of Kolto - where it is made, how it is made.;
The Selkath are a great mystery. To the Sith, to the Republic, to me... their secrets are what makes them strong. I would tell you more if I knew, but I do not.;
My name is <FullName>.;
<FullName>. Now we know something about each other... but really, we still know nothing. What do you want with me, human?;
I want to ask you some questions.;
Nothing. I'll be going now.;
My name is none of your business.;
You presume to know my business, human. Yet if your name becomes important to me I only have to check with the Selkath registry to know it.;
But for now, keep your secret well hidden if you wish. What is it you want with me, human?;
Answers? What are you talking about?;
"Greetings once again, <FullName>. Or should I say ""Revan""?";
How did you know that?;
Don't be naive. I am of the Genoharadan. We are bounty hunters, assassins and spies. We have agents with the Republic, we have agents with the Sith.;
Did you really think we wouldn't know about your little encounter on the Leviathan? Although I will admit, we were as surprised as you... the Jedi did a remarkable job of faking your death.;
So what happens now?;
I will admit, my first impulse on hearing this news was to disappear. The Genoharadan don't often become directly associated with such prominent figures as a former Dark Lord of the Sith.;
But then I began to realize the potential advantages of the situation. Assuming you complete the tasks required for your initiation into our guild, you could be very valuable to us.;
So for now, little has changed. I will keep your secret, just as you have kept ours. I am curious to see how events will play out between you and your old apprentice.;
If the situation becomes dangerous, we Genoharadan can simply disappear as we have often done in the past. But for now, we will continue your initiation into the guild.;
Is there anything else, <FullName>?;
Zuulan Sentar is dead.;
Yes, <FullName>, I am aware of this. Our agents have been keeping a close eye on you, though I doubt you saw them. They were there when Zuulan met his untimely end.;
And, as promised, here is your reward for the task: a blaster developed exclusively for the use of those within our guild. It will serve you well, I am sure.;
This assignment was only the beginning, <FullName>. A small test, which I am pleased to say you passed. But now a more difficult challenge awaits you.;
There are three targets that the Genoharadan want you to remove. If you can eliminate all three, then you will gain full membership in our ancient guild.;
The first is a Gammorean named Vorn Daasraad. The second is a shapeshifter called Rulan Prolik. The third is a Selkath known as Ithorak Guldar.;
Tell me about Vorn Daasraad.;
Vorn is a freelance bounty hunter. He's very, very good but he's a bit too sadistic for our tastes. He likes to sacrifice an efficient kill for the pleasure of watching his victim suffer.;
The Genoharadan will tolerate a certain amount of competition, but Vorn has become too dangerous. You'd be surprised at how much political damage one rogue assassin can inflict.;
Vorn was last seen on Tatooine. We suspect he's taking a break from hunting sentients by going after a Krayt dragon. We don't want him to leave the Dune Sea alive.;
I'll find Vorn and bring him down!;
Just be careful when you face off against him. Vorn doesn't travel alone: he's always got his assault droid close at hand. The two of them make a formidable pair.;
Tell me about Rulan Prolik.;
We don't know much about Rulan, except that he's some kind of shapeshifter. We don't even know if it's a natural ability or the result of some powerful alien technology.;
But we suspect he's behind several prominent assassinations on the Outer Rim. The Genoharadan are worried he might decide to move his operations closer to the galactic core.;
With his ability to assume virtually any form, he could wreak havoc in the Galactic Senate. We aren't about to let that happen.;
So how do I find someone who could look like anyone?;
Finding Rulan won't be easy, but we have reports he may be on Kashyyyk. He's probably honing his skills by hunting the dangerous creatures in the Shadowlands.;
Tell me about Ithorak Guldar.;
Ithorak isn't violent like Rulan or Vorn, but in many ways he's far more dangerous. He's a con artist and blackmailer who's taken millions of credits from rich and powerful families.;
He also deals in secrets and information, and these can be far more deadly than any blaster. But Ithorak is careful - we know he's somewhere here on Manaan, but we don't know where.;
All we know is how to contact him. There's a Twi'lek named Vek at the Manaan swoop track. He can set up a meeting between you and Ithorak.;
Sure. I'll just tell him I want to kill his boss and book an appointment.;
Ithorak poses as a merchant of rare antiquities. It's the perfect cover for his real work - it gives him access to rich and powerful families without drawing suspicion.;
You'll have to convince Vek that you represent a buyer interested in purchasing some rare art from Ithorak. Convince Vek, and he'll set up a meeting.;
The meeting is your one chance to take Ithorak out, but be careful. He'll choose the time and place, and he's not going to leave himself vulnerable.;
Why would Vek set up a meeting between us?;
Any tips for this mission?;
[Persuade/Lie] Zuulan Sentar is dead.;
[Failure] I'm disappointed in you, <FullName>. Did you really believe I would fall for such an obvious lie? Didn't you think I might have agents watching you to see how you performed?;
I know you let Zuulan live, though the slaver's days are numbered. Even now one of our more reliable agents is hunting him down.;
But I am willing to forget this incident, though you would do well to learn from it. There is a lesson for you here: the Genoharadan show no mercy.;
Since you did not kill Zuulan I cannot give you the bounty for this assignment. In any case, <FullName>, your role in Zuulan's fate is now over.;
Do you have further business you wish to discuss at this time, or are we done here for now?;
[Force Persuade] You should give me Zuulan's bounty anyway.;
[Failure.] Did you really think that Jedi mind trick could work on one of the Genoharadan? You are a fool, <FullName>!;
The Genoharadan have no wish to work with fools. I am disappointed in you, <FullName>, but you leave me with little choice.;
I gave you an opportunity to join our guild, but through your actions you have shown yourself to be unfit. This is the last you will ever see of me or the Genoharadan, <FullName>. Goodbye.;
You better give me Zuulan's bounty anyway, before someone gets hurt.;
Are you threatening me? Here, where the Selkath authorities will arrest anyone who breaks the peace? Empty threats are the sign of a fool, <FullName>.;
Lorgal is dead.;
Yes, <FullName>, the agents I sent to watch you have reported back to me concerning Lorgal's death. You should take pride in a job well done.;
And, as promised, here is your reward for the task: a poisoned vibroblade forged exclusively for the use of those within our guild. It will serve you well, I am sure.;
Vorn Daasraad is dead.;
Well done, <FullName>. And, as promised, here is your reward: a Genoharadan stealth unit. You'll find it is far superior to most.;
Vorn, Rulan, Ithorak - that is all of them! You have done it, <FullName>. I hardly dreamed it was possible, yet now the task is done!;
All the years of planning. Spying and digging to discover their true identities - it was all worth it! Now the Genoharadan are mine alone!;
What are you talking about?;
Poor, foolish <FullName>. You had no idea that the targets I sent you after were three of the Overseers of the Genoharadan, did you?;
The Overseers have always acted in secret, their true identities hidden from the guild and even each other to prevent one person from seizing control of the entire guild.;
But now they are dead, and I am the only Overseer left in the guild! All the agents of the Genoharadan are mine to command! And I couldn't have done it without your help, <FullName>!;
So when do I get to join the guild?;
I'm sorry, <FullName>. Even after all you have done for me I cannot let you join the Genoharadan now. You are far too dangerous: you know the true identity of the only surviving Overseer.;
I suppose I could try to have you eliminated, but I have seen your skill in dispatching the other Overseers. I think it would be in both our best interests if we were simply to part ways.;
Nobody plays me for a fool! You'll pay for this, Hulas!;
*sigh* I was afraid it would come to this. Very well, we will finish this as these things always seem to end: in bloodshed. But the streets of Manaan are no place for this confrontation.;
Meet me in the Dune Sea, <FullName>. There we will engage in a ritual battle according to the customs of my guild, just you and me.;
Goodbye, <FullName>. I will wait for you in the Dune Sea. I don't need to remind you that you must come alone. If you do not, then you won't see me and you will never have your revenge.;
So that's it? We just part ways?;
I'm afraid so. The other Overseers are dead, but there is still much work for me to do to cement my hold on the guild.;
And as for you, <FullName>, I suspect your destiny lies elsewhere. You were never meant for the shadowy, secret world of the Genoharadan. You are bound to a much more public fate.;
Goodbye, Hulas.;
Goodbye, <FullName>. This is the last you will ever see of me or the Genoharadan, though if you watch carefully you may see evidence of our work throughout the galaxy.;
This isn't over, Hulas! Nobody plays me for a fool!;
Glad I could help you out. What happens now?;
You used me!;
You tricked me!;
Vorn's death brings you closer to completing your initiation into the Genoharadan, <FullName>. However, until you have completed all your missions you cannot be accepted into the guild.;
Rulan Prolik is dead.;
I must congratulate you. Rulan was no easy target. I will admit that you are not the first to be sent after him, though you are the only one to succeed.;
Here, take this Genoharadan visor. Many of our agents use them to increases their senses and improve their skills. It really is quite an extraordinary item.;
With Rulan gone, you are another step closer to entering the guild. But until you have completed all the missions you will not be accepted into the Genoharadan.;
[Persuade/Lie] Rulan Prolik is dead.;
[Failure.] The Genoharadan are not easily fooled, <FirstName>. My agents reported Rulan fled from your battle. They tell me you didn't finish the job.;
If you expect to join our guild, you will have to learn that we never leave a job unfinished. Go back to Kashyyyk. Find Rulan. Finish the job.;
Until you do you will never be one of the Genoharadan. Now, is there some other business you wish to discuss?;
I can't complete the Zuulan Sentar mission. Dantooine is destroyed.;
Yes, I have heard how the Sith razed the planet. Such radical overreactions are one reason the Genoharadan would prefer to see the Republic remain in power.;
It is likely that Zuulan died in the attack, but we do not like to leave such things to chance. It will take some time before my agents can determine if Zuulan survived.;
Ithorak Guldar is dead.;
Yes, I heard he met a rather grisly end. For completing this mission you have earned another reward. Take these Genoharadan gloves. You will find they are very useful in battle.;
By disposing of Ithorak you bring yourself ever closer to being accepted into the Genoharadan. But you must complete all your missions before you will be admitted into the guild.;
I have some questions about the Genoharadan.;
You must understand that there is much I cannot tell you until you are accepted into the guild, of course. But ask your questions and I will tell you what I can.;
Who formed this guild? Where did it begin?;
The Genoharadan were created by the the galactic tyrant Xim the Despot, five thousand years before the Republic itself was even founded.;
During Xim's short but brutal reign he used Genoharadan agents to eliminate his most powerful enemies. When Xim was finally overthrown, it was believed the Genoharadan disbanded.;
But the Genoharadan did not disband. Instead, we vanished into the darkness. Now we carry on our work from the deepest shadows, dispatching the enemies of those who hire us.;
Tell me more about the Genoharadan.;
In the first few centuries after Xim was overthrown, the Genoharadan were nothing but hired killers. We were a mere tool to be used by those who were rich and politically ambitious;
"But slowly the guild evolved. We began to shape and alter events through our actions. We ceased to be a servant of the political elite; we became a powerful faction in our own right.";
The organizaton of the guild itself also changed at this point. Instead of a single guildmaster, it was decided there would be four Overseers to guide and lead the Genoharadan.;
By distributing the power in this way we were protected against becoming a tool of a single person. The Overseers' individual ambitions would serve to balance each other out.;
Tell me about the Overseers.;
The Overseers are a secret cabal of four individuals who control the Genoharadan. For their own protection, nobody knows the identity of an Overseer. They are anonymous even to each other.;
Through agents and go-betweens, the Overseers consult with each other on all guild business. The system ensures no one person can manipulate the guild for their own benefit.;
What happens if an Overseer is killed?;
As you can imagine, the method for choosing and replacing an Overseer is complicated. The anonymity of a candidate must be protected at all costs, or the entire system will break down.;
If one Overseer were ever able to somehow eliminate the other three at the same time, he could seize all the power for himself and the guild as we know it would change forever.;
More than this I cannot tell you, for the sake of the guild. Besides, many of the details are hidden from me, as well. They are known only to the Overseers themselves.;
What else can you tell me about the Genoharadan?;
I'm sorry, <FullName>, but I am not ready to reveal all our secrets to you yet. Perhaps after you have completed another of your missions I will tell you more of this.;
Why haven't the Genoharadan assassinated Malak?;
Malak is no easy target, even for the Genoharadan. He is far too visible a figure. We prefer to operate on the fringes of events, not plunge into their center.;
In any case, there is no guarantee that the Genoharadan would eliminate Malak even if we could. Not yet. He may someday be of use to us, depending how events play out.;
Right now we support the Republic, but the goals of our guild are many and our methods subtle. At times we intervene in wars, but often we prefer to remain behind the scenes.;
We have found it more effective to let the grand scope of events play themselves out, then manipulate the situation to our advantage. It is one of the keys to keeping our existence well hidden.;
Do the Jedi Order know about your guild?;
Some of the wise Masters have knowledge of our existence. Those who study galactic history carefully will see evidence of our influence throughout.;
"But it is unlikely that even the Jedi know the true scope of our power and influence. They permit us to exist because they see us as a minor faction in the galaxy; one of many.";
Still, we try to avoid crossing paths with the Order. The Jedi are powerful and difficult to manipulate. We are careful to avoid actions that would draw their full attention.;
Despite their wisdom, the Jedi are in many ways like everyone else. They would not believe the true extent of our secret society even if you were to tell them.;
I don't have any other questions.;
How are the Overseers selected?;
Rulan Prolik got away. I can't find him.;
I guess this changes things.;
Revan? I have no idea what you're talking about?;
I'm not Revan anymore. Don't call me that.;
Yes, it is probably a good idea to hide your true identity. We Genoharadan are masters of gathering information, but few others know the truth about you. There is power in secrets.;
Welcome back, <FullName>. I see you have come alone, this is good. I assume you are here to discuss the business of the Genoharadan.;
You return. Was our business so unfinished when we last spoke? What is it you want?;
Who are you again?;
You have forgotten my name? Knowledge is power, but information is useless if you do not make a point to remember it. I am Hulas, a traveler from the world of Duro.;
I want to ask you about the Genoharadan.;

I couldn't sit by and just let you suffer.;
I don't have anything to give you as a reward for freeing me. Nothing tangible, anyway. But I've got information that could be worth a fortune.;NM08AAHUDR11002_.mp3
I used to be the pilot of the Ebon Hawk - Davik's flagship. I know the codes to disable the security system protecting it. I'll load them into your datapad now.;NM08AAHUDR11005_.mp3
You can use those codes to steal the Ebon Hawk right out of its hangar. Sell it to the highest bidder, ransom it back to Davik - whatever you do you'll make thousands!;NM08AAHUDR11007_.mp3
Okay, you're free to go now.;
It won't be long until Davik figures out I'm free. I have to get out of this base before that happens.;NM08AAHUDR11009_.mp3
We've got what we came for. We should get going.;NM08AAHUDR11011_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;
Questions? Please - I've already told you the only useful thing I know. Just let me go before Davik figures out I'm missing.;NM08AAHUDR11016_.mp3
You better come up with more of a reward if you want to walk out of here alive!;
What? But... I don't have anything else! Those Ebon Hawk codes are worth a fortune! Isn't that enough? Please, just let me go.;NM08AAHUDR11018_.mp3
You might warn the guards. I better just kill you.;
Hey! There's no need for that. Just... just run, pal, before my friend here decides to start blasting.;NM08AAHUDR11020_.mp3
We got what we came for. There is no need to indulge your appetite for violence.;NM08AAHUDR11022_.mp3

You core-slime! I didn't survive through all that torture just to let you kill me!;NM08AAHUDR11025_.mp3
Fine. Start running, then.;
So now that you're free there's the matter of a reward...;
Okay, you're free. Now give me my reward or I'll kill you myself!;
Please don't hurt me! I'll tell you everything I know - information worth a fortune! So just stay calm, okay? I'll tell you what I know.;NM08AAHUDR11028_.mp3
Please... the pain. I can't take it anymore! Please help me. Please... just release me from this torture cage.;NM08AAHUDR11030_.mp3
Who are you?;
My name is Hudrow. I used to be Davik's personal pilot until he caught me smuggling spice on the side. He threw me in here to be tortured to death! Please... I can't take much more of this!;NM08AAHUDR11032_.mp3
Why should I help you?;
I've got information... the security codes for the Ebon Hawk. The ship is worth a fortune! I'll give them to you if you release me! Please... I'm begging you!;NM08AAHUDR11034_.mp3
Sure, I'll set you free.;
Thank you! The button in the corner - just press it and I'll be free. Hurry!;NM08AAHUDR11036_.mp3
Give me the codes, then I'll set you free.;
No way. I can't afford to trust anyone. Those codes are my only leverage - without them I'll never get out of here! Set me free, then I'll give you the codes.;NM08AAHUDR11039_.mp3
I think I'll just leave you here.;
No! What kind of a monster are you? Please - they'll torture me until I'm dead! Don't leave me here!;NM08AAHUDR11041_.mp3
We may need that ship. Are you sure we shouldn't free him?;NM08AAHUDR11043_.mp3
Perhaps you should reconsider. His information may prove invaluable to us.;NM08AAHUDR11045_.mp3
How can I release you?;
The button over there in the corner. Please - just press the button and set me free from this torture cage!;NM08AAHUDR11048_.mp3
Take your blustering threats somewhere else, human. Ithorak has no desire to meet with you!;
[Force Persuade] I represent a wealthy buyer from Coruscant.;
"[Success] Yes, you do have that look about you; the air of one who serves the rich and powerful. Servile, fawning... a look I have seen in my own mirror far too often. *sigh*";
Very well, I'll set up a meeting with my boss. The Sith permit Ithorak to conduct his private business in their non-secured hangar. Go to the docking bays and we will meet you there.;
I'm sorry about the threat. I didn't mean anything by it.;
Your apology is accepted, human. I understand that intimidation can be useful at times. On someone of lesser character it might even have worked.;
But even though I don't hold any ill will towards you, I'm afraid you still can't meet with Ithorak. As I said before, you are not the kind of client we normally take on.;
Here's 500 credits to set up the meeting. That should prove I'm serious.;
Yes, that does show a serious level of commitment. Whoever you represent must be quite wealthy, if they have authorized this kind of payment just so you can see Ithorak.;
Never mind. I'll just go instead.;
Then I shall return my attention to the track. Goodbye, human.;
Goodbye.;
Goodbye, human.;
Congratulations on winning the Manaan championship. I do enjoy watching your races, human. It makes a nice break from the hectic world I must deal with everyday in my business.;
I need to meet with Ithorak Gulder. Can you set it up?;
You need to meet with Ithorak? Forgive my skepticism, but you hardly resemble our typical client. We deal in the kind of pieces found in the chambers of a galactic senator.;
[Persuade] I represent an anonymous buyer from Coruscant.;
[Failure] Perhaps you do, human. But how can I be sure you're telling the truth? I would hate to waste Ithorak's time if you aren't serious.;
Unless you want the Manaan authorities to find your body floating in the ocean, you'll set up this meeting!;
Hmph! Now I *know* you aren't the type of person we want to deal with. Your threats mean nothing to me: I once had a planetary amabassador threaten to have me executed on the spot!;
But I knew she couldn't touch me, and I know you can't do anything to me here on Manaan. Not without having half of Ahto City's security force coming down on you.;
Who are you?;
My name is Vek. I work for Ithorak Guldar, a merchant who deals in very rare and expensive art. He serves as the go-between for buyers and sellers throughout the galaxy.;
I serve as Ithorak's security advisor - a highly demanding job. The fact that Ithorak seems to delight in insulting and berating me makes it even more difficult.;
You're wearing a Sith uniform. Are you with the Sith?;
To be honest, no. Not really. I just wear this uniform to gain respect. People are less likely to give me trouble if they think I *might* be with the Sith.;
Don't you think the Sith might take exception to that?;
Well, maybe. I guess. But the Sith here on Manaan aren't about to do anything to get them in trouble. Not if it means getting sanctions against their Kolto shipments.;
As long as I don't actually *say* I'm with the Sith, they don't seem to mind. So I use this outfit to give me the psychological edge I need. Being Ithorak's security advisor isn't easy!;
Yes, I can see how it would be very stressful.;
You can't even begin to imagine how hard it is dealing with the galaxy's cultural elite. They're like spoiled children, throwing tantrums whenever they don't get their way.;
And Ithorak is the worst of them all! 'You idiot, Vek!' 'How could you be so stupid, Vek!' He thinks my job is easy, but I'd like to see where he'd be without me!;
I'm... I'm sorry for that outburst. I come here to relax, but just talking about work is making me tense. So allow me to wish you a civil 'good day' so I can get back to watching the racers.;
Your job doesn't sound that hard to me.;
I'll be going now.;
What is your business, exactly?;
Who are you again?;
What do you do again?;
I enjoy watching you on the track. You are good, for a human. Your runs are a nice diversion when the stress of my business becomes too much for me.;
Greetings, human. Have you come here to watch the swoop races? I find they are an excellent way to relieve stress. And in my business, I need all the stress relief I can get.;
Welcome once again, human. Is there something I can do for you?;
[The Eastern Dune Sea continues to a barren horizon, but there are signs that people have passed this way. The occasional stone appears to be marking a path, but the logic of how they are placed is indecipherable to an outsider.];
[A vast expanse of desert stretches before you, with no markers or any indications of life. It would be a deathtrap for anyone wandering aimlessly.];

"Greetings; if you haven't heard, there is some trouble over at the academy. Best stay away from there. But anyhow... is there anything I can offer you today?";
What sort of trouble?;
"I don't really know much; but people have been either whispering or fighting around here, and my sales are through the roof.";
Trouble's good for business, that's what I always say. Especially when it's Sith trouble.;
So, how can I help you?;
What sort of merchandise do you offer?;
"Weapons, mostly; I've got... connections. You'll need them, if you're going to be spending any time here.";
Why so?;
"There are a lot of Sith on this planet; this is where they come to study. Obnoxious brats, the lot of them.";
Just between you and me, I'll never understand why everyone thinks 'dark side' and 'hooligan' should be the same thing.;
But they are definitely dangerous. So that's why you'll probably need weapons. Heh... not that they'll be much help.;
"I'm training to be a Sith myself; I think I'll be alright.";
Really? You won't tell them what I said, will you?;
You seem like a good sort, compared to most of the lot around here. I didn't mean anything by it.;
I sell to anyone, no matter how they treat me. So, is there anything you'd like?;
What connections do you have?;
Mandalorian raiders occasionally drop by, needing to get rid of some extras that they can't sell in the civilized systems.;
They treat me well, I treat them well. It works out.;
So if you need weapons... and you probably will... this is the place to come.;
Why will I need weapons?;
Can I see your merchandise?;
"Certainly; allow me to punch up the stock.";
Not right now, thank you.;
Thanks for dropping by.;
What sort of connections?;
Greetings. Say, aren't you the one who won that swoop race on Manaan? I'm a big fan.;
"I hope we can find something suited to a celebrity like you; is there anything you'd like?";
"Good to see you again; is there anything you need?";
"Greetings; welcome to Korriban. If there's anything you need, you can talk to me.";

[The shimmer of a repulsor field is visible before you. It stands in stark contrast with the foliage around it.];
Here we are again. Shall I bypass the field so we may pass?;NM24AAFORC01001_.mp3
Yes. Get us past the field.;
I can manipulate it for a moment. Let me see... how did the Czerka engineers do it...;NM24AAFORC01011_.mp3
Ahh, there we go. Now keep moving. These are the most dangerous depths of Kashyyyk.;NM24AAFORC01021_.mp3
A few surprises wait for us, I'll wager.;NM24AAFORC01022_.mp3
Why did the Czerka place this here?;
I think it was an attempt to block the more dangerous carnivores from wandering freely, but it's not very effective.;NM24AAFORC01006_.mp3
It limits us non-climbers, but the creatures of Kashyyyk are very adaptable. You'll see why when we reach your goal.;NM24AAFORC01007_.mp3
Have you gone past it before?;
Yes, but I don't make a habit of it. The other side is genuinely dangerous.;NM24AAFORC01009_.mp3
Why place this thing here?;
There are others, each blocking similar points on certain paths. It is all very calculated. Very precise.;NM24AAFORC01013_.mp3
It would have been effective if it hadn't relied on the creatures to be walking. Climbers don't have much trouble getting around it.;NM24AAFORC01014_.mp3
Whatever. Just shut it down.;
You aren't going to ask about it? A repulsor field in the woods and you have no interest?;NM24AAFORC01016_.mp3
Very well. Why did Czerka put this here?;
Just shut it down. I'll worry about it later.;
All right then, uh, how did it go...;NM24AAFORC01019_.mp3
Ah, very well. Young durga-spits like you have no appreciation for details. Now, let's see... how did I do it...;NM24AAFORC01020_.mp3
I trust you can get past it? You said so.;
There, you see? Beautifully subtle, isn't it? At least, compared to other Czerka equipment dumped down here.;NM24AAFORC01003_.mp3
It's only been here a short while, or the Wookiees would have disabled it. They wouldn't have had an easy time of it, though.;NM24AAFORC01004_.mp3
[This is obviously one of the barriers to your progress that Jolee was speaking of. If he were here, he would allow you to pass it.];
[There appears to be no obvious means of deactivating the field. You'll need to find someone familiar with the area that is willing to help you.];
The Twi'lek, Yuthura, is now the master of the academy. I wonder if she will admit more students, now.;
I have been told that Yuthura Ban has been killed. Do you think they will allow more students, now, or no?;

It seems that I have little hope in competing against you and the others. Master Uthar did not even speak to me during his speech.;

Thank you, human. I do not know what you are doing inside this military base, but I am grateful. Once again I owe you a debt I can never repay.;
Now I must leave this place before the Sith discover I have escaped. If you are wise, you will do the same. If the Sith capture you I doubt anyone else will come by to set you free.;
You there - human. Remember me? You helped me once before when the Sith were trying to arrest me. Outside your apartment. Do you remember?;
Right. I remember you.;
I am in need of your help once again. The Sith are going to execute me for removing the Sith corpse from your apartment complex. Please, help me get out of this cage.;
How do I get you out?;

What's in this for me?;
I have nothing to offer you, other than my gratitude. Please, human, have pity on me.;
I think I'll just leave you there.;
"No, human, please! I beg you not to leave me here. Just set all the panels on the wall to the red ""off"" position to release me. Is that so much to ask?";
Fine, I'll help you.;
Forget it.;
Is there nothing I can say to persuade you, human? Please, have pity on me. Reconsider, I beg you.;
Sorry, I don't remember who you are.;
I suppose all of us Duros look alike to you, human. In any case, it doesn't matter whether you remember helping me before or not.;

Of you. Fighting a dark Jedi. Revan, I guess.;
This is... strange. Such visions are often a sign of Force sensitivity.;NM02AFVISI05004_.mp3
Are you saying I can use the Force?;
I... I'm not sure. It may be that you have some connection to the Force. It would not be unheard of. When we first met, your natural talent may have fed off my own Force abilities.;NM02AFVISI05006_.mp3
It is possible that in the excitement of the battle's aftermath the Force allowed you to witness one of my more intense memories.;NM02AFVISI05007_.mp3

Lord Malak, the Star Forge is operating at 200% capacity - far beyond our expectations.;NSTN12STUN01000_.mp3
I am more interested in the young Jedi Bastila and her Battle Meditation. Have you learned how she escaped the destruction of Taris?;NSTN12STUN01001_.mp3
She was aided by Carth Onasi, a decorated war hero of the Republic and a legendary soldier. During the Mandalore Wars he was honored many times for his bravery.;NSTN12STUN01002_.mp3
You know this man?;NSTN12STUN01003_.mp3
Yes, Lord Malak. He served under me when I still followed the Republic. You could say I was his mentor.;NSTN12STUN01004_.mp3
Interesting. How did you acquire this information, Admiral?;NSTN12STUN01005_.mp3
An eye witness, Lord Malak.;NSTN12STUN01006_.mp3
Calo Nord, a bounty hunter, was there when Bastila and Carth escaped the planet. Apparently they left him for dead.;NSTN12STUN01007_.mp3
A Jedi and a war hero - it's a wonder you survived the encounter.;NSTN12STUN01008_.mp3
I am hard to kill, Lord Malak.;NSTN12STUN01009_.mp3
Calo has agreed to help us capture the young Bastila - for a very hefty fee, of course. But I assure you he is well worth the price. His reputation as a bounty hunter is well earned.;NSTN12STUN01010_.mp3
Her companions are nothing to me, Calo - but I desire the young Jedi taken alive if at all possible.;NSTN12STUN01011_.mp3
Lord Malak, forgive me. There is something else. May we have a private audience away from the ears of the common soldiers?;NSTN12STUN01012_.mp3
I trust you are not wasting my time, Admiral Karath.;NSTN12STUN01013_.mp3
I promise you will be very interested in what Calo has to tell you about Bastila's other companions, Lord Malak.;NSTN12STUN01014_.mp3
Calo Nord is dead, Lord Malak. He has failed in his mission. Forgive me.;NSTN14STUN01000_.mp3
The penalty for failure is death, Admiral Karath. But the failure was Calo's, not yours. You may rise.;NSTN14STUN01001_.mp3
Shall I hire another bounty hunter, Lord Malak?;NSTN14STUN01002_.mp3
No mere bounty hunter can stand against a Jedi. I shall not make the same mistake again.;NSTN14STUN01003_.mp3

And then we shall see if Revan can stand against the full fury of the Star Forge! Ha-ha-ha!;NM45AADARK99007_.mp3
Welcome back, Revan. It has been some time since you last accessed my database. I was beginning to wonder if you had been terminated.;
I almost was. But I'm hard to kill.;
An obvious conclusion, given your presence here. However, my sensory input systems are detecting some significant changes in your composition since your last visit.;
Your neurological patterns exhibit subtle yet substantive alterations in both thought patterns and information processing. These changes have been noted and recorded in my database.;
Your database?;
I am a completely self-sufficient, autonomous, interactive database constructed by the Rakata to record and store the entire history of the species.;
However, since the collapse of the Infinite Empire there have been few events worth recording, and nobody has sought to access the information stored within my database... until you came along.;
Due to my systems' ability to monitor and repair themselves, you will find all the data within my archives has remained fully intact. Please choose the topic you wish information on.;
I'm looking for genetic data on the Rakata.;
My storage banks contain significant quantities of information on this subject, compiled through hundreds of years of research and study.;
Please wait while I load the information onto a data pad for your future reference. Processing...;
Information transfer complete. Is there anything else you require, Revan?;
Tell me about the Star Forge.;
The Star Forge was constructed during the apex of the Infinite Empire's power. A true technological marvel, it is an enormous space station that serves as both factory and battle dreadnaught.;
The Star Forge can mass produce immense fleets with a minimum of time and resources. In addition, the Star Forge also shares much of the same technology used in my own construction.;
In many ways the Star Forge is like a living entity. It feeds, it hungers, it draws on the energy flowing through all living things - what you called the Force the last time you were here.;
This ability to feed and consume the living energy of the Force is the key to the Star Forge's power, but ultimately it was also what led to the destruction of the Infinite Empire.;
What do you mean?;
The Rakata are by nature a cruel and savage species. The Star Forge fueled itself with the hatred inherent in its own creators, and in doing so it accentuated these traits within the Builders.;
In your terminology, the Star Forge is a tool of the dark side. It corrupts those who use it so that it can generate greater and greater amounts of negative energy to fuel itself.;
The Builders thought they were strong enough to control this effect, but they were wrong. They became victims of their own creation, and eventually their hatred turned them against each other.;
Civil war destroyed the Infinite Empire... a lesson to remember. Only one who is immensely strong in mind and will can harness the power of the Star Forge without suffering a similar fate.;
I want to ask you something else.;
I'll be going now.;
As you wish. Please return if you find yourself in need of the information stored within my database.;
How can I shut off the disruptor field around this planet?;
The Disruptor Field was constructed as the Star Forge's primary defense against enemy attack, and can only be deactivated from the upper levels of the Temple.;
How can I get to the upper levels of the temple?;
My systems control the doors to the upper levels, allowing only those who are worthy of the Rakata legacy to pass. The last time you were here, Revan, I unsealed the doors for you.;
However, the subtle neurological changes I detected in you earlier likely caused a failure in the recognition system that would have opened the doors for you.;
I have updated my databases to recognize the new configurations in your mind, Revan. The doors to the upper levels will once again open for you.;
Do you know anything about the Star Maps?;
The Star Maps were built on conquered worlds as a symbol of Rakatan dominance and glory. Each map showed the whole expanse of the Infinite Empire, with the Star Forge at the center.;
When the Empire fell, the Rakata fled back here to their homeworld. They sabotaged the Star Maps so the enslaved species could not use them to discover the Star Forge or this planet.;
But I used the Star Maps to find this place!;
The Star Maps were created with the same technology as my own self-sufficient systems. Over the millennia the maps have been slowly rebuilding and repairing themselves.;
As you informed me during your last visit to this world, the Star Maps are still in a damaged and incomplete state. It is not possible to locate the Star Forge using a single map.;
However, the Star Maps have repaired themselves to the extent that it is possible to discover the Star Forge's location by combining bits of data from several of the maps, as you did.;
They didn't do a very good job of destroying them.;
Tell me about the history of the Infinite Empire.;
At its peak the Infinite Empire ruled over 500 planets and was comprised of ten billion Rakata and over a trillion slaves scattered across the galaxy.;
"But the glory of the Infinite Empire was built on war and slaughter; it was inevitable it should collapse upon itself. Conflict among power-hungry warlords escalated into full civil war.";
Worlds were ravaged and millions of lives were lost. Sensing the weakness of their oppressors, the slaves rebelled and overthrew their masters. And then came the plague.;
The plague?;
Its origins were unknown - perhaps the creation of an enslaved species, perhaps a mutation of a natural virus. It killed only Rakata, and it spread to every corner of the galaxy.;
The Infinite Empire crumbled into dust as the few Rakata survivors fled back here to their home world. All evidence of their existence was destroyed by the species they once enslaved.;
But even hidden here on their secret home world they were not safe. Millions died from the deadly plague, many more died in the never ending civil war.;
The history of the Rakata ended twenty thousand years ago. Now they are nothing but a few scattered tribes descended from the priest and warrior castes, still waging our never ending civil war.;
What are you?;
I need some information.;

This droid is too busy preparing drinks to take your order.;
We've got problems! We've flown into some kind of disruptor field. All my instruments are jammed! We've got massive overloads in all systems!;NM12AAC04001000_.mp3
I'm picking up a single planet in this system.  I'll try and put us down there.  Hold on.;NM12AAC04001001_.mp3
This may be a rough landing.;
What what what? Something else come into my prison? Already?;
So very long a time and nothing. Then in a span of mere months three in a row! What sheer luck!;
Well let's have a look at you. Hmm. Biped. More or less symmetrical. Far less hair than the last one. Opposable digits. Mostly water, hey? I suppose you'll have to do.;
I'll have to do for what?;
Eh? For a body, of course. I don't want to remain in this prison forever, no no no.;
I'm a prisoner here. As are you, yes indeed... though I suspect by accident rather than by sentence, yes? I was put here on purpose.;
My own people put our criminals in little cages like this. Well... our minds, anyway. For really terrible criminals like me our mind gets locked away forever.;
How long have I been here now? Hmmm... one... four... no, no, longer than that. I've never been very good with numbers.;
This is a prison?;
Can you think of a better prison than one without walls? What does your species use? Cages, I suppose.;
Is there no way out of here?;
Well, now *that* is a most interesting question. Yes yes yes indeed.;
I've been here long enough to ponder that. How many years, now? A thousand? Ten thousand? Bah... I could never remember the numbers, even when I kept track.;
The point is that I know a way out of this clever little prison. Interesting, that, wouldn't you say?;
Out? Out to where? If you get out of here, your body's probably dead.;
How clever of you to realize that? Indeed you are correct. Your body, however, is not.;
Now before you go off getting all excited and defensive, let me tell you that I can't go jumping into your body without your willing agreement.;
Conversely, you can't go jumping back into your body without my knowledge. This leaves us at something of an impasse, wouldn't you agree?;
So what do you suggest?;
What I suggest is for us to settle this now, like civilized beings.;
It is like this, dear sentient... if you like, we could spend the next thousand years debating. You want out, I want out, it could go on and on.;
Unless your species is remarkably long-lived, I doubt your body has a thousand years. And, frankly, I doubt either of us is going to convince the other of anything, yes?;
So why waste the time? A simple competition between the two of us and we settle the matter. You win, you go free. I win, I go free. Yes?;
How do I know I could trust you?;
You have no reason not to trust me, now. If I were to betray you, then you would never trust me again... and we would be stuck here arguing forever.;
It only takes once.;
I suppose that's true. But if you won and I did not release you, there would never be another chance for me to escape anyway, would there? You would never agree to it.;
You have a point.;
Hence I may as well let you go, if you win. It is my one and only opportunity for freedom.;
What kind of competition do you mean?;
I have little clue as to which activities you are superior at. You are at the same disadvantage with me, I suspect.;
So the best game is one of the mind. An exchange of riddles, perhaps. The first of us to fail at an answer loses. What do you think?;
I don't seem to have much of a choice.;
Now now no need to be fussy. If I seem to be moving fast it's simply because I've had an overabundance of time to consider this scenario.;
That being the case, and seeing as this is technically my home, I'll go first. Now... let's see...;
"""Until I am measured, I am not known, yet how you miss me when I have flown.""";
Light.;
Mmm? Are you quite serious with that answer? And here I thought I was only warming up. The answer is time!;
My, my, my... the contest is over already! Fair is fair, sentient... I go free.;
With luck you will someday find a body of your own, yes? So don't despair... but do hold still.;
Time.;
Yes yes yes... I suppose that was an easy one. Perhaps I should have used all this time to think of harder riddles, hey?;
Fair is fair, sentient. Your turn.;
"""If you break me, I do not stop working. If you touch me, I may be snared. If you lose me, nothing will matter.""";
Oh my... there are not many things that keep working once they're broken. Hmmm... hmmmm. Snared? No no no, that's not it!;
I... I concede. I do not know the answer to your riddle. You are victorious.;
It's your heart.;
*sigh* It appears my destiny is to be imprisoned even longer. Are you ready to return to your body, sentient?;
Before I go, what's your name?;
Eh? My name? It's... it's... well how do you like that? I've completely forgotten.;
I think I knew it a thousand years ago. I guess I've been here so long I've forgotten. My, that is depressing.;
I'm ready to go.;
There's nothing complicated to it. It's better for me to just show you than teach you. Just close your eyes a moment, sentient...;
Right. Get me out of here, and don't do anything funny.;
I could try to find some other way to get you out of here.;
I doubt you could help. My people made quite certain that escaping these prisons was a difficult prospect, you know.;
It took me as long as I've been here to figure out the only exit... and even then, I'm sure it's only happened because my prison is no longer secure.;
Hmmm. I do have to wonder how that happened. Are my people still about? If they were, I can't see that they'd let my prison loose so easily.;
But even if they are gone, I doubt you'd be able to find any way to release me. No, I suppose I shall just have to wait for someone who is not as proficient at riddles as you are to come along.;
Don't worry. I'm sure someone else will be along before you know it.;
You know... you're right. And maybe they won't be as intelligent as you, either. That makes me feel much better, thank you.;
I could destroy your prison once I'm out... if you wish.;
Oh, I certainly doubt that. No offense, but your species hardly strikes me as that advanced. Besides... I'm not ready to explode into bitty atoms just yet.;
Oh my... there are not many things that keep working once they're broken. Hmmm... oh! Oh, yes. Your heart! Heart is the answer!;
Very clever, sentient... but it is my turn once again!;
"""I never was, yet always will be. I am never seen, yet always come. I can carry nothing, yet hold much for some.""";
Tomorrow.;
Yes yes yes, you have the right of it. Tomorrow it is.;
Gravity.;
Aha! Caught you, I have! Tomorrow is the answer! Tomorrow!;
Rain.;
Vacuum.;
"""Who makes it has no need of it. Who buys it has no use for it. Who uses it has no knowledge of it.""";
Air.;
No no no, you are wrong! A grave is the answer! To bury the dead!;
Energy.;
A grave.;
Yes, that's it. A grave it is, though I'll likely never see one.;
"""I am always hungry, I must always be fed. The finger I lick will soon turn red.""";
A gizka.;
No no no! You are wrong! A flame is the answer, to blister you red!;
A flame.;
Yes, it's true. I wasn't sure if you blistered as we did... but it appears you do. So be it.;
A starship engine.;
A mouth.;
"""To keep me, I must be given. If I am not kept, I am broken.""";
Love.;
Ha! No no no you are wrong! It is your word! You must give your word... and if your word is not kept, it is broken!;
A mirror.;
The sound barrier.;
Your word.;
True, true, you have the right of it. If your word is not kept, it is broken.;
"""What has roots as nobody sees, is taller than the trees, up up it goes and yet it never grows.""";
What manner of plant could that be? But it does not grow... so is it no plant at all? Think think think!;
What manner of plant could that be? But it does not grow... so is it no plant at all? It... it is a mountain! Yes, that is it!;
"""You heard me before, yet you hear me again, Then I die, until you call me again.""";
Hmmm... what an odd riddle. Yes yes yes, let me see. Hear again, and then call again... what could it be?;
Hmmm... what an odd riddle. Yes yes yes, let me see. Hear again, and then call again... an echo? It is an echo! Ha ha!;
"""Flying to Dantooine I meet five ships. Each ship has five crewmen, each crewman five pets. How many in all are flying to Dantooine?""";
No no! Not numbers! Never have I been good with numbers! Hmmm... think think think! Five times five... add the one... no no no...;
Err... carry the two... ninety-four? No, ninety-six! Is it ninety-six?;
It's one. I'm the only one flying to Dantooine.;
Ahh! Fooled, I have been! Fooled myself! Very very clever of you! You have won!;
"""You can see nothing else when you look in my face, I will look you in the eye and I will never lie.""";
Never lie, hey? Hmmm. There is something familiar here... I cannot place my finger upon it. Look you in the eye... look you in the eye...;
Never lie, hey? Hmmm. There is something familiar here... I cannot place my finger upon it. Look you in the eye... your reflection! It is your reflection!;
"""What does a poor man have that a rich man requires, what a miser spends and a thrifty man saves, and all men carry to their graves?""";
Hmmm... what a very odd and valuable thing this must be. Think think think! Is it... no no no, not that. Hmmm...;
Is the answer... time? Could it be?;
"The answer is ""nothing"".";
Blast! Spends nothing, saves nothing, carries nothing to his grave! Yes yes yes I should have known! Ahhhhh, you have won.;
Hope.;
I'd rather a more physical challenge.;
Mmmm no doubt. You may have missed my earlier statement, so let me remind you that your physical body is not really here.;
"Your muscles do not exert anything and you can apply no force here. Hence a ""physical"" challenge is somewhat impossible, no?";
So let's restrict ourselves to the mental challenges, my dear sentient.;
And what's to stop you from cheating?;
For that matter, what's to stop *you* from cheating? The only thing I can think of is that it's quite hard to cheat at riddles. Fair is fair.;
What are the rules?;
Hmm. Perhaps we should restrict ourselves from riddles specific to our culture or race. A kiratta-sarn, while wonderful to look at, would be meaningless to you, I'm sure.;
Beyond that, I shouldn't think there be any rules necessary. A riddle is a riddle. So are we agreed?;
This sounds deceptively simple.;
Does it? In truth, I've had a long time to think it over. You can take your time thinking about it, yourself, but why?;
Forget it! Tell me how to get out! NOW!!;
Why would I do that? And however would you coerce me to do so? No no no... we play or you stay. Simple as that.;
Look... you are *not* getting my body.;
Did I not already say that I could only take your body if you were willing? Yes yes I believe I did. We are still communicating, correct?;
How do I know you aren't lying to me?;
I don't suppose you'll tell me, will you?;
Why would I not tell you? My escape requires your involvement... and your body, I might add.;
Let me guess: there's a catch.;
Isn't there always? There's only one place that one of us can escape to... and that's your body. Mine, I'm sure, is not available.;
What did you do to get imprisoned here?;
I led a war. Well, a rebellion really, though the details would hardly interest you. Many of my kind died, and I'm responsible... or so they said.;
"You said ""three in a row"" earlier. Have there been others besides me?";
Oh yes yes indeed. Two others of entirely different species visited me before you. I couldn't speak with them like I can with you, however.;
They eventually grew angry and ran off into the whiteness. If you go far enough out, you may find them... though I wouldn't recommend it.;
They're likely quite mad. All this whiteness can do that to you, you know. It'll drive you mad mad mad. If you let it.;
Just keep your distance, I'm warning you.;
And what would you do? Harm me? You think you're wearing those clothes, here, and carrying those weapons? Interesting, really.;
No no no... there's not a thing we can do to each other. So you needn't worry, I can't harm you. Isn't that reassuring?;
Mind telling me who and what you are?;
Back off, creature! I don't care to be inspected!;
Oh? Your race is a violent one, then? I see, I see. My own race is not so different. Are you familiar with us? The others weren't.;

The vision again! Did you see it? You must have. Revan and Malak were here before us - I feel their dark presence. They must have come and found... this.;NM13AABAST01030_.mp3
What is it?;
It's a map of hyperspace coordinates. Some sort of star chart. But what is this Sith Star Forge they mentioned? And why did they lust to uncover its secrets?;NM13AABAST01032_.mp3
Could it have been a factory, or weapons plant?;
Maybe... that might explain how the Sith were able to amass a fleet so quickly...;NM13AABAST01034_.mp3
Whatever this Star Forge is, it was important enough for Revan and Malak to betray the Jedi. This Star Forge must be the seat of their power. If it could be destroyed...;NM13AABAST01036_.mp3
How can we destroy it if we don't even know what it is?;
The hyperspace coordinates on this map might lead us to the Star Forge, if they were complete. But there are pieces missing.;NM13AABAST01038_.mp3
What good is an incomplete map?;
I recognize one of the planets on the map: Korriban - a Sith world. And if that's Korriban, then this must be Kashyyyk... and Tatooine... and here's Manaan...;NM13AABAST01041_.mp3
Now I think I understand. This map was only the starting point for Revan's dark journey into the ways of the Sith.;NM13AABAST01043_.mp3
Tatooine, Kashyyyk, Manaan, Korriban: Revan visited each of these worlds searching for clues to reveal the hidden location of the Star Forge.;NM13AABAST01045_.mp3
So now what?;
Before we do anything we must inform the council of what we have discovered. They will decide our next course of action, though I suspect our task has only just begun.;NM13AABAST01047_.mp3
We have to explore these worlds!;
Can't you tell anything from the map?;
So we're back at square one?;
Destroyed? If it could be harnessed...;
Such thoughts speak of the dark side! We serve the Republic and the Jedi Council. It must be their decision as to what course of action to take.;NM13AABAST01052_.mp3
Who said it had anything to do with the Sith? They may have allies in the background helping them now.;
What does it mean?;
It looks like some sort of map...;
The Council has finished its deliberations and are waiting. We should see them now.;NM13AABAST01057_.mp3
The Council must be told about what we have discovered! Meet me in the Council chambers.;NM13AABAST01059_.mp3
The Republic Fleet must have got the message I sent as we were crashing onto that planet. I'm picking up a transmission from them now.;NM12AAC05001000_.mp3
This is Admiral Forn Dodonna to the Ebon Hawk, do you read us?;NM12AAC05001001_.mp3
Admiral Dodonna, this is Carth Onasi. We are receiving your transmission.;NM12AAC05001002_.mp3
Carth, I'm glad to see you're still alive. We've begun our assault on the Star Forge, but we're taking heavy losses. How did the Sith ever manage to build something of this scope!;NM12AAC05001003_.mp3
The Star Forge wasn't constructed by the Sith, Admiral. We don't have time for me to fully explain it, but that space station is far older than you can imagine.;NM12AAC05001004_.mp3
Maybe we should pull the fleet back and retreat. I don't know if we have the firepower to go up against this alien technology.;NM12AAC05001005_.mp3
You can't do that, Admiral.  The Star Forge is a factory of immense power.  It's been churning out the capital ships, snub fighters and assault droids that have powered the Sith war effort. ## You have to destroy the Star Forge now or you'll be fighting an unending wave of reinforcements.;NM12AAC05001006_.mp3
You have to destroy the Star Forge now or you'll be fighting an unending wave of reinforcements.;
Then I guess we have no choice.  But it isn't going to be easy. ## I can't even get our capital ships into position to start bombarding the Star Forge. ## The Sith fleet is too well organized.  It's like they can guess our every move and counter our every strategy.;NM12AAC05001008_.mp3
I can't even get our capital ships into position to start bombarding the Star Forge.;
The Sith fleet is too well organized. It's like they can guess our every move and counter our every strategy.;
It's because of Bastila, Admiral.  She turned to the dark side and become Malak's apprentice. ## We suspect she's somewhere on that space station right now, ## using her Battle Meditation against you and your fleet.;NM12AAC05001011_.mp3
We suspect she's somewhere on that space station right now,;
using her Battle Meditation against you and your fleet.;
This is Master Vandar. A number of Jedi Knights have joined our fleet under his command.;NM12AAC05001014_.mp3
If Bastila is using her power to augment the Sith then Malak's fleet is invincible. Our only hope is to somehow stop Bastila from using her Battle Meditation.;NM12AAC05001015_.mp3
How can we do that if she's on the space station?;NM12AAC05001016_.mp3
I will send a squadron of Jedi Knights to the Star Forge to find Bastila. Their small ships will be able to fly through the Sith blockade and dock on the space station.;NM12AAC05001017_.mp3
If they can find Bastila, they may be able to distract her attention from the battle overhead. ## That should allow you to move your capital ships into postion for a final assault on the Star Forge itself.;NM12AAC05001018_.mp3
If they can find Bastila, they may be able to distract her attention from the battle overhead.;
I hate to ask you this after all you've done, Carth, but the Jedi may need all the help they can get...;NM12AAC05001020_.mp3
Don't worry, Admiral. The Ebon Hawk and her crew are going to see this through to the end!;NM12AAC05001021_.mp3
And may the Force be with you.;NM12AAC05001022_.mp3
[A vast expanse of desert stretches before you, with no markers or any indications of life. It would be a deathtrap for anyone wandering aimlessly.];
Im... [cough] impossible. I... I cannot be beaten. I am the Dark Lord of the Sith.;NM45AADART04014_.mp3
No, Malak. I am the true Sith Master!;
Yes... I cannot deny it any longer. [cough] You are the one who deserves... who deserves to be the Dark Lord.;NM45AADART04016_.mp3
You were the one who found the first Star Map on Dantooine, Revan. [cough] It was you who lead us on our quest for the Star Forge. I only followed in your wake.;NM45AADART04017_.mp3
I tried to usurp your rule, to steal the title of Sith Master from you. But now I understand... The destiny is yours, Revan. Not mine.;NM45AADART04018_.mp3
You... you are Darth Revan, Lord ... [cough] Lord of the Sith. And I... I am nothing.;NM45AADART04019_.mp3
The apprentice has learned his final lesson.;
And so it ends as I somehow always knew it must: in darkness.;NM45AADART04021_.mp3
You should have known you could never defeat me, Malak!;
The Star Forge is mine now, Malak!;
This is the way of the dark side, Malak: all things end in death.;
Still... [cough] still spouting the wisdom the Jedi, I see. Maybe there is more truth in their code than I ever believed.;NM45AADART04025_.mp3
I... I cannot help but wonder, Revan. What would have happened had our positions been reversed? What if fate had decreed I would be captured by the Jedi?;NM45AADART04026_.mp3
Could I have returned to the light, as you did? [cough] If you had not led me down the dark path in the first place, what destiny would I have found?;NM45AADART04027_.mp3
You cannot blame me for the path you chose.;
I suppose... I suppose you speak the truth. I alone must accept responsibility for my fate. I wanted to be Master of the Sith and ruler of the galaxy.;NM45AADART04029_.mp3
But that destiny was not mine, Revan. [cough] It might have been yours, perhaps... but never mine. And in the end, as the darkness takes me, I am nothing.;NM45AADART04030_.mp3
I am sorry I started you on this path. But you chose to continue down it.;
The power of the light will always be stronger than the dark side.;
You continue to amaze me, Revan. If only you had been the one to uncover the true power of the Star Forge you might have become truly invincible.;NM45AADART04033_.mp3
But you were a fool. All you saw was an enormous factory, all you ever imagined was an infinite fleet rolling forth to crush the Republic. You were blind, Revan - blind and stupid!;NM45AADART04034_.mp3
What are you talking about?;
The Star Forge is more than just a space station. In some ways, it is like a living creature. It hungers. And it can feed on the dark side that is within all of us!;NM45AADART04036_.mp3
Look around you, Revan. See the bodies? You should recognize them from the Academy. These are Jedi who fell when I attacked Dantooine. For all intents and purposes dead, except for one difference:;NM45AADART04037_.mp3
I have not let them become one with the Force. Instead I have brought them here. The Star Forge corrupts what remains of their power and transfers the dark taint to me!;NM45AADART04038_.mp3
You cannot beat me, Revan. Not here on the Star Forge. Not when I can draw upon the power of all these Jedi!;NM45AADART04040_.mp3
And once you are beaten I will do the same to you. You will be trapped in a terrible existence between life and death, your power feeding me as I conquer the galaxy!;NM45AADART04041_.mp3
Is there some point to this?;
[There is a powerful energy shield that prevents you from passing.];
[This kshyy vine ascends high into the canopy above. There is no indication why its growth has stopped at this point.];
The vine... I remember this. There were hunters that would tell of the trial... of how the chieftain Rothrrrawr was nearly killed.;
It was said that he lost the blade to Bacca's sword in a place just like this, foolishly challenging the Great Beast. I wonder...;
What do you know about the ritual?;
Not much. I believe a specific creature was killed to hang from the vine. This served as bait for the larger more dangerous beasts.;
We have a viper kinrath corpse. Perhaps that is what is required for the ritual. Perhaps we were meant to do this. Tie it to the vine.;
[Tie the viper kinrath corpse to the vine.];
[The creature is easily wrapped in the vine, which doesn't distort at all under the weight. The only movement is a rustling from off in the distance.];
Perhaps later.;
Very well, but it should be done.;
We should seek out a suitable creature to place on the vine. I don't know what will happen, but it is worth trying.;
So this Great Beast is going to miraculously appear for me?;
Your tone mocks the ritual, but this is how it was done for generations. It is how we proved our worth... and punished for Rothrrrawr's arrogance.;
Never mind for now.;
No! No, we must do this. We can complete the ritual and summon the Great Beast. Perhaps that is the way to repair Bacca's sword.;
Here, I think this is how it was supposed to be done. Take the viper kinrath corpse we found and tie it to the vine. Then we wait.;
Very well.;
[The ground beneath is stained by years of blood, suggesting that freshly killed animals have been suspended from the vine many times in the past.];
[Leave.];
[The kshyy vine is slick with blood.];
[The viper kinrath corpse hangs lifeless, the kshyy vine barely distorting under its weight. The only movement is a rustling off in the distance.];
Darth Malak!;NM40ACDART03002_.mp3
Down you go!;_M40ACDART03999_.mp3
Ha-ha-ha!;NM45AALIGH010XX_.mp3
I hope you weren't thinking of leaving so soon, Bastila. I've spent far too much energy hunting down you and your companions to let you get away from me now.;NM40ACDART03004_.mp3
Besides, I had to see for myself if it was true. Even now I can hardly believe my eyes... tell me, why did the Jedi spare you? Is it vengeance you seek at this reunion?;NM40ACDART03006_.mp3
Reunion? What are you talking about?;
What? Ha-ha-ha! You mean you don't know? Ha-ha-ha! All this time, and you still haven't figured it out? Ha-ha-ha!;NM40ACDART03008_.mp3
I wonder how long you would have stayed blind to the truth? Surely some of what you once were must have surfaced by now.;NM40ACDART03010_.mp3
Even the combined power of the Jedi Council couldn't keep your true identity buried forever, could it?;NM40ACDART03012_.mp3
Why did the Jedi spare me? I don't understand...;
This meeting was inevitable, Malak!;
As is the outcome. I am actually surprised this confrontation did not happen sooner, given how powerful your mind once was.;NM40ACDART03016_.mp3
You cannot hide from what you once were, Revan! Recognize that you were once the Dark Lord - and know that I have taken your place!;NM40ACDART03018_.mp3
No... this is some type of trick! A Sith lie!;
You do not yet remember, Revan? The Jedi set a trap. They lured us into battle against a small Republic fleet. During the attack a team of Jedi knights boarded your ship.;NM40ACDART03020_.mp3
"The Jedi strike team captured you and the Council used the Force to reprogram your mind; they wiped away your identity and turned you against your own followers.";NM40ACDART03022_.mp3
No, I don't believe you, Malak!;
"You must have seen flashes of your old life in your dreams, Revan; memories bubbling up to the surface? Surely you must remember the battle in which you were captured?";NM40ACDART03024_.mp3
"How you survived the final battle is a mystery to me. Perhaps you should ask Bastila; after all, she was part of the Jedi strike team that captured you!";NM40ACDART03026_.mp3
Bastila, is this true?;
It's true. I was part of the team sent to capture Revan... to capture you. When Malak fired on the ship you were badly injured. We thought you were dead.;NM40ACDART03028_.mp3
Your mind was destroyed, but I used the Force to preserve the flicker of life in your body. I brought you to the Jedi Council. They were the ones who healed your damaged mind.;NM40ACDART03030_.mp3
Then why don't I remember being Revan?;
The Jedi Council didn't restore your wounded mind, Revan! They merely programmed it with a new identity - one loyal to the Republic! They tried to make you their slave!;NM40ACDART03032_.mp3
You've been lying to me this whole time, Bastila!;
I wanted to tell you, but the Council forbid it! They were afraid you might return to the dark side if you discovered your real identity!;NM40ACDART03034_.mp3
But now you know the truth, Revan! The Council has failed in their attempt to make you their pawn! The will of a Sith Lord is not so easily manipulated!;NM40ACDART03036_.mp3
Why not just let me die?;
The Jedi hold all life sacred, even that of a Sith Lord. I could not just let you die, Revan. Not if it was possible to save you.;NM40ACDART03043_.mp3
"Bastila hides the truth behind noble words, Revan! The Jedi needed the memories buried deep in your wounded mind; there was no other way to bring them out. They had to keep you alive!";NM40ACDART03045_.mp3
But why program me with another identity?;
"We couldn't simply restore your true identity; Revan was too dangerous. But locked inside your mind was information the Republic needed: the secrets of the Star Forge.";NM40ACDART03047_.mp3
"The Council created an identity for you: a soldier under my command. Your subconscious memories were supposed to lead me to the Star Forge; there was no other way to get the information.";NM40ACDART03049_.mp3
They made you their puppet, Revan - and Bastila was the handler pulling your strings!;NM40ACDART03051_.mp3
Why you, Bastila? Why did the Council choose you?;
When I used my Force powers to keep you alive on that bridge it created our bond. I convinced the Council that I could use that bond to draw out your memories and lead us to the Star Forge.;NM40ACDART03053_.mp3
Tell the truth, Bastila, you wanted to taste the dark side for yourself! You knew the only way the Council would permit you to explore the Sith's power was through Revan's lost memories!;NM40ACDART03055_.mp3
"NO! I wanted to help you, Revan. I thought this mission would redeem you; that it would atone for your past crimes. How else could you be saved?";NM40ACDART03057_.mp3
But what if I remembered who I really was?;
You had to be healed so I could try and draw out the secrets of the Star Forge - it was our only hope of stopping the Sith! It was a risk the Council chose to take.;NM40ACDART03059_.mp3
I understand, Bastila. You had no other choice.;
"Forgiveness, Revan? You are weak; I was right to betray you. You are not fit to rule the Sith!";NM40ACDART03069_.mp3
A small part of me has always regretted betraying you from afar. I always knew there were some who would think I acted out of fear, that I did not want to face you.;NM40ACDART03071_.mp3
"But now fate has given me a second chance to prove myself. Once I defeat you in combat no one will question my claim to the Sith throne; my triumph will be complete!";NM40ACDART03073_.mp3
Your power is no match for the light!;
The Jedi Council were foolish to let you live. I won't make the same mistake. We shall finish this alone in the ancient Sith tradition: master versus apprentice, as it was meant to be!;NM40ACDART03076_.mp3
Triumph, Malak? You seem to forget that I'm still alive!;
You used me, Bastila! You're no better than the Sith!;
How can you say that? Malak nearly killed you, but the Jedi Council gave you another chance to live! They gave you a chance to redeem yourself by defeating the Sith!;NM40ACDART03038_.mp3
A rash and futile hope. The dark side is too strong, my power is too great! Even my old master is no longer a match for me!;NM40ACDART03040_.mp3
But the memories I have... where did they come from?;
Yes - I've seen Bastila in my visions! She was there!;
How did they capture someone as powerful as Revan... I mean, me?;
I helped them, Revan. I always knew that one day the title of Dark Lord would be mine! When the Jedi strike team boarded your vessel I saw my day had come.;NM40ACDART03081_.mp3
I ordered my own ships to fire on your bridge. I thought I could destroy all my enemies with a single glorious victory! I never dreamed the Jedi would take you alive from the wreckage.;NM40ACDART03086_.mp3
But why did you betray... your master?;
You mean why did I betray you, Revan. You are the one who taught me the ways of the Sith: the strongest must rule if we are to survive!;NM40ACDART03088_.mp3
You knew I would one day challenge you for supremacy, but you underestimated me. I acted sooner than you expected and seized the Sith throne with a single brilliant stroke!;NM40ACDART03090_.mp3
Why wouldn't the Jedi simply kill me?;
"The Jedi are fools; they do not believe in executing prisoners. Originally I assumed you had died in the battle. Imagine my surprise when I found out you were still alive, Revan.";NM40ACDART03093_.mp3
Do you mean I'm really... your Master?;
Once I served you, Revan, but I always knew that one day the title of Dark Lord would be mine! When the Jedi strike team boarded your vessel I saw my day had come.;NM40ACDART03084_.mp3
I'm... Darth Revan? How is that possible?;
Damn gizka...;
3ab to the left, 3ad to the right;
You're back! But where's Bastila? Is she alive? What happened inside that Temple?;NM41AACART04000_.mp3
Bastila has fallen to the dark side. She fled to the Star Forge.;
The dark side? Bastila? No! No! How could that happen?;NM41AACART04002_.mp3
She was always in danger of being seduced by the dark side, Carth. Bastila was strong, but she was always impatient and headstrong. Malak preyed upon her weaknesses.;NM41AACART04003_.mp3
This planet is a tainted place, the Star Forge and the Temple have twisted the Force into an instrument of evil - just as Malak has twisted Bastila into a servant of the Sith.;NM41AACART04004_.mp3
She can still be saved, can't she?;
Malak has a strong hold on Bastila now - it will be difficult for her to break free of his influence. Especially considering her long association with you.;NM41AACART04006_.mp3
Remember the bond that was forged between you when she rekindled the spark that was your life. Through that bond she touched your memories... and also the echo of the dark taint within you.;NM41AACART04009_.mp3
But there's still hope for her, right? I mean, Revan rejected the dark side so Bastila could too, right? We still might be able to save her.;NM41AACART04010_.mp3
We can try... and we will.;
I don't know what fate awaits us, but I sense Bastila still has a role to play in the events to come. I have no doubt she will be waiting for us on the Star Forge.;NM41AACART04012_.mp3
No doubt. I must say that it's good to have you with us, my dear. For a minute there I thought you might decide... well, never mind what I thought.;NM41AACART04013_.mp3
Decide? Decide what?;NM41AACART04014_.mp3
Bastila tried to tempt her to the dark side, to reclaim Revan's heritage. She failed.;NM41AACART04015_.mp3
So... you did it? You turned against Revan once and for all? I knew she wasn't part of you anymore. I...I knew it.;NM41AACART04016_.mp3
Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Anything can still happen.;
I told you that you would have to make a choice eventually, that you would be tested. I think that was it, I...I can feel it.;NM41AACART04020_.mp3
And you did exactly what I'd hoped you would. It couldn't have been easy... I'm...I'm very proud of you.;NM41AACART04021_.mp3
It wasn't easy at all. Bastila made a good case.;
I'm sure she did. I can't say that any one of us wouldn't have been tempted.;NM41AACART04023_.mp3
I... I love you. And I...I can't wait until all of this is over with.;NM41AACART04028_.mp3
I love you, too.;
Hey! Sheesh... get a room, will ya?;NM41AACART04030_.mp3
That two spirits have found each other amidst such turmoil is a good omen, Mission. Does it not please you to see?;
Oh, sure. Even a good omen can get itself a room, though, don't ya think?;NM41AACART04032_.mp3
Well, I'm an old man and I know you should take love when you can find it. Good for you two, I say.;NM41AACART04037_.mp3
Beep! Beep-beep boop!!;
Answer: I have no idea what they speak of, droid. Organic meatbags are an eternal mystery to me.;NM41AACART04039_.mp3
Confidence is all well and good, Carth, but if we are going to catch up to Bastila we should leave soon, don't you think?;NM41AACART04040_.mp3
Okay - let's get moving. The longer we wait the harder this is going to be!;NM41AACART04041_.mp3
Hey, cool your engines there.;
Right. Sorry. I just... can't remember the last time I felt this happy. I can wait until the Star Forge is destroyed.;NM41AACART04034_.mp3
You make that sound so easy. Just fly over and boom, one less Star Forge in the universe, huh?;NM41AACART04035_.mp3
I feel more confident now than I ever did before. The Force is with us, Mission.;NM41AACART04036_.mp3
We've got a long way to go yet, Carth.;
I could never do what Bastila did.;
I know. I can't blame Bastila for being turned, however... she's...she's just so young and doesn't deserve this kind of fate.;NM41AACART04025_.mp3
Thank you. I appreciate the support.;
Always. I'm not certain any one of us wouldn't have been tempted by Bastila's offer.;NM41AACART04027_.mp3
I chose the light side. It's true.;
Once and for all? What are you talking about?;
Bastila tried to tempt her to the dark side, to reclaim Revan's heritage. She failed.;NM41AACART04043_.mp3
No doubt. Let's go, then, before she has time to organize a bigger welcoming committee.;NM41AACART04044_.mp3
I'm not sure what's in store for us, but I sense Bastila still has a role to play. I have no doubt she'll be waiting for us on the Star Forge.;NM41AACART04045_.mp3
It took the whole Jedi Council and a mind wipe to save me. What chance does she have?;
It's too late for her. Just accept it.;
I can't help but feel this is partly my fault.;
In the end we all choose our own path, but keep in mind the role that you played in her downfall. You and the task assigned to her by the Jedi Council.;NM41AACART04008_.mp3
Malak corrupted Bastila because she was weak.;
Weakness has nothing to do with the corruption of the dark side. A Jedi must always guard against pride and the desire for power. Especially you.;NM41AACART04049_.mp3
Bastila is lost to us now. She deserves to die.;
Bastila is dead, Carth. Malak killed her.;
Dead? I... I can't believe it.;NM41AACART04052_.mp3
She is not dead, Carth - though maybe that might have been easier for you to accept. She has fallen to the dark side and fled to the Star Forge.;NM41AACART04053_.mp3
She's not dead, Carth - though that might have been easier for you to accept. She's fallen to the dark side and fled to the Star Forge.;NM41AACART04054_.mp3
No time! We have to get off this planet and get to the Star Forge!;
Hold on a second! What about Bastila? Wasn't she in the Temple? Wh...what happened?;NM41AACART04056_.mp3
Bastila - you're alive! I was worried about you. For a minute there I was sure we'd never see you again once Malak got his... w... wait a minute.;NM41AACART04057_.mp3
Where are Juhani and Jolee Bindo? Are they okay? What happened inside that temple?;NM41AACART04058_.mp3
I have reclaimed the title of Darth Revan! Bow before me!;
What... what are you talking about?;NM41AACART04060_.mp3
The Jedi Council has failed, Carth - Darth Revan has been reborn! Together we will destroy Malak and seize control of his fleet, then use it to crush the Republic!;NM41AACART04061_.mp3
Juhani and Jolee would not swear loyalty to the new ruler of the Sith. They died for their foolishness. Now swear loyalty to Darth Revan, or face your own death!;NM41AACART04062_.mp3
No, you can't mean that! This... this isn't you! You're not Revan, I know it!;NM41AACART04063_.mp3
I am Revan, Carth. Now and forever.;
You've got to resist it! Th... this isn't you talking... we... we can help you, we can find a way --;NM41AACART04067_.mp3
My, my. I think the sad fool may actually be in love with you, Revan.;NM41AACART04068_.mp3
This is my choice, Carth, whether you like it or not.;
I refuse to believe that! We'll...we'll stop you if we have to, all of us. We'll save you from yourselves!;NM41AACART04073_.mp3
Don't resist me, Carth, or I'll be forced to destroy you.;
Wait, Lord Revan. Carth speaks only for himself - he does not speak for the others. He may find he stands alone here!;NM41AACART04080_.mp3
The droids will continue to serve you Revan - they are programmed to obey their master. And there may be others who will choose to join us.;NM41AACART04081_.mp3
The Republic is doomed, Revan has returned! Who will now swear loyalty to the second coming of the Dark Lord?;NM41AACART04082_.mp3
You're Revan and I'll follow you anywhere. It doesn't matter who you're fighting against, I'll be at your side. Mandalorians don't have any great love for the Republic anyway.;NM41AACART04083_.mp3
Light side, dark side - it doesn't make any difference to me, Revan. I'll stick by you no matter what comes.;NM41AACART04084_.mp3
Mission, what about you?;
I saw what the Sith did to Taris - anyone who serves the dark side is evil! Big Z and I are with Carth on this one!;NM41AACART04086_.mp3
No, Mission. I am bound by the oath of my life debt. I... I must stand with Revan.;
Zaalbar - Revan's a Sith! Just like Malak! It's not a betrayal if you break your life debt now!;NM41AACART04088_.mp3
If I go back on my vow I am betraying myself, my people and my ancestors. I cannot do that. Please, Mission - join us.;
No, Zaalbar. I don't care! I won't help the Sith against the Republic! Not for anything! Not even for you!;NM41AACART04090_.mp3
You don't have to help the Sith, Mission. Not while I'm here.;NM41AACART04091_.mp3
I see now it was a mistake to let you go into that Temple. I of all people should have seen this coming. First Saul Karath, and now you... I mean, I should be an expert on betrayal by now!;NM41AACART04092_.mp3
But nothing you can say or do can make me betray the Republic. I won't join you, and I won't just stand aside and let you become ruler of the Sith again, Revan!;NM41AACART04093_.mp3
You don't stand a chance against all of us, Carth.;
I... I'll find a way to save you, I swear! I won't give up on you... no matter what!;NM41AACART04095_.mp3
Run for it, Mission! Go! Go!;NM41AACART04096_.mp3
Let him go! We have more important things to worry about. We have to get to the Star Forge and kill Malak. Then we can turn our attention to the Republic.;NM41AACART04097_.mp3
Run for it, Mission! Go! Go!;NM41AACART04098_.mp3
No, Carth! Don't do it!;NM41AACART04099_.mp3
Then I guess it's time for you to die!;
It's too bad it had to come to this, Carth.;
Zaalbar, what about you?;
Not everyone is willing to throw their life away for the Republic, Carth!;
Not everyone is as foolish as you are, Carth!;
All of you? Are you sure of that?;
I guess I'll just have to kill you all, then.;
Join me, Carth. You can rule at my side, it's not too late.;
No, never! You're not the woman I love. We'll stop you if we have to, all of us.;NM41AACART04071_.mp3
How sad. I guess there's no future for us after all, is there?;
Does it matter who I am? I have joined the dark side.;
Don't be a blind fool, Carth. Open your eyes.;
Wh... what? No! We serve the Republic! You're no better than Malak! We'll never swear allegiance to one who serves the dark side!;NM41AACART04076_.mp3
If you resist me, I'll destroy you all!;
Only you serve the Republic, Carth. You don't speak for the others.;
Jolee would not swear loyalty to the new ruler of the Sith. He died for his foolishness. Now swear loyalty to Darth Revan, or face your own death!;NM41AACART04105_.mp3
They didn't make it.;
I went over to the dark side, Carth. That's what happened.;
Where's Jolee Bindo? Is he okay? What happened inside that temple?;NM41AACART04108_.mp3
He didn't make it.;
Kashyyyk... my home. I should have prepared you for coming here... but I don't know if I've prepared myself.;
Prepared me? What do you mean?;
I didn't leave Kashyyyk voluntarily. Mission must have told you how I was fleeing slavers... but there was more.;
I am an exile. The slavers on Kashyyyk only took me after I was forced to leave my village home, 20 years ago.;
Why were you forced to leave?;
My brother made deals with the slavers and allowed them to get a foothold. I found out and attacked him.;
The fight was stopped, but my father did not believe me when I told him about my brother's actions.;
I was made an exile, disowned by my home and people. I should not be here. They will not accept me back.;
Why didn't your father believe you?;
When I attacked my brother I was so mad... I used my claws. You don't understand what that means to a Wookiee.;
Our claws are tools, not weapons. To use them in battle is to become an animal. It is madness without honor.;
I am forever a madclaw in the eyes of my people. Nothing I say is to be trusted. They were right to cast me out.;
We'll deal with that if we have to. Let's go.;
I don't have much hope.;
Time has passed. Things will have changed.;
The slavers are still here... this dock is theirs. I doubt anyone has risen to try and fight. Nothing has changed.;
I just hope I can prove myself to my people. It will be difficult to make them listen. I just don't know.;
That's enough. I'll learn the rest on my own.;
Then stumble blindly. I won't speak of it again until it is in your face.;
I don't care, I'll learn what I need myself.;
It's a little late for warnings, fur ball.;
Don't mock me, this is hard. Mission may have told you I was taken from here by slavers... but there is more.;
Zaalbar should be here. He shouldn't miss this. He needs to know he can come back here.;NM22AAZAAL01029_.mp3
What do you mean?;
I can't talk for Big Z, but believe me, he should be with us. He's got... unfinished business here.;NM22AAZAAL01031_.mp3
I decide who comes or stays on the ship.;
I'm not saying that I know better than you, but this is Zaalbar's home. Don't you think he'd know some things?;NM22AAZAAL01033_.mp3
Besides, he's got things here he needs to take care of.;NM22AAZAAL01035_.mp3
The Wookiee was looking pretty agitated back in the ship. You think it's wise to leave him unattended?;NM22AAZAAL01036_.mp3
Perhaps you should reconsider leaving Zaalbar behind. This is, after all, his homeworld.;NM22AAZAAL01044_.mp3
It is always good to know as much as possible about a world, and to have a reliable guide. Perhaps we should get Zaalbar to accompany us.;NM22AAZAAL01053_.mp3
Hmph. Maybe we should have brought the Wookiee out. This place looks... untamed.;NM22AAZAAL01060_.mp3
Are you afraid of the wild, Mandalore? Are you a coward?;NM22AAZAAL01062_.mp3
Mandalorians are not cowards! We're just practical.;NM22AAZAAL01064_.mp3
Observation: You should have brought the Wookiee Zaalbar, despite the smell. He would have knowledge of this place, master.;NM22AAZAAL01066_.mp3
He has been away a long time.;
"Retort: ""A long time"" is still more frequent than ""never,"" which is how many times the rest of us have been here, master.";NM22AAZAAL01068_.mp3
Raargh!;
[This unsavory looking man appears to be looking for someone... maybe even one of your companions back on the Ebon Hawk.];
*grunt* What the hell is your kind doing here? Bad enough I have to deal with all these other idiots, but now there's a stinkin' Cathar on this world too?;NGLOBEHXOR15000_.mp3
I have as much right to be here as you do, SIR!;NGLOBEHXOR15002_.mp3
Do not seek to aggravate us.;
Ooooo! Big man, the Jedi, shooting his mouth off from behind a lightsaber, or whatever you're carrying.;NGLOBEHXOR15082_.mp3
Hiding behind your pet Cathar... And a woman at that!;NGLOBEHXOR15084_.mp3
We should have exterminated all you Cathar when we had the chance.;NGLOBEHXOR15086_.mp3
Wha... What do you know about my world?;NGLOBEHXOR15007_.mp3
I know enough that... Hey, wait a minute... you look familiar somehow...;NGLOBEHXOR15009_.mp3
What? You...;NGLOBEHXOR15011_.mp3
Do you two know each other?;
This doesn't concern you, Jedi trash.;NGLOBEHXOR15015_.mp3
Hm... now where could I have... No, he's dead and she likely is too. I...;NGLOBEHXOR15017_.mp3
What are you talking about??;NGLOBEHXOR15019_.mp3
Maybe I was wrong. Still, I think a specimen like you would be a nice addition to my collection.;NGLOBEHXOR15021_.mp3
So what would it take, Jedi, for you to sell your pet here to me?;NGLOBEHXOR15023_.mp3
She is not for sale!;
Now don't be so selfish. We both know Cathar aren't real people anyway.;NGLOBEHXOR15025_.mp3
The females make amusing pets, but males should be put down like the animals they are. I remember one time on Taris...;NGLOBEHXOR15027_.mp3
What?! WHAT DID YOU SAY?!;NGLOBEHXOR15029_.mp3
What are you saying?;
WHAT DID YOU DO ON TARIS, YOU SCUM?!;NGLOBEHXOR15031_.mp3
Put one of you down like the animals you are. So easy... then I saw one of the females on the auction block, but those darn Jedi...;NGLOBEHXOR15033_.mp3
It was you!;NGLOBEHXOR15035_.mp3
What? Me? Oh ho! Now I recognize where I've seen that face before.;NGLOBEHXOR15037_.mp3
You were the little Cathar I was going to purchase. But those Jedi came and stole my pet away from me!;NGLOBEHXOR15039_.mp3
You bought Juhani?;
When I was fighting with the Mandalorians against the Cathar, I developed an appreciation for these creatures. They make excellent servants if properly trained.;NGLOBEHXOR15041_.mp3
You Jedi act all prim and proper, but inside you must feel the same way I do about the lesser, non-human species. The Sith at least let their feelings show on the outside.;NGLOBEHXOR15043_.mp3
You... My homeworld...;NGLOBEHXOR15045_.mp3
Come now, will you let your pet go? I'm sure we can come up with a price we both think is fair.;NGLOBEHXOR15047_.mp3
You'll only hurt her if I let her go.;
NO, I WILL NOT BE SOLD!;NGLOBEHXOR15051_.mp3
And I will see you dead for what you have done to my people!;NGLOBEHXOR15053_.mp3
Uh... hold on a second! Don't be hasty!;NGLOBEHXOR15055_.mp3
Do not fall to the dark side again, Juhani.;
I... I will remain calm. I am a Jedi now.;NGLOBEHXOR15057_.mp3
My lust for vegeance must be curbed.;NGLOBEHXOR15059_.mp3
Yes, yes... Say no to the dark side...;NGLOBEHXOR15061_.mp3
But I will have you yet! Heh.;NGLOBEHXOR15063_.mp3
There is no emotion...;
...There is peace.;NGLOBEHXOR15066_.mp3
Let's get him!;
Yes, we.... NO! I must not fall prey to the dark side again.;NGLOBEHXOR15069_.mp3
Show me the money first.;
You were buying Cathar slaves?;
What are you talking about?;
You were on Taris?;
Calm down, Juhani.;
She is her own person.;
Well... what are you offering?;
Heh, I knew we could work something out.;NGLOBEHXOR15077_.mp3
I am not for sale!;NGLOBEHXOR15079_.mp3
We should just leave, Juhani.;
You annoy me, worm.;
Ooooo! Big woman, the Jedi, shooting her mouth off from behind a lightsaber, or whatever you're carrying.;NGLOBEHXOR15088_.mp3
Just ignore him, Juhani.;
Heh, yeah, do like the Jedi tells you and back off! Your people are pathetic, it's no wonder we crushed your world so easily.;NGLOBEHXOR15005_.mp3
A big mouth like that can get you killed.;
Ack! *cough* Heh, you seem to have defeated me, Cathar worm, but I'll have the last laugh in the end!;NGLOBEHXOR15090_.mp3
What do you mean?;NGLOBEHXOR15092_.mp3
Yes, what do you mean?;
*cough* You may have killed me here, today, but I had the pleasure of killing off your species!;NGLOBEHXOR15094_.mp3
Not everyone who fought alongside the Mandalorians did it for their stupid concept of 'honor'. Some of us did it just for the pleasure: the pleasure of seeing your world burn.;NGLOBEHXOR15096_.mp3
You... you animal! You wretch!;NGLOBEHXOR15098_.mp3
*cough* *cough* Heh, but I'm beyond your petty vengeance now, girl. You can never have your revenge!;NGLOBEHXOR15100_.mp3
Do not give in to the dark side, Juhani.;
I will not give him the satisfaction of seeing me give in to the dark side.;NGLOBEHXOR15103_.mp3
Worm!;NGLOBEHXOR15108_.mp3
I killed your people on Cathar in the sky, on the ground, in their homes. I hunted them down like the animals they were, just to see them burn.;NGLOBEHXOR15110_.mp3
But the treacherous beasts fought back and left me with injuries that meant I could never fight again... or so they thought!;NGLOBEHXOR15112_.mp3
Stop trying to provoke her!;
No, I will not give in to him.;NGLOBEHXOR15114_.mp3
I ended up in the Lower City of Taris, and what did I find? A few of those stinking beasts living there!;NGLOBEHXOR15116_.mp3
The male was easy enough to best, but the females proved elusive. I didn't know what happened to them after I killed the male, until I saw this cursed woman on the auction block.;NGLOBEHXOR15118_.mp3
But then the Jedi came and ruined everything before I could have my revenge... *cough*;NGLOBEHXOR15120_.mp3
You... You killed my father, you killed my people, you treat us like animals... You deserve to die!;NGLOBEHXOR15122_.mp3
Do not give in Juhani. You are stronger than this.;
Give in and embrace your hate! You're no better than me! You're nothing!;NGLOBEHXOR15124_.mp3
I... I...;NGLOBEHXOR15126_.mp3
Do not do it, Juhani.;
I... Help me, please! Do not let me give in to my anger again!;NGLOBEHXOR15128_.mp3
Just step away.;
Haha! Your kind always were weak-minded!;NGLOBEHXOR15130_.mp3
No, I will not do this. He may die, but it will not be out of my vengeance.;NGLOBEHXOR15135_.mp3
You coward! You weak... ahhh... gurk! *death rattle*;NGLOBEHXOR15137_.mp3
Kill him now.;
You... You will die for what you have done!;NGLOBEHXOR15140_.mp3
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.;
Quit your whining!;
This isn't going to work.;
We should just kill you now.;
Hahah- *cough* *cough* But you won't! You're the cowardly type, all of you. You don't have the guts to finish me now!;NGLOBEHXOR15146_.mp3
Just ignore him.;
You could kill him now.;
No! I cannot give in to my anger. I will not give him the satisfaction of making me that way.;NGLOBEHXOR15106_.mp3
He doesn't have long, Juhani.;
He may not, but I will make him pay with what little time he has left! I will make him tell me what he has done to my people!;NGLOBEHXOR15149_.mp3
Don't listen to him.;
There she is! Get her, men, but remember: don't kill her!;NGLOBEHXOR15152_.mp3

It's a dark Jedi! This fight is too much for us - we better stay back. All we'd do is get in the way.;NM01AA_CUT04001_.mp3
That was one of the Jedi accompanying Bastila. Damn, we could have used her help!;NM01AA_CUT04000_.mp3
Oh... uh... hello, officer. Making another patrol, are you? Well, I won't get in your way.;
Before the Sith arrived there was talk of changing Taris' alien restriction laws. But I guess that probably won't happen now.;
I know some Twi'leks who've been given special permission to live in the Upper City. They don't have to hide out in a dump like this.;
I hate this world. They treat us aliens like scum. As soon as the Sith quarantine is over, I'm leaving for good!;

They say Taris is the Coruscant of the Outer Rim. But this world is nothing but crumbling buildings and urban waste!;
Now that power has been transferred to the right-hand pillar, there is no point in altering the controls further.;
There are three pillars that have electronic read-outs showing the energy levels of four systems. The controls show that these systems can be transferred to other pillars.;
Caution! Some of the systems are very delicate and improper transfer of power can cause an electrical overload!;
In order to unseal the chamber, all of the following four systems must be transferred to the right pillar:;
:: TOP SYSTEM :: May be transferred to any pillar safely without fear of overload.;
:: MID-UPPER SYSTEM :: This system causes an overload if transferred to a pillar with an active Top System.;
:: MID-LOWER SYSTEM :: This system may only be safely transferred to another pillar that either has no systems or only the Base System active.;
:: BASE SYSTEM :: This large system may only be transferred to a blank pillar with no systems active in it, or it will cause an overload.;
Remember: A system may be transferred to another pillar if it is the ONLY active system on that pillar or it is the LAST one listed.;
All power has been successfully transferred to the right-hand pillar. The room has been unsealed.;
The current system displays on the pillars read:;
Active systems - left pillar: <CUSTOM10> Active systems - middle pillar: <CUSTOM11> Active systems - right pillar: <CUSTOM12>;
Move a system from the left pillar.;
To which pillar do you wish to transfer power for the Base System?;
The middle pillar.;

Darth Malak!;NM40ACDART03002_.mp3
I hope you weren't thinking of leaving so soon, Bastila. I've spent far too much energy hunting down you and your companions to let you get away from me now.;NM40ACDART03004_.mp3
Besides, I had to see for myself if it was true. Even now I can hardly believe my eyes... tell me, why did the Jedi spare you? Is it vengeance you seek at this reunion?;NM40ACDART03006_.mp3
Reunion? What are you talking about?;
What? Ha-ha-ha! You mean you don't know? Ha-ha-ha! All this time, and you still haven't figured it out? Ha-ha-ha!;NM40ACDART03008_.mp3
I wonder how long you would have stayed blind to the truth? Surely some of what you once were must have surfaced by now.;NM40ACDART03010_.mp3
Even the combined power of the Jedi Council couldn't keep your true identity buried forever, could it?;NM40ACDART03012_.mp3
Why did the Jedi spare me? I don't understand...;
This meeting was inevitable, Malak!;
As is the outcome. I am actually surprised this confrontation did not happen sooner, given how powerful your mind once was.;NM40ACDART03016_.mp3
You cannot hide from what you once were, Revan! Recognize that you were once the Dark Lord - and know that I have taken your place!;NM40ACDART03018_.mp3
No... this is some type of trick! A Sith lie!;
You do not yet remember, Revan? The Jedi set a trap. They lured us into battle against a small Republic fleet. During the attack a team of Jedi knights boarded your ship.;NM40ACDART03020_.mp3
"The Jedi strike team captured you and the Council used the Force to reprogram your mind; they wiped away your identity and turned you against your own followers.";NM40ACDART03022_.mp3
No, I don't believe you, Malak!;
"You must have seen flashes of your old life in your dreams, Revan; memories bubbling up to the surface? Surely you must remember the battle in which you were captured?";NM40ACDART03024_.mp3
"How you survived the final battle is a mystery to me. Perhaps you should ask Bastila; after all, she was part of the Jedi strike team that captured you!";NM40ACDART03026_.mp3
Bastila, is this true?;
It's true. I was part of the team sent to capture Revan... to capture you. When Malak fired on the ship you were badly injured. We thought you were dead.;NM40ACDART03028_.mp3
Your mind was destroyed, but I used the Force to preserve the flicker of life in your body. I brought you to the Jedi Council. They were the ones who healed your damaged mind.;NM40ACDART03030_.mp3
Then why don't I remember being Revan?;
The Jedi Council didn't restore your wounded mind, Revan! They merely programmed it with a new identity - one loyal to the Republic! They tried to make you their slave!;NM40ACDART03032_.mp3
You've been lying to me this whole time, Bastila!;
I wanted to tell you, but the Council forbid it! They were afraid you might return to the dark side if you discovered your real identity!;NM40ACDART03034_.mp3
But now you know the truth, Revan! The Council has failed in their attempt to make you their pawn! The will of a Sith Lord is not so easily manipulated!;NM40ACDART03036_.mp3
Why not just let me die?;
The Jedi hold all life sacred, even that of a Sith Lord. I could not just let you die, Revan. Not if it was possible to save you.;NM40ACDART03043_.mp3
"Bastila hides the truth behind noble words, Revan! The Jedi needed the memories buried deep in your wounded mind; there was no other way to bring them out. They had to keep you alive!";NM40ACDART03045_.mp3
But why program me with another identity?;
"We couldn't simply restore your true identity; Revan was too dangerous. But locked inside your mind was information the Republic needed: the secrets of the Star Forge.";NM40ACDART03047_.mp3
"The Council created an identity for you: a soldier under my command. Your subconscious memories were supposed to lead me to the Star Forge; there was no other way to get the information.";NM40ACDART03049_.mp3
They made you their puppet, Revan - and Bastila was the handler pulling your strings!;NM40ACDART03051_.mp3
Why you, Bastila? Why did the Council choose you?;
When I used my Force powers to keep you alive on that bridge it created our bond. I convinced the Council that I could use that bond to draw out your memories and lead us to the Star Forge.;NM40ACDART03053_.mp3
Tell the truth, Bastila, you wanted to taste the dark side for yourself! You knew the only way the Council would permit you to explore the Sith's power was through Revan's lost memories!;NM40ACDART03055_.mp3
"NO! I wanted to help you, Revan. I thought this mission would redeem you; that it would atone for your past crimes. How else could you be saved?";NM40ACDART03057_.mp3
But what if I remembered who I really was?;
You had to be healed so I could try and draw out the secrets of the Star Forge - it was our only hope of stopping the Sith! It was a risk the Council chose to take.;NM40ACDART03059_.mp3
I understand, Bastila. You had no other choice.;
"Forgiveness, Revan? You are weak; I was right to betray you. You are not fit to rule the Sith!";NM40ACDART03069_.mp3
A small part of me has always regretted betraying you from afar. I always knew there were some who would think I acted out of fear, that I did not want to face you.;NM40ACDART03071_.mp3
"But now fate has given me a second chance to prove myself. Once I defeat you in combat no one will question my claim to the Sith throne; my triumph will be complete!";NM40ACDART03073_.mp3
Your power is no match for the light!;
The Jedi Council were foolish to let you live. I won't make the same mistake. We shall finish this alone in the ancient Sith tradition: master versus apprentice, as it was meant to be!;NM40ACDART03076_.mp3
Triumph, Malak? You seem to forget that I'm still alive!;
You used me, Bastila! You're no better than the Sith!;
How can you say that? Malak nearly killed you, but the Jedi Council gave you another chance to live! They gave you a chance to redeem yourself by defeating the Sith!;NM40ACDART03038_.mp3
A rash and futile hope. The dark side is too strong, my power is too great! Even my old master is no longer a match for me!;NM40ACDART03040_.mp3
But the memories I have... where did they come from?;
Yes - I've seen Bastila in my visions! She was there!;
How did they capture someone as powerful as Revan... I mean, me?;
I helped them, Revan. I always knew that one day the title of Dark Lord would be mine! When the Jedi strike team boarded your vessel I saw my day had come.;NM40ACDART03081_.mp3
I ordered my own ships to fire on your bridge. I thought I could destroy all my enemies with a single glorious victory! I never dreamed the Jedi would take you alive from the wreckage.;NM40ACDART03086_.mp3
But why did you betray... your master?;
You mean why did I betray you, Revan. You are the one who taught me the ways of the Sith: the strongest must rule if we are to survive!;NM40ACDART03088_.mp3
You knew I would one day challenge you for supremacy, but you underestimated me. I acted sooner than you expected and seized the Sith throne with a single brilliant stroke!;NM40ACDART03090_.mp3
Why wouldn't the Jedi simply kill me?;
"The Jedi are fools; they do not believe in executing prisoners. Originally I assumed you had died in the battle. Imagine my surprise when I found out you were still alive, Revan.";NM40ACDART03093_.mp3
Do you mean I'm really... your Master?;
Once I served you, Revan, but I always knew that one day the title of Dark Lord would be mine! When the Jedi strike team boarded your vessel I saw my day had come.;NM40ACDART03084_.mp3
I'm... Darth Revan? How is that possible?;

You have returned! I was beginning to fear that you, too, might have been lost. Did you find out what had happened down there at the facility?;NM26ACREPD08000_.mp3
The Selkath went insane.;
Insane? What did they do? And why?;NM26ACREPD08002_.mp3
They killed almost everyone on the Station.;
They killed... everyone? And the mercenaries we sent later? That is... horrible. What caused them to all go insane at once like that?;NM26ACREPD08004_.mp3
Your construction woke something up.;
Something was down there? Living in the Rift by the kolto?;NM26ACREPD08006_.mp3
A gigantic firaxan shark that drove all the Selkath insane.;
That's... horrible. The entire operation wasted by a disaster we could never in a thousand years have foreseen.;NM26ACREPD08008_.mp3
What has happened to the facility itself? Were there any survivors?;NM26ACREPD08010_.mp3
A few scientists have survived.;
Well, that is good to know. Good to know indeed. But... What has happened to the facility? Was it damaged?;NM26ACREPD08012_.mp3
The harvesting machine was destroyed.;
No! That is terrible. That will set our work back years... *sigh* It may even cost us the war.;NM26ACREPD08014_.mp3
While I am glad that you were able to solve our problems, the cost may have ended up being much too high.;NM26ACREPD08016_.mp3
But you have done your job and helped us in our time of need, and for that I thank you.;NM26ACREPD08018_.mp3
Oh, and did you end up finding your Star Map?;NM26ACREPD08020_.mp3
Yes I did.;
As you can see, by helping us you helped yourself. Perhaps we can work together again in the future.;NM26ACREPD08022_.mp3
None of your business!;
I'll assume that means yes. As you can see, by helping us you helped yourself. Perhaps we can work together in the future.;NM26ACREPD08025_.mp3
The kolto seems to have been contaminated.;
Contaminated? That's... That's much worse than I would ever have thought possible. It might have been better to lose the entire facility rather than damage the kolto supply.;NM26ACREPD08028_.mp3
This must remain entirely secret. We cannot allow anyone to find out that we damaged the kolto production or we would be banned permanently from the planet.;NM26ACREPD08030_.mp3

You think I got lucky last time? Okay, let's do it again!;
You traveled a long way just to die, Calo!;
[With the benefit of a map you make your way to the Eastern Dune Sea. Ahead is a relatively sheltered area that shows signs of recent activity.];
You have defeated the murderous animals! We thank you, human, for saving us!;
Er... No problem!;
If your arrival had not been so fortuitously timed, we would have been in great danger. We thank you again for saving us.;
What are you doing here?;
We had crashed here when our mining survey vessel encountered some strange sort of energy field. It disrupted our engine and power system and forced us to make a crash landing on this world.;
Our ship sank far out to sea, but a handful of us were able to make it to this island... more than you see here, though.;
Where are the rest of your companions?;
Many have been killed at the hands of the locals. A few tried to swim to one of the closer islands, but we have not heard from them in many days.;
Of the 10 of us who remained here, we two are the only remaining survivors...;
The native creatures killed the others?;
They attack any they come across. They are barbaric savages who feast upon the bodies of the dead!;
The only beings who crash here that can hold them off are the Mandalorians, and we dare not go near them... we know of their depredations too well.;
There are Mandalorians here??;
Yes, there are. More than you might think, although that may just be because they aren't killed as easily as we are.;
With their weapons they raid and kill other survivors, and can fight off the natives as well. They seem to have some sort of invisibility or light cloaking shield that hides them until they strike.;
Where are they?;
They are north of here by a large temple structure. We dare not approach it, for they would surely kill us.;
But we cannot delay here much longer... The longer we stay, the more likely either the Mandalorians or the natives will find us and kill us.;
Why don't you try to get to one of the other islands?;
I believe that would be the best choice... The others have not returned, but it may be because they could find no way to.;
It would be worth the risk, rather than stay here and face certain death...;
I thank you one last time, human, for saving us. We shall remember you, and hope that, should you escape, you will tell the Republic of those of us stranded here.;
You could stay in our ship if you want.;
No, we dare not. If we remain here, it will only be a matter of time before the natives or the Mandalorians find us and kill us.;
Tell me of the natives.;
We know little beyond what we have told you already... savages who eat the dead and attack anyone on sight. If it were not for them, this world might almost be habitable...;
Has anyone found a way off this world?;
The Sith... we have seen Sith interceptors in the sky once or twice... They appear to be able to fly unimpeded through the field which forced us to crash. If we could somehow find a ship of theirs...;
But it is too much to hope for. The Sith would surely kill us on sight if we were found. Much better to hide and hope the Republic finds us here eventually.;
We believe they may have something to do with the large temple structure to the north of here. We have been suspicious of that structure since we landed, but we cannot approach it... the Mandalorians hunt in that area.;
What happened?;
It's not like me to crush insects like you, but I'm bored, so...;
What?! You... No!;
Why would they have attacked you?;
How do you know I'm friendly to you?;
Why... why would you not be? All we survivors on this strange world must band together, else the marauding inhabitants would slaughter us all!;
Actually, I'm not here to save you.;
You... you are not? Then what are you here for?;
I have to find a way off this world.;
As do we all.;
We have seen little in the short time we have been on this world that would indicate a way off... except...;
Except?;
Spill it!;
It's not like I had a choice...;
None of us are here by choice... and all seek a way to escape.;
I'm here to finish the job they started!;
Well, they attacked me first...;
If I had known you were there, I would have waited a couple minutes...;
If you had... had waited for a better opportunity, yes! But then we would have been in danger... but I can see your point!;
You are smart as well as valorous. We thank you again for saving us.;
You will find my prices have increased dramatically, human. Kolto production is faltering, and the Manaan government has raised all taxes on goods sold to foreigners.;
I'd like to see what's in stock.;
I am certain you will see that all of my inventory is of superior quality.;
I want to ask you a few questions.;
I am far too busy to spend my time conversing, human. I must reserve my time for paying customers, not idle gossip.;
I think I'll be going now.;
Until next time, human.;
Greetings, human. In these troubled times with difficulties between the Republic and our government here, know that you can always find the goods you need with me.;
Greetings, human. While the Sith have suffered setbacks here on Manaan and their goods are in short supply, you can rest assured that I will always have what you need.;
Greetings human. You have done the Selkath a great service by uncovering the Sith plot to corrupt our youth.;
To show the appreciation of my people, you shall find all my wares have been marked down with a substantial discount.;
Greetings, human. Your reputation for Pazaak preceeds you. If you wish, feel free to play within this establishment.;
Others who share your interest in the game often come here to play - and to partake of my fine wares.;
Greetings, human. There are few places in Ahto City where off-worlders are welcome, but here they are at least tolerated.;
RRRRAAAAARRRGGGG!;
Okay you alien scum, everybody get up against the wall! This is a raid!;NM02AAPRER99000_.mp3
There was a patrol here just yesterday, and they found nothing! Why do you Sith keep bothering us?;
That's how we Sith deal with smart-mouth aliens! Now the rest of you get up against the wall before I lose my temper again!;NM02AAPRER99002_.mp3
Hey, what's this? Humans hiding out with aliens?;NM02AAPRER99008_.mp3
They're Republic fugitives! Attack!;NM02AAPRER99009_.mp3
So we have found it. Father's holocron. I suppose I should be thankful the desert sands had not swallowed it up.;NM18ABBAST14000_.mp3
Are you going to give it to your mother?;
I don't know. I'll...I'll have to think about that. I'll keep it on me while I decide.;NM18ABBAST14002_.mp3
You there! Human! You are placed under the arrest of the Ahto City Civil Authority!;
What? Why?;
Though the Sith Embassy here is considered sovereign territory of the Sith Empire, we have been monitoring an alarming number of weapon discharges and detonations from within the base.;
Inquiries to the staff of the Embassy yielded no response. It would seem that contact had been cut.;
Our cameras recorded you entering the base shortly before contact was lost and fighting apparently began.;
It is the conclusion of the Ahto City Civil Authority that you are responsible for the disturbance here, and you are hereby placed under arrest. You will come with us to await your trial.;
As material witnesses, the individuals who accompany you will be detained at your vessel, and the vessel itself prohibited from leaving Manaan.;
We will leave. Now. Do not attempt to resist, or we shall resort to overwhelming force.;
Our external monitors recorded you entering the base shortly before contact was lost and fighting aparently began.;
I have done nothing wrong.;
You'll never take me alive!;
Do not be foolish, human! We have the entire armed forces of Manaan at our disposal. You WILL submit to our authority!;
[This cave exit leads to the inhospitable surface of the planet. There is nothing for you to see there.];
The Star Forge... it's huge. I've never seen anything like it before.;NM41AASTAR03000_.mp3
I can feel the power of the dark side emanating from that space station. It almost feels like... like it's alive. That must be where Malak has taken Bastila.;NM41AASTAR03001_.mp3
I'm transmitting these co-ordinates to Admiral Dodonna. Maybe a quick strike by the Republic can cripple the Sith fleet.;NM41AASTAR03002_.mp3
Message is away. We should probably wait for the Republic fleet to show up before we try and rescue Bastila. We'll need cover if we want to fly in and dock on the Star Forge.;NM41AASTAR03003_.mp3
We've got company... a small vanguard of Sith fighters, coming in hard! Get on those gun turrets! Take those fighters out before they report our position to the main fleet!;NM41AASTAR03004_.mp3
What was that? What's wrong? Did one of the Sith fighters hit us?;NM41AASTAR03005_.mp3

It smells like death here. Not good, honest battlefield death, but a musty, wasting death. Figures we'd find one of these Star Maps in a place like this.;NM39AASTAR99000_.mp3
The Sith have long worshipped the ancient secrets of the dark side. It is not surprising to find the Star Map in a place like this.;NM39AASTAR99006_.mp3
Look, we've got what we came for. Can we go now? This place gives me the creeps.;NM39AASTAR99003_.mp3
So, now that we've got the Star Map what say we get out of here. The dampness in these tombs is hard on my old bones.;NM39AASTAR99009_.mp3
I guess we can get out of here now. I won't be missing this place, that's for sure.;NM39AASTAR99005_.mp3
Comment: Now that we have the Star Map, I see little reason for us to remain in this tomb, Master.;NM39AASTAR99011_.mp3
We've got what we came for, so let's get out of here. The sooner we leave the stink of this place behind the better.;NM39AASTAR99001_.mp3
We've found the Star Map, now let's get out of here. This place reeks of death and evil.;
I can feel the power of the dark side here. It is... unnerving. Now that we have the Star Map we should leave this place of evil.;NM39AASTAR99007_.mp3
The Sith are big on the ancient power of the dark side. It only makes sense we'd find one of those Star Maps in a place like this.;NM39AASTAR99008_.mp3
Wow - I never figured to see a Star Map in one of these moldy old tombs.;NM39AASTAR99002_.mp3

Dantooine... it seems like a lifetime since I last set foot on her surface, though in truth it has only been a few months. We should be safe from Malak here... for now, at least.;NM12AABAST01000_.mp3
Safe? You saw what his fleet did to Taris: there wasn't a building over two stories high left standing! They...they turned the planet into one big pile of rubble.;NM12AABAST01001_.mp3
Even the Sith would think twice before attacking Dantooine. There are many Jedi here, including several of the most powerful Masters of the Order. There is great strength within this place.;NM12AABAST01002_.mp3
I agree with Bastila. We should be safe here.;
"We can get supplies here and recuperate. The Academy is a place of mental and spiritual healing; something we could all use after what we've been through.";NM12AABAST01004_.mp3

"We can't just keep running; Malak will find us eventually. We need to regroup; we need a plan.";NM12AABAST01009_.mp3
The Force has given us a... a vision. Like the one we shared on Dantooine. Did you see it? Of course... you must have. The Force is strong with us both.;NM12AABAST01010_.mp3
There are some who believe Korriban is the birth place of the Sith... this planet is an evil place. There are secrets here best left uncovered.;NM12AABAST01011_.mp3

"During the vision I felt cold and trapped; almost as if I was buried alive. It felt... it felt like we were in some kind of tomb.";NM12AABAST01013_.mp3
No doubt things will become more clear once we discover the Star Map's location.;NM12AABAST01014_.mp3
Won't the Sith recognize you?;
Hmmm... maybe you're right. Most of the dark Jedi would only know me by name, but there are a few among them who might recognize my face.;NM12AABAST01059_.mp3
For the safety of our mission I must remain on the Ebon Hawk while we are on this planet.;NM12AABAST01060_.mp3
It would be safer if you stayed hidden on the ship.;
We have to uncover those secrets if we want to stop Malak.;
You are right, of course. We cannot turn away from the path we have started on... no matter where it may lead.;NM12AABAST01016_.mp3
I don't have time for your visions, Bastila!;
The visions are as much yours as mine - and they are the key to finding the Star Forge and stopping Malak!;NM12AABAST01018_.mp3
"The Wookiees of Kashyyyk make their home high among the wroshyr branches; only their bravest warriors dare to descend into the forbidding depths of the forest.";NM12AABAST01021_.mp3
If the Star Map is located far beneath us on the planet's surface, as our vision seems to suggest, it is unlikely the Wookiees even know of its existence.;NM12AABAST01022_.mp3
The Star Map would likely have to be within some kind of shelter to protect it against dust and sandstorms.;NM12AABAST01026_.mp3
I suspect there are many such caves and caverns hidden in the sands of the Dune Sea. The creatures of this world probably use them as their lairs.;NM12AABAST01027_.mp3
The ocean floor is vast and much of it is uncharted, even by the native Selkath. But how could Revan and Malak have found their way down?;NM12AABAST01032_.mp3
Kashyyyk is a lush but simple and undeveloped world. I would not have expected to find the alien technology of a Star Map here.;NM12AABAST01019_.mp3

Do you think the Wookiees are involved?;
Tatooine is known for little but blowing sand. I find it surprising that there would be a Star Map somewhere in its desolate wastes.;NM12AABAST01024_.mp3
It looked like it was inside some kind of cave.;
Maybe Tatooine wasn't always a desert.;
Perhaps, though that would have been tens of thousands of years in the past. Now there is nothing but the howling emptiness of the Dune Sea.;NM12AABAST01029_.mp3
"It is strange that anyone would have built a Star Map here; the entire surface of Manaan is covered by nothing but vast oceans.";NM12AABAST01030_.mp3
It looked like the Star Map was underwater.;
Maybe the land was once above the surface.;
It is possible. The melting of polar caps or a cataclysmic earthquake could have buried the land beneath the waves eons ago. Records from that time are incomplete.;NM12AABAST01034_.mp3
Another vision. The Force is guiding us, helping us retrace the steps of Malak and his old Master. Leading us ever closer to the Star Forge.;NM12AABAST01035_.mp3
"You felt it, yes? Another vision? The Force continues to work through us; showing us the Star Maps unearthed by Revan and Malak.";NM12AABAST01036_.mp3
Can you sense it? The wind... the sound... the smells? I feel it all now that we are away from the spaceport.;
This walkway is new, probably built by the slavers, but I remember the trees. My village is not far from here.;
What can I expect to encounter?;
I'm sorry, I don't know. It has been so long since I left. I only know the way things were, and many things may have changed.;
I must warn you of one thing... I don't know if I will be a help or hindrance to you here. My father was very powerful... a chieftain.;
Perhaps his feelings have mellowed, but if my brother had his ear all this time... I may be very unwelcome.;
We'll deal with that when the time comes.;
That is what I am dreading. My shame was meant to be forgotten on some far away world. I never thought I'd come back.;
I'm sorry, I've taken enough of your time. We should press on.;
I don't have time for your family squabbles.;
I'm not asking you to deal with anything. I just wanted you to know about potential problems.;
Bah, do what you want with this information. I won't say any more about it.;
Is there anything I can help you with?;
It is kind of you to offer, but my problems are very personal. I'm not sure if I am ready to deal with them.;
We're here for the Star Map. Nothing else, understand?;
Yes, your outsider concerns must always come first. Just remember that this was my home. You are the stranger here.;
I never thought I'd see the big trees. Zaalbar's stories didn't do it justice. This is incredible.;NM22ABZAAL01023_.mp3
I wish he was here to see this. He'd want to see this, you know?;NM22ABZAAL01025_.mp3
This planet is incredible! It's too bad Zaalbar isn't with us. It would be nice to have a guide who's familiar with this place.;NM22ABZAAL01026_.mp3
"This place is wild and untamed. It stirs the blood and makes one feel alive. It is a shame the Wookiee is not here with us; I have no doubt he would feel the same way.";NM22ABZAAL01027_.mp3
This place is so wonderful, yet so strange. Maybe we should have Zaalbar with us. A guide with local knowledge could be invaluable.;NM22ABZAAL01028_.mp3
If you are not a student here, then your questions should be addressed to the Jedi Council.;
I am afraid that I am too busy to answer you questions.;
You have done well in bringing Juhani back into the light. I am sure that once she gets past her remorse, she will be a model Jedi.;
It was most regrettable that you could not save Juhani. She was an endearing, if rash, pupil.;
Do not let the lessons she has given us all elude you.;
Yes, apprentice? What is it you require?;
I wish to know about the Jedi Code.;
There is much to learn of the Jedi Code, and much subtlety in what is there.;
You would do well to learn from the example of my student, Garrum: There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.;
Know this, and you can never fail.;
For the rest of the Code, I suggest you ask some of the other Jedi here. Know your peers as well.;
Is there anything else you require?;
Do you know anything about the corrupted grove?;
The dark side holds great sway over people, places and things. It is not always obvious from where this dark power comes.;
If the Council has told you to investigate, perhaps you should do just that.;
What can you tell me about the Mandalorian raiders?;
The Mandalorians have been scattered across the Outer Rim since their defeat by the Republic years ago. They have managed to survive by raiding for food and credits.;
I have not heard much about any activities of theirs on Dantooine. I spend much of my time in seclusion meditating. Perhaps another may help you.;
Who are you?;
I am Master Tar'eelok. I train here with, and under, Master Zhar Lestin.;
A Jedi's training is never over, even when one has a padawan of their own.;
Knowledge will be the key to our eventual victory over the Sith. Knowledge of our weaknesses and theirs.;
Knowing yourself is the key to any great battle.;
What do you know of the Council?;
They are great and powerful Jedi, all. Do not be intimidated by them, however. If there is something you wish to know from them, merely ask.;
What is this Cortosis ore you mentioned?;
The Cortosis mineral is a rare and unique substance that has the property of being able to deflect the beam of a lightsaber.;
Although the process for forging it into blades was developed by the Echani for their dueling culture, it has since spread across the galaxy.;
The Sith have taken to providing blades of this type to their mercenaries and pawns, so that they would prove more effective against us.;
It does raise the possibility of those same mercenaries being effective against their Sith masters in turn, but given the overpowering military might of the Sith at the moment, it is unlikely.;
I must go now.;
As you will.;
I hope that the Force guides you well on your quest, Padawan.;
Yes, Padawan? What is it you require?;
Beks are nothing but bantha fodder! The Vulkars are strongest!;
We'll teach you who's strongest!;
Sith aren't welcome here!;
More strangers!;
What is this? What's going on here?;

Greeting, young human. You are welcome in my humble abode, as are all others who deign to visit this poor, outcast Hutt.;
Who are you?;
I am known as Shuma. I am one of the many who have been made poor and disadvantaged by this cruel, cruel war.;
What are you doing here?;
Alas, even a poor Hutt businessman is not exempt from the fires of the conflict that now rage between the Sith and the Republic.;
The world my business was based on, Neka, was subject to a most unexpected and unfortunate attack by the Sith armada.;
The space lanes were clear one day, then the next they were filled with Sith interceptors and closed to traffic.;
I had under my employ - quite unwittingly, of course - certain transport pilots who knew ways to slip me past the blockade above that world.;
That is the only means by which I managed to escape Neka before the Sith commander deemed it worthless and virus-bombed all intelligent life from it...;
It gives one a new appreciation of the value of the... sometimes troubling Jedi Order.;
Is there anything else you wish?;
You're a Hutt!;
Hahaha! You are most perceptive, I see! Not many people can tell that at first glance.;
But I know that is not what you meant. I labor under the misconceptions and biases against my species.;
We have the unfortunate reputation, you see, of being criminals and murderers and worse...;
But I am merely a businessman who has been cast out from his home in this most cruel war. Your Council has seen fit to grant me asylum here away from the dangers in this sector.;
But enough about my troubles. What more would you have of me?;
I must be going now.;
Good luck to you then, in all your endeavors. Should you come back to me, I would be grateful for any conversation.;
Welcome back, young Jedi. You are kind to spend time with a poor, old Hutt.;
Welcome back, young apprentice. You are kind to spend time with a poor, old Hutt.;

Oh... uh... hello, officer. Making another patrol, are you? Well, I won't get in your way.;
Don't hurt me! Just... just take what you want. I won't try to stop you.;
Before the Sith arrived there was talk of changing Taris' alien restriction laws. But I guess that probably won't happen now.;
I know some Twi'leks who've been given special permission to live in the Upper City. They don't have to hide out in a dump like this.;
I hate this world. They treat us aliens like scum. As soon as the Sith quarantine is over, I'm leaving for good!;
Anchorhead;
No, this is not possible! You have rejected the dark side, you are a weak and pathetic servant of the light! How can you still stand against me? Why can't I defeat you?;NM45AABAST01041_.mp3
Now you see the dark side is not stronger than the light.;
Yes, I see you speak the truth. I am no match for you. Please, for the sake of what we once shared, do not make me suffer. End my life quickly. There is no other way.;NM45AABAST01044_.mp3
I could never kill you, Bastila.;
What other choice do you have? I have fallen to the dark side, I am the apprentice to the Dark Lord himself. You cannot let me live.;NM45AABAST01047_.mp3
You can reject the dark side, Bastila. Return to the light.;
No... I'm not strong enough. There is too much anger inside me now. Too much hatred and fear. I can no longer find peace in the Force.;NM45AABAST01049_.mp3
[Persuade] Use our bond, then. Take your strength from me.;
[Success] You... always had more strength than I did. I told you that. I felt so... helpless before your destiny.;NM45AABAST01051_.mp3
You were Revan and I couldn't tell you... it was agonizing! Even worse when I began to... feel closer to you. I despised myself for it.;NM45AABAST01052_.mp3
And even now I... feel your strength. It... does help me. Thank you, I think I can face the end, now. If you are the one to end it for me.;NM45AABAST01053_.mp3
[Persuade] I love you, Bastila. I can't abandon you, ever.;
[Success] You... love me? Heh. I... there was a time I yearned for and yet dreaded to hear those words. I loved you, too, but I could never... face who you were.;NM45AABAST01108_.mp3
Malak knew how I felt. Any part of the light that was within me would be extinguished when I killed you.;NM45AABAST01109_.mp3
But what good is love? It cannot save me from the sea of blackness I am drowning in. I have betrayed everything I ever believed in! How can I atone for that?;NM45AABAST01110_.mp3
Help us defeat the Sith, Bastila. This will atone for what you have done.;
Yes, I... could join you in your battle against the Dark Lord. That alone would not make up for all I have done, yet... it would be a step in the right direction.;NM45AABAST01065_.mp3
But how would you be able to trust me? How do you know I wouldn't turn on you when you faced Darth Malak? How do you know the dark side wouldn't make me betray you again?;NM45AABAST01066_.mp3
I trust you enough to leave myself open to your attack, Bastila.;
You play a dangerous game. Are you certain you wish to take this risk? I could end your life and gain Malak's favor with a single stroke of my lightsaber.;NM45AABAST01068_.mp3
You won't, Bastila. Because I love you and I believe in you.;
You are brave... and some would say foolish. But you are also right. The dark side has not wholly consumed me. I cannot raise my blade against you.;NM45AABAST01071_.mp3
You will go on to defeat Malak, of this I have little doubt. You will have gone from being the Sith Lord, himself, to the savior of our galaxy.;NM45AABAST01072_.mp3
And... and you said you loved me. This may not be the best time to say it, but...;NM45AABAST01073_.mp3
I love you, too. With all my heart.;NM45AABAST01074_.mp3
You aren't afraid to love anymore?;
After this? No, nothing could make me feel safer than to be loved by you.;NM45AABAST01076_.mp3
You should go. Malak awaits. This isn't over, yet... for any of us.;NM45AABAST01083_.mp3
I should stay here, though. If we face Malak I am afraid his dark presence will overwhelm me. It would not be wise to expose myself to such temptation.;NM45AABAST01084_.mp3
Bastila, I want you at my side when I face the Dark Lord.;
I'm sorry, but the risk is too great. I am not wholly free of the dark side's shadow. Not yet. But you are more than a match for the Dark Lord. I understand that now.;NM45AABAST01086_.mp3
I will stay here in this chamber and use my Battle Meditation to aid the Republic fleet. I am their only hope of destroying the Star Forge and ending the Sith menace.;NM45AABAST01114_.mp3
You must go and face Malak, but you have to hurry. Once I turn the battle in the Republic's favor we won't have much time to escape the Star Forge before it is destroyed.;NM45AABAST01115_.mp3
Good luck, my love... and may the Force be with you.;NM45AABAST01116_.mp3
Good luck... and may the Force be with you.;NM45AABAST01117_.mp3
You could use your Battle Meditation to aid the Republic fleet.;
Yes, that would be for the best. You don't need me to defeat Malak, anyway. Now I understand that a true Jedi is a match for any Sith. Even the Dark Lord himself.;NM45AABAST01088_.mp3
I... I must know something, first, before that happens. I must ask you something.;NM45AABAST01077_.mp3
Will there be a place for me in your future? Do you... do you love me?;NM45AABAST01078_.mp3
I do love you, Bastila.;
I love you, Bastila, but after everything that's happened...;
I see. Thank you for your honesty. It's probably for the best that it goes no further. You saved me and I will always be grateful.;NM45AABAST01082_.mp3
No. I'm sorry, Bastila, but I don't love you.;
You are brave... and foolish. The dark side has wholly consumed me, and you will suffer for failing to see that!;NM45AABAST01089_.mp3
You won't, Bastila. I know you still serve the light side.;
You're right. I suppose I can't trust you, after all.;
A wise decision. You cannot trust me, and you cannot bring yourself to execute me. I see now there is only one way this can end. The time for words is done! Defend yourself!;NM45AABAST01091_.mp3
You're right. Don't worry, you won't feel a thing.;
Do it. Quickly...;NM45AABAST01112_.mp3
[Failure] There is nothing in my heart but the blackness of the dark side! I am sick of your preaching, Revan!;NM45AABAST01063_.mp3
I ask you for an honorable death, but you are too weak to even grant me that! No more words! This must end with blood!;NM45AABAST01093_.mp3
[Persuade] Look into your heart, Bastila, and you will find the light.;
[Success] I... I know a flicker of the light still burns within me. Malak felt it too. He knew it could only be extinguished if I killed you.;NM45AABAST01061_.mp3
But what good is a single flicker of light against the sea of darkness I am drowning in? I can never atone for my betrayal.;NM45AABAST01062_.mp3
I was redeemed, Bastila. You can be, too.;
You were a special case. The Council had no other choice. They needed you alive so they could discover the location of the Star Forge. It was an act of desperation.;NM45AABAST01097_.mp3
It was my responsibility to watch over you, to make sure you did not slip back into your evil ways. I was supposed to protect you from the dark side.;NM45AABAST01098_.mp3
You did protect me, Bastila.;
But at what cost? In protecting you, I fell to the dark side myself. Is that the price of a Jedi's redemption? Must another of the Order fall to save me?;NM45AABAST01100_.mp3
I cannot allow that to happen. Please, this is too painful. Strike me down. End this now, quickly. There is no other way.;NM45AABAST01101_.mp3
You can't protect someone from the dark side. Each individual must choose their own path.;
I... I suppose you are right. Yet the path I have chosen is that of the dark side. I don't see any way I could atone for what I have done. I deserve to die.;NM45AABAST01103_.mp3
You did more than protect me, Bastila.;
It's true I possess... feelings for you. But was it only an illusion brought about by our bond? And what was the cost?;NM45AABAST01105_.mp3
Please... this is too painful. End it now, quickly. There is no other way.;NM45AABAST01106_.mp3
I was the Dark Lord, Bastila, and the Jedi Council let me live.;
[Failure!] No! That bond is what took me down this path to begin with! It poisoned me... I hated myself for loving you and now I have betrayed everything!;NM45AABAST01054_.mp3
[Persuade] Turn to the Jedi code, Bastila. It can help you.;
[Success] I doubt mere words can help me now, but to appease you I will recite them:;NM45AABAST01056_.mp3
There is no emotion: there is peace. There is no ignorance: there is knowledge. There is no passion: there is serenity. There is no chaos: there is harmony...;NM45AABAST01057_.mp3
Strange, but even now I find comfort in these words. I... suppose old habits die hard.;NM45AABAST01058_.mp3
There is no death: there is the Force. Thank you, Revan. I am ready to face my fate now.;NM45AABAST01059_.mp3
[Failure] The Jedi code is nothing but words, the babblings of senile old Masters! The code cannot help me now!;NM45AABAST01092_.mp3
There's no need for me to kill you, Bastila.;
I am stronger than you could ever be, Bastila!;
You can't win, Bastila. Now you must die!;
Hmmm... look at this. This is one of those old style manual locks. No computer codes or nothing. The sewers is the only place you'll see one of these on Taris.;NM05AAMISS01000_.mp3
You can't use conventional security spikes on these old locks, but don't worry. I've come across them before. I've rigged up a little device that should do the trick.;NM05AAMISS01001_.mp3
You're a sight for sore eyes, Mission.;
I'm glad to see you too, Big Z! You didn't think I'd forget about you - Mission and Zaalbar, together forever!;NM05AAZAAL03001_.mp3
Who's that with you?;
These are my new friends, Big Z. Without them I never could have got you out.;NM05AAZAAL03003_.mp3
Good to meet you, Zaalbar. I'm <FullName>.;
"You know the language of my people? That is rare among your species; I am impressed.";
You have saved me from a life of servitude and slavery. There is only one way I can ever repay such an act: I will swear a lifedebt to you.;
A lifedebt? Are you sure about that, Big Z? Think about it carefully. You better be sure about this.;NM05AAZAAL03006_.mp3
I am sure, Mission. This is an issue of great importance to me. Because of our great physical strength, Wookiees are being used as slave labor on our own homeworld.;
"They see us as brutes and animals to be exploited. Over the years slavers have taken many of my people; we must always be on guard against raids against our villages.";
When the Gamorreans captured me, I thought I was doomed to a life of servitude. I have been saved from such a fate, and the only way I can repay that is through a lifedebt.;
Big Z swearing a Wookiee lifedebt to you. Wow - this is major. Do you realize what this means?;NM05AAZAAL03010_.mp3
It's some kind of loyalty vow, isn't it?;
A lifedebt is the most solemn vow a Wookiee can make. It means he'll stay by your side for the rest of your life - wherever you go, whatever you do, Zaalbar will be with you.;NM05AAZAAL03013_.mp3
In the presence of you all I swear my lifedebt. Forever after I will be by your side, <FullName>. May my vow be as strong as the roots of the great Wroshyr trees of Kashyyyk.;
I'm honored to accept his vow.;
I guess this means you're stuck with me too. Wherever Big Z goes, I'm going. I almost lost him once - it's not going to happen again.;NM05AAZAAL03016_.mp3
I'm glad to have you aboard, Mission.;
So... I guess I still owe you one secret path into the Vulkar base. That was the deal, wasn't it? Don't worry, I know a backdoor into that scum den!;NM05AAZAAL03018_.mp3
Good. The sooner we get there the better.;
I better come with you - the Vulkars put up a force shield to keep the sewer dwellers out. I'm one of the only non-Vulkars on Taris who can get you past it.;NM05AAZAAL03020_.mp3
I can't remember exactly how to get there, but I know it was somewhere here in the sewers. Over to the northeast, if I remember right. I just hope the rancor monster isn't still there.;NM05AAZAAL03021_.mp3
Rancor? Are you serious!;
There used to be a rancor monster that made its nest in that part of the sewers. Pretty much eats anything it can get its claws on. That thing is huge!;NM05AAZAAL03023_.mp3
Luckily rancors aren't too bright. I was able to sneak past it before, so I'm sure we'll figure something out. That is, unless you want to change your mind.;NM05AAZAAL03024_.mp3
That's not really an option. Let's go.;
Okay then, off we go. Like I said, somewhere to the south-east. Just look for the force shield and we'll know we're there.;NM05AAZAAL03026_.mp3
[ZAALBAR has joined your party. Remember, you can only have two party members with you at any time. The others will wait for you back at the apartment.];
[You can switch party members using the PARTY SELECTION screen, accessible by left-clicking the Party Selection button while on the Map screen. This button is disabled in areas that are considered dangerous.];
[Left-click this response to go to PARTY SELECTION screen.];
I'm not afraid of any rancor. Let's go.;
If you can get past the rancor, then it shouldn't be a problem for me!;
Whoa - nobody said anything about a rancor monster!;
A rancor monster? Good - I'm spoiling for a fight!;
You did a good job mopping up those Gamorreans, but I don't think you want to take on a rancor! Those things are huge!;NM05AAZAAL03031_.mp3
Just tell me how to get there.;
Great - a Wookiee and a snot-nosed punk!;
Hey - don't underestimate me! I may be young, but I'm quick and plenty smart. You just give me a chance and you'll be surprised at how useful I can be.;NM05AAZAAL03034_.mp3
Why won't this nightmare end!;
I don't want a Wookiee following me around all the time!;
Sorry, but there's not much you can do about it. Zaalbar's already sworn the lifedebt and it's not something they can just take back. This is a sacred, irreversible vow.;NM05AAZAAL03037_.mp3
I don't suppose there's any way I can get out of this?;
I'm not sure.;
Let me guess - it means I got a walking carpet following me for the rest of my days.;
Hey - don't make fun of the lifedebt! This is serious business, you know?;NM05AAZAAL03040_.mp3
I've always wanted a Wookiee slave!;
Hey - Zaalbar's not your slave! He just swore a lifedebt to you. It's not the same thing.;NM05AAZAAL03042_.mp3
Don't mention it. I was happy to help.;
So, is there some kind of reward for freeing you?;

This is futile, master! Why must you keep me back like this? Why can I not learn to fight with a real lightsaber?;
Do not underestimate the strength of your Cortosis blade, young Padawan.;
It is not a lightsaber! It is nothing!;
And perhaps that is the reason you have not advanced to lightsaber training.;
You are too headstrong, too overeager to move on without the knowledge necessary to use what you learn.;
A lightsaber is a delicate and subtle weapon. One that can cause great harm to its wielder if not used properly.;
I believe we have trained enough for now. Reflect on what you have learned, Padawan. Through learning comes knowledge.;
There is no ignorance. There is knowledge.;
Yes, master. Thank you.;

The Drunk Side;
Well, well. A Star Map. An ancient artifact of dark side power. Can't say I'm surprised. I always knew there was something funny down here.;NM25AASTAR99012_.mp3
I wonder if the Star Map has had an effect on the evolution of the creatures here in the Shadowlands. Might explain why it's so dangerous down here.;NM25AASTAR99026_.mp3
In all my years on Kashyyyk I have never heard mention of anything like this Star Map existed in the Shadowlands. This discovery is... disturbing.;
"This place feels wrong to me; it is tainted by the Star Map's very existence. We should return to the treetops as soon as possible.";
An interesting theory, but I suppose we don't have time to test it now, do we? Now that we've got what you came for we should be heading back up to the treetops.;NM25AASTAR99027_.mp3
This doesn't make any sense. Why put a Star Map here in the Shadowlands? Who's ever going to see it?;NM25AASTAR99000_.mp3
The Star Map is an artifact of the dark side. The horrors that live here in the Shadowlands could be the result of thousands of generations affected by the Star Map's power.;NM25AASTAR99001_.mp3
I guess it's possible the Star Map could have been built before these trees popped up. It's just hard to imagine Kashyyyk with no forests, you know?;NM25AASTAR99011_.mp3
Hey, this place is starting to give me the creeps. We've got the Star Map, let's just get out of here, okay?;NM25AASTAR99030_.mp3
I suppose it's possible the Star Map was built before these trees were ever here. It's just hard to imagine this world without these massive forests.;NM25AASTAR99007_.mp3
You know what? This place is making me uneasy. We've got the Star Map, let's just get out of here.;NM25AASTAR99028_.mp3
I suppose if the Star Map is as old as everyone seems to think it could have been here before all these damn trees. It's just hard to imagine.;NM25AASTAR99009_.mp3
But I don't want to stand around here chatting about this. Too many spots for an ambush. We've got what we came for - let's just head back to the treetops.;NM25AASTAR99029_.mp3
Come. We should leave this place. There is nothing else for us here.;NM25AASTAR99002_.mp3

Observation: This is a strange place to encounter a Star Map, Master. Down here it is unlikely anyone would ever find it.;NM25AASTAR99014_.mp3

Possibly. The Star Map is incredibly ancient.;
An excellent point, Master. Now that we have what we came for I do hope we will be leaving this world soon. All this flora and fauna is so very tiresome.;NM25AASTAR99017_.mp3

Investigate? You're just like the others - fodder for the Selkath. Walking fish snacks. Chomp, chomp, chomp - if you can run you might be fast food.;NM28AASUR104002_.mp3

Don't know. Go ask them. Ha-ha-ha!;NM28AASUR104014_.mp3

It seems our little stowaway is gone.;
What are you talking about?;
I saw her sneaking off the ship. I called out to her, but she ran off. I guess she figured it was time to leave.;
She's probably better off on her own.;
You're probably right. She's a survivor, after all.;
That might be why she left. Maybe her instincts warned her we were headed for trouble... trouble she wanted no part of.;
That's a cheery thought.;
I guess there's nothing more we can do but continue our search for the Star Maps. I hope things work out - for her and for us.;
She's probably right.;
I think you're reading too much into this.;
We have to go after her!;
It was hard enough discovering her on this little ship. We'll never find her if we have to search an entire planet.;
But I wouldn't worry about her. She's a survivor, she'll be okay.;
Good riddance.;
That seems kind of harsh, but I guess she'll be okay on her own. She's a survivor, after all.;
Gone?;
I was checking our supplies in the cargo hold. Something's not right.;
Not right? What do you mean?;
Someone's been into the emergency stash of food. Mission and I asked everyone, but nobody knows anything about it.;
You might want to check out the food stores the next time you're in the cargo hold.;

People complain about the Sith, but this quarantine is good for all the businesses on Taris. Look at Javyar's cantina. That place has never been busier!;NM02AAMAN207002_.mp3
If the Sith wanted to get on everyone's good side, they'd go clean up the swoop gangs in the Lower City.;NM02AAMAN207004_.mp3

"You got lucky on Taris; the Sith attack saved you from a quick and gruesome death. But I promise you, the Sith won't be getting in my way this time!";NGLOBECALO02004_.mp3
How did you get down here?;
"You underestimate me; there's other ways down here besides the Republic subs. A small vessel with the right weapons can blast a path right through those firaxian sharks.";NGLOBECALO02006_.mp3
Once I got down to the ocean floor all I had to do was come here and wait. I knew you'd come back this way eventually.;NGLOBECALO02008_.mp3
Hold on, Calo... maybe we can work out a deal here.;
Sorry, I'm not in this for the credits. You're the only ones who've ever gotten away from me - I've got a rep to protect!;NGLOBECALO02010_.mp3

I have news, Lord Malak. About the Jedi.;NM45AAMALAK2001_.mp3
Ah, the Jedi. Did my droids pass their test? Did they destroy our enemies?;NM45AAMALAK2002_.mp3
N-no, Lord Malak. The droids could not stop them.;NM45AAMALAK2003_.mp3
Strange. I did not think there were any among the Order who could survive an attack by an army of the Star Forge's battle droids.;NM45AAMALAK2004_.mp3
It... it was Revan, Lord Malak. Your old master is with the Jedi, here on the Star Forge!;NM45AAMALAK2005_.mp3
Yes... that would explain why the droids failed. Revan always was strong in the Force. Very well - send out all available troops. The apprentices, as well.;NM45AAMALAK2006_.mp3
Do you... do you think they can stop Revan, Lord Malak?;NM45AAMALAK2007_.mp3
Of course not! But they will slow Revan down. That will give me the time I need to fully prepare the Star Forge's defenses.;NM45AAMALAK2008_.mp3

Poor Ixgil. He should never have talked back to that Sith. Thankfully you were here to step in and help us, human.;
This isn't the first time the Sith have come in here to cause trouble for us, but hopefully it will be the last.;
Won't someone come searching for this patrol?;
Don't worry about the bodies. I will move them so it looks like they were killed elsewhere. That should throw the Sith off the track.;
With any luck, they won't be bothering us again for a while.;
I'm just glad I could help.;
Stay out of my way or I'll kill you, too!;
Forgive me, human. I only wanted to thank you, I meant no harm. I will leave you in peace.;

Chuundar is very interested in furthering our exchange of labor for weapons. We've begun expanding our operations, as I'm sure you've seen.;
I think Zaalbar will have something to say about this.;
The time for objections is long since passed, if there ever was one. You brought about this change. You have no one to blame.;
I have no objections. Chuundar showed me the way things must be. There is nothing for me here. The old ways are dead.;
Er, the tone of your Wookiee's muttering seems agreable. He likely agrees that this was the gentlest outcome possible.;
What are your plans for Kashyyyk?;
Czerka Corporation will begin an extensive examination of the commercial potential of this world. The Wookiees will aid us in this.;
I'm certain there are ample resources for us to export. I doubt we will encounter much more resistance. We will be here for quite some time.;
I need supplies. What do you have available?;
Czerka Corporation maintains a well-stocked armory, although for general goods you will need to speak with the vendor in the docking area.;
Can I expect a reward for what I have done?;
I would think that the thanks of Czerka Corporation would be enough, especially after your previous actions. You have caused us significant difficulty.;
I have reports about you meddling with our operations in the Shadowlands. I think we will consider this agrement with Chuundar to be fair compensation. Yes, that is what we will do.;
Perhaps I could persuade you otherwise?;
Perhaps that is exactly why I have instructed the guards to watch your every action, and how I react to you. I have taken precautions reagrding your... capabilities.;
No, I don't believe we will be extending any financial compensation to you today. Thank you for your assistance.;
I'm looking for something called a Star Map.;
I have no information about that. You appear to have explored deeper than any of our current expeditions. I certainly can't expand on what you've seen.;

Czerka will be operating here for quite some time. All things considered, this was the gentlest outcome possible.;
I don't approve of this.;

Even after all this time... look, they fit as though just made. Bacca's Ceremonial Blade... mine...;
What do you intend to do with it?;
Use it, of course. It has no more worth to my people. Not with Chuundar as chieftain. The old ways are dead. You showed me that.;
No, this sword will serve me as I see fit. It is no longer a symbol that anyone here recognizes. Still... maybe...;
No, no I am through with this place. Let's go find some prey. I want to see how Bacca's toy cuts.;

I'm Carth, one of the Republic soldiers from the Endar Spire. I was with you on the escape pod, do you remember?;NM02AACART02003_.mp3
I had a strange dream. Like a vision or something.;
I'm not surprised. You took a serious blow to the head. You're probably having all kinds of strange dreams. I wouldn't worry too much about it.;NM02AACART02101_.mp3
Well, you've been slipping in and out of consciousness for a couple of days now, so I imagine you're pretty confused about things. Try not to worry. We're safe... at least for the moment.;NM02AACART02005_.mp3
We're in an abandoned apartment on the planet of Taris. You were banged up pretty bad when our escape pod crashed, but luckily I wasn't seriously hurt.;NM02AACART02006_.mp3
I was able to drag you away from our crash site in all the confusion, and I stumbled onto this abandoned apartment. By the time the Sith arrived on the scene we were long gone.;NM02AACART02007_.mp3
The Sith?;
Taris is under Sith control. Their fleet is orbiting the planet, they've declared martial law and they've imposed a planet-wide quarantine. But I've been in worse spots.;NM02AACART02012_.mp3
I saw on your service records that you understand a remarkable number of alien languages. That's pretty rare in a raw recruit, but it should come in handy while we're stranded on a foreign world.;NM02AACART02013_.mp3
There's no way the Republic will be able to get anyone through the Sith blockade to help us. If we're going to find Bastila and get off this planet, we can't rely on anybody but ourselves.;NM02AACART02014_.mp3
Why is it so important to find Bastila?;
That smack to your head did more damage than I thought. Bastila's a Jedi. She was with the strike team that killed Darth Revan, Malak's Sith master.;NM02AACART02016_.mp3
Bastila is the key to the whole Republic war effort. The Sith must have found out she was on the Endar Spire and set an ambush for us in this system.;NM02AACART02017_.mp3
I believe Bastila was on one of the escape pods that crashed down here on Taris. For the sake of the Republic war effort, we have to try and find her.;NM02AACART02018_.mp3
How can one person, even a Jedi, be so important?;
Bastila is no ordinary Jedi. She has a rare gift the Jedi call Battle Meditation. Bastila's power can influence entire armies.;NM02AACART02020_.mp3
Through the Force Bastila can inspire her allies with confidence and make her enemies lose their will to fight. Often, that's all it takes to tip the balance in a battle.;NM02AACART02021_.mp3
Of course, there are limits to what she can do. But from what I understand of her ability, it requires great concentration and focus to maintain her Battle Meditation.;NM02AACART02022_.mp3
The attack on the Endar Spire happened so fast she never had a chance to use her Battle Meditation. Like us, she barely got out alive.;NM02AACART02023_.mp3
So what do you suggest we do next?;
Bastila's going to need our help. Many of Darth Malak's followers can use the dark side of the Force, and the Sith have already killed more than their share of Jedi in this war.;NM02AACART02026_.mp3
"Nobody will be looking for a couple of common soldiers like us. And if we're careful we can move about the planet without attracting notice; a luxury Bastila won't have.";NM02AACART02027_.mp3
She's going to have half the Sith fleet looking for her. They know how important she is to the war effort.;NM02AACART02028_.mp3
The whole planet is under quarantine. No ships can land or take-off. So if Bastila's going to escape Taris, she's going to need our help. And we'll probably need hers.;NM02AACART02038_.mp3
Any idea where we should start looking for Bastila?;
While you were out I did some scouting around. There are reports of a couple escape pods crashing down into the Undercity. That's probably a good place to start.;NM02AACART02040_.mp3
But the Undercity is a dangerous place. We don't want to go in there unprepared. It won't do Bastila any good if we go and get ourselves killed.;NM02AACART02041_.mp3
I want to ask you some questions.;
I'll tell you whatever I can, though I...I don't know how much help it'll be.;NM02AACART02050_.mp3
What do you know about Malak and the Sith?;
Everything I know about Malak is pretty much common knowledge. He escaped the trap that killed Darth Revan, his Sith Master. With Revan's death, Malak became the new Dark Lord.;NM02AACART02055_.mp3
It's obvious that Malak's a ruthless tyrant who'll crush anyone who stands in his way... just like Revan was. Experience has shown that the Sith won't stop until the Republic lies in ruins.;NM02AACART02056_.mp3
Malak and his Sith don't respect anything except raw, brutal power. It's hard to imagine how someone who used to be a Jedi could become such a monster!;NM02AACART02057_.mp3
A Jedi? What do you mean?;
Malak and Revan were once both part of the Jedi Order, but they were young and headstrong. And against the wishes of the Council they went to battle the Mandalorians on the Outer Rim.;NM02AACART02059_.mp3
Something happened out there. Something corrupted them and drew them over to the dark side. Or maybe there was something rotten inside them all along. I don't know.;NM02AACART02060_.mp3
They formed an army of ex-Republic soldiers and Jedi who had fallen to the dark side, with Revan at their head... until Revan was killed by Bastila's Jedi strike team.;NM02AACART02061_.mp3
But even that didn't slow the Sith down. Malak just stepped in and assumed Revan's role. He took control of the Sith armada and resumed the bloody conquest of the Outer Worlds.;NM02AACART02062_.mp3
I want to ask you something else.;
Don't worry. We'll find a way to stop the Sith.;
I hope you're right. But the Republic hasn't been able to stop them so far, even with the support of the Jedi Council. I think Bastila might be the galaxy's last hope.;NM02AACART02067_.mp3
What can you tell me about this planet we're on?;
Taris was once a magnificent planet-wide metropolis of towering skyscrapers. But that was a long time ago.;NM02AACART02071_.mp3
The Upper City, where the rich citizens live, is...is still pretty safe. If it wasn't for the Sith occupation and the planet-wide quarantine it might not even be that bad a place to live.;NM02AACART02072_.mp3
But farther down things have degenerated. The...the Lower City is nothing but a slum overrun by swoop-bike gangs waging a never-ending war for control. And the Undercity is, well, even worse.;NM02AACART02073_.mp3
"The lowest level of Taris is a wasteland overrun by rakghouls; mindless, diseased mutants that attack on sight. I've already entered all this info into your data-pad journal.";NM02AACART02074_.mp3
I'd like to know some more about you, Carth.;
"I understand why you want to know more about me; I...I kinda get the feeling we'll be spending a lot of time together over the next while.";NM02AACART02052_.mp3
"But this isn't really the best time for long introductions; we should stay focused on the task at hand. There'll be time for that later.";NM02AACART02053_.mp3
The sooner we start looking for Bastila the sooner we find her. Let's go.;
Good idea. We can use this abandoned apartment as a base, and we can probably get some equipment and supplies here in the Upper City. Just remember to keep a low profile.;NM02AACART02077_.mp3
I've heard some grim stories about the Dark Jedi interrogation techniques. They say the Force can do terrible things to a mind. It can wipe away your memories and destroy your very identity!;NM02AACART02078_.mp3
But I figure if we don't do anything stupid we should be okay. I mean, after all, they're... they're looking for Bastila, not a couple of grunts like us. Alright, soldier, let's move out.;NM02AACART02079_.mp3
Come on. I want to scout this planet out a bit.;
Sounds like Malak and the Sith have the right idea.;
How can you say that? The Sith are butchers! Soldiers, civilians - I mean, they don't care who they kill! Even...even children!;NM02AACART02064_.mp3
Right now the Republic is the only thing keeping Malak's brutal fist from crushing the entire galaxy... and it won't be long until even the Republic falls to the Sith fleet.;NM02AACART02065_.mp3
What's in this for me if I help you out?;
You mean besides a chance to get off this planet before the Sith find you? Do you...do you have any idea what the Sith do to prisoners of war?;NM02AACART02082_.mp3
Okay, you made your point. I'll help you out.;
Good. We need to work together if we're going to survive.;NM02AACART02084_.mp3
If you want my help you better make it worth my while.;
Oh, I get it. Never mind that the Sith will destroy the Republic and ravage the galaxy. You're only in this for the credits.;NM02AACART02086_.mp3
Don't worry. The Republic pays its mercenaries well. You help me find Bastila and they'll make it more than worth your while, I'm sure. Plus, it might be your only chance to get off Taris.;NM02AACART02087_.mp3
If it means getting off this planet, I guess I can help you find Bastila.;
I think I'll take my chances on my own.;
Don't be a fool! You're not getting off this world without help, and you can't hide here forever. Do you have any idea what will happen when the Sith find you?;NM02AACART02089_.mp3
If Bastila's a Jedi, she can probably look after herself.;
How do you even know Bastila's still alive?;
I don't. But Bastila's young, and she has a powerful command of the Force. We survived the crash landing, so I'm willing to bet that she may have, too.;NM02AACART02093_.mp3
Besides, what's the alternative? I mean, if she's dead, then no one can stop Malak and his Sith from wiping out the Republic. And I'd rather operate on the assumption that she survived.;NM02AACART02094_.mp3
Forget it! I'm not risking my life to try and save her!;
I don't think you understand the situation. We can't hide on this planet forever. Eventually the Sith will find us... and, trust me, you don't want that.;NM02AACART02096_.mp3
Getting off this world isn't going to be easy... we'll probably need Bastila's help. Not to mention that without her, the whole Republic war effort is doomed.;NM02AACART02097_.mp3
Bastila? She's the one from the Endar Spire, right?;
I guess I owe you my life. Thanks.;
You don't have to thank me. I've never abandoned anyone on a mission, and I'm not about to start now. Besides, I'm going to need your help.;NM02AACART02010_.mp3
So are we just going to wait here for the Republic to rescue us?;
Right. I'm <FullName>, by the way. How did we get here?;
Carth, the one on the communicator. I remember.;
Where am I? How did I get here?;
Whoa, hold on. Don't try to get up yet. You were smashed up pretty bad when we crash landed here on Taris.;NM02AACART02000_.mp3
Don't worry, we should be safe here in this apartment. I gave you something to help you sleep. Just get some rest and let the kolto packs do their job.;NM02AACART02001_.mp3
[This unsavory looking man appears to be looking for someone... maybe even one of your companions back on the Ebon Hawk.];
*grunt* What the hell is your kind doing here? Bad enough I have to deal with all these other idiots, but now there's a stinkin' Cathar on this world too?;NGLOBEHXOR15000_.mp3
I have as much right to be here as you do, SIR!;NGLOBEHXOR15002_.mp3
Do not seek to aggravate us.;
Ooooo! Big man, the Jedi, shooting his mouth off from behind a lightsaber, or whatever you're carrying.;NGLOBEHXOR15082_.mp3
Hiding behind your pet Cathar... And a woman at that!;NGLOBEHXOR15084_.mp3
We should have exterminated all you Cathar when we had the chance.;NGLOBEHXOR15086_.mp3
Wha... What do you know about my world?;NGLOBEHXOR15007_.mp3
I know enough that... Hey, wait a minute... you look familiar somehow...;NGLOBEHXOR15009_.mp3
What? You...;NGLOBEHXOR15011_.mp3
Do you two know each other?;
This doesn't concern you, Jedi trash.;NGLOBEHXOR15015_.mp3
Hm... now where could I have... No, he's dead and she likely is too. I...;NGLOBEHXOR15017_.mp3
What are you talking about??;NGLOBEHXOR15019_.mp3
Maybe I was wrong. Still, I think a specimen like you would be a nice addition to my collection.;NGLOBEHXOR15021_.mp3
So what would it take, Jedi, for you to sell your pet here to me?;NGLOBEHXOR15023_.mp3
She is not for sale!;
Now don't be so selfish. We both know Cathar aren't real people anyway.;NGLOBEHXOR15025_.mp3
The females make amusing pets, but males should be put down like the animals they are. I remember one time on Taris...;NGLOBEHXOR15027_.mp3
What?! WHAT DID YOU SAY?!;NGLOBEHXOR15029_.mp3
What are you saying?;
WHAT DID YOU DO ON TARIS, YOU SCUM?!;NGLOBEHXOR15031_.mp3
Put one of you down like the animals you are. So easy... then I saw one of the females on the auction block, but those darn Jedi...;NGLOBEHXOR15033_.mp3
It was you!;NGLOBEHXOR15035_.mp3
What? Me? Oh ho! Now I recognize where I've seen that face before.;NGLOBEHXOR15037_.mp3
You were the little Cathar I was going to purchase. But those Jedi came and stole my pet away from me!;NGLOBEHXOR15039_.mp3
You bought Juhani?;
When I was fighting with the Mandalorians against the Cathar, I developed an appreciation for these creatures. They make excellent servants if properly trained.;NGLOBEHXOR15041_.mp3
You Jedi act all prim and proper, but inside you must feel the same way I do about the lesser, non-human species. The Sith at least let their feelings show on the outside.;NGLOBEHXOR15043_.mp3
You... My homeworld...;NGLOBEHXOR15045_.mp3
Come now, will you let your pet go? I'm sure we can come up with a price we both think is fair.;NGLOBEHXOR15047_.mp3
You'll only hurt her if I let her go.;
NO, I WILL NOT BE SOLD!;NGLOBEHXOR15051_.mp3
And I will see you dead for what you have done to my people!;NGLOBEHXOR15053_.mp3
Uh... hold on a second! Don't be hasty!;NGLOBEHXOR15055_.mp3
Do not fall to the dark side again, Juhani.;
I... I will remain calm. I am a Jedi now.;NGLOBEHXOR15057_.mp3
My lust for vegeance must be curbed.;NGLOBEHXOR15059_.mp3
Yes, yes... Say no to the dark side...;NGLOBEHXOR15061_.mp3
But I will have you yet! Heh.;NGLOBEHXOR15063_.mp3
There is no emotion...;
...There is peace.;NGLOBEHXOR15066_.mp3
Let's get him!;
Yes, we.... NO! I must not fall prey to the dark side again.;NGLOBEHXOR15069_.mp3
Show me the money first.;
You were buying Cathar slaves?;
What are you talking about?;
You were on Taris?;
Calm down, Juhani.;
She is her own person.;
Well... what are you offering?;
Heh, I knew we could work something out.;NGLOBEHXOR15077_.mp3
I am not for sale!;NGLOBEHXOR15079_.mp3
We should just leave, Juhani.;
You annoy me, worm.;
Ooooo! Big woman, the Jedi, shooting her mouth off from behind a lightsaber, or whatever you're carrying.;NGLOBEHXOR15088_.mp3
Just ignore him, Juhani.;
Heh, yeah, do like the Jedi tells you and back off! Your people are pathetic, it's no wonder we crushed your world so easily.;NGLOBEHXOR15005_.mp3
A big mouth like that can get you killed.;
Ack! *cough* Heh, you seem to have defeated me, Cathar worm, but I'll have the last laugh in the end!;NGLOBEHXOR15090_.mp3
What do you mean?;NGLOBEHXOR15092_.mp3
Yes, what do you mean?;
*cough* You may have killed me here, today, but I had the pleasure of killing off your species!;NGLOBEHXOR15094_.mp3
Not everyone who fought alongside the Mandalorians did it for their stupid concept of 'honor'. Some of us did it just for the pleasure: the pleasure of seeing your world burn.;NGLOBEHXOR15096_.mp3
You... you animal! You wretch!;NGLOBEHXOR15098_.mp3
*cough* *cough* Heh, but I'm beyond your petty vengeance now, girl. You can never have your revenge!;NGLOBEHXOR15100_.mp3
Do not give in to the dark side, Juhani.;
I will not give him the satisfaction of seeing me give in to the dark side.;NGLOBEHXOR15103_.mp3
Worm!;NGLOBEHXOR15108_.mp3
I killed your people on Cathar in the sky, on the ground, in their homes. I hunted them down like the animals they were, just to see them burn.;NGLOBEHXOR15110_.mp3
But the treacherous beasts fought back and left me with injuries that meant I could never fight again... or so they thought!;NGLOBEHXOR15112_.mp3
Stop trying to provoke her!;
No, I will not give in to him.;NGLOBEHXOR15114_.mp3
I ended up in the Lower City of Taris, and what did I find? A few of those stinking beasts living there!;NGLOBEHXOR15116_.mp3
The male was easy enough to best, but the females proved elusive. I didn't know what happened to them after I killed the male, until I saw this cursed woman on the auction block.;NGLOBEHXOR15118_.mp3
But then the Jedi came and ruined everything before I could have my revenge... *cough*;NGLOBEHXOR15120_.mp3
You... You killed my father, you killed my people, you treat us like animals... You deserve to die!;NGLOBEHXOR15122_.mp3
Do not give in Juhani. You are stronger than this.;
Give in and embrace your hate! You're no better than me! You're nothing!;NGLOBEHXOR15124_.mp3
I... I...;NGLOBEHXOR15126_.mp3
Do not do it, Juhani.;
I... Help me, please! Do not let me give in to my anger again!;NGLOBEHXOR15128_.mp3
Just step away.;
Haha! Your kind always were weak-minded!;NGLOBEHXOR15130_.mp3
No, I will not do this. He may die, but it will not be out of my vengeance.;NGLOBEHXOR15135_.mp3
You coward! You weak... ahhh... gurk! *death rattle*;NGLOBEHXOR15137_.mp3
Kill him now.;
You... You will die for what you have done!;NGLOBEHXOR15140_.mp3
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.;
Quit your whining!;
This isn't going to work.;
We should just kill you now.;
Hahah- *cough* *cough* But you won't! You're the cowardly type, all of you. You don't have the guts to finish me now!;NGLOBEHXOR15146_.mp3
Just ignore him.;
You could kill him now.;
No! I cannot give in to my anger. I will not give him the satisfaction of making me that way.;NGLOBEHXOR15106_.mp3
He doesn't have long, Juhani.;
He may not, but I will make him pay with what little time he has left! I will make him tell me what he has done to my people!;NGLOBEHXOR15149_.mp3
Don't listen to him.;
There she is! Get her, men, but remember: don't kill her!;NGLOBEHXOR15152_.mp3

If not, it might convince Dustil that what we're saying about the Sith is true. It would be worth a shot.;NM35AACART03002_.mp3
Anyone else get the feeling that finding this Star Map in the back of this krayt dragon's cave is more than just a coincidence?;NM18ACSTAR99000_.mp3
The Star Map is an artifact of the dark side. The krayt dragon may have been drawn here by its dark power, only to be enslaved by it.;NM18ACSTAR99001_.mp3
Say, now that we've got the Star Map do you think we can leave this planet soon? I've got sand *everywhere*!;NM18ACSTAR99011_.mp3
We've found the Star Map, now let's get out of here. There's a foul smell in this place. Something worse than any krayt dragon stench.;
We should probably get going now. We've found the Star Map, and I'm guessing there isn't much else worth seeing on this planet.;NM18ACSTAR99007_.mp3
Now that we've got what we came for we should probably move on. Can't say I'm going to miss this pit of a world.;NM18ACSTAR99009_.mp3
Come. We should leave this place. There is nothing else for us here.;NM18ACSTAR99002_.mp3
The Star Map is an artifact of the dark side. The krayt dragon may have been drawn here by its dark power, only to be enslaved by it.;NM18ACSTAR99003_.mp3
Well, no point hanging around here. Now that we've got the Star Map we might as well move on.;NM18ACSTAR99006_.mp3
Come. We should leave this place. There is nothing else for us here.;NM18ACSTAR99004_.mp3
The Star Map is an artifact of the dark side. The krayt dragon may have been drawn here by its dark power, only to be enslaved by it.;NM18ACSTAR99005_.mp3
Observation: There is tremendous power emanating from the Star Map. I wonder if the krayt dragon was drawn to this cave because of it?;NM18ACSTAR99015_.mp3
Possibly. The Star Map is a powerful dark side artifact.;
Yes, master. I'm certain you are correct. Now that we have what we came for I do hope we will be leaving this world soon. I am growing so sick of sand in my circuits.;NM18ACSTAR99017_.mp3
It's probably just coincidence.;
Anybody else get the feeling that finding this Star Map in the back of this krayt dragon's cave is more than just a coincidence?;NM18ACSTAR99008_.mp3
Hey - it's one of those Star Maps, ain't it? Kind of weird finding it in the back of a krayt dragon's lair, don't you think?;NM18ACSTAR99010_.mp3
Finding this Star Map here in this cave gives me a cold shiver. You don't think it's just coincidence that the krayt dragon made its home here, do you?;NM18ACSTAR99012_.mp3
The Star Map. Even after all thousands of years it has been here,  it still has tremendous power. Can you not feel it?;NM18ACSTAR99013_.mp3
Statement: I believe there can be little doubt that we have found the Star Map you were seeking. I am surprised it is still working after all this time.;NM18ACSTAR99014_.mp3
I do not think it is mere chance that we have found the Star Map here, in the lair of a krayt dragon.;NM18ACSTAR99019_.mp3
Boop-boop. Beep. Click-whirr.;
I agree. It's amazing the Star Map is still working after all these years.;
Beep. Fritz. Zzzott.;
You're right. Let's get moving.;
Beep. Whoop. Woo.;
I can't believe we couldn't get arena tickets for this match! Now we'll have to watch the duel on the view screen.;NM02AEDUEL99000_.mp3
Who cares? It's Duncan and Gerlon fighting. It's not like we're going to miss anything good.;NM02AEDUEL99001_.mp3
Shh! They're about to start, so quit complaining and just watch the view screen!;NM02AEDUEL99002_.mp3
You out on patrol? Consider yourself lucky: we're stuck standing guard over this dump to try and prevent another swoop riot!;NM03AALOIT18000_.mp3
This area is off limits because of the riot after the last race! You Tarisians couldn't handle crowd control, so we're shutting down the swoop track. Just move along!;NM03AALOIT18002_.mp3
Well done, Lord Revan. You are as ruthless as Malak ever was! Quickly, now. We have to get to the Star Forge and destroy the Usurper!;NM41AAMISS04027_.mp3

So, you decide to show your face. I don't know who you are or who sent you to kill me, but you should have stayed hiding!;

You may have defeated the pathetic bounty hunter my Master sent after you, but you are no match for me! I have studied at the foot of the Dark Lord himself!;NGLOBEBAND01002_.mp3
How did you get down here?;
Do you think those Republic subs are the only way to reach the ocean floor? Malak and Revan found a way down here long before the Hrakert station was built.;NGLOBEBAND01004_.mp3
I acquired a ship and followed the same route Revan and my Master used on their own journey. Then it was simply a matter of waiting for you to return for the Star Map.;NGLOBEBAND01006_.mp3

Your words mean nothing to me... unless you wish to beg for your life. No? Then I shall try to make this both quick and painful!;NGLOBEBAND01008_.mp3

Revan - I knew you'd come for me. Malak thought you might be afraid to enter the Temple again, but he doesn't know you like I do. Not anymore. Not since you've changed.;NM44ACEVIL01001_.mp3
Quickly, Bastila - come with us! We have to escape before Malak arrives!;NM44ACEVIL01002_.mp3
"Escape? You don't understand. I have sworn allegiance to Lord Malak and the Sith; I am no longer a pawn of the Jedi Council.";NM44ACEVIL01003_.mp3
No, Bastila! Don't go over to the dark side!;
You say that as if the dark side is some terrible entity. The Jedi Council has brainwashed you like all the others. Like they once did with me.;NM44ACEVIL01005_.mp3
They speak of the dark side as if it something to be feared. But in reality their only goal is to manipulate those who are strong in the Force. The fear of the dark side is a tool to maintain control.;NM44ACEVIL01006_.mp3
Why do you think the Jedi forbid you and Malak from joining the Mandalorian Wars? They knew you would realize your true potential and break free of their domination.;NM44ACEVIL01007_.mp3
Malak has shown me how the Jedi Council have been using me the same way they once tried to use you. They've been holding me back because they knew one day I would surpass them all.;NM44ACEVIL01008_.mp3
No - I don't believe it! How could you betray us like this, Bastila?;
I resisted at first. I endured the Sith torments with the passionless serenity of a true Jedi, emptying my mind. But after a week of endless tortures I finally saw the truth.;NM44ACEVIL01012_.mp3
Malak forced me to acknowledge my anger and pain. He showed me the liberating power of these emotions. Then he made me see how the Jedi Council has denied me what is mine by right!;NM44ACEVIL01013_.mp3
The Jedi Council gladly used my Battle Meditation in their wars, but they still treated me like a child - like an inferior. They were jealous of my power... of what I could become!;NM44ACEVIL01014_.mp3
They wanted me to bow and call them Master and follow their Code and obey their every order. But all the while they were exploiting my Battle Meditation for their own use!;NM44ACEVIL01015_.mp3
Don't do this, Bastila! Fight it! I'll help you!;
You are a sad little fool. You speak as if I were the same Bastila that you've known all along. But freed from the control of the Jedi Council I've become much, much more.;NM44ACEVIL01017_.mp3
I almost wish you could see things as I do now. I wish you could join me and taste true power once again. Sadly, I doubt you are even capable any longer.;NM44ACEVIL01018_.mp3
With the power of the Star Forge Malak will destroy the Republic and conquer the galaxy. And I will be the apprentice at his side - after I prove my worth by killing you!;NM44ACEVIL01027_.mp3
I like this side of you, Bastila. Now we can truly be together.;
You think so, do you? You style yourself the Master of the Sith that you once were? To think I once envied you your passion, your power.;NM44ACEVIL01020_.mp3
Don't be lured in by these Sith lies, Bastila!;
"Lies? You are the one living a lie, Revan. The Jedi Council made you into something you are not; they programmed you to be their slave.";NM44ACEVIL01022_.mp3
You used to be Revan, Master of the Sith, but no longer. You are simply a pawn of the Jedi Council and the Republic they serve... like I was until Malak freed me from their shackles!;NM44ACEVIL01024_.mp3
A pity the power you once had is so diluted in you. You could have been strong as I am now... stronger, even. But that will never happen, now.;NM44ACEVIL01026_.mp3
I am Revan, the Dark Lord! Bow down to me, Bastila!;
If you've fallen under Malak's control you must die!;
It's not too late, Bastila! You can still turn away from the dark side!;
It didn't take long to convert you, did it? I always knew you were weak!;
A pawn of the Jedi Council? What are you talking about?;
"Surely you know what I mean, Revan. Look at what the Council did to you; they turned you into their puppet. The same thing they do to all who are truly strong in the Force.";NM44ACEVIL01029_.mp3
Come on, Bastila. We have to escape before Malak shows up!;NM44ACEVIL01030_.mp3
You are stronger than I would have thought possible, after what the Jedi Council did to you. Seems that Malak was wrong - the power of the dark side is not lost to you after all, Revan.;NM44ACEVIL01031_.mp3
I draw my power from the light now, Bastila.;
You can deny what you are, Revan, but you are only fooling yourself. I know the truth. I have seen the shadows inside your mind.;NM44ACEVIL01033_.mp3
Remember: I was there when you nearly died in the trap set by the Jedi Council. I used the Force to preserve your life, Revan. We are forever linked by my actions on that bridge!;NM44ACEVIL01034_.mp3
That is how I know you will come back to the light.;
These are not your true feelings, Revan. You are speaking as a tool of the Jedi Council - as I once did. But now I see how the Jedi used us both!;NM44ACEVIL01036_.mp3
The Council tried to exploit the bond between us. They hoped I would draw out your memories to lead them to the Star Forge. We were slaves to their will - like all who follow the Jedi Code!;NM44ACEVIL01037_.mp3
But in our shared visions of the Star Maps I also felt the so called taint within you. I resisted it at first, but now I embrace the power of the dark side - your dark side!;NM44ACEVIL01038_.mp3
Learn from my mistakes. It is not too late to come back to the light!;
Mistakes? No, Revan - the only mistake you are making is the one you are making now! You deny yourself the power that is yours by right! Only now do I realize how strong you are.;NM44ACEVIL01040_.mp3
You deserve to be the true Master of the Sith, not Malak. I see this now. Together we can destroy your old apprentice. Join with me and reclaim your lost identity!;NM44ACEVIL01041_.mp3
I'm not Revan anymore. I don't even remember those days.;
Your mind was too badly damaged to ever fully restore your memories, Revan. But your power, your strength of will, the essence of who and what you are: these things still remain!;NM44ACEVIL01043_.mp3
Once long ago you defied the Jedi Council, freeing yourself from their control. You claimed your rightful title of Dark Lord of the Sith. Together we can defeat Malak and take back what is yours!;NM44ACEVIL01044_.mp3
Please, Bastila... if you feel anything for me, you won't do this!;
I... I don't. The only Revan I could respect is one who would break free of the Council's slavery. One who would grasp the power that lies before him... not the weak fool I see.;NM44ACEVIL01046_.mp3
Bastila, it is not too late for you to be saved. The teachings of the Jedi can lead you from the dark side back into the light and a true understanding of the Force.;NM44ACEVIL01048_.mp3
You are beneath my contempt, Juhani. When you felt the power of the dark side you fled to a cave like some cowering animal! You know nothing of the Force or its true potential!;NM44ACEVIL01049_.mp3
But you, Revan - the power of the dark side is yours to command! You can use it to destroy Malak! With my help you could rule over the entire galaxy!;NM44ACEVIL01050_.mp3
I don't want to rule the galaxy. I want you to return to the light.;
You are a pathetic fool, Revan! Together we could have defeated Malak and ruled over an Empire, but now I will be at Lord Malak's side instead!;NM44ACEVIL01081_.mp3
You will be crushed with the Republic and all the fools who bow down to the Jedi Council! No one can stand against the power of the Star Forge and the Sith fleet!;NM44ACEVIL01082_.mp3
The Dark Lord Revan is dead. I am a servant of the light now.;
Yes! Together we can rule the galaxy!;
Listen to me... the dark side leads to death and destruction. I've seen the horrors the Sith have unleashed on the galaxy. Turn away from this path.;NM44ACEVIL01056_.mp3
Shut up, old man. Your time is over! The age of the Jedi and the Republic is no more! This is the age of Darth Revan and the Sith!;NM44ACEVIL01057_.mp3
Don't do this, kid. I don't want to, but I'll fight you if I have to. Even if it costs me my life.;NM44ACEVIL01058_.mp3
I am the Lord of the Sith! Bow down before me!;
A true Jedi will never bow down to the Sith. If this is your decision I have no choice but to do battle against you.;NM44ACEVIL01060_.mp3
Kill her! Rend her flesh! Show her the fate of all who dare stand against us! Embrace the power of the dark side!;NM44ACEVIL01061_.mp3
No, I will not kill my friend. I reject the power of the dark side.;
Death to the Jedi!;
Yes! The sacrificial blood will consecrate this ancient temple in the name of the Sith! With the death of the Jedi the rebirth of Darth Revan will be complete!;NM44ACEVIL01067_.mp3
I'm a Jedi... I'll never bow down to the Sith. If you go through with this I have no choice but to do battle against you.;NM44ACEVIL01064_.mp3
Kill him! Grind his old bones to dust! Show him the fate of all who dare stand against us! Embrace the dark side!;NM44ACEVIL01065_.mp3
Then you must die!;
You... you're right. I cannot do this. I reject the dark side!;
No! Do not walk down this path... it can only lead to destruction! I know of what I speak!;NM44ACEVIL01069_.mp3
Shut up, Juhani! You know nothing of the dark side's true potential! When you felt its touch you fled to a cave and cowered in terror!;NM44ACEVIL01070_.mp3
I have no wish to fight you and Bastila, but if you choose to walk down this path you know I must stand against you... even at the cost of my life.;NM44ACEVIL01071_.mp3
How do I know you won't betray me?;
I need deny my passions no longer, Revan. I would stand by your side gladly, as your lover and apprentice!;NM44ACEVIL01073_.mp3
I swore allegiance to Malak only because I thought you had lost the power you had once wielded. But this... this would be much better.;NM44ACEVIL01074_.mp3
I would be utterly yours, master! Together we would destroy Malak and you would reclaim the mantle of Dark Lord!;NM44ACEVIL01075_.mp3
No, I... don't want you like this. I want the woman I knew.;
Turn away from this path, Bastila. The dark side leads only to destruction.;
It's not to late for you, Bastila. The dark side is evil but it isn't all powerful. You can still fight against it. Don't let it consume you.;NM44ACEVIL01053_.mp3
You are beneath my contempt, old man! You hid like a coward for decades on Kashyyyk! You know nothing about the true potential of the Force!;NM44ACEVIL01054_.mp3
I don't trust you. I think I'll just kill you instead!;
No! This is the way of the dark side! Do not give in to the anger and hatred!;NM44ACEVIL01083_.mp3
No! Don't give into your anger. Remain calm, remain focused. Don't let her twist your mind like this!;NM44ACEVIL01080_.mp3
It is your power that will keep me as your loyal apprentice, Revan. I swore allegiance to Malak only because I thought you had lost the power you once wielded.;NM44ACEVIL01077_.mp3
"But you have proven yourself in our battle; I see you possess the strength to destroy Malak and reclaim the mantle of Dark Lord. Now I see you will make a worthy Sith Master.";NM44ACEVIL01078_.mp3
How can I reclaim my identity if I can't even remember it?;
No! This isn't the Bastila I knew!;
Of course not! I have been reborn in the wake of destiny... *your* destiny! The power of the dark side is yours by right!;NM44ACEVIL01086_.mp3
What are you saying, Bastila?;
If I am so powerful, then why do you serve another master?;
Then why don't we join our power together, as it was meant to be?;
There is no link between us, Bastila! Not anymore!;
Our bond is not easily broken, Revan. Even when your mind was destroyed and reprogrammed with a new identity the bond between us endured.;NM44ACEVIL01091_.mp3
We are linked by more than just a bond, Bastila.;
Do not mistake the power of the Force for love, Revan. It does not exist. Power is what forged our bond, and power is what made us both tools of the Jedi Council!;NM44ACEVIL01093_.mp3
Don't call me that. I'm not Revan anymore. I'm <FullName> now.;
Now you see the power of the true Dark Lord!;
"Yes, Revan! I was there when you almost died in the trap set by the Jedi Council; I used the Force to preserve your life. We are forever linked by my actions on that bridge.";NM44ACEVIL01096_.mp3
The Council tried to exploit our bond. They hoped your memories would lead me to the Star Forge. But in our shared visions of the Star Maps I also tasted the power of the taint within you!;NM44ACEVIL01097_.mp3

We have seen you, Interloper! You are a servant of the Elders. By order of the One you must die!;
Stay your weapons, Interloper. We are not here for battle or blood. We bring you an invitation from the One, Great Champion of the Rakata.;
Rakata? The One? What are you talking about?;
Wait a minute - you understood these creatures? Of course... you and Malak must have been here before. You...you probably learned their language back when you were Revan.;NM41AABLAC01002_.mp3
You have used strange magics and weapons to slaughter our raiding parties, Interloper. You have bathed in the blood of fierce Rakatan warriors.;
Your power and skill in battle has impressed the One. He wishes an audience with you: a great honor. Come with us now and we will take you to him.;
Who is the One? What's going on here?;
The One is the leader of our tribe, the Great Champion of the Rakata. He has feasted on the flesh of many foes. Come with us and we will take you to him now.;
Okay. Take me to the One.;
I'm not going anywhere with you.;
The will of the One cannot be denied, Interloper. You will come with us now to see our Champion, or our rancor war beasts will destroy you.;
I think I'll just kill you instead!;
Are you blind, Interloper? Our war beasts will crush you if you defy us! This is your last chance: come with us to see the One, or we will feast on your bones!;
You can't kill me! I'm invincible!;
Release the war beasts!;
Death is such a small impediment.;
[Force Persuade] I don't have to come with you.;
[Failure] You try to use your magic on us, Interloper? We are Rakata! You cannot bend us to your will like mindless beasts!;
Hold on a second - you understood these goggle-eyed freaks? You must have come to this planet and learned the language back before the Jedi messed up your mind. Back when you were still Revan.;NM41AABLAC01016_.mp3
Query: You are able to comprehend the speech patterns of these organics? You must have visited this planet and learned their language in your previous incarnation as Darth Revan.;NM41AABLAC01017_.mp3
Wait a minute - do you understand these creatures? You must have learned their language when you came here in search of the secrets of the Star Forge. Back when you were still Revan.;NM41AABLAC01018_.mp3
You understand these aliens? Of course... you must have come here and learned their languge in your search for the secrets of the Star Forge. Back when you were still Revan.;NM41AABLAC01019_.mp3
Whoa. Can you actually understand what these guys are saying? I guess you must have come here back when you were Revan, huh?;NM41AABLAC01020_.mp3
You can actually understand this strange speech? You must have come to this planet and learned their language when you were Revan.;
An invitation? What kind of invitation?;
You talked to old Rukil Wrinkle-Skin? My mommy says he's crazy! I have to stay away from him!;NM04AAOUTC13000_.mp3
Mommy says all the up-worlders is selfish and mean. But you look nice to me.;NM04AAOUTC13002_.mp3

Bastila, I was wondering something. How did those Vulkars manage to capture a famous Jedi like you? Were you knocked out when your escape pod crashed?;NGLOBEBANT00000_.mp3
No, I was conscious. But my Force powers were exhausted from using my Battle Meditation in the battle for the Endar Spire. Without my help you might never have gotten off the ship alive.;NGLOBEBANT00001_.mp3
Fair enough. But I've seen you Jedi in action. There's no way those thugs would have stood a chance against your lightsaber.;NGLOBEBANT00002_.mp3
My lightsaber was... misplaced. I couldn't find it after the crash. I looked *everywhere* in that pod. The Vulkars came and overwhelmed me even as I was searching for my weapon.;NGLOBEBANT00003_.mp3
Wait a minute, let me get this straight. You *lost* your lightsaber? Ha-ha! I mean, isn't that a violation of some kind of Jedi code or something?;NGLOBEBANT00004_.mp3
Of all the Jedi in the galaxy, why do we get one who's absent-minded?;
This is no laughing matter! During the crash my lightsaber must have... it must have fallen from my belt and rolled under my seat! The Vulkars probably found it there when they searched the wreckage.;NGLOBEBANT00008_.mp3
Hey, hey, hey, don't get mad. I'm sorry. It's just funny to think of a legendary Jedi losing her lightsaber. Take my advice: this is one detail you might want to keep out of the history texts.;NGLOBEBANT00009_.mp3
I hardly consider myself a legend, Carth. Though I will consider your advice when I relate these events to the Jedi Council. There is no need for them to know *every* detail of what transpired.;NGLOBEBANT00010_.mp3
Maybe losing lightsabers is a side-effect of her Battle Meditation.;
Leave her alone, Carth.;
Bastila, did you ever think about joining all the Jedi who were running off to follow Revan and Malak when they went to fight the Mandalorians?;NGLOBEBANT00011_.mp3
That was nearly five years ago. I was still an apprentice, my Battle Meditation hadn't even manifested itself. Yet even then I had the wisdom to obey the will of the Council. Unlike Revan.;NGLOBEBANT00012_.mp3
I guess. Still, do you ever wonder if things could have been different? Would Revan and Malak still have been corrupted if the Council had supported them instead of dragging its feet?;NGLOBEBANT00013_.mp3
Do not blame Revan's corruption on the Council! Your Republic saw only the threat of the Mandalorians, but the wisdom of the Masters saw beyond the immediate threat.;NGLOBEBANT00014_.mp3
What did they see, exactly?;
There was something lurking out there, something that devoured Revan and Malak - and many other Jedi. Had the Council sent us all into the unknown, how many more would have fallen?;NGLOBEBANT00016_.mp3
So you're saying we should have done nothing? Just let the Mandalorians conquer us unopposed? I mean, the Republic was under attack, and the Order abandoned us!;NGLOBEBANT00017_.mp3
We did not abandon you! But the Council were not about to throw lives away foolishly. In time, we would have aided you against the Mandalorians. But you couldn't wait.;NGLOBEBANT00018_.mp3
Revan and Malak offered a quicker answer, and the Republic chose to walk the easy path rather than the path of wisdom. Now we see the results all around us.;NGLOBEBANT00019_.mp3
You asked me if I think things could have been different? I *know* they could have! If Revan had only listened to the Council, millions of innocent people would still be alive.;NGLOBEBANT00020_.mp3
Yeah, right. And every single one of them would be speaking Mandalorain. I think we're done here. Let's just get back to the task at hand.;NGLOBEBANT00021_.mp3
Sounds like you're just making excuses, Bastila.;
Hey, Carth. You're a pilot for the Republic, right? You've been all over the galaxy I bet, right? So tell me, how would you rate Taris compared to other worlds you've seen?;NGLOBEBANT00023_.mp3
I'll be honest, Mission, Taris would rate pretty low. The prejudice, the rich spoiling themselves while the poor are crushed beneath them - not a pretty picture.;NGLOBEBANT00024_.mp3
Yeah, but that's only since the Sith occupation. Before that... well, I guess it wasn't all that different, really. Hmm... maybe Taris ain't as great as I thought, you know?;NGLOBEBANT00025_.mp3
Trust me, Mission. There are a lot of worlds better than Taris. There are worse, too. But Taris is no place for a kid to live on her own - even a kid who's got a Wookiee to look out for her.;NGLOBEBANT00026_.mp3
Hey, I ain't no kid! And I look out for Zaalbar as much as he looks out for me. Big Z's my friend, not my babysitter! Geez, I come ask you a question and you give me a lecture!;NGLOBEBANT00027_.mp3
Don't you snap at me, missy! You want a lecture? How's this: only bratty little children fly off the handle because of a simple comment.;NGLOBEBANT00028_.mp3
Settle down right now - both of you!;
I don't have to listen to you, Carth! You ain't my father - though you're sure old enough to be! So keep your lectures inside your withered old head, 'cause I don't need 'em!;NGLOBEBANT00031_.mp3
And I sure as hell don't need this. Let's just drop it and get back to what we were doing.;NGLOBEBANT00032_.mp3
You're not going to take that from him, are you Mission?;
Uh, hey Carth. Can I... can I talk to you for a second?;NGLOBEBANT00033_.mp3
Are you ready to have a civil chat? Or are is this going to be another childish tantrum?;NGLOBEBANT00034_.mp3
Tantrum? I'm trying to apologize, you nerf-herder! Uh... I mean... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to get mad at you. It's just that I'm sick of everyone treating me like I'm a helpless kid.;NGLOBEBANT00035_.mp3
Yeah, I know. And I'm sorry about what I said, too. I'm just a little on edge lately. Not surprising considering all we've been through. But I shouldn't take it out on you.;NGLOBEBANT00036_.mp3
It's about time you two made up.;
Mission, you have to know that we don't think you're helpless. Look where we are, look at what we're doing. You're not just along for the ride.  We need you.;NGLOBEBANT00038_.mp3
You really mean it, don't you? Nobody's ever said anything like that to me before, not even Big Z. He might think it, but he's not really one for words, you know. Thanks, Carth.;NGLOBEBANT00039_.mp3
Ah, it's no big deal. I know how it is. Sometimes you just need to hear a few words of encouragement. Kids are like that.;NGLOBEBANT00040_.mp3
Kids are like that?? Listen you... oh, I get it. Okay, you got me. You're pretty funny, Carth. For an old guy. Come on, you geezer - let's get back to what we were doing.;NGLOBEBANT00041_.mp3
What's with all the apologies? I was hoping for another fight!;
Carth, you fought in the Mandalorian Wars, didn't you? We may have faced each other in combat. What battles were you in?;NGLOBEBANT00043_.mp3
I try not to think about my past battles too much. The horrors of war are something I'd rather not relive.;NGLOBEBANT00044_.mp3
The horrors of war? My people know only the glory of battle. I'm disappointed in you, Carth. I thought a warrior like you would understand.;NGLOBEBANT00045_.mp3
Carth isn't like you, Canderous.;
I'm not a warrior, I'm a soldier. There's a difference. Warriors attack and conquer, they prey on the weak. Soldiers defend and protect the innocent - mostly from warriors.;NGLOBEBANT00048_.mp3
Nice speech. I bet you tell yourself that every night so you can sleep. But I accept who and what I am. I don't have to justify it with words - victory in battle is my justification!;NGLOBEBANT00049_.mp3
Justification through victory? So what happens when you lose? You know, like you did against us.;NGLOBEBANT00050_.mp3
You had us outnumbered five to one. You had more ships, more troops, more supplies and the Jedi on your side. And we still made the Republic tremble before we fell!;NGLOBEBANT00051_.mp3
Nice speech. I bet you tell yourself that every night so you can sleep. I don't want to talk about this anymore, Canderous. The war is over. You lost.;NGLOBEBANT00052_.mp3
Yeah, Carth. When did you get all peace-loving on me?;
Keep it cool, you two. I don't want this getting out of hand.;
So, Bastila, I heard a rumor that the Vulkars captured you without much of a struggle. It must be embarrassing to be bested by a handful of street thugs.;NGLOBEBANT00054_.mp3
There were extenuating circumstances. And I can assure you it took far more than a handful of Vulkars to subdue me.;NGLOBEBANT00055_.mp3
Okay, let's not get into this.;
Whatever you say. All I know is that if we had more Jedi like Bastila fighting against us in the Mandalorian Wars, my side might not have lost.;NGLOBEBANT00057_.mp3
Bold talk from a broken-down merceneray who was serving at Davik's heel. I'd call you his pet kath hound, but they have enough loyalty not to turn on their masters.;NGLOBEBANT00058_.mp3
Insults? Maybe if your Master had trained your lightsaber to be as quick as your tongue you could have escaped those Vulkars, you spoiled little Jedi princess!;NGLOBEBANT00059_.mp3
"I was not spoiled! I was given the same training as everyone else in the Order! You are nothing but a... no. I must not do this. There is no emotion; there is peace.";NGLOBEBANT00060_.mp3
That's the problem with you Jedi. Always chanting about peace and control, never up for a good fight. Well, except for Revan, I guess.;NGLOBEBANT00061_.mp3
Enough, Mandalorian. I won't rise to your bait any more. The game is over. Let us continue on with what we were doing.;NGLOBEBANT00062_.mp3
Yeah, I'm sure there were twenty of them. I mean, fifty... no, wait... a hundred!;
Hey, Big Z, we've got to do something about your breath.  I didn't want to say anything, but it's bad. Worse than usual, which is hard to believe.;NGLOBEBANT00064_.mp3
In fact, now that I think about it, your breath has been pretty rancid ever since we rescued you from those Gammorean slavers. What did they feed you, buddy?;NGLOBEBANT00065_.mp3
They didn't. I wasn't their guest, Mission. I was a prisoner. I don't think they cared much what happened to me.;
Oh, Zaalbar, that's terrible! I know how grouchy you get if you don't get your eight square meals a day. I'm amazed you didn't pass out from hunger.;NGLOBEBANT00067_.mp3
I did manage to take a chunk out of the arm of a guards that wandered too close to my cage. But it tasted awful, so I spit it out.;
Ewww! No wonder your breath is so bad, Big Z. Gammoreans smell like bantha poo-doo! We'll have to pick you up a toothbrush to clean that stench out of your choppers.;NGLOBEBANT00069_.mp3
Wookiees do not brush their teeth, Mission! It... it just isn't done! What humiliation will you use on me next? A comb?;
Okay, relax. No toothbrush. Sheesh. Just try to eat something else to cover up that smell, okay? Stay away from anything that's smart enough to lock you in a cage this time.;NGLOBEBANT00071_.mp3
*sigh* I'll take care of it as soon as I can, Mission. For now, let's stay focused on the task at hand.;
Hey, Big Z. Don't take this the wrong way, but lately I've noticed you're starting to look a little bit scruffy.;NGLOBEBANT00073_.mp3
Scruffy? What are you talking about? I hope you aren't suggesting I take a bath!;
No, I'm not suggesting a bath. I know how well that went over last time. But your hair's getting all tangled. And if you look close, you can see a few gray strands starting to poke through.;NGLOBEBANT00075_.mp3
You're making this up! I groom every day! My hair is not tangled, and it's not going gray!;
She's got a point, Zaalbar. You could use a good makeover.;
Don't worry, Big Z. It's nothing I can't fix. A little trim, a splash of coloring and you'll be as good as new. Best looking Wookiee on the planet. Maybe a nice suit...;NGLOBEBANT00079_.mp3
You don't trim a Wookiee! You don't color a Wookiee! And you certainly don't dress a Wookiee!;
I know Wookiees aren't into the whole clothing thing, but you could start a whole new trend! You'd be on the cutting edge.;NGLOBEBANT00081_.mp3
Rargh! Leave me alone!;
Okay, okay. Sheesh. Try to offer some constructive criticism and this is the thanks I get? Let's move on. You can just stay naked and scruffy for all I care.;NGLOBEBANT00083_.mp3
Zaalbar looks fine to me.;
Hey, Bastila. You ever just use the Force for fun? You know, a little jolt of the Force to trip some jerk who's ticking you off?;NGLOBEBANT00084_.mp3
I would never use the Force for such a petty and trivial revenge! The mere thought of it is preposterous!;NGLOBEBANT00085_.mp3
Ah, come on. There's got to be times when you've thought about it. Don't be so stuck up - you can tell me.;NGLOBEBANT00086_.mp3
I am not stuck up. I merely have the years of training to give me the wisdom and understanding to see how childish such an act would be.;NGLOBEBANT00087_.mp3
Childish? Is that a crack about my age? You ain't much older than me, miss high and mighty! Just 'cause you're some Jedi doesn't mean you can be a prissy little...;NGLOBEBANT00088_.mp3
What the -?? Hey, that wasn't funny!;NGLOBEBANT00089_.mp3
I have no idea what you're talking about, Mission. Come now, we have to get going. Please do try to be less clumsy in the future.;NGLOBEBANT00090_.mp3
Jolee, may I have a moment? There is something I wish to speak to you about.;NGLOBEBANT00091_.mp3
"Yep, I figured it was only a matter of time until we had the whole ""come back to the Order"" discussion. Well, I guess there's no avoiding it now, so let's get it over with.";NGLOBEBANT00092_.mp3
I know you have... issues... with the Order. But you are a Jedi, Jolee. You command the Force. Without the guidance of the Council how can you avoid falling to the dark side?;NGLOBEBANT00093_.mp3
Well, I've managed to avoid it the last 20 years or so. Besides, light side, dark side: they don't mean the same to me as they do to you. I don't see in absolutes.;NGLOBEBANT00094_.mp3
Malak and the Sith are evil, Jolee! Surely you can see that.;
I want to stop Malak as much as anyone. But I don't have to join the Order to do it. Look at Carth, or Canderous. They're with us in this quest, but they aren't Jedi.;NGLOBEBANT00097_.mp3
The capacity for good or evil, like the Force itself, is in all living creatures. And belonging to the Jedi Order, or the Sith, or any group, won't change what you are at your core.;NGLOBEBANT00098_.mp3
I see you are quite adamant. No doubt you've had ample time to think on this during your long seclusion. I guess it was foolish of me to think I could sway your position so easily.;NGLOBEBANT00099_.mp3
Yeah, I'm old and stubborn. But I appreciate the effort. But from now on you can just think of me as any other non-Jedi in our little group - with a lightsaber. And Force powers.;NGLOBEBANT00100_.mp3
So you don't have a problem with Malak and the Sith?;
Of course! Malak isn't evil, he's just misunderstood!;
So, Jolee, you decided to leave your little hermitage in the forest and come help us stop the Sith. I guess you realized this was worth coming out of retirement for, huh?;NGLOBEBANT00102_.mp3
Yeah, that's right, sonny. The Sith are the greatest evil to hit the galaxy since, well, the Mandalorians. And they're the worst thing since Exar Kun. Blah, blah, blah, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.;NGLOBEBANT00103_.mp3
Okay, old man, you lost me there. Are you trying to make a point?;NGLOBEBANT00104_.mp3
Look, everybody always figures the time they live in is the most epic, most important age to end all ages. But tyrants and heroes rise and fall, and historians sort out the pieces.;NGLOBEBANT00105_.mp3
Are you saying what we're doing isn't important?;
Malak is a tyrant who should be stopped. If he conquers the galaxy we're in for a couple of rough centuries. Eventually it'll come around again, but I'd rather not wait that long.;NGLOBEBANT00107_.mp3
So we do what we have to do, and we try to stop the Sith. But don't start thinking this war - your war - is more important than any other war just because you're in it.;NGLOBEBANT00108_.mp3
"That's an interesting theory, but I don't buy it. The Republic stands for something; it's stood for something for fifteen thousand years. And if it falls, everything will change forever.";NGLOBEBANT00109_.mp3
You believe whatever you need to to get you through this, sonny. The bottom line is we both want to stop Malak, so let's not get hung up on the details. Let's just get back to stopping him.;NGLOBEBANT00110_.mp3
If you feel that way, why did you come with us?;
I think it's pretty clear that Malak is the tyrant in this case.;

Thank you, outsider. You are... like I thought Rorworr was. Please, leave me. I want to be alone for a bit.;
I still thank you... I just need some time to think about things.;
You? Why are you here? Haven't you done enough? Jaarak is dead and Rorworr is dead and... and...;
Just leave me alone. I don't want to talk to anyone.;
I don't understand what is going on... but I'm not listening to anything you have to say, outsider. You're trying to confuse me.;
Jaarak will... explain what he has said. I know he will. You don't know anything, and I won't listen to you.;
I've... I've never spoken to an outsider. I mean, Chuundar makes us learn to understand you, but I've never been this close to one of you.;
We're rather hairless, aren't we?;NM23ABWOOR02011_.mp3
What are you doing here? Have you come to laugh at us? Come to gloat about how many of us you take? Can you even understand me?;
I'm <FullName>. I helped Freyyr return to power. I'm a friend.;
I don't know about that. I hear lots of things and I'm not sure what to think anymore.;
Can I ask you some questions?;
Oh, please don't. I haven't been paying attention to anything since Rorworr went missing. Do you know anything about that?;
I hope not. I hope you slavers didn't get him. N-not that you're a slaver. I'm sorry. I'm very tired. I haven't slept much lately.;
Who was Rorworr?;
Rorworr? Oh, he's the greatest! He's led hunting parties to the Shadowlands, and even fought outsiders! Slavers... like you probably are.;
He's taught me a lot. He said I could grow up as strong as him, that I'd fight you too. I will, too. I will.;
When did Rorworr go missing?;
Stop bothering the boy, outsider! he doesn't need you taunting him.;
But what if they know something? Maybe they could help?;
An outsider? Help? Look around you, Woorwill. Outsiders do nothing but steal and lie and taint the best among us!;
Outsider, you talk to me if you must bother us at all. Leave him alone.;
Go over who Rorworr was again.;
Do you know whose bolt casing this is?;
What? Uh, sure, it looks like... like Jaarak's. I think so, anyway. I'm not sure.;
This bolt casing was found on Rorworr's body.;
On... Rorworr's body? Then... then he's dead? But he can't be!;
Don't listen to him, Woorwill. Outsiders only lie when their mouths are open, you know that.;
Rorworr was dealing with slavers. Do you know anything about this?;
No he doesn't! You don't say another thing to him! You want to lie, you lie to me, outsider!;
I think I begin to see what has occurred here. We should speak to Jarak at once.;NM23ABWOOR02048_.mp3
Leave... leave the boy alone. Please. You will want to talk to me.;
What do you have to say about it?;
Speak with me directly, away from the boy. Please.;
I want to go over this with Woorwill again.;
I'm not sure that I should have said anything to you in the first place.;
I found Jaarak's bolts on Rorworr's body.;
Goodbye.;
Goodbye, I guess.;
Very well. I will speak with you, Jarak. Goodbye, Woorwill.;
You will listen when I talk! I speak the truth!;
Like I said before, Woorwill, don't believe what they say. Trust your own kind.;
You'd better be sure, fool. I found it on your hero's corpse.;
And you can't tell me when Rorworr went missing?;
I'm <FullName>. I'm here with Chuundar's permission.;
I understand you. I'm not here as a slaver.;
Then why are you here?;
Warning: And get no closer, hairy organic! I will protect the master from your barbaric ways, I warn you!;NM23ABWOOR02013_.mp3
You're back again? Have you seen... no, you wouldn't tell me. You wouldn't care.;
Leave the boy alone. Please.;
I go where I want. You'll do as I say.;
"Just like any other outsider; Half mad and no honor.";
Quiet you, I'm talking to this one.;

Revan! You have defiled the temple by bringing others in with you!;
The One has decreed that you are to be destroyed for your transgression!;
Well done, Revan. I was certain the defenses of the Star Forge would destroy you, but I see there is more of your old self in you than I expected.;NM45AADART04043_.mp3
"You are stronger than I thought; stronger than you ever were during your reign as the Dark Lord. I did not think that was possible.";NM45AADART04044_.mp3
The light side is stronger than you know, Malak.;
I am tempted to try and capture you alive, Revan. Then I could break your will and bind you to me as my apprentice, as I did Bastila.;NM45AADART04046_.mp3
You would be a far greater asset to me than even Bastila and her Battle Meditation, if I could control you. But is it worth the risk?;NM45AADART04047_.mp3
"Perhaps you are too powerful to be my apprentice. I betrayed you when I realized my own strength was greater than yours; in time you might try to do the same to me.";NM45AADART04048_.mp3
I will never serve the dark side again, Malak!;
Foolish words. The darkness and the light wage a constant war within you. The balance is tipped one way now, but it can easily be tipped back.;NM45AADART04050_.mp3
Savior, conqueror, hero, villain. You are all things Revan... and yet you are nothing. In the end you belong to neither the light nor the darkness. You will forever stand alone.;NM45AADART04051_.mp3
I believe in the power of redemption.;
"Of course. What else do you have? Fate and destiny have conspired to keep you alive despite my best efforts; they have thrust you into the role of savior.";NM45AADART04053_.mp3
We have been inexorably pushed to this final confrontation, Revan. I see now that this can only be settled when one of us destroys the other.;NM45AADART04065_.mp3
Once again we shall face each other in single combat... and the victor will decide the fate of the galaxy!;NM45AADART04068_.mp3
You're still making the mistake of underestimating me, Malak.;
I cannot deny your resilience. You survived my first betrayal, thanks to Bastila's inteference. You escaped the destruction of Taris and you escaped me on the Leviathan.;NM45AADART04063_.mp3
You even survived my attempt to destroy you with the Star Forge itself. Fate and destiny have conspired to keep you alive despite all my efforts.;NM45AADART04064_.mp3
This is your last chance, Malak. Surrender.;
No, Revan, this time our confrontation can only end in death... yours or mine.;NM45AADART04067_.mp3
Enough words! Now we end this!;
You are eager for blood, Revan... as am I. Very well, you shall have your wish.;NM45AADART04070_.mp3
I was always stronger than you, Malak! That was why I was the Master!;
Once you were stronger than me, Revan. But as your apprentice I surpassed you. The Master must always be stronger than the apprentice... that was why I betrayed you.;NM45AADART04056_.mp3
You betrayed me from afar. You were afraid to face me, Malak.;
No! I was prepared to face you, Revan. But fate presented me with a better option. I saw my opportunity and seized it.;NM45AADART04058_.mp3
The trap set by the Jedi only hastened my decision. If they had not attacked I would have challenged you for mastery of the Sith soon enough.;NM45AADART04059_.mp3
You knew I was stronger than you. You still know it.;
You underestimated me back then... you still do.;
I would have killed you then... and I'm going to kill you now!;
Im... [cough] impossible. I... I cannot be beaten. I am the Dark Lord of the Sith.;NM45AADART04014_.mp3
No, Malak. I am the true Sith Master!;
Yes... I cannot deny it any longer. [cough] You are the one who deserves... who deserves to be the Dark Lord.;NM45AADART04016_.mp3
You were the one who found the first Star Map on Dantooine, Revan. [cough] It was you who lead us on our quest for the Star Forge. I only followed in your wake.;NM45AADART04017_.mp3
I tried to usurp your rule, to steal the title of Sith Master from you. But now I understand... The destiny is yours, Revan. Not mine.;NM45AADART04018_.mp3
You... you are Darth Revan, Lord ... [cough] Lord of the Sith. And I... I am nothing.;NM45AADART04019_.mp3
The apprentice has learned his final lesson.;
And so it ends as I somehow always knew it must: in darkness.;NM45AADART04021_.mp3
You should have known you could never defeat me, Malak!;
The Star Forge is mine now, Malak!;
This is the way of the dark side, Malak: all things end in death.;
Still... [cough] still spouting the wisdom the Jedi, I see. Maybe there is more truth in their code than I ever believed.;NM45AADART04025_.mp3
I... I cannot help but wonder, Revan. What would have happened had our positions been reversed? What if fate had decreed I would be captured by the Jedi?;NM45AADART04026_.mp3
Could I have returned to the light, as you did? [cough] If you had not led me down the dark path in the first place, what destiny would I have found?;NM45AADART04027_.mp3
You cannot blame me for the path you chose.;
I suppose... I suppose you speak the truth. I alone must accept responsibility for my fate. I wanted to be Master of the Sith and ruler of the galaxy.;NM45AADART04029_.mp3
But that destiny was not mine, Revan. [cough] It might have been yours, perhaps... but never mine. And in the end, as the darkness takes me, I am nothing.;NM45AADART04030_.mp3
I am sorry I started you on this path. But you chose to continue down it.;
The power of the light will always be stronger than the dark side.;
You continue to amaze me, Revan. If only you had been the one to uncover the true power of the Star Forge you might have become truly invincible.;NM45AADART04033_.mp3
But you were a fool. All you saw was an enormous factory, all you ever imagined was an infinite fleet rolling forth to crush the Republic. You were blind, Revan - blind and stupid!;NM45AADART04034_.mp3
What are you talking about?;
The Star Forge is more than just a space station. In some ways, it is like a living creature. It hungers. And it can feed on the dark side that is within all of us!;NM45AADART04036_.mp3
Look around you, Revan. See the bodies? You should recognize them from the Academy. These are Jedi who fell when I attacked Dantooine. For all intents and purposes dead, except for one difference:;NM45AADART04037_.mp3
I have not let them become one with the Force. Instead I have brought them here. The Star Forge corrupts what remains of their power and transfers the dark taint to me!;NM45AADART04038_.mp3
You cannot beat me, Revan. Not here on the Star Forge. Not when I can draw upon the power of all these Jedi!;NM45AADART04040_.mp3
And once you are beaten I will do the same to you. You will be trapped in a terrible existence between life and death, your power feeding me as I conquer the galaxy!;NM45AADART04041_.mp3

I have to give you credit... you've led me on quite a chase. But nobody gets away from Calo Nord in the end!;NGLOBECALO02000_.mp3
I see you brought some back up, Calo. Realized we were a bit much to handle on your own, eh?;NGLOBECALO02002_.mp3
"You got lucky on Taris; the Sith attack saved you from a quick and gruesome death. But I promise you, the Sith won't be getting in my way this time!";NGLOBECALO02004_.mp3
How did you get down here?;
"You underestimate me; there's other ways down here besides the Republic subs. A small vessel with the right weapons can blast a path right through those firaxian sharks.";NGLOBECALO02006_.mp3
Once I got down to the ocean floor all I had to do was come here and wait. I knew you'd come back this way eventually.;NGLOBECALO02008_.mp3
Hold on, Calo... maybe we can work out a deal here.;
Sorry, I'm not in this for the credits. You're the only ones who've ever gotten away from me - I've got a rep to protect!;NGLOBECALO02010_.mp3
Let's go, boys... it's show time!;NGLOBECALO02013_.mp3
You think I got lucky last time? Okay, let's do it again!;
You traveled a long way just to die, Calo!;

At last, my search is over! I was beginning to fear someone else had killed you and deprived me of the pleasure.;NGLOBEBAND01000_.mp3
You may have defeated the pathetic bounty hunter my Master sent after you, but you are no match for me! I have studied at the foot of the Dark Lord himself!;NGLOBEBAND01002_.mp3
How did you get down here?;
Do you think those Republic subs are the only way to reach the ocean floor? Malak and Revan found a way down here long before the Hrakert station was built.;NGLOBEBAND01004_.mp3
I acquired a ship and followed the same route Revan and my Master used on their own journey. Then it was simply a matter of waiting for you to return for the Star Map.;NGLOBEBAND01006_.mp3
You're Malak's apprentice? Can't say I'm impressed.;
Your words mean nothing to me... unless you wish to beg for your life. No? Then I shall try to make this both quick and painful!;NGLOBEBAND01008_.mp3
When will Malak learn? I'll kill you just like I killed Calo Nord!;
You're a fool if you think you can defeat me.;
You were on the Endar Spire! You killed Trask. You'll pay for that!;
[This door is sealed with an ancient mechanism.];
No offence, but I could have done better than you on that last race. As a true fan, I know how to do these things right.;
You didn't look too good out there on that last run. I guess everyone has their bad days.;
You sure you're cut out for this league of racing? Maybe the stress of it is getting to you.;
I don't believe it! Who'd have thought Queedle had it in him?;
A new Champion! And it's Queedle! I knew he could do it with a decent swoop under him.;
How about that? Queedle, a local racer, showing those pros how it's done!;
I cheer for Queedle now that he's winning. It would take an amazing racer to win me away.;
You here to cheer Casandra? She's a fine racer. I hope she knocks Hukta out of the running.;
Hukta Jax is insane. He just smashes through everything to the finish. I guess we should expect that from a Gamorrean?;
We need more rules about overpowered bikes. Hukta just rides over everything. It's boring watching him.;
Queedle is the local favorite. You should cheer along with us. He needs the encouragement.;
You're pretty good. Maybe I should start putting some credits on your races.;
I guess you've got what it takes to advance. The odds against you winning are getting better.;
The second round always has experienced riders. You'll be up against some tough times.;
You're up against the second round times now. That's a hard round to beat.;
Some of the racers are having a bad time here on Manaan. Seems like you have all the luck right now.;
Some of the other fans didn't think you could reach the second round, but I knew you would all along.;
Are you sure you're up to challenging the third round time? I mean, you're good, but are you that good?;
I'm putting all my credits on you. You're a sure thing.;
Whew, that was an exciting time you turned in. Noboby else had a chance.;
Good race, Sector Champion. I guess you'll be off to the big tracks, once the circuit is back up.;
Wow, I bet you could have won on Taris with times like that. It's a shame we'll never know.;
Could I get an autoprint? You've just had the quickest rise to Sector Champion that I've ever seen.;
Raargh!;

Ha-ha! Mmm... Wife and children. Sounds like a good idea...;NM14ABCUT002002_.mp3
This morning's getting stranger by the minute. First Bastila comes out looking like she saw a ghost, and now you.;NM13AACART02004_.mp3
Well, Bastila did mention that you should go to the Council chambers before she left. It is no doubt urgent, so you shouldn't keep them waiting.;NM13AACART02006_.mp3
Did she say anything else?;
No, she didn't. She didn't seem well, as I recall... and for that matter neither do you. Are you alright?;NM13AACART02008_.mp3

They're waiting for you inside.;NM13AACART02016_.mp3
But if they can do that, the whole system could...;
Silence! This is not for outsiders to hear!;
Well, human, you find yourself in a most difficult situation. The Hrakert Rift is the most precious resource on Manaan, and anything that threatens it or the kolto it produces threatens our entire species.;
We will not tolerate threats to our neutrality, our existence, and our way of life!;
As much as we may admire your Republic and your Order in particular, I believe you will have a hard time explaining your role in this incident adequately.;
We have determined that you are responsible for the detonations that occurred near the Hrakert Rift. We demand to know what occurred down there!;
If the Republic has broken its neutrality treaty with us, the reprecussions shall be very grave indeed!;
What have you done to the Rift?;
[Force Persuade] Nothing happened down at the Rift.;
[Failure] Do not try to manipulate us with your powers, human! You have only one chance left to tell us the truth!;
[Force Persuade] I am telling the truth.;
Enough of these lies!;
For your crimes against Manaan and the Selkath you are banned forever from this world, on pain of death!;
You can't do this!;
It is our duty to punish those who transgress our laws. We can do this... and we will!;
Guard! Eject the prisoner from the court!;
You won't get away with this!;
We can and we will. Your Republic will not risk offending us. Not with the Sith as powerful as they are.;
But I've done nothing wrong!;
Do not mock us, human!;
You have been found guilty, proving that you actually are.;
If you knew who you were dealing with...;
You are an off-worlder, like any other. Only more troublesome than most...;
[Lie] The Sith were trying to collapse the Hrakert Rift!;
[Success] The Sith were down at the Rift?!;
But how could the Sith have been there when we had...;
What?;
When we... we monitor the Rift constantly. How could the Sith have approached it without us knowing?;
[Lie] They had built a station down there already.;
[Success] I find that highly unlikely... How could we have missed such a large undertaking?;
Impossible! Our own sta...;
Our what?;
It is impossible... that's all...;
[Lie] Maybe they have some sort of stealth field.;
[Success] That they could smuggle onto Manaan without our knowing about it? Impossible!;
You fail to realize that if they had such a stealth field, we would not be able to detect them bringing it either.;
But that area is closely monitored... We would have detected any new vessels approaching it just by perturbations in the currents.;
[Lie] Maybe some Selkath were helping them.;
[Success] Some... Selkath?;
Selkath would not be helping off-worlders to disrupt our most valuable resources!;
They have already attempted to seduce our young away from us... Who's to say they hadn't corrupted someone else?;
Have you seen this, human? Is this how you know of it?;
There were many Selkath down there.;
This we know. What happened there, off-worlder?;
We know??;
Silence. It will be discussed later.;
Well, human? What REALLY occurred down there?;
[Lie] It was the Sith. They tried to blow it all up.;
[Failure] Your lies only make the hole you dig yourself deeper, human!;
It is likely that you have sabotaged our efforts AND the facilities at the Hrakert Rift. For this you must pay the price.;
How do we know this? What have you been hiding from us? What facilities??;
It is not an issue to be discussed among outsiders.;
No! I demand answers! What has been happening down there?;
Our agreement with the Republic to research and synthesize kolto has nearly borne us disaster. That is all you need to know.;
The Republic... Why were we not informed?;
It was not necessary for you to know. Now keep your silence!;
[Lie] I really don't know exactly.;
I've been lying... It wasn't really the Sith.;
What?;
I knew it! It was the Republic, wasn't it!;
The explosions were at the research station both our governments set up there.;
Research Station?! What are you talking about? Dont try to lie to us, human!;
We know of this.;
What?!;
It will be discussed later.;
This cannot be kept silent! The Council will...;
The Council will hear nothing of this! And you will keep your silence or be ejected from the court!;
But we cannot...;
Silence!;
What has happened at the research station? What caused the explosions?;
The machinery had woken up a giant firaxan shark.;
A giant firaxan? Could it be...;
Impossible! It is only a legend.;
But he said he killed it... didn't he?;
You killed this shark, human?;
I didn't kill the shark!;
The Progenitor... it must have been!;
Be quiet! That is merely a myth, and not fit for outsiders to hear!;
But if it was the life-bringer... the ancestor of our species... Think of what this could mean!;
If it always laired there... then perhaps the kolto...;
Enough! Off-worlders are not to hear of such things!;
But he said he saved it... He destroyed the harvesters to save it.;
Indeed. This casts your actions in a new light, human.;
This, I believe, will require more thought... both on your actions, and on what we must do in response.;
This court will adjourn while we deliberate.;
We have reviewed your actions and the situation, human.;
We thank you for the destruction of the machinery and saving the giant firaxan which, we believe, is the source of our kolto... or at least its guardian.;
We will not detain you any longer. While we cannot show our gratitude overtly, know that you have earned our respect.;
This trial is now over.;
But she said she saved it... She destroyed the harvesters to save it.;
I destroyed the machinery to save it.;
The machine was making it drive everyone mad.;
But she said she killed it... didn't she?;
The entire station had been driven mad.;
Mad? I find that hard to believe, human.;
We did receive those transmission just before the station went silent...;
Ask the human what happened!;
Well, human? What drove all the sentients down there mad?;
A giant firaxan shark was woken up by the harvester.;
And you destroyed the harvester to kill a giant firaxan...;
Only the Selkath went mad.;
You accuse us of being to blame for this?;
Calm yourself. We are more advanced than that.;
Why do you say that only we Selkath went mad?;
A giant firaxan shark sent out some sort of psychic call.;
The explosion... to kill a giant firaxan?;
Because they were all insane and had eaten everyone else...;
But why? If the entire station was driven mad, as would seem to be the case, surely there must have been some evidence that something had transpired down there. What was it?;
[Lie] I have no idea.;
[Success] Bah! This humans information is worthless! We have lost the facility on the bottom of the ocean. Our efforts will be exposed!;
If the entire station was driven mad, as would seem to be the case, surely there must have been some evidence that something had transpired down there. What was it?;
[Lie] The station was empty.;
[Failure] We do not believe you, human! Tell us what you know or you will not leave here alive!;
[Lie] I really don't know anything.;
You couldn't kill me if you tried!;
We should kill him now! Before anyone knows!;
No, there are others who would notice his absence and begin asking... difficult questions.;
We cannot ban the Republic for its actions, the Sith would gain too much, but we cannot let you go unpunished.;
We should kill her now! Before anyone knows!;
No, there are others who would notice her absence and begin asking... difficult questions.;
They killed the scientists and the rescue teams the Republic sent down.;
[Lie] The harvesting machine malfunctioned and exploded.;
Malfunctioned?;
Impossible! That machinery was constructed by us to last a thousand years!;
Even if it did malfunction, the Hydrolium pressure would not have caused an explosion... unless it was deliberately set.;
What happened to the machinery, human? We will not accept excuses any longer!;
I rigged it to destroy itself.;
You... YOU destroyed the machinery?!;
You have ruined our efforts! All our work to synthesize kolto is worthless now!;
Why did you do this... this thing, human?;
I had no choice... but I can offer the data the Republic gained as compensation.;
A paltry appeasement! I say we should kill this human for the impudence he has shown us, and the destruction of our station!;
No. If we are rash, then we may never get the information we need to synthesize kolto.;
This would seem to be a necessary evil...;
We agree, human. In return for this data, we shall not execute you. But you cannot go unpunished.;
We will allow the Republic to remain on this world, but you must answer for your own actions.;
A paltry appeasement! I say we should kill this human for the impudence she has shown us, and the destruction of our station!;
[Lie] I never actually saw...;
[Failure] Enough of these games, human!;
We know about the station and our personnel there! What has happened to them?;
Our what??;
[Lie] I don't know... It was crawling with Sith.;
Foreign... interests have been known to influence individuals before...;
The flow of pure kolto has stopped coming up from the ocean floor. Your submersible arose at approximately the same time this occured. We have deemed you responsible!;

I have to give you credit... you've led me on quite a chase. But nobody gets away from Calo Nord in the end!;NGLOBECALO02000_.mp3
I see you brought some back up, Calo. Realized we were a bit much to handle on your own, eh?;NGLOBECALO02002_.mp3
"You got lucky on Taris; the Sith attack saved you from a quick and gruesome death. But I promise you, the Sith won't be getting in my way this time!";NGLOBECALO02004_.mp3
How did you get down here?;
"You underestimate me; there's other ways down here besides the Republic subs. A small vessel with the right weapons can blast a path right through those firaxian sharks.";NGLOBECALO02006_.mp3
Once I got down to the ocean floor all I had to do was come here and wait. I knew you'd come back this way eventually.;NGLOBECALO02008_.mp3
Hold on, Calo... maybe we can work out a deal here.;
Sorry, I'm not in this for the credits. You're the only ones who've ever gotten away from me - I've got a rep to protect!;NGLOBECALO02010_.mp3
Let's go, boys... it's show time!;NGLOBECALO02013_.mp3
You think I got lucky last time? Okay, let's do it again!;
You traveled a long way just to die, Calo!;

The Republic Fleet must have got the message Carth sent as we were crashing onto that planet. Maybe we can use their arrival to our advantage.;NM12AAC06001000_.mp3
If Malak is distracted by the attack, we should be able to get in close enough to dock on the Star Forge and hunt the Dark Lord down!;NM12AAC06001001_.mp3
This is Admiral Forn Dodonna to the Ebon Hawk, do you read us?;NM12AAC06001002_.mp3
Admiral Dodonna, this is Bastila Shan of the Jedi Order.  We are receiving your transmission.;NM12AAC06001003_.mp3
It is good to hear your voice Bastila.  We had thought you were lost to us.  Carth's transmission reported that Malak had taken you prisoner.;NM12AAC06001004_.mp3
The Jedi sent to rescue me from the Dark Lord did their job well - though I am sorry to report Carth did not survive the mission.;NM12AAC06001005_.mp3
His loss is a great blow to the Republic.  We could have used him in this battle.;NM12AAC06001006_.mp3
We were about to pull back.;NM12AAC06001007_.mp3
We're taking heavy losses against the Star Forge.;NM12AAC06001008_.mp3
Don't pull back, Admiral.  You have to attack the Star Forge now, otherwise the Sith will use its power to destroy the Republic.;NM12AAC06001009_.mp3
I'll try to press the attack but we can't hold out much longer.  Not unless you can use your Battle Meditation to turn the tide.;NM12AAC06001010_.mp3
This is Master Vandar.  A number of Jedi Knights have joined the fleet, under his command.;NM12AAC06001011_.mp3
Bastila's power could help you win this battle, Admiral, but it will mean nothing if Malak escapes.  Destroying the Star Forge is secondary to stopping the Sith threat once and for all.;NM12AAC06001012_.mp3
What are you proposing?;NM12AAC06001013_.mp3
A small squadron of Jedi Knights in snub fighters could penetrate the Sith blockade and dock on the space station.  If they can find Malak we can end the threat of the Sith ## ...forever.;NM12AAC06001014_.mp3
I'll order the fleet to press the attack and provide some cover for your fighters.  But what of Bastila and her Battle Meditation?;NM12AAC06001016_.mp3
Bastila, you and... the Padawan... should join us.  We will need the combined strength of our entire Order to defeat Malak.;NM12AAC06001017_.mp3
As you wish, Master Vandar.;NM12AAC06001018_.mp3
And may the Force be with you.;NM12AAC06001019_.mp3
The fools!  Even Master Vandar did not realize you have reclaimed your identity as the Dark Lord! ## The Jedi strike team and the Republic forces will provide the perfect distraction as we hunt down your ex-apprentice.  And once we have slain Malak, I can use my Battle Meditation ## and the power of the Star Forge to crush the Republic fleet.;NM12AAC06001020_.mp3
All our enemies will be destroyed in a single glorious day!;NM12AAC06001021_.mp3

Beep. Whoop. Weep. Beep.;
What? Our stowaway is gone?;
Boop. Beep. Zzzott. Whirr.;
Why would she just leave?;
Whoop. Boop. Beep. Fritz.;
You think she left because she sensed we were heading for trouble? That's a cheery thought.;
Whirr. Click. Beep. Boop.;
You're right. We'll probably never see her again.;
Good. I'm glad she's gone.;
What do you mean by gone? Where did she go?;
Master, why have you summoned me? Without my Battle Meditation there is a chance the Republic capital ships could break through and attack the Star Forge itself!;NM45AALIGH01000_.mp3
This will not take long, Bastila. You will be able to resume your Battle Meditation soon enough. I only wanted you to know that Revan is here on the Star Forge.;NM45AALIGH01001_.mp3
Revan? But...;NM45AALIGH01002_.mp3
The Force is bringing us towards a confrontation with my old master. The Star Forge has drawn our enemies together so they may all die in a single, glorious day!;NM45AALIGH01003_.mp3
You must kill Revan to prove yourself worthy of being my apprentice, Bastila. You must finish what began in the Rakatan Temple.;NM45AALIGH01004_.mp3
Y-yes, Lord Malak.;NM45AALIGH01005_.mp3
I sense your fear, Bastila. But it is unfounded. The power of the Star Forge will feed the dark side within you, it will give you the strength you need to defeat my old master.;NM45AALIGH01006_.mp3
Stay here in the command center while you use your Battle Meditation against the Republic fleet. Revan will find you here in due time. It is inevitable.;NM45AALIGH01007_.mp3
Of course, Master. I will not fail you again.;NM45AALIGH01008_.mp3
Perhaps you will triumph, Bastila. But even if you fail it will give me the time I need to complete my preparations of the station's defenses.;NM45AALIGH01009_.mp3
And then we shall see if Revan can stand against the full fury of the Star Forge! Ha-ha-ha!;NM45AALIGH01010_.mp3
Where is Bastila? What happened on the ship?;NM40ADCART01000_.mp3
We ran into Malak. He would have killed us, but Bastila sacrificed herself so we could get away.;NM40ADCART01001_.mp3
You mean she's... she's dead?;NM40ADCART01002_.mp3
Bah. Malak won't kill her, don't be foolish. He'll want to use her battle meditation against the Republic. Turn her to the dark side and the Sith will always be victorious.;NM40ADCART01003_.mp3
We have to go back for Bastila!;
Not so fast. I need to know if what Malak said about you is true or not, first. You aren't... you *can't* be, can you?;NM40ADCART01005_.mp3
I don't care what Malak said! I'm not Darth Revan, I'm <FullName>.;
Revan? What... what are you talking about? Is this some kind of joke?;NM40ADCART01011_.mp3
No, it's no joke. The Jedi Council captured Revan and erased the Dark Lord's mind, programming in a new identity. Saul Karath told me on the Leviathan and Bastila confirmed it!;NM40ADCART01012_.mp3
You're Darth Revan? This is... this is big. Do you... do you remember anything about being the Dark Lord?;NM40ADCART01013_.mp3
Small bits. A few strange dreams and visions. That's all.;
Just a few flashes? That's it? Nothing more? Then I don't think there's a problem.;NM40ADCART01015_.mp3
It seems to me that if you don't really remember anything about being Revan, then it doesn't really matter anymore. You are who you are now, right?;NM40ADCART01016_.mp3
Of course it still matters! How do we know more memories won't come flooding back? How do we know Revan won't suddenly turn on us?;NM40ADCART01017_.mp3
I've been such a fool! I... I swore to protect you! And here you were the enemy all this time!;NM40ADCART01018_.mp3
I'm not your enemy, Carth, I swear!;
But... you're the one responsible for the death of my wife, the destruction of my home world! You destroyed my life!;NM40ADCART01020_.mp3
How could I have been such a fool! How could I have not known?! How could you betray me like this?!;NM40ADCART01021_.mp3
I didn't know I was Revan! How could I have known?!;
You should have known. I...*sigh* I should have figured it out. I just can't... was, was everything a lie, then? Everything we talked about?;NM40ADCART01023_.mp3
Everything that was important was real, Carth.;
Are you sure? I'm not sure what to believe any more. Who's to say that your old life won't come back... all of it?;NM40ADCART01025_.mp3
Was the woman we knew Revan or... or someone else? Will you change into Revan? How...how can any of us trust you?;NM40ADCART01030_.mp3
Well, I trust you! I know you... and you're not Revan anymore. Whatever you used to be, you're one of us now!;NM40ADCART01031_.mp3
I agree with Mission. I swore a life-debt to the person you are, not to the person you were.;
"Big Z and I will stick by you. We owe you our lives; we won't desert you now!";NM40ADCART01050_.mp3
I don't know if I can get over it that easily, Mission. I mean... after all Revan did... how could any of us forgive her?;NM40ADCART01051_.mp3
It was Saul Karath who commanded the fleet that attacked your people, Carth. And it was Malak who gave the order. You know this.;NM40ADCART01053_.mp3
"I have felt the presence of the dark side in you, Revan - as it is in all of us. I know the dangers of that path; yet I also know the fallen can be redeemed.";NM40ADCART01054_.mp3
I judge you by your actions, and as long as we have been together I have seen you act as a servant of the light.;NM40ADCART01055_.mp3
What about you, Jolee?;
What about me? I already knew who you were, though it wasn't my place to tell you. Better off that you know, if you ask me.;NM40ADCART01057_.mp3
Does it change anything? I'm not here to judge you. You'll do what you have to, and I'll help if I can.;NM40ADCART01058_.mp3
What do you think, Canderous?;
You defeated the Mandalore clans in the war, Revan. You were the only one in the galaxy who could best us.;NM40ADCART01060_.mp3
We had never met one like you before, and never since. How can you even ask if I will follow you?;NM40ADCART01061_.mp3
Whatever you are fighting, it will be worthy of my skill. I'm your man until the end, Revan, no matter how this plays out.;NM40ADCART01062_.mp3
What do you have to say, HK-47?;
Commentary: I am... experiencing something unusual, master.;NM40ADCART01064_.mp3
Why? What's happening?;
Answer: My programming is activating my deleted memory core. I believe I have a... a homing system that is restoring it, master.;NM40ADCART01066_.mp3
So this is the... stimuli you were waiting for?;
Explanation: I believe so, master. I was unaware of my homing system until it had been activated.;NM40ADCART01068_.mp3
It seems that the homing system deliberately restores my deleted memory core upon... upon returning to my original master.;NM40ADCART01072_.mp3
You mean... Revan?;
Affirmation: Correct, master. Sith protocols maintain that all droid knowledge be deleted before assassination missions, and restored upon return.;NM40ADCART01074_.mp3
I have returned to you, and my full functionality is now under your personal command. It is a distinct pleasure to see you again, master.;NM40ADCART01075_.mp3
Well... that makes a lot of sense, actually.;
Observation: Indeed. I do hope we shall have the chance to engage in combat together again soon, master.;NM40ADCART01077_.mp3
Wow. What are the chances of that happening?;NM40ADCART01084_.mp3
Remember we're talking about the Force, here. At this point Malak himself could drop out of the sky and I wouldn't bat an eyelash.;NM40ADCART01087_.mp3
Good point.;NM40ADCART01086_.mp3
You won't abandon me, will you T3?;
Beep! Beep! Beep! Woop-woooop!;
I knew the little guy would come through for you - droids don't hold grudges.;NM40ADCART01092_.mp3
Well, Carth - will you stand with me against Malak?;
Well, the others seem to trust you... and I don't see any other way that we can stop the Sith. And I suppose that Malak is the real enemy here... I really don't have any other choice, do I?;NM40ADCART01094_.mp3
I won't let you down, Carth. I promise.;
I want to believe you. You've proven yourself time and time again during our mission, but this is a little much for me to wrap my mind around.;NM40ADCART01096_.mp3
You have to try... for Bastila's sake.;
This must be even more of a shock to you... I don't know how you even keep going. I guess we both just have to find a way to push forward.;NM40ADCART01098_.mp3
Don't worry about me - I'm a soldier. I can put aside my misgivings for now. We can, uh... we can talk later, you and I. Just give me time.;NM40ADCART01099_.mp3
So I guess that's it then... we keep going. We've still got one more Star Map to uncover if we're going to find that Star Forge and save Bastila, so let's do it before it's too late.;NM40ADCART01107_.mp3
Don't worry - I won't let my personal feelings get in the way of my assignments or this mission. But don't forget: I've sworn an oath to defend the Republic!;NM40ADCART01105_.mp3
As long as this mission stays on course I'll stick with you. But I won't let you betray the Republic under any circumstances!;NM40ADCART01106_.mp3
How do you think I feel?;
You have to find a way to deal with this, Carth.;
I'm not Revan anymore, Carth. You have to believe that.;
You're right - you don't have a choice! I'm in charge here!;
I see. Well, I guess that answers a lot of my questions about who you really are.;NM40ADCART01104_.mp3
Well, Carth... what are you going to do?;
I don't know. Maybe I just need time to, uh... to think about it.;NM40ADCART01109_.mp3
The others seem to trust you... and we need you to stop the Sith. And I suppose Malak is the real enemy here. But I don't have much choice but to go along with this for now, do I?;NM40ADCART01110_.mp3
Beep! Beep-beep boop! Bwoooop.;
But I found you, you didn't find me!;
Think you'd never heard of the Force before. Seems obvious enough to me it was meant to be.;NM40ADCART01079_.mp3
I'm not exactly Revan anymore, HK-47...;
Observation: That does not matter, master. I am your droid, regardless of your actions or personality.;NM40ADCART01081_.mp3
Good. So long as you're loyal.;
Commentary: I believe I have served you well in the past, master, and will continue to do so for as long as you have need of me.;NM40ADCART01083_.mp3
Everyone be careful... there's no telling what this means!;
Observation: That is unnecessary, master. My intent is not hostile. I am receiving no combat override commands.;NM40ADCART01089_.mp3
Observation: My homing system is a function of my assassination protocols... that which I told you had been de-activated. This system was not.;NM40ADCART01071_.mp3
Your homing system? What's that?;
I'll destroy you if you make a move, droid!;
I have seen signs of the taint of the dark side in your actions and deeds, but I will not give up on you as you did not give up on me. I will stay with you, Revan.;NM40ADCART01111_.mp3
I can tell there is conflict between light and darkness within you. I do not know which way the struggle will turn, but I will not abandon you in this difficult time, as you did not abandon me.;NM40ADCART01112_.mp3
Everyone knows it was Malak who gave the order to attack your people, Carth. You can't blame Revan for that.;NM40ADCART01113_.mp3
It, uh... it all makes sense now... Revan. I've watched you, I've seen your cruelty. I've seen your... your dark side. And now this! I don't know if I can trust you. Can any of us?;NM40ADCART01114_.mp3
I... I suppose you've proven yourself to be a friend of the Republic by your actions so far... Revan. But can I trust you? Can any of us?;NM40ADCART01115_.mp3
How can you say that, Mission? The Sith bombed my home world! Revan took away my family and destroyed my life!;NM40ADCART01052_.mp3
I don't know. Everything has changed, now.;
That's what I feared. Who's to say your old life won't come back... everything you felt and thought, all of it?;NM40ADCART01027_.mp3
Why? Were you lying to me all that time?;
This isn't a joke. You know what I'm talking about. I'm talking about you, about the way you felt...;NM40ADCART01029_.mp3
Please, Carth... don't do this to me!;
Get over it, Carth. We've got more important things to think about.;
Get over it? Yeah... yeah, I can get over it. I should have figured out earlier you weren't what you seemed. That's my fault.;NM40ADCART01034_.mp3
Do you think everybody else is going to be so quick to 'get over it'? You think they're going to follow a Sith Lord?;NM40ADCART01035_.mp3
I don't see the Sith Lord standing here, I see a friend who's been with us through thick and thin! Remember - Malak's the one who tried to destroy Taris!;NM40ADCART01046_.mp3
I'm sorry, Carth... I wish this wasn't true.;
But it is true. It's horribly true! It was...it was you... you killed my wife, you ravaged my world. You...you destroyed my life!;NM40ADCART01037_.mp3
Blame the Jedi Council for this, Carth - not me!;
It doesn't matter who's to blame. You're still the one who did it. You killed my wife... you betrayed everything that I believed in! You destroyed my life!;NM40ADCART01039_.mp3
This changes nothing. I am who I am.;
Oh, it changes everything! It was... it was you! You were the one that attacked my world! You were the one that destroyed my life!;NM40ADCART01041_.mp3
"The whole time we've been chasing after Malak we've had his old Sith Master right at our side; listening to our secrets; hearing our plans!";NM40ADCART01042_.mp3
But I'm not the Dark Lord anymore, I'm <FullName>. I'm one of you!;
This changes nothing! I still want to stop Malak!;
I don't remember anything about being Revan.;
And so the lies begin. It was obvious you remembered something back there when Malak confronted you with the truth. It might have only been small pieces, but there was something there!;NM40ADCART01117_.mp3
It looks that way. I'm... Darth Revan.;
Back off, Carth! There's nothing you can do about it!;
I suppose I shouldn't be surprised by your attitude now that I know who you really are... Revan.;NM40ADCART01008_.mp3
Not so fast. We've got a bigger issue to deal with here. They deserve to know the truth about you. Do you want to tell them what Malak said, or should I?;NM40ADCART01009_.mp3
I'll tell them. I'm... I'm Darth Revan.;
Say one word and you're dead, Carth!;
Threats? You can't bully me - though I shouldn't be surprised now that I know who you really are... Revan.;NM40ADCART01120_.mp3
We can't help Bastila - not unless we find the Star Forge first.;
The Dark Lord will not kill her. He will want to use her battle meditation ability against the Republic. He will take her alive so he can turn her to the dark side. I am sure of it.;NM40ADCART01122_.mp3
Malak won't kill her. I think he'll want to use her battle meditation against the Republic. He'll keep her alive so he can turn her to the dark side!;NM40ADCART01123_.mp3
Where is Bastila? What happened on that ship?;NM40ADCART01124_.mp3
Hey, where's Bastila? What happened on the ship?;NM40ADCART01125_.mp3
Let's get out of here before they close those docking bay doors!;NM40ADCART01126_.mp3

Did you hear what happened after the big swoop race? They say Brejik wouldn't pay up when he lost, and a brawl broke out! I can't believe I missed it!;NM02AEMUSI24000_.mp3
Hmph - who dresses you? You look like you crawled up here from the Lower City. Oh well, I guess we can't all have style.;NM02AEMUSI24002_.mp3
Isn't this band great? They can't leave Taris because of the Sith quarantine, so they've been playing here every night! Talk about a good break for us!;NM02AEMUSI24004_.mp3
Did you hear? Bendak got dusted in that death match - by a woman, no less! Heh. Isn't that great? That should show these men a thing or two about who's the boss!;NM02AEMUSI24006_.mp3
Did you hear the news? Bendak got dusted in that death match! I'll never get a chance to see something like that again. I can't believe I didn't get a ticket!;NM02AEMUSI24008_.mp3

Haw haw! *snort* We gots you good now!;
*squeee!*;
We did a good ambush and you and you better pay... uh... maybe 500 credits now! You die otherwise!;
And if I refuse to pay you anything?;
This isn't tough to figure out, you know. You don't pay, we bury you here!;
Yeah, out here in the sand!;
Perhaps I could persuade you not to do this?;
What? Why would we stop? You look pretty weak right now. We got you good!;
[Persuade] If you let me go, I'll tell others how smart you are.;
[Success] Hey, we get pretty good reputation if you run around all scaredy. Haw! I like it!;
Okay, we will leave you alone here. You count yourself lucky! Yeah, you real lucky. *snort*;
Uh, Gurke? They didn't give us nothing.;
Shut up! We got what we wanted! Now we go! That's how this works! Yeesh. *snort*;
[Failure] Bah! No way are we going to let you go. In fact, I think you should get shut up now!;
Yeah, we are sick of the talking!;
Shut up and get ready to fight. Stupid.;
[Force Persuade] You want to let me go. You got what you came for.;
[Success] We let you go now. We got what we wanted. Yeah, we sure did.;
I don't have 500 credits.;
What? Then you pay whatever you got! Yeah!;
Fine, here is every credit I have. Take it all.;
Hmm... not much... but maybe that's good enough. You roll over good.;
Yeah, maybe we play with you again some time.;
Haw! Maybe! You go where you want, now. We won't hurt you. Haw! *snort*;
Who are you to threaten me? I could be dangerous.;
Uh... what? Gurke said they be easy picking!;
Shut up, stupid! *snort* They are just bluffing you! They got no hope at all!;
[Persuade] I could be a powerful Jedi. Will you risk it?;
[Success] Ah... maybe... maybe this time we play on the safe side. Yeah, maybe this time.;
Gurke, are we leaving? Who's gonna pay for the ambush stuff?;
Shut up, stupid! Just go. *snort*;
[Failure] Bah! you are nothing! You talk and talk but got nothing to show! I think we shut you up now!;
[Force Persuade] You fear me! Cower, little piggy!;
[Success] Wuh! Ah, we are sorry about everything! Yeah, everything! We'll leave now!;
They don't seem that scary to me, Gurke. You sure?;
Shut up and run, stupid! You want to die? Yeesh!;
That's it! You're all going to die!;
What? Attack them! They trying to fight!;
I don't have any credits. None at all.;
But... Gurke said you types have lots of money!;
Shut up! You got nothing? Bah! Then we kill you for your gear stuff!;
Fine, I'll pay. Just leave me alone.;

Good job, Mission! I knew you wouldn't let us down. When we get out of this I'm going to see you get a medal from the Republic for everything you've done!;NM40AABAST01060_.mp3
If I remember the layout of this ship our equipment should be in a storage chamber just through the north doors. After we grab our stuff we need to get to the main bridge controls.;NM40AABAST01061_.mp3
The bridge is the only place we can open the docking gates of the hangar where they've got the Ebon Hawk. We have to open those gates before we can fly out of here!;NM40AABAST01062_.mp3
We better get moving. I can feel the darkness of Malak's presence approaching, and I don't want to be here when he arrives. None of us is a match for the Sith Lord.;NM40AABAST01063_.mp3
I'm not afraid of Malak!;
Then you are a fool! The power of the Dark Lord is strong enough to destroy any of us... even you. It would be suicide to face Malak here! We need to get away before he arrives.;NM40AABAST01065_.mp3
We need some type of plan.;
Surprise and secrecy will serve us best. A small group might have a better chance of sneaking onto the bridge undetected while the others make their way down to the Ebon Hawk.;NM40AABAST01067_.mp3
Count me in, then. I've got a score to settle with the Admiral before we get off this ship, and I have a feeling I'm gonna find him on the Leviathan's bridge!;NM40AABAST01068_.mp3
I'm coming, too!;
That's a good idea. The others can get to the Ebon Hawk on their own, but Carth and I might need your help.;NM40AABAST01070_.mp3
The three of us will get our equipment and make our way to the bridge. The rest of you head down to the docking hangar where they've got the Ebon Hawk. You'll have to find a way to deal with guards.;NM40AABAST01071_.mp3
Don't you worry about that. I know how to deal with the guards. They won't know what hit them!;NM40AABAST01072_.mp3
Good. Get to the equipment room, grab what you need, and get going.;
We'll meet you there as soon as we get those docking bay doors open. Just make sure the Hawk is ready to fly when we get there. And may the Force be with you.;NM40AABAST01073_.mp3
We still have to get our equipment.  Let's go.;
Careful, Carth, there's more at stake here than personal revenge.;
That's true, Carth. You can come, but don't let your hatred of Saul Karath jeopardize our true mission: getting the Ebon Hawk safely off the Leviathan.;NM40AABAST01075_.mp3
You better come with me and Carth. The others can find their way on their own, but we might run into trouble. We'll need you and your powerful Force abilities to deal with it.;NM40AABAST01077_.mp3
I'll go with the others back to the Ebon Hawk.;
Let's get our equipment and blast our way to those bridge controls!;
Well done, Jolee. I knew we could count on you. A Jedi never fails to get the task done!;NM40AABAST01079_.mp3
Nice job, Canderous. You keep getting us out of jams like this and there might be a place for you in the Republic army, even if you are a Mandalorian!;NM40AABAST01080_.mp3
Well done, Juhani. In freeing us from the cell you have proven yourself truly worthy of the title of Jedi.;NM40AABAST01081_.mp3
You may be a droid, but when this is all over I'm going to see the Republic gives you a medal for your part in this!;NM40AABAST01082_.mp3
Don't try to move too quickly, you might not be fully recovered yet. Admiral Karath had his guards continue to torture you even after you passed out.;NM40AABAST01000_.mp3
They tortured all of us, though you got the worst of it by far. Saul wanted them to make us suffer. He's become some sort of sadistic monster.;NM40AABAST01001_.mp3
The dark side has perverted him, Carth. Once you start down the tainted path it leads you ever further into the depths of evil. I fear he is forever lost.;NM40AABAST01002_.mp3
No one is without hope of redemption, Bastila.;
Yes, hmm, I suppose you are correct. Sometimes it is easy to lose sight of that hope in the face of such unbridled cruelty, but you speak the truth.;NM40AABAST01004_.mp3
I suppose I'm taking the news of Dantooine's destruction quite hard. First Taris, now the Academy... is there no end to the killing?;NM40AABAST01005_.mp3
Maybe Admiral Karath was lying.;
I'd like to believe that Saul was lying to us, but even as he said the words I knew they were true. The Academy is gone.;NM40AABAST01007_.mp3
We should have felt a disturbance in the Force when the attack came. The fact that we did not is a bad sign. I fear the dark side is growing stronger, casting shadows our vision cannot pierce.;NM40AABAST01008_.mp3
I can only hope that some of the Jedi escaped. Vrook, Vandar, Zhar... I cannot imagine all of them being gone. In any case, we have lost our one place of refuge in the galaxy.;NM40AABAST01009_.mp3
None of this will matter if we don't get out of this prison before Saul gets back!;NM40AABAST01010_.mp3
Where is Saul Karath now?;
Saul mentioned that Lord Malak was on his way. I think the Admiral left to prepare for his arrival... and to report the results of our interrogation.;NM40AABAST01012_.mp3
I only wish you had been able to resist the Admiral's questioning. I hope the information you revealed does not bring the entire galaxy under the dominion of the Sith.;NM40AABAST01013_.mp3
I'm sorry, Bastila, but I couldn't just let you be tortured!;
I appreciate your... feelings... for me. But you can't let your feelings override your judgment. Remember the Jedi code: There is no emotion, there is peace.;NM40AABAST01015_.mp3
"Your efforts were well intentioned but poorly thought out; Saul tortured us all anyway. There is too much at stake to let reckless passion rule our actions.";NM40AABAST01016_.mp3
How dare you judge me? You have no idea what it's like to be put into that kind of position!;
I know if I had been in that position I would not have betrayed the Order and the Republic!;NM40AABAST01018_.mp3
No, you would have just left someone you care about screaming in agony!;
Stop it, both of you! Bastila, you... you can't honestly say how you would have reacted in that situation - nobody can! Besides, Saul already had all the information. I could tell.;NM40AABAST01020_.mp3
The interrogation was a sham. Saul was toying with us. He didn't care what we told him. I think it was just an excuse to torture us before Malak arrived.;NM40AABAST01027_.mp3
Did you feel that? A disturbance in the Force. The Admiral has sent his message, the Dark Lord knows we are here now. Malak is coming.;NM40AABAST01028_.mp3
Well, then we better hope Mission busts us out of here before he arrives.;NM40AABAST01029_.mp3
Well, then we better hope T3-M4 busts us out of here before he arrives.;NM40AABAST01030_.mp3
Well, then we better hope Jolee busts us out of here before he arrives.;NM40AABAST01031_.mp3
Well, then we better hope Canderous busts us out of here before he arrives.;NM40AABAST01032_.mp3
Well, then we better hope Juhani busts us out of here before he arrives.;NM40AABAST01033_.mp3
Well, then we better hope HK-47 busts us out of here before he arrives.;NM40AABAST01034_.mp3
I'm... I'm sorry I failed you. I didn't know what else to do.;
Don't be so hard on yourself. I've known the Admiral a long time. I could see that he already knew the answers to the questions he was asking.;NM40AABAST01022_.mp3
Saul already knew the answers to the questions he was asking.;
I've known Admiral Karath a long time and I think you're right.;NM40AABAST01026_.mp3
I'm sorry, Bastila, but I couldn't just let Carth be tortured!;
I appreciate your... feelings... for Carth. But you can't let your feelings override your judgment. Remember the Jedi code: There is no emotion, there is peace.;NM40AABAST01024_.mp3
Why should I endure torture just to protect the Republic and the Jedi?;
Your attitude disturbs me. Such selfishness is a sign of the dark side's taint, and it does little to fill me with confidence in you.;NM40AABAST01036_.mp3
Forget about it, Bastila. It doesn't matter anyway. I've known the Admiral a long time. I could see that he already knew the answers to the questions he was asking.;NM40AABAST01037_.mp3
It is fortunate you were able to resist the Admiral's questioning. The fate of the galaxy could be changed by revealing the slightest piece of vital information.;NM40AABAST01038_.mp3
I have to confess something. There was a moment - just a moment - when part of me was hoping you would tell him what he wanted to know. Just to make the horrible pain stop.;NM40AABAST01039_.mp3
I'm sorry, Bastila. Watching you suffer tore me apart.;
I know you wouldn't ever do anything to intentionally cause me pain. But you did the right thing.;NM40AABAST01041_.mp3
I don't honestly know if I could have been as strong in your position. To watch you suffer like that... it might have been too much for me to bear.;NM40AABAST01042_.mp3
Saul would have tortured us no matter what I told him.;
The only reason I stayed silent was to watch you suffer.;
You wanted me to suffer? You enjoyed my torment? I don't know what to say. I thought there was a bond between us.;NM40AABAST01045_.mp3
Maybe... maybe you're not the man I thought you were.;NM40AABAST01046_.mp3
I, uh... I have to confess something. There was a... there was a moment - just a moment - when part of me was hoping that you would tell him what he wanted to know. Just to make the horrible pain stop.;NM40AABAST01047_.mp3
I'm sorry, Carth. Watching you suffer tore me apart.;
No, I know you wouldn't ever do anything to intentionally cause me pain. But you had no other choice. You couldn't betray our cause.;NM40AABAST01049_.mp3
I... I don't honestly know if I could have been as strong in your position. To watch you suffer like that I... I might have cracked.;NM40AABAST01050_.mp3
I'm not afraid of him!;
I know... it's hard to believe they're all gone.;
It's their own fault. They should have seen the attack coming.;
Blah, blah, blah. Don't you ever get tired of being so preachy?;
This is not a matter to joke about! If there is one thing we can learn from Saul it is how the power of the dark side can corrupt even the bravest of heroes!;NM40AABAST01058_.mp3
I'm sorry. Forgive me. Snapping at you like that won't help our situation.;NM40AABAST01059_.mp3
Yes, I promised you an answer when we reached the Ebon Hawk, didn't I? But I'm afraid you won't like it. We should have some privacy for this.;
I can't deny that there are parts of you I am drawn to. Your power, your will. You are so much stronger than I am.;
In some ways you make me feel weak, like I am caught up in the wake of our destiny. But at the same time, you make me feel stronger, more alive.;
So what does this mean for us?;
"I realize now these feelings are part of the bond we share. The Jedi Council surely realized this; they knew my loyalty to the doctrines of our Order would be tested on this mission.";
By facing and overcoming my feelings for you I have learned a valuable lesson about control and the dangers of emotion. This is an important step in understanding the Force.;
I'm sorry if this is not what you wanted to hear. But I felt it was important you know our... infatuation... was nothing more than a result of our powerful bond.;
So I was just a stepping stone to you becoming a Master?;
Please, don't say it like that. You make it sound like I was using you! Don't you realize how difficult this was for me?;
Difficult for you? What about me?;
Why do you think I came to this decision? I know how hard this is for both of us! You just kept pressing forward, so I had to be the one to step up and do the right thing!;
You're the one who can't face the truth! Malak has to be stopped. How can I do that if I let myself be blinded by my feelings for you?;
I'm going to stop Malak, Bastila. But I want to do it with you at my side.;
You... you mean it, don't you? But how can I be sure you aren't making a mistake. I... I have to resist. I have to be strong for both of us.;
You know I'm right, Bastila.;
But I don't... I mean, I can't... Malak will...;
Shut up and kiss me, you babbling fool.;
Oh, my!;
We... we shouldn't have done that. It was wrong. The Jedi aren't allowed to fall in love.;
It didn't feel wrong to me.;
It was... it was a moment of weakness. When I kissed you... we shouldn't have... no, I'm sorry.;
I know we both wanted it, but we shouldn't have given in to our desire. We're Jedi! We can't act like this. Not now, not while we still have to deal with Malak!;
I'm... I'm sorry. I don't blame you, but... it was a mistake. I have to get out of here before somebody sees us together!;
We're not going back to this again, are we?;
I love you Bastila. And I know you love me.;
Okay, you've made your point. Now shut up and kiss me, you fool!;
You don't always have to be strong, Bastila. Give in just this once.;
That's okay - I never felt anything for you anyway.;
Oh, I thought... No, this is good. I'm glad you told me. This makes everything much easier.;
Don't worry - I can put this behind me. Let's just continue on with what we must do. It is better this way.;
I... I understand, Bastila.;
I hope you can put this behind you. You need to focus on stopping Malak, as difficult as that may be. Come, we should continue our mission.;
This is nothing but an excuse! You're afraid to face your feelings!;
You're rationalizing, Bastila. You're just scared to face the truth!;
So that's it? It's all over?;
I'm... afraid so. Although I suppose I should thank you for all you've done. For the lessons you helped me learn.;
Great - you learn a lesson and I get dumped!;
I wish it could be otherwise, but you have to understand that this is the way it must be. I am a Jedi, after all.;
And I feel more alive when I'm with you.;
You're stronger than I am, and there's no point in telling me otherwise. You will be a great Jedi, I think. I hope.;
Thank you for freeing us! You will eternally have the gratitude of the Rakata!;
But... I can't help but wonder, off-worlder... Why have you freed us?;
I work for the One.;
The One! He sent someone back for us as I knew he would!;
We shall return to the One and tell of what you have done.;
I have no love for the Elders.;
And neither do we. We thank you for what you have done for us.;
Shut up and accept it!;
Er... yes... yes! Thank you!;
Actually I just wanted a moving target.;
What?? You shall never kill me!;
[This door is held closed by some great power, and cannot be opened at the moment.];
[This door is locked and must be opened by some other means.];
Bastila - you're alive! Finally, things are looking up. Now we just need to figure out a way to get off this planet.;NM02AACARB01000_.mp3
You mean you don't have a plan to get off Taris yet? What have you been doing all this time?;NM02AACARB01002_.mp3
We were trying to find you, remember?;
"I see. Now that I'm back in charge of this mission, perhaps we can start doing things properly. Hopefully our escape from Taris will go more smoothly than when you ""rescued"" me from Brejik.";NM02AACARB01004_.mp3
I know you're new at this, Bastila, but a leader doesn't berate her troops just because things aren't going as planned. Don't let your ego get in the way of the real issues here.;NM02AACARB01006_.mp3
That hardly strikes me as an appropriate way of addressing your commander, Carth. I am a member of the Jedi Order and this is my mission. Don't forget that!;NM02AACARB01008_.mp3
My Battle Meditation ability has helped the Republic many times in this war, and it will serve us well here I am sure.;NM02AACARB01010_.mp3
Your talents might win us a few battles, but that doesn't make you a good leader! A good leader would at least listen to the advice of those who have seen more combat than she ever will!;NM02AACARB01012_.mp3
Both of you settle down! This isn't helping.;
Yes... You're right, of course. I apologize, Carth. This has been a difficult time for me. Of course I'm happy to listen to your advice. What do you suggest we do?;NM02AACARB01014_.mp3
"First off we can't get hung up on who's in charge; we all need to work together if we want to get off this rock. The answer's out there, we just have to find it.";NM02AACARB01016_.mp3
"Well said, Carth. And the sooner we start looking the better; I've already been a prisoner of the Vulkars and I don't plan on being captured by the Sith.";NM02AACARB01018_.mp3
Don't worry. I won't let that happen!;
I think we'll need some help getting off Taris. Maybe if we ask around one of the locals can help us out. We should probably start by asking around in the cantinas.;NM02AACARB01021_.mp3
Okay, so what now?;
Let's go find a way off this planet.;
He's right. You aren't showing much leadership ability right now, Bastila.;
You know, I had my doubts about this mission but I figured the Jedi Council wouldn't put you in charge if you weren't prepared. But here you are, acting like a spoiled child!;NM02AACARB01025_.mp3
"I see. It's true I that don't have much military experience; perhaps I should not be so quick to judge. Very well, Carth: what do you suggest we do?";NM02AACARB01027_.mp3
Carth! You can't talk to your commanding officer like that!;
Don't worry. We'll figure something out.;
I'm getting a little sick of your attitude, Bastila!;
My attitude? It strikes me that you're the one in sore need of an attitude adjustment. I happen to be in charge of this mission, if you'll recall.;NM02AACARB01032_.mp3
Ah, the damnable racket of battle! Watch yourself, even more of these crawling beasts are hiding in the underbrush.;NM24AAJOLE05000_.mp3
Who are you? What are you doing here?;
I'm Jolee. Jolee Bindo. Follow me to my camp and we'll talk a bit.;NM24AAJOLE05008_.mp3
I will, but explain what you are doing here.;
Why am I here? Hmph. Well it isn't because I like the stink of dead kinrath. Let's move this talk to my camp where the air is better.;NM24AAJOLE05010_.mp3
Keep close. It's nearby, under a log. Yeah, I live like some burrowing rodent. I fought the Sith... now look at me. Hmph!;NM24AAJOLE05012_.mp3
You use a lightsaber in battle. Are you a Jedi?;
Ah, don't start fawning just yet, I'm too old for it. *Sigh* I...I know a few things, but we can talk about it at my camp.;NM24AAJOLE05015_.mp3
Who are you to give me orders, old man?;
Look, you can follow now or stumble around on your own, but I'm too old to care whether you think I'm babysitting you.;NM24AAJOLE05018_.mp3
What, do I have to fight you as well now?;
Help or don't, just stay out of my way.;
That's the way! Now prove that wasn't blind luck, you baby!;NM24AAJOLE05020_.mp3
Quit your yapping for now. We'll talk when the company is better. Get to fightin'!;NM24AAJOLE05002_.mp3
Well, that was acceptable. You're not quite the commander I'd have accompanied in my youth, but you managed to walk away.;NM24AAJOLE05006_.mp3
[This submersible can be used to descend to the deep ocean Hrakert research station.];
[Use the submersible.];
[Step away from the submersible.];
If the droid is correct, then we must complete the tasks in the proving grounds to the east and west before these doors will open.;NM15AABAST02000_.mp3
This... this must be what Revan and Malak found when they entered this temple. This must be where their journey down the dark side began.;NM15AABAST02001_.mp3
What is it?;
This is a... a map. Some sort of intergalactic navigational chart. Revan and Malak must have used this to lead them to the Star Forge.;NM15AABAST02003_.mp3
We could use this map to follow their path and find the Star Forge ourselves. But we must be wary... they may have laid traps or concealed what they found.;NM15AABAST02004_.mp3
So what is the Star Forge, exactly?;
I... I don't know, but Revan and Malak were very interested in finding it. It must be a tool of some type... or maybe a weapon. Perhaps the Council can tell us more.;NM15AABAST02007_.mp3
But I think this map might be the key to finding the Star Forge, whatever it is.;NM15AABAST02008_.mp3
See this world here? This looks like Korriban, a Sith world. And if that's Korriban, then this is... Kashyyyk... and Tatooine... and here's Manaan.;NM15AABAST02009_.mp3
But there are pieces missing: incomplete hyperspace coordinates, corrupted data... and there doesn't seem to be anything indicating where the Star Forge itself might be.;NM15AABAST02010_.mp3
Perhaps those worlds have more clues.;
I was thinking that, too. This map can't take us to the Star Forge, but I know that Revan and Malak visited Korriban at least once. Perhaps they discovered something more there.;NM15AABAST02012_.mp3
They may have found something on each of the other worlds that completed this map. Maybe if we find all the pieces they will lead us to the Star Forge... and some way to destroy it.;NM15AABAST02013_.mp3
That sounds like quite a supposition. What if you're wrong?;NM15AABAST02014_.mp3
What if I'm right? We can't ignore this. Finding the Star Forge might very well be the key to defeating the Sith!;NM15AABAST02015_.mp3
We must inform the Council of what we have discovered. They must decide our next course of action, though I suspect our task has only just begun.;NM15AABAST02016_.mp3
What good is an incomplete map?;
I still don't understand about the Star Forge. What does it do?;
What are you talking about?;
I don't get it. Is this the Star Forge?;
[There are ancient symbols here, worn as though traced by generations of Wookiee claws. Layers of moss and dirt suggest that no one has been here in many years.];
[The beast comes when summoned, if you are generous. It comes to battle, if you are worthy and wise. It grants you glory, if you are fearsome and brave.];
[Feed the beast and it will heed your call. Take vipers from their lair and hang them from above. Let blood scent the ground of our ancestors.];
I remember this. I remember the tales of the hunters that would prove themselves in the Shadowlands.;
Can you shed any light on this?;
It is a description of the ritual you have already completed. We need not concern ourselves with it.;
I never went to the Shadowlands to prove myself. I was cast out before I could reach the proper age. I don't know anything about the rituals.;
You will have to follow whatever your instincts tell you. These were tests for individual warriors. I am sorry I can't be of more help.;
Whatever. Just tell me what you know about it.;
[Obviously this was once a place of great ritual importance.];
