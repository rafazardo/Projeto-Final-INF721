Dialogue
Garnet:Why did I do that...?
"Penelo:Are you alright, Garnet?"
Penelo:You look down... Did something happen?
Garnet:Did you hear thatZidane agreed to be Ultimecia's transient knight?
"Penelo:Yeah, I did."
"Penelo:I was surprised when I heard. Becoming a knight is something special, isn't it?"
Penelo:I can imagine how upset you must have been since you and Zidane are so close...
"Garnet:No, that's not it."
"Garnet:Zidane was just being kind, and yet I got jealous... I regret getting so upset."
"Garnet:I know I shouldn't blame my hardships on anyone or anything else, but..."
Rydia:I don't think you need to be so hard on yourself.
Garnet:Oh! Did you overhear us?
Rydia:Sorry. But we were worried about you...
Fran:There's no need to fret if your heart remains unchanged.
Garnet:I believe in Zidane. But I can't sort out how I feel...
Fran:Then why not get some distance?
Fran:You two are too close. You cannot see the forest for the trees.
Garnet:The forest...?
Rydia:I think it's a great idea!
"Rydia:Take some time for yourself. I doubt your feelings will change at this point, after all!"
"Garnet:But still, I..."
Gabranth:How long have you been here?
Rydia:Fran and I just arrived. But Garnet and Penelo were here already.
Garnet:Did something happen?
Gabranth:Have you seen Gau?
"Fran:We have not, and our departure nears."
"Gabranth:The boy was with me earlier, but I lost sight of him."
Garnet:I'll help you find him!
Gabranth:Where did Gau run off to?
"Garnet:He couldn't have gone far. If we split up, we should be able to find him."
Gabranth:Thank you for your help.
Penelo:I'm worried about him...
"Penelo:He may be free-spirited, but he wouldn't go off without a reason."
Garnet:I hope he hasn't been captured by Kefka or the others...
Gabranth:That is certainly a possibility... We must proceed with caution.
Penelo:I don't see him anywhere...
Gabranth:We should expand our search. I will cover that area.
"Penelo:Garnet and I will go that way, then."
Garnet:(It's natural for friends to worry about each other... So why couldn't I just be happy to see Zidane that time?)
Garnet:(No... I can't let my mind wander. We have to find Gau!)
"Garnet:Gau! Where are you, Gau!?"
"Mog:It's almost time to go, kupo!"
Lenna:There he is!
"Garnet:Oh, thank goodness. Let's go back. Everyone is worried about you."
Gau:Gau stay.
Gau:Gau gather herbs! Herbs smell good!
"Penelo:Why are you looking for herbs, Gau?"
Lenna:Could it be...
Garnet:What should we do?
"Mog:I'll call Sabin and Cyan, kupo!"
Penelo:Can we help you find those herbs?
Lenna:Yes! We can help you find plenty.
Gau:Gau! You help me?
Garnet:Are you two sure about this?
"Penelo:Come on, Garnet! A little fresh air will be good for you."
Lenna:Indeed. And the weather is perfect for a stroll.
"Mog:What are you going to do, kupo? Do you want me to call Zidane?"
Garnet:(I can't help thinking about Fran and Rydia's words...)
Garnet:(Perhaps I should get some distance and take some time for myself...)
Garnet:(It may be just what I need.)
"Garnet:I'm going, too!"
Penelo:That's the spirit!
"Mog:You too, kupo!? Should I go with you?"
Garnet:Please go back to the airship and let everyone know we're okay. And please keep this a secret from Zidane.
"Mog:I don't really get it, but...okay, kupo!"
"Garnet:Let's go, Gau. We'll help you find those herbs together!"
"Gau:This way, Gau!"
Lenna:I wonder where he'll lead us... Hehe. I can't wait to see.
Penelo:Yeah! Let's go!
"Gau:Gau, Gau! Thank you, Garnet!"
"Garnet:It's alright, Gau. But please be more careful next time."
Penelo:She's right. Everyone's worried about you.
Penelo:I was surprised to see Gabranth so worried about Gau.
Garnet:Oh really?
"Penelo:Back home, he was..."
"Penelo:Let's just say he didn't strike me as the ""caring"" type."
Penelo:I just can't imagine him worrying over anyone that much.
Lenna:Perhaps this world has something to do with that.
Garnet:What do you mean?
"Lenna:Back home, people have to worry about their status and their goals. They can't show all of themselves."
Lenna:But those things have changed here.
Lenna:The Gabranth you know and the one that cares about Gau are two sides of the same coin.
Garnet:(Two sides of the same coin...)
Gau:Herbs this way!
Penelo:It's been a while since we could just stroll like this. I think we've been stretching ourselves too thin lately.
Garnet:...We have. I hope we can find those herbs alright.
Gau:Smell good! Make Gau hungry!
Penelo:Don't eat it! Lenna said they're poisonous.
Lenna:Gau? Where did you go?
Gau:Over here! Come find Gau!
Garnet:Maybe he's playing hide-and-seek. But he'll get lost in a dark place like this...
"Penelo:Alright, we have to find him!"
Garnet:Ahh! Leave us alone! Haha!
Gau:Gau! Run away!
Lenna:I'm exhausted...
"Penelo:I wonder if Gau just wanted to come out here and play. What do you think, Garnet?"
Garnet:Hehe... Hahaha.
Garnet:This is so much fun!
"Garnet:Exploring the realm on foot, confronting the unexpected, running with all my might...!"
Garnet:It's just like my journey with Zidane and the others!
Penelo:That's great! I'm so glad to see you smile.
Lenna:I'm sure it must have been draining on you. We were so worried.
Garnet:Thank you...
"Penelo:Say, Garnet... You really shouldn't blame yourself."
"Lenna:You're always trying to be righteous, but that can hurt you sometimes."
"Lenna:You may be a queen back home, but always acting like one here will do nothing but run you ragged."
Penelo:No one would blame you if you let your hair down a little.
"Penelo:Yeah, you can say whatever you want around us."
Lenna:That's why we wanted you to come with us and help Gau.
Garnet:Thank you...truly.
Garnet:You two always keep a watchful eye on us. I suppose you saw right through me.
Garnet:I see now that I've been lost in thought because of what happened with Ultimecia...
Garnet:I've forgotten all about it during our adventure today.
Penelo:I'm glad it helped. You look much cheerier now!
Lenna:The sparkle is back in your eyes. You've returned to the Garnet we know and love.
Gau:Gau find path! Smell like herbs! Follow me!
Lenna:It seems like this worked out well for all of us. Perhaps your feelings helped clear the way?
Garnet:Lenna... Haha!
Penelo:We've come quite deep into the woods.
Garnet:I didn't think our adventure would bring us out here.
Garnet:But we can't stop now.
Gau:Herbs close! Gau!
Garnet:Going on an adventure like this brings back so many memories.
Gau:Memories of home?
"Garnet:I may be royalty, but I had my reckless moments."
Penelo:I can imagine.
Penelo:Zidane told me you once cut off your long hair!
"Garnet:Yes, really. I even mixed sleeping weed in with their food..."
Penelo:It sounds like there's never a dull moment around you!
"Garnet:And I never want to forget a single one of those moments, either. Haha!"
Gau:Gau smell... It close!
"Garnet:Gau, just what sort of herbs are you looking for?"
Lenna:It must be something with a potent smell. Perhaps a medicinal herb.
Penelo:But was there someone injured on the airship? I thought everyone was fine.
Gau:No. Guy not there.
Lenna:I see... You were worried because Guy hadn't returned yet.
Gau:Guy kind. He give herb when someone hurt.
Garnet:(Gau is trying to do what he can in Guy's absence...)
Lenna:You're very kind. I'm sure Guy is fine. But let's gather some herbs as a nice surprise for him.
"Gau:Herbs, down there! Lots!"
Garnet:What's the matter?
Penelo:The herbs are down a steep cliff. I don't know if we can get to them.
Gau:But Gau want herb for Guy.
"Garnet:(After all this searching, we can't return home empty-handed... I won't give up. For Gau's sake!)"
Garnet:I'll go!
Lenna:It's too dangerous!
Garnet:I'll be fine. I've jumped from a castle to an airship before.
Penelo:But if a strong wind blows or...
"Garnet:Don't worry, Gau. I'll get those herbs for you."
Garnet:I'll be back!
Penelo:Be careful!
Garnet:(This cliff isn't as bad as I thought... I'll be fine as long as I keep calm.)
Garnet:(Gau was just like me. He tried to do whatever he could in Guy's absence.)
Garnet:(Now that I'm away from Zidane...even if I feel scared or unsure...)
Garnet:(I have to do what I can until I see him again. I must!)
Garnet:I did it! I'm okay! Now tell me which herbs you need!
"Lenna:You're incredible, Garnet!"
Gau:Gau go too!
Gau:Gau get training from Yuffie! Gau find Guy's herbs!
Penelo:Good luck!
Gau:Gau get lots of herbs!
Penelo:Wow! What a harvest!
"Lenna:Your courage lit a fire in Gau's heart, Garnet."
Gau:Garnet amazing! Very brave!
"Garnet:You don't need to thank me. Because of you, I realized something important..."
Garnet:(I realized how happy others feel when helped in times of need...)
"Garnet:(You want to make people happy, Zidane. That's why you help them.)"
Garnet:(I finally understand how you feel.)
"Garnet:Gau, Penelo, Lenna... I can't thank you enough."
Garnet:Now let's go back. Everyone's waiting for us.
Gabranth:Where have you been?
Gabranth:Everyone was worried about you.
Garnet:Please don't scold him. He went to find herbs for everyone.
Gau:Armor... Gau sorry.
Gabranth:Is this for me?
Gabranth:...Hmph. I will overlook it this time. But you will explain your absence to Sabin and the others.
Garnet:Zidane...
"Zidane:I'm so glad you're safe, Dagger..."
Zidane:Why did you tell Mog not to say anything? I could've gone with you.
"Garnet:Sorry, but I needed time for myself to cool my head..."
Zidane:You mean after what happened with Ultimecia?
"Zidane:You didn't do anything wrong, Dagger. It was all my fault. I'm sorry."
Garnet:You don't need to apologize. I understand.
Garnet:I see now why you want to help people.
Zidane:You do?
"Garnet:Lenna, Penelo, and I were helping Gau find herbs."
Garnet:I mustered up all my courage and made them smile...
"Garnet:After all...helping people makes them happy, doesn't it?"
"Zidane:It does. Thank you, Dagger."
"Garnet:To be honest, I was really upset at what happened with Ultimecia."
Zidane:I won't make excuses... I did a bad thing.
"Garnet:But that's who you are, Zidane..."
Garnet:That's why I like you.
Garnet:Now I think it's time to put this whole thing behind us. Let's go back to the others.
"Zidane:W-wait, Dagger! Could you run that by me one more time?"
Garnet:Nope. Didn't I say it's time to put it all behind us?
Zidane:No fair!
"Garnet:(I never wanted to be apart from you again, but...thanks to that, I know how I feel.)"
Garnet:(There's nothing for me to be afraid of anymore.)
Garnet:(Our feelings won't change. They're here to stay.)
"Mog:I can feel it. There's a warrior nearby, kupo."
Hope:Is that him?
???:(A kid...and a girl with cat ears?)
Y'shtola:Do not be alarmed. We are not your foe.
???:So you're the ones I keep hearing about.
"Vivi:You've heard about us, Mister?"
"???:(""Mister""? Give me a break.)"
Squall:I'm Squall. My client told me about you.
Squall:Mentioned you're on a journey to seal the Torsions.
Warrior of Light:What is your purpose here?
Squall:I'm a mercenary.
Squall:I've been tasked to investigate this cavern and eliminate any threat.
"Hope:All by yourself? I get that you're a soldier, but..."
Squall:I can take care of myself.
Vivi:I guess he's not interested in joining us.
Y'shtola:He is merely choosing not to get close to others.
"Y'shtola:In any event, he bears the light, does he not?"
"Warrior of Light:More importantly, who is this client he spoke of?"
"Mog:We'll just have to ask him ourselves, kupo!"
"Mog:Found you, kupo!"
Squall:(They're still here?)
"Vivi:Squall, are you fighting all by yourself? Isn't that a little dangerous?"
Squall:You're the ones who need to be careful.
Squall:This isn't a place for amateurs.
Squall:You should get out of here before you get hurt.
Sazh:Would it kill you to lighten up a bit?
"Rem:Squall, I'm a soldier just like you."
Rem:Everyone here has their own reason for fighting. We know what we're doing.
"Cloud:Show off as much as you want, but we have some questions that need answers first."
Squall:(Who's showing off?)
Cloud:Who's your client? And how do they know about us?
Squall:That's confidential.
Sazh:I don't get you at all. What's with the attitude?
Squall:You're the ones not making any sense.
Squall:You're risking your lives solely based on what that moogle told you.
"Squall:While in reality, you have no idea what's actually happening in this world right now."
"Mog:I'm a messenger of the goddess Materia. It's my duty to protect the planet, kupo!"
Cloud:We all have something we want to protect. Isn't that reason enough?
Squall:Something you want to protect...
"Cloud:Anyway, sorry for stopping you. Later."
Squall:Stop. You're no match for what's lurking around here.
Vivi:But it's way too dangerous for you to go alone too.
"Squall:If you're scared, you can stay close to me. Just don't get in my way."
Rem:So you'll join us then?
Squall:I didn't say that. But I'll help you out while you're here.
"Squall:Come on, let's go. Things should be easier now that I'm with you."
Tifa:Looks like we made it.
Vivi:It feels good to be outside again.
Squall:Don't relax just yet. We still have to make it through the forest before we reach our destination.
"Hope:You really know your way around here, don't you?"
"Squall:I'm just going by the information I received from my client. Anyway, be careful. There are monsters up ahead."
Rem:Sounds like he's really familiar with the area. It's nice having someone you can count on.
Squall:I never said I trusted him. I'm simply relaying what I was told.
Rem:You're risking your life for a client you don't even trust?
Squall:...I needed a purpose. I was lost.
Squall:That's when he came along. Told me he needed my help.
Squall:Didn't even ask who I was or where I came from.
Hope:So you only trust him because you're contractually obligated...
Squall:But I don't think my client would lie since he's counting on my success.
"Squall:In that sense, I trust him. That's all."
Tifa:Sounds like you've got a lot on your mind. Reminds me of someone else I know.
Squall:(Hmph... You don't know me.)
Tifa:He can also be a bit awkward.
Hope:Is that being awkward?
Rem:Everyone has a different way of looking at things. That's what makes us unique.
"Vivi:Yeah, exactly."
Squall:...Come on.
Squall:Let's get out of here before any more monsters show up.
"Tifa:Yeah, good idea."
Cloud:He's going to get himself killed if he keeps this up.
Y'shtola:You refer to Squall.
"Rem:You're really worried about him, aren't you?"
"Cloud:No, I'm worried about us."
Cloud:Who knows where this so-called client is taking us.
"Cloud:And the farther we go, the more monsters there are."
"Hope:What do you think we should do then? I mean, he seems to be avoiding talking to us."
"Tifa:Yeah, but it's not like we can pretend everything's okay."
Rem:Do you think we can get him to change his mind?
"Y'shtola:That may prove to be difficult. To him, the mission is everything."
Y'shtola:He is not going to turn back until the investigation is complete.
Rem:Squall is one of us. We can't just abandon him.
"Tifa:Then I guess we need to see this through until the end, huh?"
"Hope:I was about to say the same thing. ...But what about you, Cloud?"
Cloud:I never said we should turn back. I was just saying we need to be more cautious.
Tifa:...He said cautiously.
Cloud:What's that supposed to mean?
Tifa:Nothing. Cautious is good.
Rem:I'm sure there's a reason Squall's in such a hurry.
Y'shtola:Any clue why?
Rem:He said he needed a purpose.
Rem:So maybe he's trying to make something of himselftrying to find his identity.
Y'shtola:So even Squall has worries.
Hope:I hope there's something we can do to help.
"Tifa:Yeah, come on, we have to be there for him."
Cloud:...Not interested.
"Tifa:Yeah, yeah. You keep telling yourself that."
"Rem:Hey, Squall? You're here on a mission, right?"
Rem:You don't need to report back to your client or anything?
Squall:My client is only interested in the Torsions.
Squall:How I handle the mission is up to me. That's why I chose to accompany you.
Y'shtola:And yet you continue to conceal your client's identity.
Squall:Like I said
"Y'shtola:""That's confidential."""
Y'shtola:You fear growing close to others.
Y'shtola:But I sense the good in youa desire to protect and a great inner zeal.
Hope:Is everything okay? Everyone's already heading to the next area.
"Rem:Sorry, we'll be right there."
"Y'shtola:I expect great things from you, Squall."
"Hope:Um, do you have a second?"
Hope:I was thinking about what you said earlier.
Hope:Mog told us that sealing the Torsions would protect this world.
"Hope:And as a result, save our worlds as well."
Squall:That's the idea.
Squall:But there's no way to find out for sure until we return home.
Hope:I want to know the truth. I want to know what's really happening.
"Squall:Sorry, but I don't have all the answers either."
Hope:Then why are you fighting? I'm sure you're not just following orders.
Squall:I don't fight for some great cause like saving the world or anything.
Squall:I'm just trying to survive to see my friends again. That's all.
Hope:They must mean a lot to you.
"Squall:Yeah. Now come on, let's go. You need my help, right?"
"Hope:To be reunited with your friends, huh?"
Hope:Maybe I just need to keep my eyes front. There's no going back after all.
Mog:Kupo?
"Y'shtola:Aye, how peculiar."
Sazh:Something the matter? I thought we were almost out of here.
Y'shtola:We would be if this were a normal forest.
"Tifa:Wait, are you saying it's not?"
"Mog:It's almost like we're trapped inside, kupo."
Hope:We're trapped? You mean we can't leave!?
"Y'shtola:Rather, we are not allowed to leave."
Sazh:I'm not followin' you.
Tifa:You mean someone intentionally trapped us in here?
"Y'shtola:Or perhaps ""something."" Escaping may prove to be quite arduous."
"Mog:Someone's in trouble, kupo!"
Hope:That voice! Is that!?
Sazh:Hope! *Sigh* Can't take your eyes off him for a second.
"Tifa:C'mon, we have to go after him!"
Warrior of Light:It appears that was the last of them.
"???:I mean, you're not one of the bad guys...right?"
Warrior of Light:We bear no animosity toward those who wish us no harm.
Warrior of Light:Are you hurt?
???:I'm fine. That was a close one! By the way...who are you guys?
"Hope:It looks like there aren't any more monsters here. Vanille, are you okay?"
"Sazh:Man, kids these days think they'e invincible. Glad you're okay though."
Vanille:Hope! Sazh!
"Mog:You're friends? Introduce us, kupo!"
Hope:She's a friend from back home.
Vanille:I'm Vanille. Nice to meet you.
Vanille:So...where are we?
"Mog:Come on, I'll explain on the way, kupo!"
Vanille:Wait... Do you mean I can come with you?
Warrior of Light:It is far too dangerous for you to travel alone. You may accompany us until we reach a safe
"Mog:You also bear the light, kupo! You should come with us!"
Vanille:The light? Hold on. Is that a moogle?
"Sazh:What can I say? You've missed out on a lot. But for now, we could really use your help."
Vanille:Really? Count me in.
"Mog:You can trust me, kupo!"
Vanille:A friend of Sazh and Hope's is a friend of mine.
Y'shtola:What a peculiar girl.
Sazh:For real? What's so weird about trusting others?
Y'shtola:I do not think it a bad thing.
"Y'shtola:In any event, the force preventing us from leaving the forest has weakened."
Vanille:We're leaving already? But there are still areas I haven't checked out yet.
"Vanille:This forest is huge! Who knows what wonderful treasures await us? Besides, I feel like something's calling me!"
"Sazh:And if we get lost? Then what? Listen, we need to regroup and Aw, forget it. You've already made up your mind."
"Vanille:I knew you'd understand, Sazh. All right then, let the treasure hunt begin!"
"Vanille:Hey, so... Is someone going to tell me where we are yet?"
"Cecil:We still owe you an explanation, don't we?"
"Mog:Oh yeah, kupo! Allow me to explain."
"Mog:This is an illusionary world created by the gods, but it's being corrupted by the Torsions."
Mog:That's why I'm on a journey to make friends with those who are blessed with the light to save it.
Cecil:Those Torsions threaten to erode each of our worlds as well.
"Mog:Exactly! Which is why this is such an important journey for us all, kupo!"
Vanille:I get that something has to be done...
Vanille:But why would such powerful gods need our help to fix things?
"Yuna:Now that you mention it... If our worlds really are in trouble, why would we need to come here to save them?"
"Mog:Because the gods aren't all-powerful and in control of everything, kupo."
"Mog:Besides, it's not like they created this world to be destroyed. They made it for a reason."
"Mog:That's why we desperately need your help to save it, kupo."
Vanille:Hm... Alright then.
"Mog:Does it make sense now, kupo?"
Vanille:Nope! But at least I'm certain it doesn't make sense now.
"Yuna:For now, I guess all we can do is focus on what's in front of us. We have to seal the Torsions."
"Vivi:Yeah, we don't have any other choice if we want to protect our homes."
Vanille:Huh... So that's what this is all about.
"Mog:Yep! So there's no time to waste, kupo!"
"Vanille:...Okay, ready to go then?"
Vivi:Let's be careful we don't get lost.
"Cecil:Mog, lead the way, if you could."
Yuna:We're counting on you.
Mog:Kupo!? R-right this way.
"Vanille:Things don't always go as planned...even for gods, huh?"
Vanille:I know the feeling.
Vanille:...I really hope there's some way I can help save this world.
Yda:Hrm. This forest truly is confounding.
Vanille:But you sound like you might know where we are!
"Yda:Well, I could bring us back to whence we started. I've trekked through a wood or two in my day."
Yuffie:What a relief. I'd hate to get stuck here forever.
Rem:Are you okay? You can wait outside the forest if you're worried about getting lost.
Yuffie:And let you hog all the treasure? Not a chance.
Yuffie:The treasure you told us about! You said it was callin' you.
Vanille:Oh yeah... I guess I did say something like that.
Yuffie:Must be something amazing for you to feel it calling you from so far away.
Rem:I just hope it's nothing dangerous.
"Vanille:Well, uh... Let's hope for the best!"
"Yuffie:C'mon, have some faith! You're the one who brought it up, after all."
"Vanille:Well, it's true I feel like something's calling me."
Yda:Perhaps that something is why we couldn't leave the forest earlier.
Vanille:I guess we'll soon find out.
"Yda:That we will! Whatever it is, I just hope it's not alive!"
Rem:You two are starting to scare me.
"Yuffie:Yeah, maybe I will go back and wait."
"Vanille:Come on, we've come this far. Let's see this through together."
"Yuffie:Y-you're just trying to trick me into taking point, aren't you!"
"Y'shtola:Everyone has become rather comfortable around each other, haven't they?"
Edge:You won't hear me complain.
Y'shtola:Why don't you join them?
Edge:Sometimes it's nice to just sit back and enjoy the view.
"Edge:Gotta let the ladies have their fun, you know?"
Y'shtola:...Aren't we the noble one?
Rem:This pendant's drawing in mana. Maybe this was what trapped us in the forest?
Vivi:It's kind of creepy. I don't like it.
"Rem:Yeah, we should probably leave it alone."
"Vanille:What are you two whispering about? Hey, check it out!"
Vanille:So? How does it look?
Vivi:What are you doing!?
Vanille:What do you mean?
Rem:Huh? What happened to the dark aura?
Vivi:It's gone... But why?
"Vanille:""Dark aura""? What are you talking about? It's just a cute pendant. See?"
"Mog:They say some items in this world choose their owner. It looks like that one has taken a liking to you, kupo."
"Sazh:Or maybe you scared off the ""dark aura"" with your rainbows-and-sunshine attitude."
"Vanille:Sazh, maybe it's your turn to wear this pendant. Let's see how the dark aura likes you!"
"Sazh:Okay, okay! You win. You know magic and I don't get along."
"Y'shtola:Not a terribly adventurous spirit, I see."
Sazh:You can't afford to take any chances at my age.
Vanille:You take chances all the time though. Especially when it involves your family.
"Sazh:Guess we're not that different then, huh?"
Vanille:Yeah... I wonder how everyone's doing back home.
"Rem:Well, you were reunited with Sazh and Hope in this world."
"Rem:Who knows? Maybe it won't be long before you see your family again, too."
"Y'shtola:Aye, now is not the time for sorrow."
Vanille:Was it that obvious? You're right. I shouldn't worry.
"Vivi:Besides, you have us now. We're here for you."
Vanille:Thank you so much! I'm looking forward to getting to know you all.
???:Grasslands as far as the eye can see and not a casino or pub in sight. Wish there was at least a beautiful lady to keep me company.
???:If only I had my airship.
Mog:Kupo! I can sense the light coming from that man!
"Setzer:Heh, wasn't expecting to run into you guys here."
"Shadow:Setzer, you too? How long have you been in this world?"
"Setzer:What do you mean ""this world""?"
Shadow:This moogle knows more about it than I do. He can fill you in.
"Mog:Leave it to me, kupo!"
Setzer:Whew... Sounds like I've gotten myself in a real mess this time.
Setzer:And you say you want me to help you save the world?
Hope:That's right.
"Terra:The world will be destroyed if we don't do something. Setzer, please come with us."
"Setzer:Thanks, but no thanks."
Mog:Kupo!? Why?
"Setzer:No casinos, no pubs... There's nothing to live for here, so why risk my life?"
"Mog:Awww, kupo..."
"Setzer:I'm a wandering gambler. I do what I want, going wherever the wind takes me."
"Shadow:Hmph. You never change, even if the world does."
Setzer:Life is a series of gambles. You've gotta go with your gut.
Setzer:I just want to be the one who rolls the dice.
"Mog:Why do you have to be so difficult, kupo?"
"Setzer:Well, good luck with that saving the world thing. Who knows? Maybe we'll meet again one day."
Hope:What a mysterious person. Are you sure we can trust him?
Shadow:He would no doubt be an excellent addition to our cause.
Shadow:Perhaps an airship really could tilt things in our favor.
"???:Well, I'm impressed."
Setzer:I watched you take care of those monsters.
"Mog:You're back, kupo! It's nice to see you again!"
"Warrior of Light:Setzer, was it? Have you decided to accept our proposal?"
Setzer:Not quite. I'm just trying to figure something out.
Hope:What do you mean?
Setzer:Why do you fight? What are you risking your lives for?
Setzer:There's not a single town or person in this world. Nothing here's worth fighting for.
Warrior of Light:We are no different from youwarriors from another world.
"Warrior of Light:Naturally, we all have homes we must return to and dreams yet to be fulfilled. Surely that is worth fighting for."
"Setzer:Chasing after your dreams, huh?"
Yuffie:Exactly! Take me for example. My dream's to one day steal enough treasure to restore glory to my village!
"Vivi:When I get home, I wanna go to the theater and watch plays every day."
"Hope:No matter what happens, I can't let myself give upfor the sake of my friends and for myself as well. I'm using this opportunity to get stronger."
Warrior of Light:We continue our journey because each of us has something we're looking to accomplish. Is that not enough?
"Setzer:All right, you've got me."
"Setzer:I mean, why not? Consider my life a chip in your pile."
Terra:Do you mean...!?
Setzer:What you said reminded me that I still have a dream like no other. I was a fool.
"Setzer:Sitting around isn't gonna solve anything. You know, sometimes you've just gotta roll the dice and hope for the best."
"Yuffie:I didn't even get half of that, but you sounded cool to me!"
Setzer:I'm a gambler. Deception is but one of my many talents. I'll show you just how rewarding my skills can be in battle.
Warrior of Light:We are counting on you.
"Hope:Yeah, we really appreciate the help."
"Mog:Thanks, everybody, for getting him onboard, kupo!"
Setzer:I can't wait. What could be more exciting than gambling with your own life?
Vivi:What's wrong?
"Setzer:Ever since I came here, all I've done is fight."
"Setzer:Nothing wrong with that, but I have to wonder if there isn't anything else in this world to do for fun."
"Mog:For fun? Our company isn't fun enough, kupo?"
"Setzer:That's not what I meant. I'm talking about entertainmentgambling, games, you know?"
Steiner:...Shooting what?
Tifa:Shooting Coaster. You ride in a cart that zooms down a track full of twists and turns.
"Setzer:Zooms, eh? That does sound like fun."
Cloud:...It's not for everyone.
"Tifa:Oh, uh... Yeah... Not if you're prone to nausea."
"Vivi:Theater plays are probably the most fun in our world, right?"
"Setzer:Theater and card games, huh? Your world sounds a lot like mine."
Cloud:So what's your idea of fun?
Setzer:Gamblingyou could say it's what I live for.
Setzer:I used to play all night at my casino against the top gamblers from around the world.
"Tifa:""At my...""? You run a casino!?"
Setzer:I would love for you to come see it when this is all over.
"Mog:It's too bad we still haven't found a casino in this world, kupo..."
Setzer:The sky is as vast as in any world...
Setzer:I'd be tearing it up if I only had my wings... Heh.
"Yda:Ah, there he is! Hey! Setzer!"
"Edge:What's with the moping? Come on, let's go."
Setzer:See that bird looking down on us?
Edge:Yeah? So what?
"Setzer:Surrendering itself to the wind, hovering in the skywe're on the same planet, yet we live in different worlds."
Yda:Is it just me or is he acting unusually sentimental?
Edge:You think he ate something funny?
Yang:Is everything okay?
"Laguna:What's the holdup, folks?"
"Yda:Setzer has got the blues, if you can believe that!"
Setzer:I'm just tired of treading this earth.
Laguna:Wh-whoa! Don't tell me you're gonna jump off that cliff!
"Yang:Setzer, you're not thinking straight! If you need to talk, I'm here for you!"
Setzer:...That's not what I meant.
"Laguna:Oh, really? Man, don't startle me like that."
Yang:Let's go back to camp. Mog is waiting for us.
Setzer:I'll find a way back and make our wish come true.
Hope:It looks like we've sealed all the Torsions in this area.
Sazh:Then let's fly outta here!
"Vaan:Hey Sazh, let me take a turn at the wheel for once!"
"Sazh:Not in a million years, kid."
"Setzer:Hold up, old man."
Sazh:Old man? You talkin' about me?
Hope:Who else would he be talking about?
"Setzer:Did you just say ""airship""? You have one?"
"Sazh:Of course, I do! You're lookin' at the best pilot this world's ever seen."
"Setzer:I thought you were just some guy in a strange getup from another world, but it looks like we're one and the same after all."
"Sazh:What do you mean ""one and the same""?"
"Vaan:Wait... Setzer, you're a pilot, too?"
"Sazh:What, you too!?"
"Hope:I thought you were a gambler, not a pilot."
Setzer:Don't get me wrong. I do love gamblingto the point that I even built a casino on my airship.
Setzer:But that's not my calling. What I want most is to be the fastest thing soaring across the wide blue yonder.
"Vaan:I know what you mean. One day, I want to be the greatest sky pirate there ever was!"
"Sazh:There's nothing like flying, right!? Man, I'd love to hear some of your stories!"
Shadow:Looks like they really hit it off.
"Mog:I'm glad we're all friends now, kupo!"
Setzer:I'm sure I'll discover new revelations looking down from the clouds on what I once thought was a barren world.
"Setzer:All right, I've made up my mind. I'm going to become the fastest pilot in this world!"
"Setzer:It doesn't matter where you are. If you're going to dream, dream big. Right, old man?"
Sazh:Now that's what I'm talkin' about!
"Vaan:Don't count me out yet! Come on, I challenge you to a race!"
Hope:I wish I had something that I could get excited about.
"Sazh:Hope, you're still young. You've got the rest of your life ahead of you to find something you enjoy."
Hope:You're right. I'll remember that.
"Mog:I sense another Torsion in the area, kupo."
???:Oh? I wasn't expecting an audience.
Warrior of Light:Who goes there?
Vaan:What're you doing here?
Balthier:I should be asking you that. I see you've made some interesting friends.
Vaan:Er...yeah. We're working together to seal the Torsions spreading destruction throughout this world...or something like that.
"Mog:And we're always looking for new friends that can help us, kupo!"
"Cloud:So what does the ""leading man"" want with the Torsion?"
Vivi:Sky pirate? So you're a thief who flies on an airship? That's so cool!
"Balthier:Along with mypartner, I'm afraid. We're not inIvaliceanymore, are we?"
"Mog:Everyone here was summoned from a different world, kupo."
Balthier:If only I had my airship.
"Mog:We have one, kupo! We can take you wherever you want!"
Balthier:Is that so? It appears the moogles here also know their stuff when it comes to machinery.
"Mog:I can feel the light radiating from you, kupo! Come with us!"
"Balthier:You're asking me to trust you, a complete stranger? I'd rather not be murdered today, thank you."
Vaan:What? You don't trust me?
"Balthier:You know how it is. Besides, it's against my policy to work for free."
"Balthier:Well, take care. Maybe we'll meet again."
Vivi:Is he really going to be okay on his own?
"Rem:So the Torsion's up ahead, right?"
Balthier:Hmph. I got my hopes up when I saw you were with a lady. A shame she's but a child.
Cloud:You again? Did you follow us?
Balthier:We're going to the same place. It's only logical that we'd run into each other again.
"Balthier:Are you fighting alongside them too, my dear?"
"Rem:Yes, I'm asoldier, after all. Well, I amback home, at least."
Balthier:At your age? What a barbaric world.
"Balthier:Then again, I guess no world is free of those who exploit the innocent."
"Sazh:Happens where you're from too, huh? Makes you sick, doesn't it?"
"Balthier:Hey, you there. You said you were searching for new allies, correct?"
Balthier:I really hope you have a good reason for recruiting children.
"Mog:Only a select few can close the dimensional distortions eating away at this world, kupo."
Mog:And those are the ones who bear the light.
"Mog:Just like you, kupo!"
Sazh:So what's it gonna be? We could really use the help.
"Balthier:You'd be better off without me. The fewer, the better, as they say."
Vaan:Who says that? I've never felt that way.
Cloud:You have any skills?
Balthier:I can steal certain enemy abilities.
"Balthier:When an enemy enhances its defenses, for example, I can swipe it and take it for myself."
"Mog:You're exactly the kind of person we need right now, kupo!"
Mog:My senses are telling me that the enemy up ahead is tough!
"Rem:I know it's asking a lot, but could you help us?"
"Balthier:You just don't give up, do you? All right, lead the way."
"Yang:Balthier, you said you are a sky pirate."
Balthier:You find that odd?
Yang:You don't see anyone with their own airship where we're from.
Vaan:I thought Cecil had an airship.
Cecil:I commanded a fleet. The airships themselves belonged to the kingdom.
Cecil:Anyone can possess an airship in your world?
"Vaan:Poor people can't afford them, but I guess more people do than in your world."
Balthier:Not to mention the nations waging war on each other with their own fleets.
"Cecil:Instruments...of war... So no matter the world, the concerns are the same."
Balthier:There's a glum face. I'd imagine you had a plum career as a royal knight.
Cecil:Baron is a military state. It used its airships to invade other nations.
Cecil:The innocents I...even under orders...
Vaan:You don't like airships?
Cecil:I have nothing against the technology itself...but when used to plunder...
Balthier:Treasure is my only target.
Balthier:Though I suppose there's no excusing that in the eyes of a straightlaced knight.
Vaan:Sky pirates are different from soldiers and petty thieves. They're free and debonair and everyone looks up to them.
Vaan:Every kid from the slums dreams of becoming a sky pirate. Me included.
Cecil:A love for the sky was the same in my world.
Cecil:But why...why did it turn out that way...?
Balthier:Knights have it tough wherever you go.
"Balthier:Ply the skies all you like, as long as you have something hanging over you, you can hardly call it freedom."
Balthier:...Said the pot to the kettle.
Balthier:Why do you ask? Are you going to go look for her?
"Yuffie:I was thinking I should get one, too. A gal's got her limits, you know? I wanna know how to pick a good one."
Bartz:Balthier's already a force to be reckoned with. I bet they're unstoppable together.
Balthier:For heaven's sake... You'll forgive me if I keep the particulars to myself.
"Hope:Vaan, do you know anything about her?"
Vaan:She's a friend. We traveled together.
"Yuffie:Tell me more, tell me more. Balthier's being a sourpuss."
Vaan:She's real tall and good at magicks... She's got long ears...real grown-up.
Bartz:Like Y'shtola?
"Y'shtola:You all look to be having fun, but what's this about me?"
Yuffie:Vaan's telling us about Balthier's partner.
Balthier:...A right nuisance for her if you think he's doing a good job of it.
Vaan:Then why don't you tell them?
Balthier:They'll know when they meet her. Describing viera to someone from another world will confuse them more than not.
"Y'shtola:So there are avariety of racesin your world, too?"
"Balthier:None likeyourselfto my knowledge, but wehumesaren't the only ones who walk upright, to say the least."
"Yuffie:Long ears and grown-up like Y'shtola, huh...?"
Vaan:They aren't all that alike...though I guess there are some similarities.
"Hope:Even from different worlds, they do have something in common?"
"Vaan:I still have no idea how old she is. Y'shtola, how?"
Balthier:...Grow up.
Hope:...You're being rude.
"Yuffie:Haha, Vaan got in trouble. You're such a kid."
Bartz:...Good point. I wonder how old Y'shtola is. ...Oh well.
Balthier:Well...I guess this belt should suffice as payment.
Balthier:It was a pleasure doing business with you.
"Hope:Um, sir... Would you be interested in fighting with us from now on...permanently?"
Hope:I would feel a lot more comfortable with you on our side.
"Balthier:I commend you for your manners, but you still have a lot to learn, I'm afraid."
Balthier:Man cannot live by goodwill alone. Especially sky pirates. What's in it for me?
Warrior of Light:So you do not share our desire to save the world?
"Balthier:If something were to happen to it, I'll just take to the skies, free as can be."
Vaan:But you don't have your ship.
"Mog:Never fear, kupo! You want an airship? We've got one!"
"Y'shtola:Is a reward truly the only thing you seek? ...Nay, I sense you are worried about someone."
"Y'shtola:And If I may venture a guess, I would say that person is your dear partner, is it not?"
Balthier:You have quite the intuition. I like that.
"Mog:All the more reason you should come with us, kupo!"
Mog:I have the power to find those who bear the light!
Warrior of Light:It would be in your best interest to join us.
"Warrior of Light:After all, finding your partner would be a reward in itself, would it not?"
Hope:Everyone helped me reunite with my friends from back home. I'm sure we can help you too.
Balthier:I guess any self-respecting leading man needs to do something heroic every once in a while.
Balthier:But I'm doing this for me. Don't forget that.
"Mog:Of course, kupo!"
Y'shtola:Perhaps a man can live by goodwill after all.
"Y'shtola:Or maybe it's that the ""leading man"" simply couldn't turn his back on those in need?"
Balthier:Hmph. You can read men like a book.
"???:Zidane! Where are you, Zidane!?"
???:*Sniffle* This isn't how you treat a lady.
???:How could you leave *sniffle* a helpless little girl like me behind? I can't believe you guys.
???:More importantly...where am I? I've never seen this place before.
???:I've got a bad feeling about this. ...Like a monster could come out at any moment.
"Eiko:No, I'm not gonna cry! I'm a grown-up!"
"Eiko:Besides, I'm gonna find them! I just know it!"
"Eiko:Then, I""ll make them pay for leaving me behind! Oh, the nerve!"
"Eiko:Zidane!? Zidane, is that you?"
Eiko:I'll even take Vivi or Steiner! I just want to see somebody I know...
"Eiko:Oh, uh..."
"Eiko:S-sorry for bothering you. So, uh... Catch ya later?"
Eiko:Ahhh! Help! P-please don't eat me!
Eiko:Zidane!
Zidane:Eiko!? Is that really you?
"Eiko:Finally! I've been looking all over for you, Zidane!"
Vivi:We had no idea you were even here! I'm so glad you're okay.
Eiko:Do I look okay?
Eiko:I was so lonely...and hungry... *sniffle*...and a monster even tried to eat me.
Vivi:I...I'm sorry you had to go through that.
"Eiko:By the way, what do you mean by ""here""? Where are we? could someone tell me what's going on?"
"Mog:I can do that, kupo!"
"Eiko:Hey, a moogle! I feel better already."
Cecil:What a cheerful young girl you are. Are you one of Vivi's friends?
"Eiko:Hmph! Me, interested in a little kid like Vivi? Don't make me laugh!"
"Eiko:There's only one man for me. He's older, brave, and has a tail..."
Tifa:Zidane! She's just a little girl!
Zidane:Whoa! Hold up! It's not what you think!
Eiko:Then what is it!?
Mog:Kupo! Can I please explain
Eiko:Two people once separated only to be reunited in a faraway world...
Eiko:Isn't it romantic!? I've always dreamed about this moment!
"Mog:Great! So you'll join us, kupo?"
"Eiko:Of course! Wherever Zidane goes, I go!"
"Bartz:Looks like someone's got a crush on you, Zidane."
"Zidane:Haha, yeah... It's tough being so popular sometimes."
"Eiko:I'll be friends with the rest of you, too! After all, Zidane's friends are my friends!"
"Yuna:I'm looking forward to getting to know you, Eiko."
Yuna:I-is something the matter? Did I say something strange?
Eiko:Looks like I've got myself a rivala beautiful one at that. Just great.
"Eiko:Zidane, a word, please!"
Zidane:Ugh... Why me?
"Yuffie:Eiko, this has been nagging at me, but..."
Yuffie:What's with the horn? Is that a hair accessory?
"Eiko:Nope, it's stuck to my head."
Eiko:Why are you so surprised? Everybody knows that.
Cecil:Is that so...?
"Eiko:Wow, really? You can talk to eidolons even without a horn?"
"Eiko:Hmmm, sounds rough."
"Eiko:Hm? ""We""? You mean there are lots of summoners other than you?"
Eiko:Lots of summoners... A world where you won't be lonely...
"Eiko:Are other worlds like that? What about yours, Yuffie?"
Yuffie:We don't have summoners to begin with.
Eiko:Anyone can use it!?
Eiko:Talk about culture shock. There are all sorts of worlds out there.
"Sazh:Heh heh! Bet you didn't know I'm a summoner, too."
Eiko:Wow! So cute! Does it have a name?
"Yuffie:Oh, nice going, Pops! You know your way to grab the kidlets' hearts."
"Yuna:The chick and Eiko are cute, aren't they?"
"Cecil:Quite. She's always trying so hard, it's nice to see a childlike smile for a change."
Bartz:Ughhh... I'm hungry. Wish I had something to eat...
"Vaan:The beasts here don't make for good cooking, so there's no use in hunting them."
Eiko:Sorry to keep you waiting!
Eiko:The rock-fisted potato stew is ready! Come and get it before it gets cold!
Bartz:Did you say stew?
Eiko:It's my specialty! I gathered all the ingredients and put my heart into it!
Vivi:I gathered most of
Vivi:Uh...never mind...
Bartz:Hooray! Stew! I'm gonna eat till I pop!
"Vaan:Hey, wait! No fair getting a head start!"
Terra:Hehe. Isn't everyone cheerful?
"Bartz:Woof, am I stuffed! I can't remember the last time I ate like this!"
"Terra:Thank you, Eiko. It was delicious."
Eiko:Gosh! Really?
"Zidane:Yeah, it didn't have any ""interesting"" seasonings today."
"Eiko:Well, what else would you expect from a proper lady?"
Vaan:Traveling with you means we get to eat like this?
"Bartz:Man, Zidane and Vivi, you guys have it made!"
"Eiko:Hehehe, right? I'll cook for you anytime you ask, so don't hesitate!"
Vivi:(I guess that means I've got to gather ingredients again.)
Zidane:(I'll pitch in next time.)
Terra:Everyone looks so happy. I suppose I should give cooking a try...
"Mog:We did it! Everything is going according to plan, kupo! The Torsions will all be sealed in no time."
"Eiko:Wow, you're amazing!"
"Eiko:Hey, you have friends and family too, right? Can I meet them?"
"Mog:F-friends, kupo? Family, kupo?"
Mog:I don't have either of those things... I'm just a messenger for the goddess Materia.
Eiko:Really? That's strange.
Terra:A village full of moogles?
"Vivi:Yeah, they're her family."
Terra:I'm so jealous.
"Zidane:Postal workers,merchants,travelers, you name it."
"Bartz:Huh, I had no idea moogles were so different in each world."
"Eiko:It doesn't matter where they're from! They're all the same to me, and I'll always be their friend!"
Eiko:Oh yeah! I have something I wanna give you!
Mog:A kupo nut...kupo?
"Mog:Kupo! This is delicious! I love it, kupo!"
"Eiko:Amazing, right? I'll give you another one after we seal the next Torsion!"
"Mog:I feel like a new moogle! Come on, follow me, kupo!"
Zidane:That's Eiko for ya. She's really good with moogles.
Terra:...I wish I could have a kupo nut.
"???:Seriously though, where am I?"
???:And what was with that puppet back there?
"???:I mean, it was like talking to a brick wall. There was something familiar about it though."
"???:Anyway, I have to find Yuna. If only there were some way to"
"???:Wait, I got it!"
"???:Well, that didn't work."
???:Don't tell me I'm on my own.
???:Argh! Where is everybody!?
Zidane:Yuna? What are you doing all by yourself?
"Yuna:I'm trying to find him. He might have been summoned to this world, too."
"Zidane:Oh... Well, good luck with that."
Edge:G-get away from me! I said I don't want to fight you!
"???:Nice try, puppet! You can't fool me!"
Yuna:That voice! Is that!?
"Zidane:C'mon, let's go!"
"Zidane:Edge, are you all right!?"
Tidus:Yuna!?
Edge:You know this guy? Then can you tell him to back off? He came out of nowhere and started attacking me!
Yuna:I just knew we would find each other.
"Tidus:Is that really you, Yuna?"
"Yuna:Of course, it's me! I'm so happy to see you, Tidus."
"Mog:Hooray for reunions! I think I'm going to cry, kupo!"
"Zidane:Oh, so this is who you were looking for. Glad you found each other."
"Tidus:So those humanoid monsters are called manikins, huh?"
"Edge:Yeah, and you better not confuse me for one again!"
Tidus:I'm really sorry about that.
"Tidus:So, Yuna..."
Tidus:Is that Seymour behind you real or not?
"Mog:Th-that's a manikin, kupo!"
"Zidane:Well, still beats the real thing."
"Tidus:You guys met Seymour? Guess you know what kind of a man he is too, then!"
"Tidus:Real or fake, we've gotta stop him."
Tidus:So make room for me! I'll show you just how quick I really am!
"King:Wakka, I've been wondering... What's your ball for? It doesn't look like it was made for battle..."
Tidus:Me and Wakka are both blitzball athletes!
Firion:Athletes...? I took you for warriors...
Yuna:Blitzball is a sport played with that ball.
"Yuna:The field is underwater, and you compete to steal the ball and bring it to a goal to score points."
"Yuna:It's quite popular in our world, and the best athletes will compete in tournaments in front of spectators."
Firion:You don't say... So that's where you get your agility.
"King:Underwater competition, huh...? Is it for some kind of training?"
Wakka:Entertainment...I guess. Like a festival.
Wakka:It's our job as players to give the fans a good game.
Tidus:Wanna give it a try? I bet you two'd be good at it.
King:...Should the opportunity arise.
King:Your home world was peaceful enough to hold sports tournaments?
Yuna:I think it's something to rely on...
"Yuna:When you live in fear every day, watching blitzball can cheer you up."
Firion:A job that cheers people up? That sounds right up Tidus's alley.
Tidus:Ha ha... I don't really think that much about it during a match.
"Tidus:But if I can cheer people up, I won't complain."
"Firion:I can tell you're skilled by the way you move, and I know nothing about the game. It must be fun to watch."
Tidus:You bet it is. I can't wait to get in front of the crowds again!
"Onion Knight:Tidus, you're from the same world as Seymour, right?"
"Onion Knight:It sounds like you were on opposite sides, but what did he do back then?"
Tidus:I think he was somebody important. Yuna seemed to respect him originally...
"Tidus:Maybe... Everyone trusted him, I guess."
"Penelo:Even though we're talking about your home world, you don't sound so sure."
Tidus:I don't know all there is about Spira.
"Tidus:That's my story, but not actually."
Galuf:Hmm... So you have disparate backgrounds.
Shantotto:And you as an alien would pick up on points to them less salient?
Tidus:I couldn't buy what Seymour was selling.
"Onion Knight:Release in death, right? It's a hard sell for us, too."
Onion Knight:Don't tell me Yuna and Wakka bought into that.
"Tidus:I wouldn't say they bought it, but in Spira...death is always close at hand."
Tidus:Yuna was ready to sacrifice herself to save everybody else.
Penelo:That's awful... What's the point of protecting someone if you can't be there with them?
Tidus:Everyone thought there's no other way.
"Shantotto:With death always close at hand, we all would be better off dead..."
Shantotto:...is the train of thought I suspect runs through Seymour's head.
Galuf:And he'd still push that thought in this world... He's not one to be trusted.
Onion Knight:Though I agree with not wanting to be a slave to the gods.
Penelo:...He scares me.
Penelo:The heart stops moving in the dead. There's no way for us to tell if they're happy or not...
"Shantotto:If Mog can find a use for him, then use him he would."
Shantotto:But that doesn't mean trusting him would do us any good.
"Onion Knight:If he's up to something, you guys would notice it first. When that time comes, we're counting on you."
Tidus:You got it.
"Tidus:I'm not gonna let him ""ease"" any of our ""suffering."""
"Tidus:What is Seymour doing here, anyway? What's he want from us?"
Yuna:Our lives.
Zidane:He said that we were servants to the gods and that we were better off dead.
Tidus:I sure hope we don't run into him anytime soon.
"Mog:Yeah, he's a very dangerous person, kupo. And rude at that!"
Seymour:Death is the ultimate liberation from suffering. Why can't you see that?
"Seymour:Ah, so you were summoned as well?"
Seymour:How amusing. The gods of this world must need all the help they can get.
Cecil:Take that back! Tidus is a warrior of remarkable skill.
Tidus:I knew there was a reason I never liked you!
Seymour:Say what you willfor even those thoughts are but a passing dream.
"Seymour:Now, Lady Yuna, let us put an end to this futile struggle."
Seymour:Embrace the eternal slumber that awaits you.
"Tidus:Lay one finger on her, and you're dead!"
"Yuna:Maester Seymour, I can't let you do that."
Cecil:Our lives are not ours to throw away anymore.
Seymour:Servants of the godsit seems I must release you from your pain.
"Zidane:Well, you heard him, Tidus. What're you gonna do?"
Tidus:I'm Yuna's guardian. I'll protect her no matter what happens.
Tidus:Seymour! It's over for you!
Seymour:There is no use in fighting it.
"Seymour:Come, death shall carry you off into a sweet slumber!"
Seymour:How could I lose to you mindless pawns?
King:Who are you calling a mindless pawn? It's my choice to be here!
"Seymour:Poor creatures, bound by the shackles of life..."
Seymour:The time for liberation is near.
"Tidus:Wait! Seymour, come back!"
Sazh:*Sigh* He sure comes and goes as he pleases.
"Mog:Monsters aren't our only problem, kupo. Who knows when he'll show up again."
"Sazh:It's gonna be a tough journey, kid. You up for it?"
Tidus:Bring it on.
Tidus:I told you guys already. I'm gonna protect Yuna no matter what.
King:Looks like it's settled then.
"Tidus:From now on, we're a team."
Tidus:And what kind of star player would I be if I didn't look out for you guys? Let's do this!
"Mog:Yay! Welcome to our team, kupo!"
"Mog:There's a Torsion in here, kupo! I can feel it!"
Penelo:No one let your guard down. Who knows what might be lurking in the shadows.
King:The heck are you?
Prishe:I'm Prishe! My fists and I are cleaning up the monsters around here. Nice to meet ya!
"Onion Knight:Well, aren't you the cheerful one."
Warrior of Light:I sense an exceptional power within hersomething grand.
Prishe:Hm? What's up? Something on my face?
"Warrior of Light:No, it's nothing."
"King:At the very least, it doesn't look like you're the enemy. ...Care to join us?"
"Mog:I can sense the light within her! She's one of us, kupo!"
"Warrior of Light:Prishe, we are also on a journey to defeat the monsters that terrorize this world."
Prishe:Really? What a coincidence!
Prishe:Looks like there's only one way to settle this: first one to defeat all the monsters wins!
Penelo:W-wait... You're turning this into a game?
Prishe:Yep! What better motivation than a little competition?
"Prishe:Well, catch ya later! Don't get yourselves killed!"
Prishe:You monsters are gonna be sorry when I find you!
"Mog:She could have at least listened to what I had to say, kupo."
Onion Knight:We'll just have to explain things next time we run into her.
Prishe:Ughhh... It's not...over yet.
"Shantotto:Oh, what is this I see? Already giving up on your killing spree?"
Prishe:If only...I had something to eat...I wouldn't have lost.
"Zidane:Something to eat? What, you trying to feed the monsters or something?"
"Prishe:No, you dummy! Something for me to eat!"
Prishe:I'm so hungry I can barely move. You guys got anything?
Warrior of Light:Very well. You may eat with us.
"Yang:Mog, let us feast and appease her hunger."
"Mog:Right on it, kupo!"
"Prishe:Wow, that was delicious! Thanks a bunch."
Mog:Kupo! You almost cleaned us out.
Prishe:My bad! I haven't had anything in days! Not a single eatery in sight around here.
"Zidane:So I'm guessing you came here from another world, too?"
Prishe:Another world? The heck you talking about?
"Yang:I know this may surprise you, but you have been summoned to another world."
"Mog:We're searching for people like you to help us close the Torsions, kupo."
"Prishe:Oh, okay! I don't get it, but gotcha!"
"Prishe:I mean I don't really understand what's going on, but I totally get that you need my help."
Warrior of Light:That should do for now.
"Prishe:Have no fear, Prishe is here! One good Howling Fist and those monsters are toast!"
Shantotto:That's a rather optimistic mood when just moments ago you were crying for food.
Prishe:Heh! I'm countin' on you guys to keep me full!
Zidane:I hope there's enough for the rest of us...
Prishe:Ughhh... So hungry...
Penelo:But we just ate. You sure are a bundle of energy.
Prishe:That doesn't change the fact that ...Hm?
Prishe:Sniff... Sniff sniff sniff...
Prishe:Ahhh! Y-you!
"Prishe:You smell like food! Let me have some, too!"
Steiner:I beg your pardon? I don't see how I could possibly smell of... Ah!
Steiner:I-I cannot! These pickles are my treasure!
Layle:A faint stench just wafted this way. You sure those are edible?
Tifa:They don't look that tasty...
"Steiner:These are the specialty of a certaincityin ourworld! A divisive delicacy, to be sure, but they are my favorite!"
Prishe:Ahhh! That aroma is riling up my appetite! Leeet meee have some!
"Steiner:Lady Prishe, I do believe we will get along well together."
"Steiner:Be that as it may...since coming to this world, I fear these pickles are an unobtainable commodity..."
"Steiner:Therefore I, too, have chosen to refrain from eating any! Lady Prishe, I beg your understanding!"
"Prishe:Hrmmm... Alright. If that's the way it is, I guess them's the breaks."
Prishe:But I'm hungry I'm hungry I'm hungry!
Layle:Here we go again.
Prishe:I wanna eat behemoth steak! A prime cut with all that marbling!
"Vaan:Behemoth is good, isn't it? Tasty, and fetches a nice price at the bazaar."
Tifa:Huh!? You can eat behemoth!?
Layle:You can't be serious...
Prishe:We need a behemoth... I need to show you all what you're missing.
Tifa:I think I'll pass.
"Steiner:Hmm, I see, I see. This sounds like another delicacy."
Firion:Hunting down a Torsion in a palace this big is no easy task.
"Firion:How is everyone holding up? If you need to take a break, just"
"Firion:...Wait, where's Prishe?"
Mog:Kupo! She was just here!
Galuf:Hrm. I didn't even notice she was gone. How unobservant of me.
King:Unilateral action during an operation poses a very real hazard. What could she be thinking...?
Zell:I wouldn't worry. She'll turn up before you know it.
"Prishe:Heyyy, guys!"
Zell:See? Back already.
"Mog:Kupooo! Acting on your own is a problem, kupo! Don't run off like that!"
"Prishe:Yeah, whatever you say! I just did a quick lap around the place! Found the Torsion, too!"
"Mog:One hundred percent unapologetic, kupo..."
Galuf:You covered the entire palace? Astonishing. And you were fine all by yourself?
"Prishe:Huh? Sure, why not?"
Prishe:Being alone's never been something for me to worry about.
"Firion:Don't tell me you closed the Torsion all by yourself, too. That would be far too reckless..."
"Prishe:Heck, no! It's more fun when everyone else is there, too!"
"Zell:Heheh, mighty kind of ya! Let me in on that action, too!"
Prishe:You got it! The Torsion's this way! Follow me!
"Galuf:Goodness gracious. Pep in spades, that one. I'm impressed..."
King:Let's keep up.
Firion:...I guess that means everyone's holding up well.
"Mog:Kupo! That doesn't fix my mood, kupo!"
"Firion:Hey, all's well that ends well. We found the Torsion thanks to her, too."
"Mog:That's true, kupo, but..."
Firion:Cheer up. Let's go.
"Mog:We sealed the Torsion, kupo!"
"Prishe:Heh, I even amaze myself sometimes!"
"Prishe:All right, then. Time to eat!"
Hope:She sure doesn't hold back how she feels.
"Rem:Yeah, I was thinking the same thing."
"Prishe:Rem, are you jealous?"
Rem:Huh!? H-how did you know!?
Prishe:I know what people are thinking. Not like I want to though. It just happens.
Warrior of Light:Are you implying that you can read minds?
Prishe:Nothin' so fancy as that. Let's just say I went through a lot when I was young.
Bartz:When you were young? You still look plenty young to me.
Rem:It sounds like there's a lot more to you than meets the eye.
"Prishe:Yeah, but don't worry about it. Just 'cause I can read your mind doesn't mean I'm gonna do something funny."
"Prishe:I don't like snooping into other people's business, and besides...I honestly don't care what other people think."
"Prishe:Anyway, let's get something to eat! I'm starving!"
Hope:I'm not sure I can keep up with her...
"Prishe:Oh, come on! Don't be like that! Let's be friends!"
Prishe:Things are about to get exciting! I can feel it.
"Mog:I hope she didn't read my mind, kupo..."
"Zidane:Guys, I think I see someone! Come on, they might be hurt!"
"Mog:We have to help them, kupo!"
Zidane:Are you all right? Hey!
Bartz:Whoa! Hold up. That looks likeFaris!?
Tifa:Somebody you know?
"Bartz:Yeah, we traveled the world together back home."
"Bartz:Faris, you okay!? It's me, Bartz!"
"Bartz:This isn't good. Breathing, but barely. We've gotta do something."
Tifa:He must have nearly drowned...which leaves us with only one choice.
Cloud:What are you looking at me for?
Tifa:You know mouth-to-mouth.
"Zidane:Did somebody say ""mouth-to-mouth""? Like mouth-to-mouth resuscitation?"
Zidane:Don't you worry! One hot resuscitation coming right up!
Faris:Ungh... Where am I?
Cloud:Looks like you're off the hook.
Zidane:Guess I am...
"Mog:I can sense the light in this one as well. First aid on the double, kupo!"
"Zidane:I've got this! A little potion here, and..."
"Zidane:...But gosh, what a looker."
Bartz:You're gonna get it if you keep gawking.
"Zidane:Uh-oh, I've gotta watch out for the bodyguard, too."
Rem:Bodyguard? What's he talking about?
Cloud:Beats me.
Rem:Zidane doesn't usually get this excited around other guys...
Cloud:Maybe he switched sides.
Steiner:Hmmm...
Y'shtola:Is there something on your mind?
"Bartz:Hey, everybody!"
Bartz:Faris finally woke up.
"Zidane:Hey, there! I'm glad you're okay."
Faris:I was told you all helped me. Please allow me to express my gratitude.
Faris:I'm the pirate captain Faris. Nice to meet you.
Steiner:A pirate!?
"Faris:My ship was sucked into a strange whirlpool, and I was separated from my men."
Faris:I found myself in unknown waters where my ship was attacked by monsters. I barely escaped with my life.
Faris:...Is something the matter?
"Steiner:Indeed, there is! I have no interest in consorting with the likes of a criminal! Begone!"
"Zidane:Oh brother, there he goes again."
Steiner:Ack! N-now that you mention it...!
Y'shtola:You were unaware till this moment?
"Steiner:Sea pirates, sky pirates, bandits... Why do I attract so many ne'er-do-wells?"
"Bartz:Don't sweat the small stuff. Faris, you're coming with us, right?"
"Faris:The monsters are coming out of those Torsions you spoke of, aye? Payback is in order for what they did to my ship."
"Faris:I'm happy to see you, but I'm worried about my men..."
Steiner:You say...you're worried about your men?
"Faris:Aye, the whirlpool that got my ship might have gotten the lads as well."
Steiner:...The compassion you have for your subordinates is most admirable...
"Steiner:Master Faris, please forgive my insolence! I must extend my most sincere"
"Faris:Oh, shove off. You don't need to apologize."
"Faris:Anyway, I know my way around water. If you need a fella to help clean up the monsters around here, look no further!"
Zidane:Great! Can't wait to see you at work!
"Y'shtola:...""Fella,"" is it? I see."
"Laguna:Hey, Eiko, you hanging in there?"
Eiko:Y-yeah! I'm fine!
Squall:You aren't having trouble keeping up with our grown-up steps?
Eiko:Of course not! I'm already grown-up anyway!
Yuffie:That's what a kid would say...
Faris:We'll be walking a while longer. Don't push yourself.
"Firion:You know, Faris, you're awfully nice for a pirate."
"Faris:What's that supposed to mean, ""For a pirate""?"
Firion:I have a lot...rougher impression of pirates. A band of them nearly robbed me blind once...
"Faris:Ahh, now I see."
"Faris:Aye, I'm a pirate. But that doesn't mean I assault anyone and everyone."
"Faris:Naturally I'd be concerned for my comrades, hear?"
Faris:Pirates raised me from a wee brat... The crew's like my family.
Yuffie:I get it. You're like a pirate among pirates.
"Yuffie:Oh, yeah! I've got a pirate question! What's the trick for guaranteed treasure stealing!?"
Faris:Trick to stealing? I wish I knew.
"Faris:Once your prey is in your sights, it's yours! Something in that spirit is probably important."
"Yuffie:Gee, I didn't expect a motivational slogan..."
"Faris:...But anyway, Yuffie, let me say this much."
Faris:You must never steal from the weak or the poor. Never forget your honor under any circumstances.
Yuffie:O-okay...I'll keep that in mind...
"Eiko:Hmm, what a tour de force. There's nothing like the real thing."
Squall:...Do you know what she's talking about?
"Laguna:Ooh! Straight from the pulpit, too! It's not every day you get to meet a really real pirate!"
"Laguna:That settles it! When I get back home, I'm gonna write up a full piece on you!"
"Laguna:I'll call it: ""The Pirate Way - A True Story""! Oh man, it'll fly off the racks!"
Squall:(...Who would read that...?)
Faris:Do as you like...
"Galuf:How are you doing, Faris? Getting along well with your new party?"
"Faris:Aye, swimmingly. More'n a few odd ones...but it's a good-natured lot."
Bartz:Really? That's good to hear!
Bartz:Huh? What's that?
Tidus:Whew! Haven't had a refreshing swim like that in forever! Nothing beats the ocean!
Galuf:A leisurely dip must be nice...
"Tidus:I don't know about ""leisurely."" I gotta keep up with my training, too."
"Tidus:Oh, hey! Faris, how about a lap or two? I'll bet pirates are ace swimmers!"
"Faris:I'll...take a rain check. I'd drown in these clothes, after all."
Tidus:Those clothes? Just go in your skivvies then.
"Faris:Er, well... I, uh..."
"Tidus:...? Well, it was just a suggestion."
"Tidus:Anyway, I'm going back in!"
"Galuf:...Not everyone's picked up on it yet, eh?"
"Bartz:It's up to Faris to say something whenever the time is right, right?"
"Faris:...If only I knew whenever that time might be. I can tell no one here would give me grief about it, but even so..."
"Vivi:Hey, guys!"
Vivi:Let's build a sand castle! A real big one!
Eiko:Sand castles are so childish...
"Eiko:But if we're gonna build one, we're gonna do it right!"
Vivi:It was your idea in the first place...
Bartz:A sand castle? Count me in!
"Vivi:Mr. Galuf, Miss Faris, you guys come, too! We'll be waiting for you!"
"Faris:Did he just call me...""Miss""?"
Galuf:Ho ho ho! There's no fooling the eyes of a child!
"Faris:We're coming for you, Lamia Queen! Don't let up, you landlubbers!"
Zidane:Heh heh.
Faris:...What're you smirking about?
"Zidane:Oh, nothing. Just thinking how nice it is to be around a swashbuckling sweetie for a change."
Faris:A what...!?
"Sazh:Zidane, you feelin' alright? I get Faris is good looking...but a ""sweetie""?"
"Tifa:Hold on... Faris, are you a woman?"
"Faris:...Well, looks like the cat's outta the bag."
Faris:You got a problem with it?
"Tifa:Bartz, why didn't you say anything!?"
Bartz:I didn't know I was supposed to?
Cloud:How did you know?
"Zidane:Cloud, Cloud, Cloud... Who do you think I am? I know a lady when I see one."
"Tifa:But Faris, why'd you let us think you're a man?"
Faris:It's how I grew up. Would you want to be the only girl on a ship full of pirates?
Cloud:You didn't have a choice. But you don't need to pretend you're someone else around us.
Tifa:Well aren't you the sweetest? Or are you saying that because you've been in her shoes?
"Bartz:Her shoes? Cloud, don't tell me..."
Sazh:I don't know what to believe anymore.
Cloud:...Sometimes you don't have a choice.
"Bartz:Anyway, no more secrets! We're all in this together!"
Sazh:I don't think I can handle any more secrets from this group...
Vivi:What an eerie castle.
"Zidane:Careful, Vivi. It's probably haunted."
Cloud:Who cares? We fight monsters every day.
Warrior of Light:A departed spirit could still prove to be a threat.
"Zidane:Right? So as I was saying, we need to"
"???:Stop right there, bandits, or die in obscurity!"
"Cloud:Bandits? Zidane, you do something to this guy?"
"Zidane:No way! ...I think. I mean, I'm pretty sure I didn't..."
Vivi:Are you...a ghost?
"Warrior of Light:No, he's human."
"???:A swordsman, a knight, and a black mage... They must have banded together and turned this abandoned castle into their headquarters."
Ramza:I am Ramza Beoulve. I cannot allow those who bring chaos to threaten the lives of the people!
Cloud:He thinks we're bandits. What do you want to do?
Zidane:Guess we'll just have to knock some sense into him.
Warrior of Light:Prepare for battle!
Ramza:It's not...over yet!
"Hope:Excuse me, but are you okay? You know, we don't want to fight"
Ramza:Vile banditsusing children to do their dirty work.
"Penelo:Ramza, can we talk?"
"Mog:Is everybody okay, kupo!?"
Ramza:A moogle!? It can't be! The last of their race should have expired long ago!
"Mog:Maybe in your world, kupo."
Ramza:In my world? What do you mean by that?
Ramza:I remember now. I was sucked into some sort of giant portal.
"Ramza:At the time, I thought it an illusion cast by a hostile mage."
Zidane:We're actually on a journey to close those Torsions in order to protect this world and our own.
Ramza:I apologize for accusing you of being bandits.
Ramza:Ivalice is the name of a kingdom. ...I don't understand your meaning.
"Mog:It looks like your worlds have some things in common, but are in different dimensions and eras, kupo."
"Vaan:Huh, didn't know that was a thing."
"Ramza:So you're trying to save this world to protect your own, correct?"
Ramza:May I join you? I'm certain I could be of service.
"Mog:You also harbor the light, kupo! So of course, we'd love to have you!"
Ramza:Thank you. I really appreciate it.
Ramza:I swear by my sword to fight only for what is just.
Cloud:The Torsion is close.
Squall:...Yeah. Time to check our gear...right?
Ramza:A level-headed assessment of the situation. It is heartening to have you two at our sides.
Ramza:Your fine sword arms attest to the wealth of experience under your belts.
Squall:...That's what I trained for. I'm a mercenary.
Ramza:Of course. That makes sense.
Ramza:I trained at military akademy and now make my way as a mercenary also.
Ramza:I sense our lots are not so different.
"Ramza:Which reminds me. Lightning, I have been meaning to ask:"
Ramza:It is quite a curious blade you swing; can I assume you also undertook some special study?
"Lightning:I'm a soldier, deployed wherever I was needed. Mainly patrolling the frontier and controlling wildlife..."
Ramza:I see... It must have been hard on you.
Lightning:There's something I want to protect. I never thought it hard.
Tidus:Mercenaries and soldiers... Heck if I get where you all're coming from.
Ramza:You haven't martial backgrounds? Then where learnt you your swordsmanship?
Ramza:An amateur!? And yet you're able to hold your own against these beasts!?
Tidus:Guess it just comes down to guts!
"Ramza:And what about you, Vaan? Had you a teacher?"
"Vaan:I watched Penelo learning basic self-defense... Oh, and maybe picked up a thing or two hunting."
Ramza:To grow so capable on self-instruction... One truly can draw on all sorts of experiences in battle.
"Ramza:It would seem there is yet much for me to learn here. Tidus, might you teach me this blitzball when you have the time?"
Tidus:Huh? You wanna play blitzball?
"Ramza:And Vaan, tooI would be ever so pleased if you would impart unto me the secrets of hunting."
Vaan:I don't know if there's any secrets to it... You just hunt.
"Lightning:...Don't push yourself, kid. Being a perfect mimic doesn't necessarily make you any mightier."
"Edgar:Ah, Vanille, won't you set my heart alight with sweet nothings?"
"Vanille:Huh? I'm, uh, not sure I follow you."
"Edge:With you around, even this run-down castle looks like a sparkling palace!"
"Vanille:Wow, this old dump? You've sure got a rosy view of the world."
"Edge:...A tough nut, this one."
Edgar:You can say that again...
Ramza:How are they able to engage in such frivolity in the height of our conflict...?
"Balthier:Not to your taste, Mr. Mercenary? Or envious, rather?"
"Irvine:You know, Edgar and Edge bothone's a king and the other's a prince. World's a funny place, ain't it?"
Ramza:A king and a prince!? Those two!?
"Balthier:That surprising, is it?"
"Ramza:Where I come from, to see royalty making merriment with commoners would be unthinkable."
Edge:The heck? What a dull world that must be.
Edgar:Titles are trivial. Feed them to the monsters for all I care.
Vanille:You won't see me paying them any mind.
Ramza:But if one does not carry one's self in a manner appropriate his station...
"Balthier:Stubborn one, aren't we? Try looking at the man rather than the title."
Balthier:We have here a skirt-chasing king and profligate prince. ...They're whom you would hold in esteem?
"Edge:Hey! Don't you lump me in with those bozos, whoever they are!"
"Irvine:Anyway, a king or a prince or whatever is still just a human after all."
Ramza:Just a human...blue-blooded though they may be...
Ramza:Have I been too caught up in notions of station...?
"Vanille:Uh-oh, I think he's brooding..."
Balthier:Perhaps rightly so...
"Balthier:Old habits die hard. Simply try taking things a mite easier for now, eh?"
Ramza:The concepts of borders and social status don't exist in this world? ...So that's why there's no war.
"Rem:Your world is at war, as well?"
Ramza:Yesa fruitless battle where countless innocent people suffer and die because of the warped views of a few.
Ramza:Rem am I right to assume that your world too is...?
"Rem:So somewhere along the line, I stopped thinking about it. It looks like you're really working on making a difference though."
Ramza:I'm trying.
"Laguna:Whoa, pretty heavy stuff to talk about for a bunch of kidlets."
"Ramza:Laguna, you handle firearms. Am I correct to assume you spent time on the field of battle?"
Laguna:That was a looong time ago. I quit the army and now I'm a journalistahema soon-to-be journalist!
Laguna:Maybe I'll write about my time here when I get home. Doubt anyone'd believe me though.
Ramza:Interesting... The way you have chosen to live your life has given me hope.
"Ramza:Everyone in my world is prisoner to their birth or status, but I've always felt that was ridiculous."
Terra:It's never too late to start over in life. A certain someone once showed me that.
"Terra:What's important is not your past, but your future."
Vivi:Yeah... I feel the same way.
Vivi:I used to worry over and over about why I was born and what was going to happen to me when I expire.
"Vivi:But as time went by, talking to my friends, I realized that worrying about it was pointless."
"Rem:We can't choose why we were born, but we can choose what to live for."
"Ramza:Thank you, my new friends. You have given me the inspiration I needed."
Ramza:It is neither one's birth nor status that matters. What's important is how you live your life.
"Mog:The light within Ramza is growing brighter by the second, kupo!"
"Rem:That's your chocobo, right?"
"Bartz:Yeah, he's basically my best friend. We'd go everywhere together."
Bartz:I wonder what he's up to right now? I sure hope he's not lonely without me.
"Mog:It came from over there, kupo!"
Rem:It sounds like it's in trouble.
Bartz:Just you wait! I'm coming to save you!
Red Giant:......
???:Not another step!
Bartz:We're here to help!
Ace:Rem? Is that you!?
Ace:I need some backup!
"Mog:It's hurt bad! We've gotta do something, kupo!"
Bartz:We'll take care of the monster! You take care of the chocobo!
Ace:Thanks. I owe you one.
"Bartz:All right, you giant hunk of scrap metal, let's do this!"
Chocobo:Kweh...
Ace:Is there nothing we can do?
Bartz:...What's that?
"Bartz:All right, I'll make sure to let him know."
Bartz:The chocobo wanted to thank you.
Ace:I'm sorry I couldn't save you.
Ace:If only I had gotten here a little faster...
Yuna:You did everything you could.
Ace:I was so relieved to see something I recognized in these unfamiliar lands...
"Ace:When I saw it being attacked, I rushed over, but..."
Cecil:You blame yourself for what happened?
Ace:I feel so powerless...
Cecil:You do not have to carry that burden alone.
"Bartz:Yeah, we're all in this together. So what do you say? Wanna come with us?"
"Bartz:You don't mind, right, Mog?"
"Mog:The more the merrier, kupo. I can feel a gentle, warm light radiating from him as well."
"Bartz:Further proof that you can't love chocobos and be a bad person, huh?"
Yuna:Your kindness is a powerful toolone that I'm sure will save many.
"Ace:All right, I'll come with you. I'd like to hear more about this world as well."
"Ace:Oh yeah, I almost forgot. I'm Ace. I'm anAgito CadetatAkademeiajust like Rem."
"Bartz:Then it's settled. From now on, when you've got something to protect, we've got your back."
Ace:Thanks. I appreciate it.
Ace:I've been wondering. Who's your commander?
Vanille:Commander? No one in particular.
Ace:I thought so... A unit without a commander is pretty unusual.
"Edge:Oh-ho! I get it! In that case, let ol' Edge here take command!"
Vanille:I can fight without your help. How's that sound?
Shantotto:No one orders me around.
Shadow:...I'll pass.
Edge:Ha! I knew you'd say that! You guys aren't the type to take orders.
Ace:Everyone here is more like...an autonomous collective than troops.
"Vanille:Although, hey, Shadow, don't you have a leader?"
"Shadow:A ""client."""
Shadow:He leaves it up to us how to carry out our operations.
"Ace:You don't take orders, but act on your own judgment..."
Ace:I wonder if I'm capable of that...
Shantotto:You know what I think of doing someone else's work? I could count on one hand how many stink bats I give.
Shantotto:You're in an entirely different world from that army now. You can at least decide on your own how to live.
Ace:I've never thought about it. I've always spent everything looking out for those around me...
Vanille:Looking out for others sounds fine to me.
Edge:Ain't that enough? Just keep living that way.
Ace:Do you really think so...?
"Vivi:Yeah! It sounds just like you, too!"
Ace:...Thank you. I wouldn't have expected to find an answer so close at hand.
Ace:I'll fight to protect my friends. That's how I'll live.
Chocobo:Kweh kweeh! Kweeh!
"Mog:Kupo, kupo... Okay, got it, kupo!"
"Ace:Mog, what are you discussing?"
"Mog:Kupo! We just got some good intel, kupo!"
"Mog:They said, ""There are really strong monsters pas here, so be careful,"" kupo!"
Tidus:Really? Glad we found out sooner than later.
Bartz:Thanks! You two make for fine chocobo!
Chocobo:Kweh! Kweeeh!
Ace:Wh-what's this all of a sudden?
"Mog:Kupo! They've sure taken a liking to you, kupo."
Ace:I can see that... But I didn't do anything.
Bartz:Maybe they can smell that other chocobo on you.
Tidus:They think you're one of them!
Ace:...I wonder about that.
"Ace:I'm sorry I couldn't save your friend... Watch out for monsters, okay?"
Chocobo:Kweh kweeh!
"Ace:Come on, time to get going."
"Mog:Let's get going ourselves! There's a Torsion nearby, kupo!"
Bartz:Here we go!
"Bartz:By the way, did they say anything about Boko?"
"Mog:I-I didn't ask, kupo..."
Tidus:Hm? What's the matter? Did they peck you?
"Ace:No, it's nothing..."
Tidus:It doesn't look like nothing.
"Ace:...Really, please don't worry about it. Let's get going."
Tidus:...He still feels bad about it. I guess I can't blame him...
Ace:...It feels so weird.
Rem:What do you mean?
Ace:I can still remember that chocobo who died.
Wakka:Course you do. Why wouldn't you?
"King:In our world, we forget those who die."
Wakka:Gimme a break! That's insane!
Ace:It's normal for us though. All we can do is forget the past and move on.
Vivi:I know how much it hurts when you lose someone close to you.
"Vivi:But forgetting them sounds even worse. That's not weird, is it?"
Ace:I haven't been able to stop thinking about that chocobo. ...It's like there's a lump in my throat.
Vivi:But...I bet it's really happy to know that.
Vivi:The chocobo. It can tell how much you cared.
King:The happiness of the deceased... Never thought about it that way.
"Wakka:This is the first time you guys remember someone who died, ya?"
Wakka:You rather you didn't remember? Is it better how things were in your world?
"Ace:I don't know. It's something we'd take for granted, so I can't even compare."
Vivi:You never knew what it felt like to be left behind...
"Ace:No, but as long as we're here, I'm sure we'll come to understand the feeling."
"Wakka:Whoa, don't talk like that! We're not letting anyone die, hear?"
Ace:Sorry. Of course I didn't mean it like that. I'm not going to let anyone get hurt.
"Ace:It's just...if we can feel it, I think we can understand it."
Ace:If I ever feel this pain again...I'll be ready to accept it.
Mog:Spiritus said he still has use for Seymour.
"Mog:We could really use his help too, kupo. If only I had the dimensional coordinates..."
"Shantotto:What a big mouth you have, my dearas if you wanted us to hear."
"Penelo:Hey, Mog? It kind of sounds like you want to be friends with Seymour."
"Warrior of Light:But why, when that man would make enemies of us?"
"Mog:P-please don't look at me like that, kupo."
"Mog:Our goal is to stop the Torsions from destroying the world, kupo."
"King:And by any means, is it?"
Shantotto:The hairball makes a fine point to discussthat man possesses the same light as us.
Warrior of Light:Those who can seal the Torsions can open them as well. But even then...
Penelo:That man frightens me though. How can someone believe that death is a good thing?
"Penelo:Besides, do you really think Yuna would be okay with that?"
King:I'm with Penelo on this one. We don't even know what happened between them back in their world.
Shantotto:All our thoughts are mere idle chatter. What has the fellow in question to say on the matter?
Mog:Seymour was summoned to this world by a different god.
"Mog:So he wouldn't necessarily join us. He'd just lend us a hand when we needed him, kupo."
Mog:That's why we can't force him to help.
"King:Well we're not gonna get anywhere arguing about it here. I mean, we don't even know when we'll see him again, you know?"
"Penelo:Wait, Mog... Do you know something that we don't? Like"
Warrior of Light:Behind you!
King:What a coincidence. ...Or is this actually what you were hoping for?
"Mog:Th-this isn't exactly what I was expecting, kupo!"
"Penelo:Not ""exactly,"" huh? Which means you were kind of expecting for this to happen?"
"Mog:N-no, that's not what I meant. Come on, you can trust me, kupo."
Seymour:Look who we have here. ...Hmph. It appears their trust in the moogle is wavering.
Seymour:Perhaps this is a blessing in disguise.
Yuna:Maester Seymour!? Is everyone okay!?
"Seymour:Lady Yunaalways trying to protect others, even at the cost of your own life. Very well. I shall give you the death you so desire."
"Warrior of Light:Everyone, on your guard!"
Seymour:Do not tell me that's all you have got.
"Seymour:Especially youit is as though you have some doubt in what you call the ""light."""
Warrior of Light:Doubt? I...
Yuna:What's wrong? Everybody's acting funny.
"Steiner:To tell the truth, Lady Yuna, Mog was talking about Seymour while you weren't here."
Steiner:He proposed that we get this scoundrel to help us.
Yuna:What!?
Mog:Everyone here was summoned to this world by a godmeaning everyone wields the power to seal the Torsions.
Seymour:Do not be absurd. What reason would I have to help you?
Seymour:Our visions are incompatible.
"Onion Knight:Hey, it's not like I wanna be around you, either."
Onion Knight:But do you really think you can get anywhere by yourself?
Warrior of Light:You would be naive to trust this man.
Onion Knight:I just want to hear what he has to say. I don't plan on being friends with him.
"Onion Knight:Mog said he doesn't have to come with us on our journey, but we could really use him in battle if he's willing."
Yuna:But why!? This isn't right!
Seymour:What's right in our eyes is none of his concern.
"Onion Knight:With light, you have darkness. Harmony is only truly found in the balance of opposites."
"Steiner:Maybe that's the case where you're from, but do you really believe that applies to this world as well?"
Seymour:Hmph... Very well. The dimensional coordinates are yours.
"Mog:Does that mean you'll help us, kupo!?"
Yuna:This can't be! You can't trust that man!
"Onion Knight:We won't let anything happen. We'll only summon him when we need him, right?"
"Mog:Exactly, kupo. It's only for when we need his help in battle."
Warrior of Light:But why would he agree to assist us so easily? Could it be to uncover Mog's motives?
"Onion Knight:Probably something like that. ...And he probably wants to figure out what these gods are up to, as well."
Steiner:I understand this must be hard for you.
"Yuna:For now, I just need some time to myself."
Warrior of Light:It troubles us as well. We mustn't let our guards down.
"Wakka:Hey, Yuna. About Seymour... He hasn't tried anything funny yet, ya know?"
Yuna:But who knows when he'll betray us. It's hard to fight when you always have to watch your back.
"Cecil:Yes, it bothers me, too. His beliefs are far beyond odious."
Cecil:What was Mog thinking? Just what could he be preparing us to fight?
Firion:Our organization also had doubts about Mog's motives.
"Wakka:The Returners, ya?"
Firion:Shadow's already informed them about Seymour.
Shadow:Our client's a cautious man. I'm sure he'll be able to uncover the truth.
"Yuna:We really don't know anything yet, do we?"
"Cecil:Right now, we basically share the same goal as Mog, so we're working together."
Cecil:But what happens if there's a conflict of interest?
"Wakka:Yeah, what would we do in this deranged world without a guide? We'd be helpless."
"Firion:If that ever happened, you could come join us. Right, Shadow?"
Shadow:Not a bad idea.
Yuna:What we believe and who we protect is something we have to decide for ourselves.
"Mog:Ready to go, kupo?"
"Cecil:Yes, let's go, everyone."
"Firion:I want to believe that Mog's a good guy who's simply trying to protect the world, but..."
Shadow:Let him continue thinking he has us right where he wants us. We'll find out soon enough.
Firion:You're right. He can't force us to do anything against our will.
Firion:We just need to keep an eye on Seymour...and Mog as well.
Shadow:That's what I plan to do.
Eiko:...What should I do? I'm lost.
Eiko:Oooh! The nerve! How could they leave me behind like this!
Eiko:...What...was that noise?
Eiko:Aiee! A giant monster! S-somebody help meee!
???:Get down.
Eiko:Y-you're...
Seymour:All alone in a place like this... What happened to your friends?
"Raijin:There she is! Missing child found, ya know!"
Zidane:Seymour! What do you think you're doing!
Zidane:You won't be walking away from here if I don't like your answer!
Eiko:Zidane! You've got it all wrong!
"Eiko:A monster was after me, and he saved me!"
Zidane:What? This guy!?
"Raijin:I get it! He had a change of heart, ya know?"
Seymour:A change of heart? Hah. ...You are grossly mistaken.
"Seymour:Were the girl to die, I do believe your morale would be shaken. That would be problematic."
Zidane:...Exploitative as ever.
"Seymour:...Now, if you'll excuse me..."
Eiko:Um... Th-thanks for saving me...
Seymour:...Keep your thanks. You shall meet your end by my hand in time...
Zidane:I can never tell what that snake is thinking...
Fujin:RESOLVED. FORGET.
"Raijin:I know how ya feel, but all's well that ends well, ya know?"
Zidane:Yeah...but still...
Tidus:Hrmmm... I still don't like it.
Yuna:You mean about Maester Seymour?
Tidus:I can't trust him. I get chills fighting alongside him.
"Wakka:Mog made it clear he's only around to help in battle, but..."
Wakka:It's a hard pill to swallow.
"Edgar:Frankly, it surprised me, too, to hear Seymour would join this side."
Edgar:His ideology is madness itself.
"Shantotto:In death, relief... Why does he so adhere to that belief?"
Wakka:It was hoped he might be a bridge between the races.
"Edgar:A bridge... I can appreciate that hope. ...I expect there were those prejudiced against it, too."
"Yuna:Yes. In his youth, he was persecuted by the Guado for his impure ancestry."
"Edgar:And from that trauma, he lost hope in life itself...?"
"Wakka:It almost sounds reasonable, talking to you like this. But to heck if we can understand it."
Shantotto:Ruin's aesthetic? How pathetic.
Irvine:Do you need to understand it?
"Irvine:I mean, everybody has it rough at some time or another."
"Irvine:The way I see it, life is about somehow getting over it and moving on."
"Edgar:Agreed. Death accomplishes nothing, least of all relief..."
Edgar:He's simply looking for a way to escape the realities before him.
Shantotto:And at others' expense. What utter nonsense.
Irvine:Though I doubt he'd accept our point of view all that easily.
"Tidus:I just can't relax, waiting for him to stab us in the back in the middle of a fight..."
Edgar:I wouldn't worry about that as long as Mog's intentions remain unclear.
Edgar:He wants to know of what use Mog and we can be to him.
Tidus:And what about when Mog's intentions do become clear? What then?
Shantotto:That ball's on Mog's ground.
Shantotto:And how long he plans to jerk us around.
"Yuna:Anyway, for now, all we can do is wait and watch..."
"Steiner:Hrm, a decidedly spooky forest. It feels some ghoul could pop out at any moment."
"Mog:They say that a mischievous ghost haunts these woods, kupo."
"Steiner:What!? A gh-ghost, you say?"
"Steiner:Bah! Ridiculous! Ghosts aren't real. B-besides, even if they were, they'd b-be no match for me!"
"Mog:Er, right, kupo."
"Mog:Now, come on! We'll never make it to the next Torsion if we're scared of a little ghost, kupo!"
Steiner:Such a courageous moogle. I would do well to follow his example.
Steiner:Hm? Is something the matter?
Shadow:An unsettling presence approaches.
Steiner:What!? D-do you think it's the...!?
"Mog:Help, kupo! A bear!"
Shadow:A bear?
???:Stop right there! I'm not gonna let you get away!
"Mog:You know this bear, kupo?"
Shadow:He's an ally from back home.
Steiner:Is that so? Thank goodness!
"Sabin:Your ""ally""? Don't make me laugh! Put your fists up!"
Steiner:He's quite the aggressive one. Is he always like this?
"Shadow:No, something's wrong."
"Sabin:If it's three-on-three you want, you've got it!"
Steiner:Are those manikins!? And that one looks just like him!
Shadow:What is Sabin doing with them?
"Sabin:Ow, my head... Wh-where am I?"
"Terra:Sabin, are you okay?"
Sabin:Hm? Terra?
"Sabin:Whoa, it really is you! How long have you been here?"
Terra:I've been here the entire time. You don't remember anything?
Firion:What's the last thing you remember?
Sabin:I remember coming to this forest to train.
"Sabin:Then, some weird creature attacked me...and that's where everything starts to get a little fuzzy."
Wakka:Think it was that fabled ghost?
"Mog:That must have been what it was, kupo! He was possessed!"
Edge:Possessed!? That ghost sounds like a real jerk.
Sabin:Looks like you've got yourself a lot of new friends. Introduce me!
Firion:...And that's why we have to seal the Torsions.
"Sabin:Huh... Not entirely sure I get it, but count me in."
"Wakka:Whoa, man! You sure you know what you're getting yourself into?"
Terra:Sabin's not much of a thinker.
"Edge:A real meathead, huh?"
"Mog:But it looks like even bears can bear the light, kupo!"
Sabin:You're asking for it.
"Mog:S-sorry, kupo."
Firion:There's a Torsion deep within the forest. Do you want to come with us?
"Sabin:Yeah, of course. I'm never one to turn down a good ol' ghost hunt!"
"Wakka:Yeah, and look where that got you."
Sabin:Yahoo! Let's do this!
Terra:...And that's how we close the Torsions.
Sabin:Great! So? How'd I do?
Yang:You're a seasoned warrior. It is an honor to fight by your side.
Sabin:Right!? Hard training doesn't lie. Let's show these guys what monks are made of!
Yda:Your appearance sure doesn't betray your passionate nature.
"Yda:Slightly careless, but passionate nevertheless."
"Sabin:Eh, I got a little possessedbig deal! Hahaha!"
"Penelo:He startled me when he attacked us, but he seems to be a good person."
"Sabin:Hey, Shadow. My brother's somewhere in this world too, right?"
Shadow:Correct. Firion and I are in his employ.
"Sabin:And we're helping him by closing these portals, yeah?"
"Sabin:My brother comes up with the plan, and I make it happen."
Yang:That's very admirable. Let's put our muscles to good use and help those in need!
Sabin:Yeah! That's what I'm talkin' about!
Terra:It looks like these monks have a lot in common.
"Penelo:Hey, now that I think about it...wasn't Yang also brainwashed when we first met him?"
Terra:Do you think that means that martial artists are easy to manipulate?
Penelo:Then that would make their next target...
Yda:...Why are you looking at me!?
Yda:No! No way! That would never happen to me!
Shadow:...Let us move on.
"Edgar:Well, I've succeeded in connecting with the moogle's party. What's next...?"
Sabin:Edgar? What are you up to?
"Edgar:Ah, Sabin. You look as good as ever."
"Sabin:You, too! It's a different world, but I'm glad we're adventuring together again!"
Edgar:Hearing you were here is one of the reasons I decided to join this party.
Edgar:I was worried they might confuse you for a bear.
"Sabin:Aw, c'mon! I don't need that from you!"
"Edgar:...Sabin, what's your take on this."
Sabin:Huh? Take on what?
Edgar:Why these gods made this world and summoned us here.
"Edgar:And what that moogle's motives are... I've had a number of allies look into it, but the mystery only deepens."
Edgar:Have I been going about this the right way?
Sabin:...It isn't like you to start whining like this.
"Edgar:Haha, I suppose not."
"Sabin:I can't say I get the complicated stuff, but you've never steered me wrong before."
"Sabin:Everything'll be fine! I believe in you! Whichever way you're heading, I'll make sure the path is clear for you!"
Edgar:...Of course. I know I can count on you.
Setzer:And we're a bunch of old maids?
"Cyan:I, too, as a Returnernay, as a samuraishall do my utmost!"
Terra:We're all in this together again.
"Edgar:Cyan, Terra..."
Sabin:Right! We've got friends coming out our ears! Quit your moping!
"Sabin:Alright! Let's go shake things up in this world, too!"
Shadow:...Heh. Never a boring bunch...
"Y'shtola:Our band has become rather merry, wouldn't you say?"
"Papalymo:Indubitably. Why, you could"
Yda:Hnh! Hya! Take this!
Yang:And one! And two!
Sabin:You're not there yet! I can't see your aura! Keep it up!
Papalymo:...Say it's almost too merry.
Y'shtola:Haha. They're all so fired up since he joined us.
Edgar:In truth. Even I'm surprised to see how burly he's turned out.
Papalymo:Is that so?
Edgar:Sabin was sickly and rather meek as a child.
"Edgar:Far scrawnier than me. ...Goes to show what training can do for you, I suppose."
Y'shtola:A sickly and meek Sabin...
Papalymo:It taxes the imagination.
Sabin:Edgar! What're you chatting about?
"Yda:Y'shtola and Papalymo will train with us, too!?"
Papalymo:Who ever said that?
Yang:Hm? Now that I think about it...
"Yang:Seeing the two of you standing together, the resemblance is striking."
"Edgar:We are twins, so I would hope so."
Yda:What!? You're twins!?
Prishe:I figured you were further apart in age since Edgar's king!
Papalymo:Ran you into no difficulties regarding succession?
Edgar:Nothing this little fellow couldn't settle.
Yang:Settling who would take the throne with a coin toss...? Extraordinary.
Papalymo:I see... So things were complicated.
Edgar:A trifling affair. ...Let's be on our way.
"Y'shtola:A remarkable brother you have, Sabin."
Sabin:You know it! I couldn't be prouder! Gah-
"Mog:Hey, look! I found a Torsion, kupo!"
"King:So if we close that, the monsters will stop coming, huh?"
"Penelo:G-guys, we're not alone!"
"Laguna:Whoa, is that a manikin?"
Galuf:Hold on! Is that...?
Galuf:It is! That's Krile! That's my granddaughter Krile!
Penelo:That's a manikin of your granddaughter!? Then that means
"Mog:His granddaughter is probably somewhere in this world, too, kupo."
Laguna:You see that? It ran headfirst right into the Torsion!
Galuf:Stop right there! I'm not letting you get away!
King:So much for caution. What's our next move?
"Penelo:Wh-what do you mean, ""What's our next move""? We can't just leave him."
"Laguna:Dunno about you guys, but I'm goin' in! Always wanted to see what the inside of a Torsion looks like, anyway."
"Laguna:All right, gramps! Ready or not, here I come!"
King:I suppose you got to have guts to be a journalist.
"Mog:Come on, we're going after them, kupo! Ready?"
Penelo:R-ready when you are.
Mog:Then away we go!
"Steiner:Rejoice! Victory is ours. Sir Galuf, are you feeling okay?"
Galuf:I know it wasn't really her...but this isn't something a grandparent should ever have to go through.
Galuf:Th-this voice! Is that...!?
???:I knew it was you! I've been looking all over for you!
"Galuf:Oh, Krile! My dear Krile, I'm so glad to see the real you!"
"Galuf:Are you okay? You're not hurt at all? What are you doing here, anyway?"
Krile:I'm here because II felt you were in trouble.
"Krile:I thought I heard your voice coming from this whirlpool-like tunnel, so I jumped inside!"
Cecil:She must have found a Torsion.
Yuna:And you leapt inside to save Galuf without even giving it a second thought.
Steiner:Such a devoted granddaughter.
"Krile:Grandpa, who are they?"
"Galuf:They're new friends I met in this world. Where are your manners? Go on, say hello."
"Krile:Hi, everybody! I'm Krile. Nice to meet you."
Yuna:I can't believe you came here all by yourself. You must have gotten that heroism from your grandfather.
Cecil:You don't seem to be taken aback by the fact that you're in a different world.
Krile:Why would I be? This isn't my first time in a new world.
"Galuf:I told you before, didn't I? We're used to things like this."
Cecil:Our worlds must be even more different than I thought.
"Mog:She has the light as well, kupo!"
Krile:Wow! You can talk?
"Krile:I can tell what moogles want to say, but you can talk just like us!"
"Mog:Wait, you know what I'm thinking, kupo?"
"Krile:Huh? Well, probably...?"
"Mog:Kupo! No time to dawdle! Come on, everybody, we have to find the exit, kupo!"
"Krile:Hey, wait! I thought we were still talking!"
Yuna:He seemed to be in a rush.
Cecil:It's almost as if there's something he doesn't want us to know.
"Bartz:Krile, you seriously just jumped into a random Torsion you found? You never change."
Krile:I'd do anything to save Grandpa!
Galuf:That's my granddaughter for ya!
"Vincent:Love transcends time and space, huh?"
Firion:I don't like it here one bit. It feels like it's draining the strength out of me.
Firion:Weren't you scared?
"Krile:When things look scary, the trick is to not let yourself get caught up with it."
"Krile:Just close your eyes and think of your favorite animal, and that way, you won't be scared anymore."
Firion:D-does that really work?
"Galuf:Oh, don't be so wimpy. Learn a thing or two from Krileshe's far your junior, but has twice your pluck!"
Vincent:Pluck alone won't see us through this... Not without the strength of will to go with it.
"Mog:Sorry to keep you waiting, kupo! I found the exit!"
Firion:Thank goodness. We can finally get out of here.
"Mog:Follow me, kupo!"
Yuffie:Finally! I was getting sick of this place!
Bartz:Let's go and get some fresh air!
"Galuf:Come on, Krile, let's get moving."
Galuf:Hm? Is something the matter?
Krile:I missed you so much.
"Krile:Don't leave me behind anymore, okay? I don't know what I'd do without you."
"Galuf:Hoho, what's gotten into you?"
Krile:It's just... I just...!
"Galuf:'Krile, I'll always be there for you. We're family."
Krile:Grandpa... Thank you.
"Bartz:Hold up, Gramps."
Bartz:'Don't forget about the rest of us.
Galuf:I'll be there for all of you until the very end.
"Galuf:Now, come, everyone's waiting."
"Krile:Ahh, feel that wind! It's good to know it blows here, too."
Penelo:Oh? Look over there.
"Krile:A chocobo! They're here, too!"
"Ace:...Something seems wrong, though."
Chocobo:Kweh... Kwehhh...
Bartz:What's that? You've got something on your mind? Are you thinking about lunch?
Krile:I don't think that's it. He's thinking about...love!
Ace:Is that something a chocobo would worry about?
"Krile:There's another chocobo he likes, and he can't decide to profess his love or not."
Bartz:Would ya look at this smooth operator?
Penelo:I think you should admit your feelings. You never know what the world has in store for you.
Ace:Right. Being proactive is more constructive than doing nothing.
Krile:You're worried about doing it alone? You can be braver than that!
Chocobo:Kweh... Kwehhh!
"Bartz:That settles it. Don't worry, we'll be right behind you."
Penelo:We'll be watching to see how it goes!
Chocobo:Kweh? Kweh?
Ace:Is he...nervous? It doesn't look like the conversation is getting very far.
"Bartz:C'mon, what happened to those guts from a minute ago?"
"Penelo:Ah, he's coming this way!"
Chocobo:Kwehhh... Kweh-kweh...
Bartz:What? You need advice?
"Krile:Boy, you're high maintenance! Okay, in this kind of situation, you should..."
Chocobo:Kweh!? Kweh kweh!?
Krile:Right! So go for it!
Chocobo:Kweh-kweh! Kwehhh!
"Chocobo:...Kweh, kweeeh..."
"Penelo:Is it safe to say it went well? All thanks to Krile, huh?"
Ace:What advice did you give him?
"Krile:""Don't keep a lady waiting! She wants to hear what you have to say!"""
"Krile:...I could tell what she was thinking, too."
Ace:Can't hide anything from you.
Penelo:I hope they live happily ever after.
Bartz:This reminds me of Boko... I hope he's getting along well with his missus.
Krile:I'm sure they're doing fine. Let's go see them when we get back home.
"Krile:Well, Grandpa? Am I doing it right?"
"Galuf:Marvelously, my girl."
"Krile:Because you taught me how, you know."
Setzer:Good grief... Galuf makes a picture perfect doting grandparent.
Firion:How can he help it with a cute grandchild like Krile? It's good to cherish your family.
"Krile:Alright, let's head to our next destination."
"Terra:Krile, didn't you say this isn't your first time in another world?"
Firion:A m-meteorite!? That's something you can ride?
"Terra:Not like the magic ones, I guess. ...What's it like?"
"Krile:Where we're from, you can use them to travel to another world."
Setzer:Sightseeing from a rock hurtling through the sky doesn't sound so bad.
Cloud:...I'll pass. You won't see me on a meteor anytime soon...
"Galuf:From the beginning, our world is divided intotwoseparateworlds."
Krile:Bartz and the others live in a different world from me and Grandpa.
Cloud:That means you and Bartz are aliens from each other's perspective?
"Galuf:In the strictest sense of the word, yes."
"Krile:One day, Grandpa took a meteorite to the other world..."
Krile:So I took another one to go help him! That's where I met Bartz and Faris.
Terra:Wow... You're so brave.
Firion:Isn't that a little reckless? Riding on meteorites and jumping into Torsions...
Krile:It's the least I can do for Grandpa!
"Setzer:...Courage is one thing, but what about worrying Galuf?"
Galuf:I'd be lying if I said she doesn't worry me...
Galuf:But I couldn't be happier to have raised a child who acts on her own for the sake of her family.
"Krile:Thanks for the encouragement, Grandpa!"
Setzer:I see... I guess they are a perfect match...
"Cloud:Like grandfather, like granddaughter."
Edge:We're being followed. I don't sense any hostility though.
"Zidane:Yeah, you can come out now."
"???:Besides, it would be foolish of me to pick a fight with a band of skilled warriors such as yourselves. Surely, you wouldn't hurt a man of peace, either?"
Warrior of Light:You seem lightly equipped for someone traveling these lands alone.
???:A wandering minstrel such as myself has no need for any more than what's necessary to survive.
"Onion Knight:Right... And do bards usually spy on people, too?"
???:I had to make sure you weren't a bevy of ladies after my heart.
"???:Besides, I am unfamiliar with these lands, so I'd prefer to remain careful."
Onion Knight:Yeah...I guess I'd do the same thing if I were in your shoes.
Onion Knight:Our journey has just made us a little distrusting of others. That's all.
"Onion Knight:Anyway, you're a bard, right? Sing us something."
"Mog:Good idea, kupo! I wanna hear a song!"
Thancred:They call me Thancred.
"Thancred:And while I wish I could humbly honor your request, I only sing sweet whispers of love to the ladies. I fear I haven't a song in my repertoire for your lot."
"Thancred:Well, I apologize for bothering you. Now if you would be so kind as to excuse me."
Zidane:Can you believe that guy?
"Edge:Yeah, what a disgrace to the profession."
"Mog:But I sensed the light in him, kupo."
Warrior of Light:Then I suppose we will cross paths again one day.
"Thancred:Oh, if it isn't that moogle and his friends."
Thancred:So we meet again. Glad to see you are doing well.
Mog:Kupo!? It's the bard from earlier!
"Thancred:Excellent, you remember me."
Rem:Who's that?
Terra:I have no idea.
"Thancred:Ah, it seems there are a few new faces. Why didn't you tell me you were traveling with such beautiful ladies?"
Thancred:I would have prepared a song.
"Y'shtola:Go on. We do not mind waiting. Besides, it would make a good story for when we return home."
"Yda:Yeah, if everyone isn't already fed up with Thancred, that is!"
Thancred:Y'shtola!? Yda!?
Thancred:I searched all over for you two.
"Y'shtola:Oh, really? It certainly didn't sound like it."
Thancred:I wandered the continent as a bard in search of someone I recognized. I sought information on this world.
Thancred:And I am of the mind that music is merely a tool to get people to open up.
"Thancred:After all, love makes us closer. Wouldn't you agree, milady? How about I play a song to show you what I mean?"
"Terra:I'm sorry. I, uh... I don't really know what to say."
"Thancred:Well, even a good marksman may miss sometimes."
"Yda:Thancred, stop. You're making Terra uncomfortable."
"Thancred:My apologies. That wasn't my intention, love."
Y'shtola:What will you do now?
Thancred:Well... It is a relief to see you two. Would you mind if I accompanied you?
"Warrior of Light:But you are a bard, are you not? I would assume combat to be outside your realm of expertise."
Thancred:Not exactly.
Thancred:The world has become a dangerous place. Even a traveling minstrel needs to be able to take care of himself.
Warrior of Light:Impressive. You are evidently no stranger to the battlefield.
Thancred:What can I say? I am a man with many skills.
"Mog:I'm all for having another, friend, kupo! Especially one that's been blessed by the light!"
Thancred:Blessed by the light?
Rem:You could say it means you're one of us.
"Thancred:I see. There is unquestionably much more I need to learn about this world. Anyway, it is an honor to make your acquaintance."
"Thancred:Hells, finally I catch up."
Vaan:Where'd you run off to? I thought someone was missing.
Thancred:Just a mite about.
Hope:Don't wander too far or you'll get lost.
Thancred:My bad. I'll take more care.
"Vaan:We were about to get going, but you wanna catch your breath first?"
"Thancred:Don't mind me. I mayn't look much, but my endurance has never failed me yet."
"Tifa:Huh? Thancred, are you hurt?"
"Penelo:Oh, no! Quick, let's tend"
"Thancred:My, wherever did I pick this up?"
Thancred:I wouldn't even notice a scrape like this.
"Vaan:If you're fine, that's fine, but speak up if it starts to get to you, hear?"
"Vaan:Alright, let's get a move on!"
Thancred:Not quite yet. I suggest you give up on that path.
Thancred:It's thick with fiends. Far too many to avoid.
Thancred:We'd be better off taking the long way. The battles avoided will be a shortcut in the end.
Hope:...How do you know that?
Hope:Don't tell me that's how you...?
"Thancred:I had hoped to pull things off more gracefully, but I suppose it goes to show where I need to grow."
Hope:You're sure a capable hand.
"Thancred:...Gathering information is a specialty of mine, is all."
"Thancred:As embarrassing as it might be to be injured while carrying out my so-called specialty, haha."
Penelo:That's nothing to laugh about! It's dangerous to work alone!
"Tifa:Yeah, quit trying to act cool while you're making us worry about you."
"Thancred:S-sorry, it won't happen again."
Thancred:But you can't argue that it's best we know the safest way ahead. ...Am I right?
Penelo:We can agree on it's best being safe.
"Penelo:But that includes your safety, too."
"Thancred:...You are a gentle soul. I appreciate your kindness, and will not betray it."
"Thancred:Henceforth, I will do my best to carry out my investigations with a minimum of enemy engagement."
Tifa:That'd be a load off our shoulders. Shall we leave it to the expert?
Penelo:That...seems fair.
"Thancred:If a fight is inevitable, I will seek your help. You have my word."
Cecil:Halt!
"Thancred:Ahh, you got me!"
"Thancred:I thought I stood a chance, but...now not so much."
Bartz:I wasn't sure if you were holding back.
"Thancred:Same to you. You tailored your style for me, did you not?"
"Thancred:The advantage was mine at the start, but from some point, you had made all my moves your own."
"Thancred:An aptitude worth envying, you have there."
"Bartz:I didn't want to lose, and got to learn a thing or two."
Onion Knight:Guess it's my turn.
Thancred:Spare me a moment to regain myself. Bartz here just about drained me.
"Cecil:In that case, perhaps you might spar with me instead."
Thancred:...An unforgiving lot.
Yang:Would you blame them?
Yang:They all wish to know how much they can rely on one calling himself a bard.
Thancred:I wonder about that... But the spark in their eyes was at least apparent.
"Thancred:...Aw, come on. Are they making fun of me?"
Thancred:Onion Knight is fighting like he's dual wielding.
Thancred:And Cecil's going along with it.
Yang:I doubt it is by accident.
Yang:It shows how you hold their interest.
Thancred:Each and every one of them is trying to drain the confidence from me.
"Yang:The more they learn of your abilities, the stronger grows their sense of camaraderie."
Thancred:I suppose it's easier than composing a ballad for a lot of lads.
"Yang:Come now, are you rested enough? I have been waiting for my chance to spar as well."
Thancred:...Oof. Would you consider accepting a ballad instead?
"Thancred:Torsions...was it? There are quite a number of them, aren't there?"
Rem:And this is only the beginning. They're appearing all over the world even as we speak.
Terra:You don't have to force yourself to help if you don't want to.
"Thancred:I couldn't run away and leave you with all the work, my dear. Besides, it is not like I have anywhere else to be."
"Edge:Thancred, be honest with me. Are you really just a bard?"
"Thancred:What, still don't trust me?"
"Edge:No, it's not that. I'm just amazed by how well you carry yourself in battle."
"Thancred:Heh, I appreciate the flattery."
Edge:That's why it's hard to believe you're nothing more than a bard.
Edge:Or was that singing sweet whispers stuff all a lie?
"Y'shtola:Oh, it is anything but falsehood. As I recall"
"Thancred:Y-Y'shtola, I'm afraid to ask what you are about to say."
Y'shtola:You fear I will tell anecdotes of the array of women you've seduced? Or perhaps tales of a time before you took up the blade?
"Edge:That many women, huh? Nice."
"Thancred:Y-you jest, surely?"
Thancred:I was not misleading you when I said I was a bard who sings of love.
"Thancred:I daresay you still may not trust me, but I assure you I will not act to your detriment."
"Edge:Come on, I never said I didn't trust you. Anyway, we're counting on you."
"Thancred:And I, on you all. It is truly an honor to fight alongside such seasoned warriors."
"Yda:Hey, Thancred, I don't mean to interrupt, but..."
Thancred:What is it?
Rem:...Seducing an array of women? Do you think Y'shtola was being serious?
"Terra:I don't know, but..."
Thancred:Why are you backing away!?
Y'shtola:Oh dear. Instinct is a marvelous gift.
"Thancred:Come on, you know I am no scoundrel. Tell them."
"Edge:Heh, can't wait to hear about all these babes you got with! Fill me in on the details later, okay?"
"Thancred:Aye, very well..."
Mog:Kupo?
Mog:Someone's heading toward the Torsion up ahead.
"Warrior of Light:A foe, perchance?"
"Mog:Quite the opposite, kupo! They're one of us!"
Tifa:You think they're trying to close the Torsion then?
Rem:They probably have no idea what they're getting themselves into.
Vaan:Which is why we oughta save them. The monsters here are too tough to fight alone.
"Mog:We have to hurry then, kupo!"
"Sazh:Seriously though, you gotta be pretty reckless to be out here wrestling monsters all alone."
Sazh:...Especially while trudging through all this snow.
Warrior of Light:That is simply a testament to his courage. I am certain he shall prove to be a great help to our cause.
"Mog:There's only one way to find out. Come on, kupo!"
"Warrior of Light:Well, we were able to close the Torsion."
Warrior of Light:But where is the lone warrior who came this way?
Hope:He's probably still around here somewhere.
Hope:There are still some monsters left
???:Take this!
Hope:Snow!?
Snow:Is that really you!?
Zidane:You two know each other?
Sazh:He's a friend of ours from back home. Never expected to run into him here though.
"Snow:Sazh, it's good to see you. By the way, who are your new friends?"
"Mog:They're warriors gathered here from different worlds, kupo!"
Zidane:And any friend of Hope and Sazh is a friend of ours.
"Zidane:I mean, you risked your life to save someone who you thought was a stranger."
Zidane:Now that's a real hero!
Snow:A talking moogle and a guy with a tailand I thought I'd seen it all.
Snow:Consider my mind blown.
Hope:Doesn't take much to do that.
"Zidane:Whoa, harsh. What's gotten into him?"
Sazh:Let's just say things weren't always sunshine and rainbows between them.
Warrior of Light:For what purpose did you approach the Torsion?
Snow:You talking about that portal-thing? I don't know where it came from.
Snow:But I can't just ignore something that's spitting out monsters.
Snow:So I figured I should do something about it before anyone got hurt.
"Mog:Then you should come with us to save the world, kupo!"
"Snow:Save the world, huh? I like the sound of that."
"Snow:All right! You need a hero, you got one!"
"Mog:Great! We're counting on you, kupo!"
"Snow:I know how to take a hit, so if you need me to lure the enemies, just let me know."
"Hope:You never change, do you?"
"Snow:But man am I glad to see you safe and sound, Serah."
"Serah:Not just thatI can hold my own in a fight now, too! I might even be more useful than you."
Snow:That's great. Having you along for the ride's a real pick-me-up.
Vincent:...Go figure.
"Vincent:I would have expected him to want to keep Serah away from battle, like someone else here..."
Lightning:Are you fine with putting Serah in danger? Aren't you worried about her?
Serah:Not this again...
"Snow:Course I'm worried. But it's her choice to fight, and I'm gonna respect that."
"Snow:Plus, she's got us if anything ever happens."
"Snow:If I can't save her, you will. Right, Sis?"
Lightning:Of course! When did I ever say I wouldn't?
Snow:Right? She'll never have better backup than you.
"Sabin:Hey, don't forget about us. We're watching out for all three of you, too..."
"Sabin:We're all in this together, so nobody needs to ask for help. It's a given."
"Snow:Thanks, Sabin. I just want to make sure Serah's able to do what she wants."
"Snow:So listen, Sis..."
Shadow:Keeping a distance is also a method of defense...
"Vincent:I can appreciate the dread of not recovering what you've let go, though..."
Vincent:Regrets don't vanish so easily...
Lightning:I... I can't bear it...
"Shadow:...For as brave as you are as a warrior, you're just as cautious when it comes to Serah."
Lightning:Of course I am. She's my family.
"Serah:I feel the same way, you know. I'm worried you don't look out for yourself."
Snow:Ditto. She's not the only one.
Lightning:Argh...you two...
"Lightning:Fine. Listen. Now that this bruiser's here, too..."
"Lightning:If we're fighting together, I expect you to drive us like dogs, got it?"
Serah:Lightning...! Got it!
Snow:Alright! Just tell me what you need! I'll keep all y'all safe and sound!
Firion:We need to stay on our toes here. No telling what enemies lie ahead.
"Snow:If things start to get hot, just holler. I'll keep everyone out of harm's way!"
"Wakka:Not that I don't 'preciate it, but ""everyone"" is a bit much, ya?"
"Snow:""A bit much"" is my middle name."
"Snow:Back home, too, I fought like crazy so I wouldn't lose Serah or anyone else."
Ace:You derive your strength to protect from a desire not to lose anyone.
Snow:Everything that was my normal suddenly came crashing down one day.
"Snow:Everything I thought was real, people I thought were my allies, it was all turned upside down."
"Ramza:...All I once surveyed was but a fraction of the real world, and the more I learned the truth, the less sure I became."
Steiner:You cannot see the whole picture unless it also extends beyond the frame...
Wakka:You didn't lose it when everything you believed in came tumbling down? I know I did...
Snow:I'm too dumb for that.
"Snow:I could be cut off from the entire world, but as long as I stick to my principles, I figure it's all alright."
Ramza:You're also a man driven by faith.
Snow:Finding out what's true only brings what needs protecting into clearer focus.
"Snow:I'll fight, survive, and make Serah my wife."
"Wakka:Heh, she might whip you good, ya know?"
Snow:I'm just happy to have her by my side.
Steiner:A joyous sentiment if there ever was one!
"Firion:...We're all warriors, but we're all fighting to bring an end to fighting."
Snow:You got that right. That's why I'm gonna make sure you all get home in one piece.
"Firion:Okay, just don't overdo it."
Snow:Let's get a move on!
"Snow:So all of you are fighting for something, huh?"
"Zidane:You too, right? You must've got some sort of plan."
"Zidane:I mean, you wouldn't be risking your life to protect others if you didn't."
Snow:I'll do anything to protect those I care about. Doesn't matter where I am.
"Hope:It's someplace back in our world. Snow, come on, nobody knows what you're talking about."
"Snow:Yeah, my bad. Anyway, I can't allow my home to be destroyed."
"Cloud:Pretty sure of yourself, huh?"
Cecil:Do you really think you can do it all on your own?
"Snow:It's not gonna be easy, but I'm sure it'll all work out. It always does."
"Snow:Besides, I'm not alone. I've got you guys, right?"
Zidane:That's the spirit! I think we're gonna get along just fine.
Zidane:...So is this someone you're trying to protect really that cute?
Snow:You bet she is. I could go on about her all day. ...So I better not see you try to make a move on her.
Zidane:Y-you don't say. Sounds like Snow has it rough back home.
Warrior of Light:Someone to protect...
"Snow:Come on, I know there's someone you're fighting for, too."
Warrior of Light:I have walked the path of light.
Warrior of Light:But I question if I have ever risked my life to protect someone as you do.
"Mog:Don't beat yourself up over not being able to remember, kupo."
Cloud:I'm sure you'll find yourself if you just keep moving forward.
Cloud:Talking about it can only get you so far.
Warrior of Light:You're right.
"Warrior of Light:Perhaps one day, I will become more like you, able to"
Snow:You're thinking too much again! Just go with the flow and it'll all work out. I promise.
"Hope:*Sigh* While I'm glad he's okay, I'm starting to miss when things were a little...quieter."
"Zidane:Come on, what's the fun in that? Besides, I kind of like the guy."
???:Take this you little...!
Mog:Kupo!? Did you hear that!?
"Rem:Hey, doesn't that sound like...?"
"King:Yeah, let's go check it out."
Rem:Cater! Is that you?
Cater:Rem!? And is that King!?
Steiner:Did you vanquish the monsters here all by yourself!?
Yang:Your courage is commendable.
"Cater:Huh? Oh, thanks. ...So, uh, what's up with the get-up? You guys circus performers or something?"
"Steiner:...! Hmph. Well, the others seem to know her, so I'll let it pass."
Steiner:I am Adelbert Steiner.
"Yang:And I am Yang, monk and leader of Fabul."
Cater:Hold up. A man wearing armor and a warrior monk? What in the world is going on here?
King:We need to talk.
"Rem:So, Cater, this world we're in..."
Cater:Ohhh! No wonder they're dressed so funny.
"Yang:Well, we are from different worlds, after all."
Steiner:Exactly. Our attire is simply a characteristic of our home.
Rem:She's just never seen anybody dressed like you two before. That's all.
"Cater:But seriously, I have the worst luck. I was just taking a nap on the terrace, and the next thing you know, I'm in a different world."
"Cater:Anyway, we need to close those Torsions or whatever if we ever wanna go home, right?"
"Mog:Right, kupo! So you should come"
"Cater:All right, I'm gonna go see what's up ahead! You guys check that way! We'll meet up later!"
"Mog:Waaait! I wasn't finished talking yet, kupo!"
Yang:Are you sure she'll be okay?
"King:No, this place is crawling with monsters."
Rem:Leave it to Cater to go running off without thinking first.
"Steiner:Come, let us hurry after your comrade!"
"Mog:Finally! I didn't think we'd ever catch up, kupo!"
Cater:Sorry about that. I still haven't found the Torsion yet.
"Firion:No, I'm just glad we found you before anything happened. It's dangerous here."
"Cater:Oh, you were worried about me? Rem sure is lucky to have nice friends like you."
Cater:But I'm fine. I know how to take care of myself.
"Layle:Pretty confident, aren't we? But it's people like you who end up getting themselves into trouble."
"Wakka:Yeah, and I believe it coming from you."
Penelo:The monsters up ahead are even stronger. You could get really hurt if you go alone.
"Cater:Hm... You really think so? I mean, we could cover more ground if we split up."
"Cater:Plus, the monsters here don't seem to like being shot in the face, so I think I can handle things myself."
"Wakka:Man, I love this confidence of hers!"
Firion:You possess abilities we are in need of. Would you consider fighting along our side?
"Penelo:Please, come with us. Think of it as you're doing us a favor."
"Cater:Come on, you're embarrassing me. I mean, it's tough being popular sometimes."
"Cater:But sure, you've got it! I'll come with you."
"Mog:Yay! Welcome to the family, kupo! Now we'll be able to seal the Torsion here in no time."
"Mog:Speaking of which, my senses tell me it's this way. Come on, everybody!"
"Cater:Aye aye, captain! I won't let you down!"
"Layle:Well, that was easy. I think they've got a knack for this."
"Cater:Argh, I missed!"
Cyan:It escaped.
Cater:Oh well. We explored this far. Maybe it's time to hook back up with the others.
Yuna:Look out! It brought friends!
"Cyan:Against these numbers, it may be our turn to escape."
Cyan:Lady Cater!?
Cater:I'll thin 'em out! You two call for backup!
Yuna:We can't leave you on your own!
Cater:I'll be fine!
"Yuna:...I'll stay here, too! Please bring help!"
Cyan:Very well!
"Zell:Woof, that was sure a party."
"Cyan:Verily. It is well and good we prevailed, but wherefore didst thou not flee?"
"Cater:If we all pulled out and let them get to the rendezvous point, it'd be the same as losing."
Zell:I can't fault that logic.
"Cyan:...But wert thou to fall here, then what? There art others who worry for thou."
"Cater:...Maybe. No, you're right."
"Yuna:Don't push yourself too hard, for others' sake."
Terra:But you weren't wrong. Everyone might have been in real danger if that flock suddenly attacked.
Terra:You bought us enough time to put up an organized fight.
Cater:Right? Right!
"Zell:You were trying to protect everyone. You got guts, kid."
"Cater:Well, feel free to follow my example!"
Yuffie:All these waves are wearing me out!
Cater:Seriously. Don't send me back there.
"Cloud:It's only a little further. Come on, let's mosey."
Yuffie:...Huh? H-huh? You gotta be kidding me.
Cloud:Do you know where you dropped it? Are you sure it's gone?
Rem:You probably lost it back there...
"Yuffie:If we go back, we're gonna have to go through all those fights again... Aw, man, what do I do?"
"Cater:It's something important, isn't it?"
Yuffie:But it'd suck if I drag everyone back while we're tired and some strong monster shows up.
Cloud:...You sure?
"Yuffie:Yeah, let's blow this joint."
"Cater:...Hey, why don't we sneak back and get out of there before they notice us?"
"Yuffie:I don't know how quick we'd find it, though."
Cater:We can find it! Come on!
Cater:You guys sit tight!
Yuffie:No dice... We might as well call it quits...
"Cater:This is where we were fighting, though!"
Onion Knight:You two are asking for trouble if you don't head back soon.
"Yuffie:What? You came, too?"
"Onion Knight:Cater, Yuffie already gave up. Why are you so intent on finding it?"
"Cater:Huh? 'Cause, she's a friend in need."
"Onion Knight:I figured you were being stubborn, but you're just being nice."
"Onion Knight:Either way, you're horrible at searching for things. ...Is this what you're looking for?"
Yuffie:Where were they!?
Onion Knight:Where you were. ...Don't tell me you were looking without rhyme or reason!
Cater:You got a problem with that!?
"Yuffie:Alrighty, our work here is done! Let's get back to the group!"
"Cater:Yes! I closed the Torsion! Pretty impressive, huh?"
"Galuf:Impressive, indeed. Looks like you've got the skills to back up that mouth of yours."
"Cater:Hey, you gotta practice what you preach, you know? That's my motto."
"Vincent:You're strong, talented."
"Vincent:But you lack the composure necessary for battle. ...One day, that hubris could be your downfall."
Cater:Ugh. Give it a rest. I'm tired of everyone trying to lecture me on what to do.
"Rem:Hey's saying this because he's worried about you. Right, Vincent?"
Vincent:Forget I said anything.
"Cater:Yeah... Good point. The world may be different, but people are still people, huh?"
"Yuffie:Wow, gettin' all philosophical on us now."
"Galuf:You two are a lot alike, you know that?"
Yuffie:What!? I'm nothing like this cocky tomboy!
"Cater:Excuse me!? What did you just say, you conniving thief!"
"Galuf:See, what did I tell you?"
"Rem:The more the merrier, r-right?"
"Galuf:Vincent, why don't you keep an eye on them? Give them some guidance."
Vincent:I'll pass.
Cater:Not in a million years!
"Galuf:Yep, they're perfect for each other."
"Yuffie:How could you say we're alike? I mean, have I ever been this annoying?"
"Galuf:Well, ready to go?"
Yuffie:H-hold up! Hey!
"Cater:Yuffie, it hurts to admit it...but I know how you feel right now."
"Yuffie:Thanks, Cater... You're a lot nicer than I thought."
"Cater:Maybe we're not so different after all, huh? Let's find a way home...together."
Cater:And let's show the others who's boss! Make them pay for ever doubting us!
"Yuffie:Oh, I like where you're going with this! I'm in!"
"Galuf:Heeey! Get a move on, you two!"
"Laguna:Right? So then I say, ""You're gettin' the Cuchi-cuchi treatment!"""
Yuffie:Ah ha ha! You can't be serious!
Vaan:Not the Cuchi-cuchi treatment! We'd better watch out! Hahaha!
"Mog:...They're having an awfully good time, kupo..."
Penelo:Laguna's good at storytelling. ...Hm?
Penelo:Is that...!?
Penelo:Vaan! Come here!
"Vaan:Oh, Ashe, you were summoned to this world, too?"
"Ashe:...""This world""?"
"Mog:That's my cue, kupo!"
Ashe:...I cannot believe it. Such a reality begs credulity.
"Mog:Won't you join us, kupo?"
"Ashe:Well, I..."
"Laguna:Yuffie, have you heard this one? This guy orders soup, and there's a fly in it..."
Yuffie:Ah ha ha! What the heck? Stop making me laugh!
Ashe:...I respectfully decline.
Vaan:Why? You planning to go it alone?
"Ashe:So, if you'll forgive me...I do not think it is in my interest to interrupt your frivolity..."
Penelo:Don't say that! No one is being frivolous...
Yuffie:What? Did you say something?
"Mog:Of all the times to be oblivious, kupo..."
Ashe:I am prepared to fight on my own. Please excuse me; I must hurry on...
Laguna:...Huh? What just happened? The lady won't be joining us?
"Penelo:And whose fault do you think that is, Laguna!"
Laguna:Beats me! Not mine at least!
Laguna:...But this area is crawling with monsters. We can't just let her wander on her own.
"Mog:He's right! Let's go after her, kupo!"
Ashe:Unh... If only I were stronger...
Vaan:Ah! There she is! Over there!
Penelo:Are you okay!?
Laguna:See? What did I say? This is what happens if you go off on your own.
Ashe:...What are you here for?
"Vaan:To help you, of course."
Ashe:I am...fine on my own.
Laguna:Awful darn stubborn for the shape you're in.
Penelo:Can't you trust us to help?
"Ashe:I am fighting in earnest, not for fun like you."
"Yuffie:Hey, I resent that. I put my neck on the line in battle."
Laguna:You think we'd go out of our way to chase off monsters and help you for kicks?
"Ashe:I, well..."
Vaan:Even if we look like a bunch of goof-offs...
Vaan:Everyone was worried about you. Even the guys who'd only just met you.
"Penelo:It's a boisterous group, but they're all concerned about others' wellbeing."
Ashe:I see... I suppose I lost my temper.
"Mog:Kupo! You're finally being honest with us, kupo! Hooray!"
Yuffie:Get out! A real princess! Talk about fantasy worlds!
Laguna:But man if that isn't a long name. What do you guys usually call her?
"Penelo:Well, she is royalty... We usually call her Princess Ashe."
Ashe:Circumstances require I return to my world as soon as possible...
Ashe:So please! I beg you lend me your strength!
Laguna:You got it!
"Laguna:And in exchange, you'll listen to my stupid stories now and then, eh?"
Ashe:...I will do my best.
Sabin:That it does. Reminds me of when I was still in the castle.
"Ashe:I can relate. My homeland, too, is predominantly desert."
"Edgar:Royalty of desert kingdoms, thrown together to journey across an alien world... Why, could this be fate?"
Ashe:I hope it is a fate that contributes to our war effort.
Sabin:What does that mean?
Edgar:Sabin... It means I was rejected and it is time to back down.
Edgar:Not a single woman has responded to my advances since I came here. Never have I felt lonelier.
"Lilisette:Wow, a desert princess. It has such a mysterious sound to it!"
"Onion Knight:What's your country like, Ashe?"
"Ashe:Several different kingdoms have ruled Rabanastre, uniquely blending together various histories and cultures."
"Lilisette:Hmm, in other words...it has a habit of being invaded?"
"Ashe:...You are no wrong. Two years prior, the Archadian Empire did just that..."
Onion Knight:It must be difficult to defend when you're surrounded by desert.
"Sabin:Sounds like you could use a castle that hides under the sands, too."
Edgar:Indeed. It's the special privilege of a desert kingdom in our world.
Ashe:Privilege of...a desert kingdom? Whatever do you mean?
Sabin:Just what I said. Castle Figaro can dive under the desert!
Lilisette:Whaaat!? A castle...under the desert!?
"Edgar:In an emergency, we gather all the castle's inhabitants, and thenpoof!she's gone without a trace."
"Edgar:An invading army is left standing alone, surrounded by nothing but golden sands... It's quite a thrill."
Firion:It's hard to believe possible...
"Ashe:If Ivalice...nay, if Dalmasca only had such technology, perhaps I could have protected my people..."
Onion Knight:Different worlds have different rules. No point in wishing for something that doesn't exist.
"Edgar:That swings both ways, Your Highness. There are things I cannot protect that only you can."
Edgar:Your countrymen are a resilient lot. Vaan and Penelo make that clear enough.
"Ashe:...It is true. I have many who support me, and the power left by my ancestors..."
"Sabin:Hang in there, Ashe! Nothing's impossible!"
"Ashe:Thank you, everyone. I will search for a way to protect my people that suits me."
"Edgar:Please, don't think you're in it all alone. As long as we are in this world, let's exchange all the information we can."
Balthier:You're running too far ahead.
"Cyan:If thou push thyself too hard, thy body will pay the price for it."
"Vanille:Yeah, relax for a bit and let us take things over."
"Ashe:I appreciate your concern, but I must grow stronger."
Ashe:I do it also so that my people and family claimed by war might find peace...
Hope:You lost your family...?
"Cyan:Thou hast my sympathies. I, too, lost many to an empire's artifice..."
"Vanille:Cyan, I didn't know..."
"Cyan:Forsaking thy memories and overcoming hatred are not the same thing. If thou seekest power, of this thou must beware."
Ashe:But...the dead... I could do nothing...!
"Cyan:......Lady Ashe. The family, the comrades thou lost liveth on in thy heart, in thou."
"Cyan:I know thy grief, looking to the past and lamenting thy powerlessness... But looking only to the past produceth naught."
Cyan:Thou must advance on the path in which thou believest. Failing to do so would betray the departed.
Ashe:You've conquered your grief... Would that I had your strength...
"Balthier:Why does that sound like, ""I can't conquer mine""?"
Ashe:I! ...That was not my intention!
Vanille:You're plenty strong. You'll find your peace in time.
"Cyan:And at that time, thou will have grown all the stronger. I guarantee it."
"Hope:Yes, I hope you'll let us help you get there."
"Hope:Don't take everything on by yourself, and lean on your friends. I needed to before, too..."
Cyan:I did not see my grief through on mine own either. It was with the help of my comrades.
Ashe:Then please allow me...to lean on you.
"Vanille:Of course! No matter how big or small, don't hold it back from us!"
"Balthier:Different countries, different backgrounds... Obstinancy will only get you so far with this diverse lot."
"Mog:Just a little more to the Torsion, kupo! Let's go, go, go, kupo!"
"Ashe:Once every Torsion is closed, we can return home..."
Ashe:Let us continue on!
"Galuf:...Ashe, why is it you are in such a hurry to get home?"
"Ashe:...As I mentioned before, I am the Princess of Dalmasca."
Ashe:I lead the resistance forces to counter that threat.
"Vaan:I was surprised when I first saw the princess fighting, sword in hand."
Firion:A princess fighting against imperial tyranny... I can respect that.
"Ashe:I simply desire our liberty... For that, I need power."
Firion:I understand completely. We'll do everything we can for you!
Galuf:Just...take care not to lose yourself in your quest for power.
"Galuf:No matter how powerful you become, you cannot change the past."
Galuf:...We're fighting for the happiness of those dear to us who are with us now. You musn't forget that.
"Ashe:...I understand that. Even still, I!"
"Galuf:Ha ha ha! Forgive me! As you get on in years, the more everything you say starts to sound like a lecture."
"Firion:In any event, Ashe needs to return to her world."
"Firion:If there's anything we can do, just say the word!"
Ashe:...Thank you.
"Vaan:Fighting for those dear to us who are with us now, huh...?"
Penelo:We have to give it our all and face forward.
Kefka:Ho ho ho... You're not getting away.
Kefka:Not with me and my magitek army on your tail!
Kefka:Go go go!
Kefka:A girlie with the power of an ancient race'd be a nice piece to control...
Cloud:...Is that!?
???:Ah! Cloud! Tifa!
Tifa:Aerith! You're here!
Aerith:Are you really the real Tifa?
Cloud:...So you ran into our manikins.
"Aerith:You call those dolls manikins, huh? They looked just like you..."
Aerith:But not this time. It's the real you!
"Mog:A friend, kupo?"
Cloud:A friend...from home.
Aerith:I see. That's why I can't hear its voice.
"Tifa:It's a different planet, but this one has its own crisis right now."
"Mog:We're fighting to stop this world from being devoured, kupo!"
"Tifa:You'll come with us, won't you?"
"Aerith:Well, I'd love to say, ""Of course!"" but..."
"Cloud:...Is there something you're unsure of? If you want to know more, Mog can"
Aerith:It's not that...
Kefka:I found yoo-hoo!
"Aerith:Ack, he's here!"
"Kefka:Ack, I'm here! And I have no plans to share your powers with no stinkin' moogles."
Aerith:I don't know what you're talking about! I don't have special powers!
Kuja:The poor canary doesn't realize her own potential...
Cloud:These guys were after you!
"Mog:They're bad guys who want to destroy the world, kupo!"
Kuja:Who're the heroes and who're the villains is for the audience to decide.
"Tifa:Last time I checked, heroes don't force women to come along with them."
Cloud:Stay away from Aerith.
"Aerith:Thanks, you two! I'm not alone now!"
Kuja:...And scene. How about calling it a day?
Kefka:Ho ho ho... ...Don't tell me what to do.
Kuja:...Have it your way.
Kefka:I intend to! Hasta la pasta!
Cloud:Why were they after you?
"Aerith:And yet, I have this unpleasant feeling. A murmuring..."
"Mog:...Can you tell where it's coming from, kupo?"
"Aerith:That forest... No, beyond it perhaps."
"Mog:Where the Torsion is! You can sense Torsions, kupo!"
"Tifa:Great, come with us."
Tifa:We're traveling around to close Torsions.
Aerith:Is this why they were after me...?
"Terra:Kefka, that man who was after you, uses the Torsions to satisfy his...lust for destruction."
"Terra:Even if the Torsions weren't eating away at the world, we cannot let him do what he wants."
Aerith:...I understand. Count me in.
Aerith:I want...to know more about this world.
Cloud:Good. It's safer with us.
"Mog:Great to have you, kupo!"
"Aerith:What's this? Have I gone too far ahead on my poor, lonesome own?"
Aerith:...Haha. This should keep them out of trouble...I hope.
"Kuja:Decided to perform solo after all, have we?"
Aerith:You again... I could say the same to you.
"Kuja:I've hated that clown from the beginning. I was only there because, yes..."
Kuja:It's your motives that intrigue me. An Ancient...was it?
Kuja:Why do you accept your fate? You didn't choose to be born an Ancient.
"Aerith:Perhaps, but..."
"Aerith:There are some things only I can do... Maybe it's...if I can protect what's important to me, then I'll do them."
Kuja:This is a miniature garden of the gods... Your fate also could be altered.
Aerith:I appreciate the offer. But I'd like to decide something as important as that by myself.
"Kefka:I do declare, did you stay the little lady for me?"
Kuja:Spare me the indignity of sharing the stage with a buffoon the likes of you.
Kuja:...Run. The path behind you is good enough for you to get away.
Aerith:You're helping me?
Kuja:I want to know the truth of this world... For what reason we have been put here.
"Kuja:If you can sense the distortions, then perhaps..."
Kefka:Blargh! Ptoey! Boooring!
"Kefka:If it's there for the using, use it and break it all. That's enough for me!"
"Hope:Aerith, there you are!"
Mog:Kupo! She's being attacked!
Warrior of Light:After her power...?
"Kuja:Ay me... This is my exit. If it's a sword dance you want, do it with the clown."
"Kefka:You're quite the pests, you know that? Let's put you out of my misery!"
Kefka:Harrumph! I don't need your power anyway!
"Zidane:Hold it, Kuja! Why didn't you help Kefka?"
Aerith:He tried to help me escape.
"Kuja:...I had my own reasons to speak with the girl, and nothing more."
Zidane:You... What is it you're after...?
Kuja:I hate cozy theatrics. I am done here.
Mog:Kupo... And there he goes.
"Mog:Aerith, are you alright, kupo? It's dangerous to go off on your own."
Aerith:I'm okay. I just...got a little lost.
"Zidane:""A little lost"" wouldn't have ended you up all the way out here."
Zidane:Are you sure you weren't trying to keep us from getting mixed up in your problems?
Zidane:Have a little more faith in us. Or are we that useless?
"Tifa:Yeah, whatever it is, we can get through it together."
Aerith:You're right. I'm sorry. ...Thank you.
"Mog:Alright, let's regroup and head for the Torsion, kupo!"
"Laguna:H-hey, Aerith... You have a minute...?"
Aerith:Laguna? What is it? You look troubled.
"Laguna:So you can hear what the planet is saying because you're an...""Ancient,"" was it?"
Aerith:That's right.
"Laguna:Well, you see, actually, back in my world, I could also hear voices."
"Laguna:I always thought they were faeries, but then it hit me, ""You know, what if I'm an Ancient, too?"""
"Cater:Hmmm. Is that possible, even though you're from different worlds?"
"Hope:A special race in his own world...? Laguna doesn't look very special, though..."
"Yuri:What did you hear, anyway?"
"Laguna:Stuff like, ""What the...!"" and, ""Whatever."" Came through loud and clear!"
"Aerith:...Laguna, that's probably not the planet."
"Aerith:The planet sounds like so many people talking all at one, so I can't clearly understand it."
Laguna:Huh. Really?
"Hope:I don't know how it works, but it's probably different from what Aerith experiences."
Cater:Sure you weren't just hearing things? You're probably tired.
Laguna:H-hold on! Don't jump to conclusions! There weren't just voices!
Yuri:What else?
Laguna:The faeries'd power me up a bit whenever they're around! Like I'm better than my usual self!
Cater:Aerith? That ever happen to you?
"Laguna:I see... Hrmmm, the mysteries just keep getting deeper..."
"Aerith:I don't know how your world works, Laguna."
Aerith:But maybe someone was doing something with you in mind to power you up.
"Laguna:...I haven't heard the faeries since coming to this world, so if that's the case..."
"Laguna:I must be too far for their feelings to reach me. Aw, man, how sad is that?"
"Aerith:Don't worry. Even if they're not here, I'm sure they're waiting for you to come home."
Aerith:I hope you can report back soon. Let's make sure you have lots of good stories to tell the faeries.
Laguna:Aerith...! How sweet can you get!
Yuri:I wonder if interference from someone's consciousness might be the cause.
"Hope:We're from different worlds, so there's no way really for us to know."
"Cater:Yeah, but it's Laguna. He was probably just dreaming on his feet."
Laguna:H-hey! Whaddaya take me for? You could learn a thing or two from Aerith!
Warrior of Light:This Torsion... Something is different from usual.
Cloud:Could that be because of what you sensed?
Aerith:I don't know. But the voice sounds so sad.
"Vaan:We'd better hurry and close it, ya think?"
Warrior of Light:...It would appear that way.
Rem:Will we be able to close it the same way as the others?
"Mog:The same as always! Get ready for a fight, kupo!"
Aerith:Ah! ...It's gone.
Aerith:You've been doing this the whole time?
Cloud:...This time was especially rough.
Vincent:Are even greater Torsions appearing...without us even realizing it?
"Mog:If so, we're gonna need more and more friends, kupo!"
"Terra:Aerith, you'll stay with us, right?"
"Aerith:I will. I want to learn more about everyone else, too."
"Vincent:Furthermore...why Aerith is here, and repercussions that will havewhat are the gods playing at...?"
Cloud:What's the matter?
Vincent:Nothing...but... In this world...I might even be able to atone for my sins...
Yuffie:Mr. Broody-Face is at it again.
"Yuffie:C'mon, our work here is done; let's blow this pop stand!"
"Mog:Everyone back to the airship and we'll resume our journey, kupo!"
Aerith:Huh? This feeling...
Sephiroth:Heh heh heh... Look who's here...
Sephiroth:I have no more interest in you... But...
Sephiroth:Rousing Cloud's memories make a worthwhile diversion.
Aerith:...You never change.
Aerith:I still don't know why I'm here...
Aerith:But... I will protect the people important to me!
Sephiroth:Hmph... You really don't know...? Or are you just playing dumb?
Sephiroth:It won't be long before you know the reason you're here...and what will come from it...
"Aerith:But...what is it I need to do, what is it I can do on this planet...?"
"Aerith:I have so many questions, I guess I can't help but get lost in thought like you-know-who."
"Aerith:I was lucky enough to find the others, so for now, I should talk it out with them."
Sazh:Huh? Is someone waving at us over there?
Firion:Maybe she knows one of us? She doesn't look hostile; let's go see.
Cloud:And you are?
"Lion:I'm Lion. An adventurer, just like yourselves."
Squall:Lion? That's your name?
"Lion:It sure is. And a pretty good one, if I do say so myself."
Squall:...Fair enough. What were you doing out here?
Lion:I got completely lost while looking for the rest of my party...
"Lion:I've been in a real bind, what with all the groups of monsters wandering around here."
Galuf:First lost and then surrounded by monsters... That is unfortunate.
"Lion:Hey, would you mind helping me thin them out some?"
Lion:Running into you here had to be fate.
Firion:Sure thing. We can't ignore someone who needs a hand.
"Cloud:Our agendas match: we were here to fight monsters, anyway."
Lion:Thanks. You'll be a big help.
Lion:I'll check things out over there. We'll meet up later.
Sazh:You got it! Be careful!
"Lion:Ha ha, you too!"
"Layle:Howdy, Lion. What's the word?"
"Lion:Terrific. A lot fewer monsters around, thanks to you guys."
"Steiner:Hear, hear! A horde of beasts is nothing in the face of our combined might!"
"Lion:Haha, it must be nice to have such a strong party."
"Lion:That being said, your equipment and armor are all quite different. How did you group up?"
"Mog:Kupo! I can answer that for you, kupo!"
King:You said you're looking for your party. Can you describe them?
King:None for me. Anyone else?
"Shantotto:If in Vana'diel you need a pirate, the caves of Norg is where you'll find it."
"Lion:Huh!? Professor Shantotto! You're here, too!?"
King:You know the doctor?
Shantotto:Ohohoho! That's the very least you could know!
"Layle:Pity. You're from the same world, but Shantotto wasn't who you were looking for, eh?"
Layle:I haven't heard anything about a group from Norg either.
Lion:I see... I guess I can't hope for much when everyone is from a different world...
"Lion:I'm going to search some more. If Professor Shantotto is here, they might be, too..."
Layle:Hold on. You're planning to go solo?
Lion:I am. I'd hate to impose on you more than I already have.
"Layle:Ugh... Moogle, you okay with that?"
"Mog:Not at all, kupo! You should stick with us!"
Layle:There you have it...
Lion:Really? Are you sure it's no problem?
Steiner:What problem could there be in adding another just companion to our cause?
"King:Plus, this moogle is able to detect otherworlders. Maybe your friends, too."
"Layle:Agreed, use what you have at your disposal. Now, any more excuses not to join us?"
"Lion:...Haha, I can't turn down an invitation like that. You know, Layle, you're more of a busybody than I thought."
Layle:Just a whim.
Lion:I'll take you up on it. Thanks for letting me join your party.
Lion:Hitting the road surrounded by adventurers like this is nothing short of ideal.
Sabin:What do you mean?
"Lion:We may still be in the thick of it, but I can't imagine getting the chance to travel with so many friends back home."
Lion:I'm really having a blast.
"Yuna:Be that as it may, should we be enjoying ourselves? We still have the missions we were pursuing in our own worlds."
"Lion:People are counting onsummonerslike you to bringpeaceto the world, aren't they?"
"Lion:...When you put it that way, I guess we can't be all that happy-go-lucky."
"Yuna:Oh, no. I like traveling together, too."
"Yuna:We all have our problems, but it's having lots of friends that helps us overcome them."
"Cecil:Yes. Coming to know the values of alternate worlds, it has become easier for me, too, to shoulder my burden."
"Lion:Journeys start under all sorts of circumstances, huh?"
"Yang:But now, as you say, I believe it is important we enjoy the journey."
Yang:Mounting summits in particular puts my heart at ease.
"Sabin:Man, I hear ya! Mountains are the best!"
Lion:You like going to the mountains better than traveling around to all the other places we can go?
Sabin:They're great for training!
Yang:Ahh! Coming face to face with and staring down your own limitations!
Lion:You guys are only talking about training. I suppose that's kind of a journey...
"Yuna:Mountains aren't just for training, either. Climbing them can be...tough..."
Yuna:But the view on the other side is gorgeous.
"Yuna:Climbing it and looking out is so beautiful, and...a little lonely."
"Sabin:Hmmm, snow, huh? Sounds like it'd make for a good workout..."
"Yang:...It stands to reason, if the peak is severe enough..."
"Sabin:Polishing my skills in the biting, alpine winds might be just what I need to put together a secret technique!"
Lion:She's not talking about training. And right when she was getting to the good part...
Lion:But mountains... It'd be nice to check out some different ones on this trip.
Lion:You'll have to tell me more about them next time.
"Setzer:Lion, I hear you have a taste for adventure."
Lion:That's right. I want to experience all that I can.
"Setzer:In that case, there's no better way to travel than by airship."
"Lion:I've been able to ride an airship in this world, but yeah, it would be nice to have one of my own."
Yuffie:You might want to reconsider that! Flying's dangerous!
"Lion:I thought you guys use an airship in your world, too. Are you worried I might get airsick?"
"Setzer:I wish I could say you should trust my flying, but Yuffie's motion sickness is an inviolable law."
Lion:You don't have to worry about me. Air travel sounds fun.
Setzer:Perfect. So how'd you like to spend your time in the skies? Try your luck in the casino? Break some airspeed records?
"Faris:Let me toss my hat in here. Airships are bonny and all, but so is the salty breeze aboard a real ship."
"Lion:Ooh, sailing. Faris, what kind of ship is yours?"
"Faris:Nothing like the others. She can cut through the roughest seas without a puff in her sail. ...Are ye alright, Yuffie?"
Yuffie:...Urp. Don't...rock the boat...
Lion:Don't tell me you're seasick just from talking about it...
"Yuffie:...Who, me? I'm fine. I-I mean, if you're fine, I'm fine!"
"Wakka:You know, you can travel without relying on vehicles, too."
"Yuffie:Amen, brother! Who needs vehicles! You're talking chocobo, right? Yeah, a chocobo isn't so bad..."
"Wakka:They sway a heck of a lot, but that's part of the charm, ya?"
Yuffie:!? Why would you ride on something if it sways that much?
Yuffie:It's like you want to hurl...
Yuffie:I'll pass!
Wakka:You're missing out.
"Lion:Yuffie, weren't you adventuring in your world? Were you really okay with that bad of motion sickness?"
Yuffie:Heck no!
Yuffie:But I'm a noble soul! I'll overcome all ills in the name of treasure! ...I mean justice!
Faris:I get it. Having a goal helps ye get by.
Setzer:Not sure if I should be impressed or appalled by your motivation.
"Wakka:I'm telling ya, if you can handle a chocobo, a shoopuf'll be no problem."
"Lion:Ahh, adventure... The dream keeps getting bigger and bigger."
Lion:I can't wait to get back to Vana'diel and try out all the other ways to go I haven't even heard of yet.
Layle:That takes care of the Torsion...
"Lion:This'll keep down the monsters' numbers around here, yeah?"
"Bartz:Yup, we can breathe easy for a bit. You sure pack a punch, Lion."
Penelo:But there are still Torsions the world over.
"Laguna:In other words, we keep wandering until we close every last one."
Lion:Oh? ...Sounds like we're in for the long haul. Hehe...
Layle:You don't have to look so happy about it.
Lion:My dream has always been to travel the world with my friends.
"Lion:Naturally, I wouldn't expect our journey to be easy. Plenty of trouble and pain must be waiting for us..."
Lion:But that makes me want to see it all the more.
Lion:What kind of spectacular view awaits after overcoming the hardest trials with your companions?
"Layle:Ah, now I get it. You're the posse type. Traveling free from the herd isn't so bad, you know."
"Laguna:No, no, Layle! She said it perfectly! As a fellow aspiring journalist, I know exactly what she means!"
Penelo:Huh? When did Lion say she wanted to be a journalist?
Layle:Setting journalism aside... Travel has its pleasures. I've done my fair share of wandering.
Bartz:I love to travel! It's so fun to see all the different scenery!
"Onion Knight:There's nothing wrong with having fun, but...aren't you looking for your companions, Lion?"
Lion:I am worried about them...but Vana'diel's adventurers are no pushovers.
Lion:I bet they've found themselves some new friends and are having a grand old time. Just like me.
Laguna:That's the spirit! You know what they say: the journey with a babe is the reward!
Onion Knight:...Do they say that where you're from?
"Lion:When this adventure is done, I hope I can travel around all your worlds, too."
"Lion:You'll come with me then, too, right? Haha, promise?"
Bartz:You bet! Leave it to me! I'll lead the way!
Onion Knight:Bartz is leading...?
Penelo:Hehe... The road will be a meandering one.
???:Excuse me! Is anyone home?
"???:Um... Hello? If you're there, please answer!"
???:...Oh dear. I can't even ask for directions.
"???:Zidane, Steiner... Where did everyone go?"
Kuja:What's this? It would appear a canary has lost her way.
"Kuja:Please accept my warmest welcome, Princess Garnet, to the Illusory Palace."
Kuja:It must be fate that brought the two of us together. ...Heh.
Garnet:Of course it was you who separated me from everyone...
Garnet:Tell me! Where am I? Where is everyone else!?
Kuja:You stand atop the palms of divinity...
"Kuja:As for your friends, they are mid-performance, acting out their tragedy on this stage of fantasy."
Garnet:Palms of divinity? Tragedy...?
"Kuja:A disgusting tale, I assure you, written by capricious gods."
"Kuja:Although, your appearance here is also at their direction... Hm, hm, an interesting development indeed."
Garnet:What on earth are you...?
"Kuja:Come, my precious canary."
Kuja:Join me in the loge to see how this tragedy plays out. ...Shall we?
"Garnet:...No, thank you!"
Kuja:How brave.
"Kuja:A canary prone to flight, though, needs to be kept in her cage. ...Ha ha."
Kuja:Heh... I knew you'd come. But I'm afraid I won't hand over your canary.
Zidane:Canary? You don't mean...!?
Kuja:Argh... Pitiful canary. May you be tossed about by the sea of destiny.
Zidane:Dagger! Are you alright?
"Garnet:Yes, I'm unhurt. ...Thank you for coming, Zidane."
"Steiner:I'm so happy to see you, Your Highness! To think this day would come!"
"Steiner:Oh, the sleepless nights I've spent worrying for your safety... Wahhh...!"
Zidane:He's moved to tears. ...But it really is a relief to see you safe and sound.
"Eiko:I was super, super worried about you, too!"
"Garnet:Hehe. Thank you, Steiner, Eiko."
Garnet:And you strangers from foreign lands. Thank you very much for risking your lives on my behalf.
Garnet:I am Garnet Til Alexandros. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
Zell:Garnet? Didn't he call you Dagger a minute ago?
"Zidane:Oh yeah, I guess she doesn't need to keep it a secret here."
Zidane:Garnet's the princess from a big kingdom. Dagger's the alias she uses while traveling.
"Eiko:Oh, boy... Where's Mog when you need him?"
"Steiner:Miss Eiko, allow me! It is a knight's duty to apprise his mistress of the situation!"
"Eiko:Wow, that's helpful! Take it away, then!"
"Garnet:I see... That's why Kuja called it the ""palms of divinity."""
Garnet:A journey to save the world... I wonder if I can be of any help.
Eiko:Of course you can! I guarantee it!
Steiner:Your Highness is simply overflowing with the light!
Hope:I thought Mog was the only one who could tell that.
"Zidane:Don't you worry, Princess. Tin can aside, I'll be right there with you."
Zidane:Unless I'm not good enough for you.
"Zidane:Alright then, Your Highness..."
Zidane:I shall hereby do my best to kidnap you once again.
Garnet:...Very well. Please do.
"Zidane:If it's you calling, I'll come for you as many times and wherever you need."
"Steiner:Why you...! Zidane! Protecting Her Highness is one thing, but kidnapping is far another!"
Zidane:You're complaining about that now?
Zell:Kidnap? Doesn't he mean escort? ...Weird.
"Zidane:Say, Garnet. I bet you're beat from all this walking."
"Zidane:How about a piggyback ride? Come on, don't be shy!"
"Garnet:Hehe, thank you, Zidane, but my own feet still work."
"Garnet:I can't rely on others forever, you know."
Steiner:Zidaaane! Carrying her Highness piggyback is the height of impropriety!
"Firion:I know he's usually in high spirits, but...Zidane sure seems to enjoy having Garnet around."
"Vivi:Hehe, right? They're all real good friends."
"Firion:Zidane and Steiner, too? I thought they're always fighting."
Steiner:Grrr! He's been pushing his luck ever since Her Majesty joined us!
"Vivi:Yeah, look how happy he is!"
"Steiner:How can you be so lenient? Master Vivi, please have a word with him!"
"Zidane:C'mon, Rusty, don't be so uptight. Let's enjoy the journey."
Zidane:Give me a break...
Firion:You are rather high-strung. Maybe it's a knight thing.
Firion:Garnet strikes me as a strong princess.
"Zidane:You said it, Firion!"
"Firion:You see, there's aprincessI know who's in charge of anarmy, but it had to be such burden."
Firion:It's really tremendous that Garnet is fighting for her country.
Steiner:B-but still...!
"Garnet:Oh, you come from royalty, too, Edge?"
"Garnet:Ninjutsu, you say? I do so enjoy hearing stories about other kingdoms."
Edge:Oh ho? How about we go someplace private where I can tell you more?
Steiner:Gahhh! Lord Edge! You are standing too close to Her Majesty!
"Zidane:Hold it right there, Edge!"
Zidane:Going after Garnet is crossing the line!
Vivi:See? I told you they're friends.
"Firion:Ha ha ha, I certainly see the princess is a popular one."
"Vivi:It was her! Over here, guys!"
"Jecht:Yo, Garnet! 'Preciate the recital!"
Ace:It's a beautiful song. Where did you learn it?
Garnet:I heard it often when I was little.
"Garnet:When I sing this song, it warms my heart..."
"Garnet:It reminds me that I'm not alone, and gives me the strength to go on."
King:A favorite song from your childhood...? Sounds a lot like Ace.
"Vivi:That's right, you sing a lot, too, don't you?"
Ace:But I also feel a mysterious comfort when I sing it.
"Tidus:Hmmm, I get it. Songs from memory that calm you down..."
"Jecht:...Songs, huh. S'pose you'd find something like that in every world."
Garnet:People everywhere have such memories.
"Garnet:Sir Jecht, I do so wish to hear your song. Might you sing it for me?"
"Jecht:Yeah, well, I'd love to."
Jecht:...If it were that easy.
King:...Sounds like it has a complicated backstory.
"Vivi:You look a little lonely, Mister Jecht."
"Jecht:Naw, nothing like that. It's a song everyone loved in our world. Anyone hearin' it'd feel at ease."
"Ace:As we did, led here by Garnet's voice."
"Ace:There's some invisible power songs may have. Even in different worlds, that power doesn't change."
"Jecht:...Maybe. Even if your world changes... Even if you change, ya can still hear it..."
Vivi:I wanna hear your song again! Would you sing it one more time?
Garnet:It would be my pleasure.
"Garnet:Ahem... Haha, I'm a little nervous."
Garnet:...So you also asked to be kidnapped to escape your kingdom?
Garnet:I understand how you feel... Painfully so.
"Cecil:Why, if it isn't Ashe and Garnet?"
"Edgar:Two flowers blooming in the desert... Hm, a lovely view indeed."
"Garnet:Blooming...? There's not a flower in sight, is there?"
"Edgar:That innocence suits you all too well, Your Highness."
"Ashe:Edgar, you are royalty as well, yes?"
Edgar:That is correct. I'm honored you remembered.
Garnet:Do you worry for your subjects back home?
Edgar:I'd be lying if I said I didn't.
Edgar:But the people ofFigaroare made of sturdy stuff. They supported their country marvelously whilst I was away battlingKefka.
Cecil:There was never unrest or threat of invasion during your absence?
"Edgar:Not once. We ran into a bit of engine trouble with the castle, but civil issues..."
"Edgar:Well, I suppose it'd also be a lie to say there were never any of those..."
"Sabin:Haha, you got that right. Things were...complicated."
"Sabin:...Thanks, Edgar."
"Edgar:Come, now. Bygones are bygones. And we could get through that because of all the good help we had."
Edgar:A king can only be king with the support of the people around him. I'm sure you feel the same.
"Ashe:...Yes, I am deeply indebted to my retainers and associates."
"Garnet:I, too, feel it's thanks to Zidane, Steiner, and the others that I can continue on."
Cecil:...Thinking ever of your people and blessed with reliable allies... The citizens of your kingdoms must be happy ones.
Garnet:Yes... Power will change even the finest person...
Palom:Heeey! Cecil!
Palom:What're you doing? Get your butt over here!
Yang:We are soon to depart! Please make your preparations!
"Edgar:...Heh. You have your own reliable allies, I'd say."
"Garnet:And a gentle heart. It seems being king might suit you, Cecil."
"Cecil:Haha...me, king? Please, do not even jest. I have no intention of instigating a coup d'tat."
"Garnet:Ah, no, I only meant you have the makings of a fine king. Forgive me."
"Cecil:What a fantasy...to be king. A dark knight, not true royalty like you, has no place above others."
Cecil:But...why does something about it ring familiar...?
Cecil:A groggy feeling...of some fragment of a memory...
Yuna:Whew... The monsters in this tower are rather fearsome.
"Wakka:Just the thing for your summoner's training. We're right behind ya, so don't sweat it."
Tidus:Exactly! You got a hundred and ten percent of our support!
"Vivi:Hang in there, Miss Yuna! I'll try my hardest, too!"
"Yuna:Thank you, everyone."
Yuna:I...wonder if I'm getting stronger.
Eiko:You can do it! I'm cheering for you!
Vivi:Yeah! I can breathe easy just having you here!
"Vivi:Don't you think so, too, Mister?"
???:...I wonder about that.
"Wakka:Haha... Harsh as ever, Auron..."
Tidus:You can say that again. That's why Auron always
Wakka:...!? H-h-how long have you been standing there!?
"Vivi:Yipes, I was talking to a stranger..."
Eiko:Wh-who the heck are you! It's rude to surprise a lady like that! You scared the stuffing outta me!
"Tidus:Vivi, Eiko, relax. He's no stranger. You could almost say he's as familiar as they come..."
"Yuna:It's been a while, Sir Auron. I'm happy to see you again."
Auron:...This isn't the time for joyous reunions. Look over there.
Vivi:Wah! A monster!
"Eiko:Argh! Why does everyone have to pop out of nowhere like that!? If you're gonna show up suddenly, say so first!"
"Auron:Perfect timing. Yuna, Tidus. Let's see how you've grown."
"Wakka:Yuna, it's all good. With Auron on our side, we got nothin' to worry 'bout!"
Auron:Who said I was joining you?
Eiko:...Whaaat? I thought you're her friend! Give us a hand here!
Auron:I'll be watching closely. You won't get any help from me.
Vivi:Y-you can't mean that! What if we lose? Then what?
Auron:We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
"Wakka:Harsh, man... Alright, bring it on!"
Tidus:Let's show Auron what we're made of!
Tidus:Yahoo! The winners!
Firion:He really did just watch. Is he some big shot where you're from?
"Wakka:Right, and the summoner saves the world. Been there, done that for Sir Auron."
Yuna:Sir Auron journeyed with myfatherand defeatedSin.
Firion:So if I follow you...defeating Sin's what made him legendary?
Tidus:...More or less.
Auron:Not bad. You've improved.
"Yuna:No, I'm afraid I...still have a long way to go."
Yuna:I've only made it this far with everyone else's support.
Auron:Hah. You should be happy with that.
Auron:The number of guardians you have is the number of people you can rely on.
Auron:The strength of your guardians is a sign of your own strength. Hold your head higher.
"Yuna:Y-yes! Thank you, sir!"
Firion:He just complimented us.
Tidus:Aren't you happy about it.
Firion:Why shouldn't I be? Someone a big enough deal to be called a legend complimented all my friends.
"Wakka:...Ya can sure be honest when ya least expect it. Or maybe ""pure"" is the word."
"Yuna:Ah, Sir Auron. If it's no problem, might you consider traveling with us...?"
Auron:Of course. I intend to.
Auron:Your enemies' strength will also grow from here on out. I will once more escort you as a guardian.
"Vincent:A legendary guardian, eh...? How much ability must one have to be called a legend?"
Auron:...Legends don't mean a thing when all the rules have changed. Don't let your guard down just because I'm here.
Vincent:Change the world and titles are irrelevant? Sound reasoning.
Auron:Precisely. And strength doesn't come from an individual's title or power.
"Tidus:Why are you two so serious? The gist is, it's everyone's power together that's important. Am I right?"
Vincent:...Hmph. Such innocence.
Auron:Through and through. How much trouble has he caused you?
Tidus:Why's it a given I'm causing trouble!
"Auron:As his chaperone, too, I beg your cooperation."
Vincent:Heh. ...Likewise. I can tell he's been a handful for you.
"Cyan:An enormous tower, this is. Prodigious in monsters and no top in sight."
Auron:The monsters around here are trivial. ...Let's keep moving.
"Zell:You call those trivial!? Man, legend is right!"
Cyan:Sir Auron has a superior sword arm and the nerve to match it.
Yang:Indeed. Fighting alongside him is a right fine workout.
Tidus:Can you lay it on a little thicker?
"Yuna:Haha, it's truly a great help having you with us, Sir Auron."
Yuna:Running into you in a place like this... Miracles really do happen!
"Auron:Not that easily, they don't. I'm here because you are."
Yuna:...What do you mean?
Zell:It almost sounds like you've been tailing us the whole time.
"Auron:Oh ho, you're sharper than you look."
"Auron:Just so, I came to this tower and have been observing you for a while."
Yang:What!? I hadn't the slightest!
Cyan:Nor I. My training is clearly far from adequate.
Tidus:Why didn't you show your face sooner!? You're fine watching Yuna struggle!?
"Tidus:Well, yeah, but..."
"Auron:If I couldn't confirm your journey wasn't in error, I wouldn't have offered to help."
Auron:Moreover...I was enjoying myself. Watching all you and your companions put into growing stronger...
Yang:Paternal devotion...you might say.
"Cyan:I understand thy feeling all too well, Sir Auron."
"Yuna:I want to save the world with everyone else... This isn't Spira, but my mind is made up."
"Yuna:So please, lend us your strength in this world, too!"
Auron:The start of a new story...eh?
"Jecht:Y'know, Auron, you've sure mellowed out."
Auron:...How long do you think it's been since then?
"Jecht:Heh, yeah. My brat's put on an inch or two, too."
Jecht:I owe it to ya... Thanks.
Laguna:Oh? Here's a dainty-looking get-together!
Cyan:From Lady Yuna I heard tell these two art old friends.
"Jecht:Yup, me and Auron were her old man's guardians."
"Sazh:Oh, yeah, did he also have to do that summoner's journey thing?"
Steiner:A journey to save the world! They both accomplished such an amazing feat. Truly inspiring!
"Jecht:An amazing feat, huh? ...Yeah, well...a lot went down, and I ended up unable to go home..."
Jecht:So I had to ask this guy to wipe my kid's nose in my place.
"Laguna:Ah, I get it! So you're like Tidus's second pops."
Cyan:To take charge of another man's son...thy trust must be in no small measure.
Auron:...That's how long we've known each other.
Laguna:I'll be. You two don't look very friendly on the outside...
Laguna:But obviously that's not the case!
Auron:The first impression Jecht left was...horrendous.
"Auron:Imprudent, self-satisfied, and reckless. And a bad drunk on top of all that."
Jecht:This guy was as stubborn as they come.
"Jecht:And he was so hot-headed, we were like oil and water! I don't know how many times we went at it."
"Sazh:Auron, hot-headed! I can't begin to imagine..."
Auron:...It was a long time ago.
"Steiner:And in spite of your difficult beginnings, there is no questioning the friendship between you now!"
"Steiner:In my case, though I could not accept Zidane...my impression of him changed during our struggles together."
"Laguna:I'm best buds with my brothers-in-arms! I wonder if they're here, too. I'd sure like to introduce you to them."
Cyan:Ahh...the bonds forged on the battlefield can overcome all.
"Sazh:Huh, everybody's got plenty of stories to tell. Say, what're y'all up to later?"
Auron:...I'm game.
Jecht:Alright! I like the sound of that! Been a while since we cut loose!
Hope:The World of Darkness... Are we really going to be okay?
"Raijin:Wh-wh-what're ya worried about, ya know? We'll be f-f-fine, ya know!"
"Zell:Hahaha! Raijin, you're quaking in your boots!"
"Hope:Aren't you, too?"
Zell:Ulp! You could tell?
Galuf:How pitiful. Can't you show a little more spine?
Zell:Easier said than done...
Auron:To lose your nerve before a great trial can happen to anyone... Even me.
"Raijin:Wha...? You mean to tell us you've been through this too, ya know?"
Auron:...Of course.
"Auron:In my younger days, hoping to change things, I journeyed to hone my skills."
Auron:But in the end...nothing changed. I was insufficiently prepared.
Galuf:Everyone experiences something like that at some point.
Hope:Even you?
Galuf:Quite some time ago...
"Galuf:If I had been a bit more dependable, I wouldn't have caused everyone so much trouble."
"Auron:Bartz and the others don't seem troubled, though, so it shouldn't trouble you."
"Auron:But for the rest of you, we only want you to not choose a path forever regretting the same old rut."
"Galuf:In every world, the aged entrust their hopes to posterity."
"Hope:...Yeah, if we want to accomplish anything, we need to conquer ourselves first..."
"Raijin:Hear! Nothing to it but to do it, ya know! Time to screw our courage after coming this far, ya know!"
"Zell:I'm ready! If there's anything I don't want, it's regrets!"
Auron:You'll define your generation. It is enough to shape your stories without dwelling on them.
Galuf:...Looks like you spurred them on.
"Auron:...If so, good."
"Galuf:...You know, you don't need to act so decrepit yet though."
Auron:...What's that supposed to mean?
"Galuf:Sure, the aged are supposed to inspire the young, but from where I stand, you're still plenty young."
Galuf:Your tale isn't finished either. Let's keep spinning this yarn together.
Galuf:I jest!
Auron:...I intend to. I have my own story...
???:Huff... Is this the last of them?
???:Argh! There's no end!
???:What on earth...is going on? Why is this happening to me?
???:Oh... Ohhh...
???:Setzer! Cyan!
???:Thank goodness I found you! Where have you
???:Something's not right...
Manikin:Ohhhgh... Ough...
???:You're just imitations...
???:It seems I have no choice...but to fight...!
Setzer:Hm? Is someone there?
"Setzer:Celes! Well, this is a surprise! So you were dragged"
Celes:Not a step! Don't you come near me!
Setzer:...Now what's this about? It's rare to hear you joke around.
Celes:I'm not joking! If you fakes think you can fool me again
Celes:...It can talk? And it isn't sparkling like the others...
Setzer:Of course. You fell in with some manikins. It happens a lot around here.
"Setzer:How about this? Celes Chere, the brilliantMagitek Knightraised in theGestahlian Empire."
Setzer:Numerous feats on the battlefield have earned you a reputation as the undefeated general...
Setzer:Not to mention your stunning good looks and equally stunning vocal chords. You could be in the opera.
Setzer:Aren't I well informed? You still doubt I'm the genuine article?
Celes:Setzer...! It's the real you!
"Setzer:Welcome to a world abounding in thrills and mysteries. It's good to have you, Celes."
"Zell:Aha, there he is. Setzer! You lookin' at the sky again?"
"Layle:That never gets old with you, does it? ...And who have we here?"
Cyan:Wh-what's this! If it isn't Lady Celes!
Zell:A friend of Setzer and Cyan? That means a new friend of ours!
"Layle:Hmm... Presumably a friend of Edgar's then, too."
"Celes:Ah, who might you be?"
"Celes:A different world... Warriors of light... Another, newly formed Returners..."
Cyan:It is expected that thou wouldst be confused. I had no easy time grasping it myself.
Layle:Is it that complicated? It all made sense to me.
Zell:You get used to things too easily...
"Setzer:We're not alone. Terra and Shadow are here, too. Don't you worry."
Celes:And Kefka... That menace is also here...
Cyan:That villain would lead this world to ruin as well. We mustn't let him roam free!
"Layle:So is it safe to assume you'll be coming with us? You have a beef with Kefka, too, I'd wager."
Zell:He's not the only punk up to no good either. You gotta help us out!
Celes:I have no reason to decline. Allow me to join your ranks.
Celes:We'll cut short their wicked ambitions!
Edgar:The dignified rose mayn't choose where it blooms. Your beauty is unchanging.
"Celes:As is your philandering, Edgar."
Sabin:Gah-ha-ha-ha! He's always raring to go!
"Shantotto:And you're always deafening, you know."
"Cecil:There is nothing better than friends with whom you can laugh out loud, Shantotto."
Shantotto:I understand you belonged to the imperial army or somesuch in your land.
Shantotto:Which should make you enemies with these two. What caused you to give them a hand?
Celes:I was a general of the Gestahlian Empire...but no longer...
Edgar:Emperor Gestahlused his military might to invade nations the world over. WithKefkaat his side.
Sabin:And Celes had had enough of it! That's why she teamed up with us!
Cecil:You also turned against your homeland...and that courage changed the world...
Celes:I don't know that I'd call it courage...but I am indeed a traitor.
"Terra:No, you're nothing of the sort."
Terra:You've risked your life fighting to rescue the innocent.
"Edgar:Hear, hear. A true servicewoman is the one who sincerely puts the happiness of civilians first."
"Edgar:More properly, it is the emperor who is the traitor. Such a selfish individual is wholly unfit as a head of state."
"Shantotto:More importantly...if you hail from the same country, you must know of that clown's pedigree."
Celes:Kefka...and I are the same. We were both artificially infused with magic to become magitek knights.
Cecil:The same!?
Celes:You could say Kefka paid for his power with his sanity.
"Celes:One wrong step, and that could have been me..."
Sabin:You as mad as Kefka? I can't even begin to imagine it.
Shantotto:Driven mad with magic power? Don't make me sniff. It just shows how fragile his mind was to begin with.
Cecil:Your strength of heart let you resist the temptation of power. At least that is what I believe.
"Celes:...Thank you, Cecil."
Shantotto:Be that as it may...
Shantotto:One man-made magitek knight...
Shantotto:And one natural-born mage...
Shantotto:I couldn't have produced better test subjects had I myself set the stage!
Sabin:Not!
"Shantotto:Oh ho ho ho! Haven't you ever heard a joke, you lot?"
Terra:It didn't sound like she was joking...
Eiko:I fear I love thee more than I should!
"Zidane:Princess... Wilt thou be happy, married to a lowly peasant such as I?"
"Eiko:Prithee, call me ""princess"" no more!"
"Eiko:Wilt thou truly cherish me, the king's only daughter?"
"Eiko:Or is such a desire too dear to wish for!? After our nuptials, shall I...shall I..."
"Zidane:""...Become no more than a puppet?"""
"Eiko:Arrrgh! I completely forgot it! Darn it, darn it, darn it!"
"Garnet:Haha, shall we take it once more from the top then?"
Setzer:What are you all doing here?
"Eiko:We're practicing a play. Garnet knows all the lines, so we're going over it from scratch."
Celes:A play?
"Setzer:Aha, I see... This sounds like Celes's cue."
Celes:H-hey! Don't even start!
Zidane:You have theater experience?
Celes:I had no choice! You know
"Eiko:Wow, Celes! That's so cool!"
Vivi:I'd love to see you in the play!
Garnet:As would I!
"Celes:Ulp... W-well, if you insist... Give me a moment to warm up..."
"Celes:Ahhh, mi mi mi mi~ Ahem, Ma~ri~a~"
Setzer:Heh. Not bad.
"Celes:I'm the darkness, you're the starlight / Shining brightly from afar. / Through hours of despair, / I offer this prayer / To you, my evening star."
Celes:...How'd I sound?
Garnet:...I'm so moved! Your voice is so strong and clear! There's no denying you're a star!
Eiko:I was hypnotized! I could listen to you forever!
"Zidane:Yeah, you blew away all my expectations!"
Vivi:It was wonderful!
"Celes:R-really? Well, I guess I can sing a little more..."
Celes:Must my final vows exchanged / Be with him and not with you? / Were you only here to quiet my fear... / O speak! Guide me anew.
Setzer:...Let's not get carried away now...
"Terra:Before you met us, you were attacked by manikins of Setzer and Cyan, right?"
"Celes:Yes... They looked so much alike, I'm sorry to admit I let my guard down."
"Tidus:Those things sure are a piece of work. When I first saw Seymour's manikin, I couldn't tell either."
Bartz:They couldn't fool me! I'd never seen the real Galuf sparkle like that!
Galuf:Good grief. You choose the oddest things to be astute about...
"Galuf:Be that as it may, isn't it true you learnt I was here after finding a manikin of me?"
Celes:In other words...
"Celes:If we see a manikin of someone, it means that person's somewhere out there in this world?"
Shadow:That would be a natural conclusion.
Terra:Mog says the manikins are created by Spiritus...
Shadow:If you believe what he says.
"Terra:He didn't seem to be lying, though!"
"Tidus:Now, now, arguing won't get us anywhere."
"Celes:Assuming it's true, why would Spiritus make those copies?"
"Bartz:Ummm, aren't he and the goddess who summoned us on real bad terms?"
Celes:Enjoying watching allies fight each other? I did point my blade at Setzer...
Tidus:You mean he's trying to get us all mixed up?
Shadow:That does not explain the manikins of our adversaries from our home worlds.
"Tidus:Ah, good point..."
"Galuf:Manikins usually appear in or around Torsions, a road anyone who's come here has taken..."
"Galuf:We're bound to learn the source of the manikins in time, wouldn't you say?"
"Bartz:There's lots of enemies with manikins as lackeys, too."
Celes:So Spiritus makes manikins of anyone who comes through a Torsion...
Celes:And then places them under the command of the warriors he's summoned...?
Tidus:Has she got it right?
"Shadow:I can't jump to any conclusions, nor have I a reason to."
Terra:I'll go ask Mog again. Maybe he has something new to tell us.
"Celes:I'll go with you. There's plenty more I'd like to know, too."
Shadow:...Too bad it's a waste of your time.
Cecil:Is that...Kain!? You're here!
"Edge:Somebody you know, Cecil?"
Kain:Edge... Yang... I see. You two have lost it as well.
Kain:Cecil... To think you'd lose the hallowed light...
Cecil:What do you mean? What are you doing here?
Kain:...Don't be so suspicious of me. How long have we known each other? My voice should be enough to understand.
Kain:Be at ease... I have no interest in conflict here. What we hope to protect is the same.
"Mog:Kupo! He entered the Torsion, kupo!"
Warrior of Light:Does he intend to close it by himself?
Edge:He'll be in a bind if he is! Let's go give him a hand!
Cecil:I know we ought to. But Kain...
"Yang:He broke off relations with Lord Cecil to serve under avillain. Myhomeland, too, was...by his forces..."
"Warrior of Light:He appeared to be concerned for your wellbeing, though."
Warrior of Light:That you had lost something...
Cecil:You lost some of your memories when you came here. It is to that he must have been referring.
"Edge:Come to think of it, he knew my name."
Edge:I don't know any dragoons... Huh? Or...do I...?
Yang:Is there something we may have forgotten about Lord Kain and ourselves...?
Cecil:Let us enter this Torsion as well. If Kain knows anything...it would be in our interest to know as well.
Edge:Amen! This is gonna bug me if we don't clear things up!
Cecil:Mog...there is something I would ask you.
Cecil:The light... Did you sense it in him?
"Mog:If he's planning to use his powers properly, then it's the light, kupo!"
Cecil:...I see.
Cecil:Kain!? Why!?
"Kain:...That should be obvious. Draw your blade, Cecil!"
"Bartz:The Torsion closed! Wait, that means...!"
"Kain:I created it. And by defeating me, you closed it."
"Cecil:Why, Kain! Why would you threaten the world this way!"
Cecil:Unless... Is someone manipulating you!?
Squall:...This isn't like you.
"Squall:Would you mind speaking so we can follow along, too?"
Onion Knight:Tell us what's going on. Wasn't there something you wanted to know?
Kain:...That moogle is not here.
Kain:Have you noticed while battling in this world a feeling that your strength is being drawn out of you?
"King:Yeah, we have wondered about that."
King:It seems most obvious when fighting inside a Torsion.
"Kain:How about when fighting against me, a warrior from another world like yourselves?"
Squall:It was more pronounced than going up against manikins or monsters...maybe.
"Bartz:Ah! Come to think of it, it might've felt that way whenever we fight those other guys, too!"
Onion Knight:So you picked a fight with us to figure that out.
Kain:I don't have all the answers.
Kain:Only...I've been told what's draining your strength is that moogle.
Cecil:Who told you that?
Kain:You aren't ready to know.
Cecil:Because I've...forgotten something important?
Cecil:Kain... Please tell me. I... What have I lost?
Kain:Something meaningless if you can't remember on your own.
Squall:So what now? Going back to whoever is feeding you info?
Kain:That was my plan...
Bartz:And you're just gonna leave your friend worried and confused?
"Kain:He's the one who does not trust me... But you are right, warrior from another world."
Kain:I cannot leave Cecil in this state. I will join you on your journey.
Onion Knight:That would be a big help. Let's share what we know.
Cecil:Kain... Can I trust you...?
Kain:Call me a traitor if you like. ...I will bring the light back to my friend.
"Zell:Yo, Kain! How do you train to jump like that?"
"Zell:You can jump really high, right? I wanna jump like you, too!"
Kain:Many years of dragoon training. It's not something you'll learn in a day.
"Bartz:Huh, you don't say."
"Bartz:Inour world, the crystals can give us all sorts ofjobser...powers."
"Vaan:Hmmm... I know we had all sorts in our world, but did we have dragoons?"
"Rem:Even if we use the same word for it, a dragoon can be completely different from world to world, it seems."
"Rem:InOrience, there was akingdomwhose soldiers fought while mounted on dragons."
"Zell:Get out! Oh, man, that's so rad!"
"Rem:Our countries were at war, though, so they were our enemy..."
Vaan:That sucks.
Kain:A lively party... ...Cecil?
Cecil:...Our friends from other worlds have been able to accept Kain without prejudice.
Cecil:And yet I...cannot even trust my dear friend...
Kain:...That's not your fault.
Cecil:Kain...I... I am sorry...
"Kain:It's fine. In the memories you have now, I am still a traitor."
Cecil:Is there no way you will tell me what I've forgotten?
"Kain:No. If you cannot reclaim it yourself, your hallowed light will have no brilliance to it."
Kain:And it does nothing to change the fact that I did betray you.
Vaan:Are you talking about something serious?
"Zell:Hey, we know we can count on him! Don't sweat the small stuff!"
"Bartz:You alright, Cecil?"
Cecil:Yes... Sorry to worry you. Let us be on our way.
Kain:...What do you mean?
"Kain:TheDragoons of Baronstood shoulder to shoulder with theRed Wings, our air force."
"Kain:Though in recent years perhaps, the king's favor fell more so upon the Red Wings."
Firion:What made you decide to become a dragoon?
Kain:Heh... You are a curious lot. What is the point in asking such a thing?
Vanille:Is it so weird to want to hear about a friend?
Cloud:...It's just small talk.
Firion:Forgive us if it's something you'd rather not share. I just wanted to know more about your world.
Yuna:Everyone is interested since there's so much we don't know about each other.
Kain:...Is that so?
Kain:I...chose the life of a dragoon out of pride.
"Vivi:Were you always with Mr. Cecil? You're best friends, right?"
Kain:Yes... We grew up together.
Vanille:...Where could she be now? She just popped into my mind.
Vivi:I'm sure you'll see her again.
"Firion:Though best friends, you and Cecil are having a hard time of it..."
Cloud:It's the Torsions... They've taken something from all of us.
Yuna:...It's a little scary. I wonder what it is I don't remember.
Kain:You'll remember eventually as we journey on.
"Kain:The question is, what will you do when what was lost is reclaimed?"
Cloud:Everyone from your world seems to have lost something pretty important.
"Kain:Indeed, but..."
"Kain:With comrades such as all of you, I'm certain they'll regain it."
Firion:That's right... We're all in this together.
Warrior of Light:You've grown more pensive since Kain joined us.
Zidane:Is it whatever you can't remember from back home that's eating you?
Cecil:...Indeed. I've lost something important that for the life of me...I just can't figure out.
Cecil:But more painful than that is this cold-hearted distrust of my friend.
Cecil:Have I...let my heart become as black as this armor...?
"Zidane:For such a softie, you're way too hard on yourself."
Warrior of Light:As am I. Everyone has missing memories to some extent or another... I know this thanks to him.
"Zidane:I trust Kain. After all, he's sticking his neck out there for everyone, right?"
Warrior of Light:Agreed. His spear shows us the way.
Warrior of Light:The mystery to be solved is the Torsions...
"Cecil:If we can know them, we can know what it is we have lost, is it?"
Cecil:You two are right. There is nothing to gain in fretting...
"Zidane:The way I see it, Kain's defending you along with the rest of us."
"Zidane:Any doubts you have'll clear up eventually, hear?"
"Cecil:Thank you, Zidane. As I am, I will do what I can to believe that."
Kain:Cecil and his companions were summoned by this Materia...
Kain:Could the difference in our memories have to do with who summoned us?
"Spiritus:Warrior burdened with the mark of treachery... Go, and protect my world!"
Kain:As though I would fight for your sake.
Kain:I fight...to protect my friend.
"???:Now, to Cecil's side with you..."
Kain:Heh... My thoughts exactly.
???:Ah! A hiding spot!
???:...Whew. Finally they're gone.
???:How did I get myself into this...? I can't even tell where I am.
???:Nor can I take another step. I'm exhausted...
???:...I wish the others were here. Firion... Sniff...
???:Oh? What's this?
???:Wild rose... Therebel army'spassword. A flower of hope that connects us.
"???:Blooming even here, deep in these woods, unwithered and full of vigor."
"???:...No, I mustn't give up now."
"???:If I continue running, I should find the others! This is no time to stop!"
???:...You have my thanks.
Firion:This forest is crawling with monsters. Let's watch our step...
Yang:Hrm! Speak of the devil...!
Firion:Maria!? Is that you!?
"Maria:Ah! Firion, I finally found you!"
Firion:I'm glad to see you safe and sound. Did you come through this forest on your own?
Maria:I thought I was a goner with all the fiends at my heels...
"Maria:But...at the moment I had nearly given up hope, I came across a patch of wild rose that reminded me of you and the others..."
Maria:That gave me just what I needed to carry on.
Firion:I see. We owe it to the wild rose...our password in the rebellion.
Galuf:Rebellion? Is she also one of your Returners?
Shadow:...Her face is unknown to me. A new recruit?
"Firion:There's a resistance back in our world, too. Maria and I both fought together for the rebel army."
Maria:Returners? Back in our world?
"Layle:How about you fill her in, Firion?"
"Firion:Maria, try not to panic, but the world we're in now..."
Maria:...So it's the fault of these Torsions that we've all been torn from our homes.
"Layle:We're all in the same boat here. Summoned by a ""god"" of some sort to fight for the ""sake of the world."""
"Yang:If we do not defend this world, our home worlds are also at risk of being consumed... In other words, we also fight to protect our own worlds..."
Yang:Or that is what Lord Mog has professed...
Shadow:With no evidence to back up the claim.
"Galuf:Moreover, it's not only the villains who can create Torsions... We're up to our necks in mysteries."
Firion:Did you happen to feel as though your strength was being drawn out of you when you passed through the Torsion or while battling monsters?
"Maria:Come to think of it, my legs were trembling...but I had assumed it was from fear and exhaustion..."
Shadow:If only it were just that.
"Layle:My employer, the Returners, is the group trying to get to the bottom of why we're here and what these gods are up to."
Maria:Leave it to Firion to join the rebellion in a completely different world.
"Firion:Our other friends from the rebel army must be here, too."
"Firion:Let's find them together. And uncover the mysteries of this world! You will join us, won't you?"
Maria:But of course! I wouldn't want to disappoint any of you!
Galuf:Ho ho ho! Admirable confidence.
"Yang:We will put our faith in you, Lady Maria!"
"Wakka:Alrighty then. That's enough of a break. Let's hit the road again, yeah?"
Penelo:...Huh? I don't see Yuna.
Yuna:Sorry to keep you!
"Yuna:Forgive me, I must have started to doze off..."
"Vaan:Ha ha, no kidding! Nice bed head!"
Yuna:Eh!? B-bed head!?
"Yuna:Ohhh, not again..."
"Vaan:You know, for as much as you look like you've got it together, you can be pretty scatterbrained sometimes."
Wakka:Right? She's been like that since way back when.
Maria:Since way back? Are you two childhood friends?
Maria:Like siblings... Just like me and Firion.
Wakka:Oh yeah? You two also have a long history together?
"Firion:I was without mother or father, so Maria's took me in."
"Vaan:Oh, so you're family."
Yuna:...How dreadful. I'm so sorry...
Penelo:Imperial invasions happen in any world...huh...
Penelo:War takes everyone... Family... Homeland...
Wakka:Shoot! Can't start dwelling on the past!
Vaan:Separated from yourbrother...'cause of theempire...
"Vaan:Me and Penelo are both orphans, too. It's a pretty common story. But that doesn't mean we're alone."
"Firion:That's right. We're not alone. Even if the world changes, that's still the same."
"Firion:So let's keep our eyes on the future. Surely Leon, too, will..."
"Maria:Yes, you're right. Let's go!"
"Wakka:Fore that, though, let's give Lady Yuna a chance to fix her hair."
"Yuna:Oooh, Wakka!"
Celes:Ah...a dead end. There's not much we can do about a rampart such as this.
Auron:We'll have to turn back and look for another way around.
Cater:Whaaat!? We already came this far! What a waste!
"Vanille:Yeah, isn't there something we can do? Maybe try climbing it?"
Celes:Please... What if someone falls?
Auron:I doubt anyone plans on falling...
"Mog:Let's give up here, kupo. I'll start looking for another route."
"Vanille:Hey, can't you float us over the wall?"
"Mog:Not likely, kupo... It's not even an emergency, and if I dropped someone midway...kupo..."
"Cater:Well, there is NO way I'm going back the way we came."
"Celes:This isn't going anywhere... Maria, what do you think?"
"Maria:I understand how Cater feels, but we shouldn't consider scaling it."
"Maria:We have children like Vivi and Eiko with us, too, after all. Do try to bear it."
Cater:Yeah... I guess that would be hard on them.
Vanille:If we can't climb it...what if we knocked it down?
Auron:What are you thinking...?
"Vanille:Haha, I was only joking."
Maria:...Why didn't I think of that...?
"Maria:Mog, are there any cannons on the airship?"
"Mog:Kupo? C-cannons, kupo?"
Maria:Or maybe Cater's guns have enough magic power...
Auron:Maria? Don't tell me...
Maria:It's settled! Let's blow this thing up!
Celes:You can't be serious! The whole wall!?
"Vanille:Yeah, I don't know about that..."
Cater:I'm in! The best answer is the simplest one!
"Celes:H-hold on! If you blow it up, what about all the debris!?"
Auron:Crushed under a collapsing wall is just as much a dead end.
"Cater:Uh, didn't think about that. We could hide behind something...but I don't see anyplace..."
"Mog:Another route is the only answer, kupo. Give it up, you two."
Maria:I thought it was a good idea...
"Auron:""Let's blow this thing up!"" She's more of a firecracker than I would have expected."
Celes:Indeed... Doubtless she's seen her fair share of mayhem in the rebel army.
"Maria:It is not only back home, but in this world, too, the battles are unceasing..."
Maria:The peaceful days spent with my family have become a distant memory...
"Cait Sith:Oh, Maria?"
Cait Sith:What's got you so down?
Maria:...I'm sorry. I was thinking of home...
Seven:Yours and Firion's...?
"Ramza:You had mentioned your hometown was caught up in war, and you were separated from your family..."
Ramza:There is no end to conflict in my world as well. ...I share your pain.
"Chelinka:It's sad and scary to lose family... For your family to lose you, too..."
"Chelinka:But...you can't lose hope... Once you do, you can never change your fate..."
"Chelinka:I know there's still hope for your world, so please...don't give up..."
Kain:...Agreed. Everyoneeven those in similar circumstancesthat's what we're fighting to protect.
Maria:You're all too kind...
"Seven:Oh, yeah. Cait Sith, how about a fortune telling?"
Cait Sith:Fortune telling? Of what?
"Seven:Maria's fortune, of course. Isn't that your deal?"
"Cait Sith:Oh, you better believe it! Let's give it a whirl!"
Cait Sith:Beyond ordeals lies an unexpected reunion. Your lucky color is a daaark one...
Seven:Look at that. A reunion awaits you.
"Kain:Ordeals, eh... Will those be obstacles before you...or within?"
"Ramza:But whatever could, ""Your lucky color is a dark one,"" mean?"
"Cait Sith:Hmm... It's just a regular fortune, so maybe a connection to something black?"
Chelinka:But doesn't that give you something to look forward to now?
"Maria:...Haha, thank you."
"Maria:Yes, I do think that fortune gave me a little bit of hope."
Cait Sith:Oho! I couldn't be happier to hear it! Fortune must be smiling on this fortune-telling machine!
Maria:If I can live with my family again...
Maria:I will overcome any ordeal I must!
Seven:That's the spirit.
"Ramza:Aye, and we will aid you in any way we can."
"Mog:There's a Torsion hidden deep inside this forest, kupo! Let's go!"
Vivi:...Huh? What're we waiting for?
Cecil:...It would seem we are being stalked.
Edge:Yeah it would...
"Mog:Kupo? What do you mean, kupo?"
Edge:You can't tell? There's a pack of monsters breathing down our necks.
Vivi:Ack! Wh-why're there so many!?
Cecil:And they look particularly bloodthirsty.
"Mog:I don't get it, kupo! We didn't do anything to upset them, kupo!"
Vivi:Wahhh!!
Cecil:Vivi! Are you alright!?
"Vivi:Y-yeah, somehow..."
Vivi:But look at these monsters... Was someone scribbling on them?
Bomb:Grrrowl!
"Edge:Whoa, you're right! Take a look! They're all covered in doodles!"
Cecil:That explains their ire.
"Mog:Kupo! We've been framed, kupo! Who's responsible for this, kupo!?"
Edge:Save your interrogation! Here they come!
Mog:Kupo... That was a close one...
Bartz:Been a while since I've seen monsters that angry.
"Yuffie:Even if they're monsters, drawing all over them's a nasty trick."
"Wakka:...Ya know, Yuffie, you should prolly come clean sooner of later, yeah?"
Yuffie:Hm...? M-me!?
"Mog:Good point... That's exactly the sort of prank Yuffie would pull, kupo."
Yuffie:H-hang on a minute there! It wasn't me!
"Yuffie:Ahhh! Don't you start suspecting me, too! Ya'll keep doubting me like that, I'm gonna turn to a life of crime!"
???:Waughhh! Lemme alone!
Cecil:Is that...Palom!?
"Palom:Alright! This is in the bag! Come and get it, you stupid monsters!"
"Mog:That face... They're really angry, kupo..."
"Cecil:...Palom, is this your doing?"
Palom:Perfect timing! These dummies have got the shortest tempers!
Wakka:So would anyone if you draw all over them!
Yuffie:Whew! This clears my name!
Bartz:Don't feel relieved yet!
Palom:Heh heh! That takes care of that!
Steiner:I will have no heh-heh-ing from you! You nearly got us killed!
"Cecil:Explain yourself, Palom."
Palom:Ulp... You're not angry...are you?
"Steiner:Of course we are, you little prankster!"
Yuffie:And how! You made everyone turn on me!
"Palom:Aww, but there're so many monsters around here, you know? So I thought I'd practice my magic a little and clean their clocks."
Vivi:You mean...all by yourself?
"Vivi:Wow, really? That's pretty cool!"
Cecil:...And? What does magic practice have to do with doodling on monsters?
"Palom:Er, well..."
"Palom:They were all sleeping so peacefully, I couldn't resist, and one thing led to another..."
Cecil:And they woke up and pursued you in their anger...
"Zidane:Good grief, who would prank a pack of monsters?"
"Mog:Kupo! But, but! That's exactly the type of adventurous spirit we'll need in the heat of battle, kupo!"
"Yuffie:Gee, that's a nice way to excuse it."
"Cecil:Mog, is it safe to assume Palom's will is also of the light?"
"Mog:It is, kupo! I want this mischievous black mage on our team, kupo!"
Palom:Great! 'Cause I was coming with ya anyway!
Steiner:This does not sit well with me.
"Palom:Don't look so gloomy, Pops! Be glad I'm here to help you out!"
Yuffie:What an attitude.
Steiner:I cannot claim to see much difference from you.
Yuffie:Don't you compare me with that kid!
Palom:My magic's the best under the sun! Just wait and see!
"Vivi:I'm Vivi! I'm a black mage, too!"
Palom:No kidding? Not bad for a squirt!
Palom:Alright then! I'll teach ya some real great magic over there! C'mon!
"Zidane:If Vivi has a new friend, it can't be a bad thing...right?"
Chelinka:Yuri! Where are you? Yuuuri!
"Tifa:Palom! If you can hear us, come on out!"
"Mog:No luck, kupo... They're nowhere to be found."
Kain:The monsters in the vicinity are fierce. We mustn't let our guard down.
Chelinka:Oh dear... Yuri!
Tifa:Let's split up one more time. They can't have gone that far.
"Palom:Hey, how's it goin'?"
Chelinka:Yuri! Palom!
Palom:Huh? Why's everyone so shocked to see us?
Tifa:You should know why! You're the ones who ran off without telling anyone!
"Mog:Where were you two, kupo?"
"Yuri:There was this real interesting looking spot, so we went to go investigate."
Palom:It was dark and damp and spooky. We had a blast!
Chelinka:And all by yourselves... What if some monsters found you!
Palom:Me and Yuri'd take care of 'em!
Chelinka:That's not what I'm talking about.
Chelinka:I was so worried... Can't you be even a little sorry!
"Yuri:Sorry, sorry! We'll be more careful next time..."
"Tifa:Palom, do you understand, too?"
Tifa:...? Palom?
Palom:We were wrong... Sorry to make you worry about us...
Tifa:No way! He actually...!
"Mog:Apologized, kupo! And didn't make any excuses!"
Kain:What curious turn of events might this be?
Palom:Getting chewed out by Chelinka just reminded me of my sister...
Yuri:You have a sister?
Tifa:Huh... Are you at all similar?
"Kain:Other than appearance, not in the least."
Palom:I'm so jealous that Yuri gets to have his sister here with him.
"Palom:We were always together, but now..."
Tifa:Cheer up. I'm sure we'll run into her soon.
"Mog:She might already be here, kupo! We should hurry up and find her!"
"Chelinka:Yes, we can't leave her all alone in a dangerous place like this."
"Palom:Hey, she isn't the wimp you seem to think she is! Monsters won't get her that easily!"
"Palom:We're the magical prodigies of Mysidia, after all!"
"Palom:You'll all help me look for her, right?"
Chelinka:Of course.
Vivi:Here I go! Pow!
"Palom:Ohhh! You did it, Vivi! All that training paid off!"
"Vivi:Hehe... Thanks, Palom. You think I got a little stronger?"
"Palom:Yeah, you did! Now you can use real great magic, too!"
Palom:Let's go show everyone! This calls for a real great exhibition ceremony!
"Cait Sith:Hey, now, what's all the buzz about?"
Ashe:I do not know. I was simply asked to come here.
Palom:Heya! Sorry to keep all y'all waiting!
"Palom:Vivi's gonna show you all the real great magic I taught him! Aren't ya, Vivi!"
"Vivi:Uh, hi there..."
Palom:Oh? And here's a monster!
"Palom:Alright, Vivi! Do your stuff!"
Vivi:Ahhh! I can't handle this by myself!
Ramza:Vivi! Look out!
Ashe:To his aid!
Cait Sith:On my way!
Vivi:Whew... That was scary...
"Palom:Aw, Vivi! Quit yer whining! That thing woulda been toast with your real great magic!"
Vivi:Wh-what do you think I am...?
Palom:sometimes ya gotta bluff it! Puff yer chest out and face it like a man!
Cait Sith:You're sure a feisty lad.
"Ramza:Verily, I am fain to believe he would not back down before any foe."
Palom:You got that right! Watch this! I'll show you how strong I really am!
Palom:Waaaugh! Even I can't handle this many all at once!
Cait Sith:Now what?
Ashe:I suppose some things you cannot bluff.
Ramza:That is what for we have our brothers- and sisters-in-arms.
"Vivi:Right! Let's help him! Palom, we're coming!"
Golbez:...So you will go.
"Kuja:You've felt it, I'm sure. That sensation of someone draining away our power..."
"Golbez:Furthermore, that moogle... It is no mere spirit..."
"Golbez:If you are at their side, you may learn its true identity."
Kuja:My plans aren't so grandiose as that.
Kuja:...The audience has simply tired of waiting for me to take the stage.
"Mog:Kupo! A Torsion is forming, kupo!"
"Zidane:Kuja... So this is one of your Torsions, is it?"
"Kuja:Why, so it is. You need something to fight, don't you? How can we call this a show without an action sequence?"
"Mog:Your underhanded theatrics end here, kupo!"
Steiner:Why you! This time you will get the drubbing you deserve!
"Kuja:Heh... Yes, do give it all you've got."
Setzer:...I suspect he's bluffing; dare we play along?
Zidane:He's not getting away this time. I'll drag the truth out of him if I have to!
Kuja:You should save that line for after you've won the battle.
"Kuja:Now then... The villain, yours truly, is thus trounced..."
"Kuja:And the Torsion vanishes. All according to the moogle's script, I do believe."
"Balthier:If there's something you want to say, try spitting it out."
Zidane:What is it you know? About Mog? About the Torsions?
"Kuja:Heh heh... Well, for example...how about this?"
Mog:Kupo!? These are...dimensional coordinates!?
Vivi:Huh!? Does that mean...Kuja's gonna fight for us!?
"Edgar:Then do tell, what's your motive? I assume that know-it-all smirk isn't an act."
Kuja:This is just a cameo for now...
Kuja:It will be a while yet before I take center stage.
Balthier:Please... start pretending you're the leading man and you'll be sorry to find someone else already in the spotlight.
Zidane:Hold on! I'm not done with you!
"Mog:...Should I try summoning him, kupo?"
"Edgar:No, he's not the type to engage in decent conversation anyway. More importantly..."
"Zidane:Vivi... Calling him an ""ally"" all of a sudden has to be hard to swallow."
Vivi:I don't know...
Vivi:I feel scared...but I also feel like I need to be brave enough to accept that his powers can help us...
Balthier:I'm not surprised it's confusing for you. The man was your enemy back in your world.
"Edgar:The rest of us don't know anything about him, but we can appreciate how complicated your feelings must be."
"Edgar:But thinking about our next steps, if you'll forgive me saying so, we stand to profit from his abilities and knowledge."
Zidane:What he's done back in our world is completely unforgivable. Especially what he's done to your friends...
Zidane:Even so...I think we might need him here.
Vivi:Yeah... I know...
"Zidane:If it looks like Kuja's going back to his old tricks for even a second, I'll be there to rein him in. 'Kay?"
Balthier:Why do I feel left out?
"Edgar:If such a thing happens, we'll all be here to make things right."
Zidane:Ah...yeah. That's right. We're in this together.
"Vivi:Thanks... Everyone. I'll do my best, too, and think things over."
Zidane:Kuja's...gotta be planning to alter his fate back home.
"Zidane:Vincent, weren't you trying to do something similar?"
"Vincent:...Yes, though it ended in failure."
Tidus:How can someone even alter fate to begin with?
"Shantotto:Well, creating Torsions is a power we all possess."
Shantotto:So manipulating the jumble of time and space within them would be my guess.
Vincent:That's the idea.
"Garnet:The Torsions also affected our memories when they brought us here, did they not?"
"Vincent:They distort time itself. For instance, some who should have already passed are living and breathing among us..."
"Vincent:Yet this fact hardly strikes us as strange... Whether that's also the work of the Torsions, I don't know..."
"Vincent:I don't know, but...it was enough to make me think the sins I'd committed were redeemable."
Shantotto:Short of even a hypothesis.
"Shantotto:To be of use to my research, such details are worthless."
Vivi:People who've already died...are living among us...
Tidus:That means Kuja has someone he wants to bring back to life?
Zidane:If there's any mortal fate he wants to change...it's his own.
Zidane:Kuja can't accept that his days are numbered.
"Vincent:I searched for some means under that mage Kefka, and did little more than err for it."
Vincent:It's unlikely Kuja will have any better success.
Tidus:...Everyone dies eventually.
Vivi:Yeah... That's what we leave memories for.
"Tidus:If I'm gonna disappear at some point, if someone remembers me...even just once in a while...that's enough for me."
"Vivi:...Me, too. That's why I'm traveling with everyone..."
"Garnet:To leave memories... No doubt our adventure here will become valuable memories, too."
Zidane:Yeah. ...Be nice if Kuja could come around to see things that way.
"Lightning:It seems that Kuja is only interested in being evasive, and isn't going to give us a whit of information."
Cyan:What sort of man is he?
"Zidane:""What sort...""? Man, where to start?"
Eiko:It is all his fault the kingdom fell to shambles!
Cyan:So it is fair to say he is not a man of virtue.
"Lightning:The situation sounds more complicated for Zidane and Vivi, though."
Vivi:A lot of my friends were used like tools and got really hurt.
Zidane:Learning that drove him to despair. He probably...wants to change that.
Lightning:Do you think changing his fate would be beneficial for all of you as well?
Steiner:Such as turning everything back to the way things were...?
Eiko:No! That wouldn't solve anything!
Vivi:...Yeah. A lot of bad things happened...but we shouldn't act like they didn't happen.
Cyan:To fear death...and regret one's failings are feelings present in anyone.
"Cyan:...The number of times I have lamentedmy country'sruin, the loss ofmy family, are uncountable..."
Steiner:However...it is because of our journey that the princess and I are who we are today.
Cyan:Verily. It is what lies beyond after seeing it through those terrible memories.
"Lightning:Anyway, still nothing proves we or the gods here have any power to meddle with time back in our own worlds."
Lightning:You have to keep your eyes front and move on. ...Regret is a waste of time.
"Zidane:Yeah, I know."
"Eiko:I'm with you, Lightning! When the going gets tough, I'm going with my eyes front!"
Steiner:Indeed... Let us carry on.
"Zidane:I'm fine, Vivi. You go on ahead."
Zidane:Kuja...please... At least in this world...don't go down the wrong path...
Zidane:Maybe if it's someplace within my reach...I can help you.
"Kuja:My, my... What a strong cast."
"Irvine:Oh, it's the show-off pretty boy. What's the occasion?"
"Terra:If you've come here without Mog summoning you, that means..."
Edgar:You have something to tell us that's not for moogle ears.
Kuja:Heh... No pivotal revelations quite yet. We wouldn't want to spoil the story.
Serah:Then tell us what you can. I don't care who it's from; I just want answers.
Kuja:...Such a strong heroine.
"Kuja:Let us talk about gods, today. Two gods who created a world."
"Warrior of Light:The goddess who summoned us, Materia... And the other being Spiritus..."
"Kuja:Yes, Materia and Spiritusa perpetually bickering pair."
"Kuja:I was summoned by Spiritus. His sole concern is power, and he pays little heed to one's...people skills in their worlds."
"Irvine:Well, that's funny. Didn't the two of them make the world?"
"Kuja:Yes, they created it, but therein arose some abnormalities..."
"Edgar:And though they should be working together to fix things, they can't agree on the means and quarrel to no end...?"
Kuja:That quarrel is merely the superficial layer of this tale... What's eating away at the world is something more complex.
"Serah:You're not saying that's Mog, are you?"
Terra:But Mog! Mog's been guiding us...
Irvine:Can anyone here come up with some proof either way?
Edgar:...We'll keep your words in mind. I'm sure they'll come in handy.
Kuja:Heh heh... Please carry on dancing until the climax.
Terra:I can't believe Mog would be plotting something behind our backs...
"Edgar:Don't confuse ""keeping in mind"" with ""believing."""
Warrior of Light:Regardless of the veracity of his tale...it is fact that Mog puts us in a difficult position by recruiting Kuja and his kind.
Serah:I don't think I could so easily trust someone who was a bitter enemy back home...
"Irvine:Our enemies could be next, don't you think?"
"Warrior of Light:If we notice the slightest harm or unease befall any of our comrades, we must not keep it to ourselves."
"Edgar:Naturally. We're brothers and sisters in destiny, after all."
"???:The last time Ivisited thereas an instructor was...with Squall, huh?"
"???:I think I remember teasing him then, too."
???:Zell... Seifer... That was a rough exam...
"???:Heavens, this isn't the time to get lost in thought."
???:Where could everyone be? I'd best try to meet back up.
Laguna:Hey! Who's that over there!?
???:You're kidding me... Laguna?
Y'shtola:Your acquaintance?
"Laguna:Eh? Uh, I, um... I don't think we've met...maybe?"
"???:...But that can't be right, because I shouldn't be me in that case. This is strange..."
???:And who are these others? I've never seen a knight in full armor outside of movies...
???:Ears and tails... An unknown race...?
"???:...No good. I need to calm down. Like I tell my students, there's a difference between a test and the real thing..."
Zidane:Hello? You keep mumbling to yourself...
"Laguna:Another one who knows me, but I don't know them... Why does this keep happening to me? Ugh, my head hurts..."
"Cecil:This may be more complicated than it first appeared, but she doesn't seem to be hostile."
"Y'shtola:It would be nice to determine as much at our leisure, so perhaps we should rid the area of any other threats first."
Zell:Quistis!
Quistis:Zell! And Squall! I finally found you!
Y'shtola:So you are an acquaintance.
Zell:But she was the youngest to pass the SeeD exams. Her creds are solid!
Squall:...Glad you're safe.
Quistis:Uh-oh... Did something happen? It's not like you to worry about others.
Steiner:Master Squall has been most concerned about his friends back in his world.
"Galuf:He puts on a standoffish face, but he's a compassionate lad deep down!"
Squall:(...I shouldn't have opened my mouth.)
Quistis:An alternate world? It's hard to believe...but I think I've got the situation.
Y'shtola:We have been gathering allies along our journey.
"Galuf:Everyone starts off on their own, but as you can see, we're now one big, happy family."
Quistis:So then the rest of our party is with you?
Squall:We haven't found everyone. But that doesn't mean they're here.
"Quistis:I see... Here or not, though, you can't help but worry..."
"Quistis:""Ever."""
"Y'shtola:Haha, you've read him like a book."
Steiner:Just like a teacher to know her student.
"Quistis:Not as a teacher, but a friend. You've been fighting alongside him, too, haven't you?"
"Squall:...It's good that you're alright and caught up on things. But as for me, just"
"Y'shtola:""Leave me alone."""
Y'shtola:...Did I do it right?
Squall:...Let's go.
"Zell:Aww, c'mon Squall! Don't pout!"
"Quistis:At last, someone with my sense of humor. We should have a chat."
Y'shtola:It would be my pleasure. As a friend.
"Galuf:Hmm, wise beyond her years and possessed of a deep understanding of her companions, it seems."
Steiner:Another valuable ally we have gained!
"Quistis:I see you've been honing your skills during your time here, Zell."
Zell:The competition's fierce in a big party like this! Gotta kick it up a notch!
"Quistis:And it's reassuring to see you've got a handle on your nerves, Irvine. Everyone is looking good, all things considered."
Irvine:Never been better.
"Zell:Oh yeah, Seifer and his crew are here, too..."
Zell:Be nice if he'd grow up a little...
"Vaan:That's right. You'd know Seifer, too, huh?"
Quistis:You've met him?
"Hope:...Yeah, we've fought a number of times."
Vaan:He picks a fight with us every time we run into him.
"Quistis:I'm not surprised... As his instructor, please accept my apologies."
Yuna:We can tell he's not a bad person.
"Yuna:He told me that I shouldn't have to shoulder everything myself, and that he'd protect me as a knight..."
"Irvine:Always a heavy-handed approach, that guy."
Quistis:...Indeed. A shortcoming that keeps holding him back...
Quistis:He gets good marks in combat...but his habit of ignoring others to do his own thing is inexcusable for a mercenary.
"Hope:So he was like that back in his own world, too..."
"Zell:Those other two from thedisciplinary committee, too."
Quistis:Fujin and Raijin?
Irvine:The three of them carrying on without a clue about what's going on here sure is something.
Quistis:I see... They deserve an A for effort.
"Quistis:I suppose in this sort of situation, a bad habit of doing his own thing becomes an ability to act independently."
Zell:That's one way to put it. You're trying to defend his actions?
"Quistis:He hasn't committed any serious wrongdoing yet, right?"
"Irvine:Yet. No telling when he'll try to pull something funny, though."
"Quistis:I may not be his instructor anymore, but we grew up in the same environment. I'd like to see him succeed if possible."
Hope:You sure are supportive. I'll bet you were a nice teacher.
"Irvine:The kids love ya, ""Instructor"" Trepe."
"Quistis:I told you, I'm no longer an instructor! ...Though I don't mind the compliment."
"Eiko:Say, Quistis!"
"Quistis:Oh? Hello, you two. How can I help you?"
Eiko:I've got a real interest in this school thing I've been hearing about!
"Vivi:You're a teacher, right, Miss? It'd be nice if you could teach us some stuff, too..."
Quistis:What cute students. You'd be underclassmen back in the garden.
Quistis:I'll teach you what I can...but what about these three in the back there?
"Prishe:Heya! Sign us up, too!"
"Sabin:With all my training, I forgot my studies. Figure I better learn a thing or two so I can help out Edgar!"
Bartz:It'd be useful to learn fighting techniques from another world! And it sounds like fun!
"Quistis:I see... Well, you're free to join...but this will be elementary instruction, okay?"
"Quistis:Alright, let's review the monsters we just discussed. Ready?"
"Eiko:Yes, Miss Trepe!"
"Prishe:You bet! They're friggin' hot to the touch! I'm right, right?"
Prishe:Huh? Was that it?
Quistis:...Let's try again.
Quistis:What effect does amalboro'sbad breathhave on a person? Anyone?
Sabin:You get real light-headed and pass out!
"Bartz:You lose your appetite, too."
Quistis:I-I guess that's not wrong...
Sabin:Oh yeah! Wreckin' the curve!
Bartz:We can do anything if we put our minds to it!
"Eiko:Aw, c'mon! What gives?"
Eiko:You guys are holding up the whole class! We can't move on like this!
"Eiko:Vivi, speak up! Give 'em your piece of mind, too!"
Eiko:...You're asleep.
Prishe:Aren't we all a little tired?
Sabin:I'll bet it's from having to use my melon for the first time in so long. How 'bout we all take a quick nap?
"Bartz:Thanks, Quistis! I look forward to learning from you again!"
Quistis:...I'm a failure.
Eiko:Arrrgh! How frustrating! It can't end like this!
"Irvine:What's the matter, Quistis? Ah! Did you just remember something important?"
"Quistis:No, quite the opposite."
"Quistis:I feel as though, bit by bit, I'm losing details of events from our world."
"Quistis:I haven't forgotten everything, of course, but it's like there are these holes..."
"Faris:You, too? Same here, to be honest."
Galuf:I don't see what's so unusual about a little memory loss.
Onion Knight:You're a special case...
Balthier:More than a few are in the same situation. ...Enough to make me question myself.
"Irvine:Out of curiosity, what's the situation with your GFs?"
"Quistis:I haven't any... Or perhaps more accurately, I couldn't use them in this world even if I wanted to."
Irvine:Sounds about right.
"Quistis:""Guardian Forces."" Something like what we callsummonshere."
"Irvine:Where we're from, you get a nice power boost from equipping them."
Quistis:The trade-off being you lose some of your memory...or by chance remember things.
"Galuf:Hm, what you might call a double-edged sword, eh?"
"Onion Knight:But you can't use them here, right?"
Faris:Meaning they aren't to blame for your memory loss.
"Quistis:Yes, so it would seem..."
"Balthier:So is it the Torsions, or is it the gods?"
"Onion Knight:Torsions are one thing, but memory-stealing gods?"
Balthier:Who's to say? There could also be another player in the mix we've yet to imagine.
"Faris:Gods or whoever, what's there to gain from taking away our memories?"
"Irvine:""Keep your mind focused on this world""? Memories from back home'll get in the way, after all..."
"Quistis:...At any rate, at least we can tell friend from foe."
Quistis:I'd hate to imagine we're fighting our allies because we don't remember them.
Balthier:Perish the thought. Now let's focus on the task at hand.
"Mog:Lord Spiritus's warriors are really getting things done, kupo!"
"Mog:Care to see what they've been up to, kupo?"
"Spiritus:Hmph... If you think you can manage such a feat, show me."
Cloud of Darkness:Hahaha... That you would even try to use us is appalling...
Cloud of Darkness:We are the law itself. That is the reason which the world follows...
Mog:Kupo! They didn't tell us anything!
"Mog:How about this one, kupo?"
The Emperor:What's this...? A wretched god and its wretched spirit?
The Emperor:I alone am all that's needed to rule this world. Shall I destroy it here and now?
"Mog:Hold that thought, kupo! If you destroy the world, the Torsions go with it, kupo!"
"Mog:That would put you in a bind, too, right, kupo?"
"The Emperor:Then bother me no more. The next time you have an audience with me, it will be in a battle over the conqueror's throne."
"Mog:Kupo... Let's try the sorceress, kupo..."
Ultimecia:Ha... Deceitful spirit. Still you persist with this act.
"Ultimecia:Unaware of that within you, eating away at your very self..."
"Mog:Kupo! No one is cooperating, kupo..."
"Kefka:This does not sit well with me. Pretending to let us do what we want, while it's really for your own hobbies."
"Kefka:Well, pthbbth! I'm through with you!"
"Kefka:Hee hee hee! Time to get on with my bad self, just the way I like it."
"Mog:Are you going to cut ties with Lord Spiritus, kupo! Is that really a wise idea?"
"Spiritus:I care not. At least I can grasp his motivation, unlike you."
"Mog:Kupo! I'm working hard for the sake of the world and its gods, kupo!"
Kefka:Hee hee hee! It has been a puh-leasure doing business with you.
"Mog:Consider it a deal, kupo!"
Terra:Mog!? Kefka...what are you doing here!?
Kefka:Whoopsie-daisy. I'll leave it to you to relay the particulars. TTFN!
Edgar:...Mog! Did you just accept Kefka's dimensional coordinates!?
Firion:You mean...to fight with us!?
"Terra:No! How could you!? Mog, you know what Kefka has done!"
"Mog:H-he was so very insistent about it! Whether you use them or not is up to you, kupo..."
Edgar:That's not what we're talking about! We're talking about your behavior!
Edgar:That man has slaughtered countless innocents in his lust for carnage! There's no excusing his sins!
Shadow:You worked with Kefka for a time.
Shadow:What's his goal here? Would you be able to detect any ulterior motives?
Terra:Shadow! Are you really...?
Shadow:I'm eliminating emotion to assess reality.
Edgar:Are you telling us we need...to get a grip?
Shadow:I don't expect it to come easily.
Firion:There's no telling when Kefka might betray us...
"Shadow:By moogle logic, that would make Mog a traitor, too."
Edgar:So the moment Kefka starts acting suspiciously...we should be prepared to eliminate him and Mog wholesale.
Terra:Mog... Why...?
Vincent:...We don't need to reach a conclusion immediately. Let's take our time thinking this over.
Vincent:...What do you want?
"Kefka:I just came to see you, ol' palsy-walsy!"
"Kefka:You wike pwaying fwiends, don't you? I mean, all this talk of trust and stuff makes me want to hurl, but I see the appeal!"
Vincent:...Leave me alone.
Seifer:Hey! You trying to start something?
Serah:Are you bothering Vincent?
Kefka:Heh heh heh. You caught me!
Kefka:I was just trying to have a little fun with my buddy!
Vincent:...I won't make the same mistake again. You and I are nothing alike.
"Seifer:There'll be no fighting on my watch! If you keep this up, you'll have to answer to me."
"Kefka:Alright, alright. See ya later, alligator!"
"Raijin:That was close! You sure told him, ya know!"
Vincent:...I'm fine.
Seifer:I still can't believe Mog allowed that guy to join our ranks. That moogle can't be trusted after all.
"Serah:But thanks to you, Seifer, nothing happened."
"Raijin:That's right! He takes his role on thedisciplinary committeeseriously, ya know!"
Serah:Hehe... How noble of him.
Seifer:Hmph... Course there'll be trouble with mooks like him around.
Serah:That's true... Terra and Edgar haven't yet accepted Kefka as part of the group...
Serah:But I understand. Even I wouldn't be able to accept an enemy from my home world so easily...
"Raijin:Yeah. Let us handle those moments, ya know?"
Vincent:Everyone has something that they can't do on their own...
Serah:You're right. It's important for us to be there for each other.
Kefka:I can't believe a force of destruction like yourself was really summoned by that blockhead Materia.
"Shantotto:Unfortunately for you, I don't recall by whom I was brought."
"Shantotto:But I pursue my own goals, so to me, it matters not."
Kefka:Then why don't you come with me? I'm certain it'll be easier to satisfy your destructive desires.
Shantotto:That is for me alone to decide.
Shantotto:But I do not think my noble ideals and your uncouth motives would ever coincide.
"Kefka:Heh heh heh... No matter what pretty logic you put behind it, destruction is still destruction!"
"Eiko:Oh no! What should I do!? If those two start a fight, it's gonna be big trouble!"
Rem:What's the matter? Is something wrong?
Eiko:Yes! It's Shantotto and Kefka! Come quick!
Papalymo:Good grief... That's a combination to make my head hurt.
King:Let's get a move on.
Rem:What happened here!?
"Shantotto:Have you come to help me? You're a bit late, as you can see."
Eiko:Did you fight Kefka?
"Shantotto:I was merely conducting an experiment, to my own merriment."
King:An experiment? It looks like someone used a massive amount of magic here.
Rem:Just what were you trying to test?
Papalymo:Well... Do you know what happens to the remnants of magic? Have you noticed it flowing in a certain direction?
"King:We were studying the use of magic back home, so I guess..."
Rem:...Toward Mog?
"Shantotto:Oh, how cheery! It seems there was some truth to my theory!"
Papalymo:Yes. It appears that Mog's been absorbing the energy we release during battle.
Eiko:But why would Mog do such a thing? Won't he explode?
Shantotto:Explode... I see. That's what his intention may be.
Papalymo:A clash between warriors of different worlds produces magical power or an equivalent energy.
King:Which means he's trying to use that energy for something.
Rem:I can't imagine it's anything good. Let's tread carefully... We have no choice but to fight.
"Faris:That mage, Kefka. He hasn't done anything to us so far."
"Faris:I get that it's nothing good, but what did he do in your world?"
"Ramza:If it comes to a duel, I would know as well."
Edgar:Originally he was amagitek knightof theGestahlian Empire.
Warrior of Light:Stole the power of goddesses...?
Ramza:Had he no cognizance of his crimes? Some ideology or driving goal?
Setzer:Kefka hasn't the heart for such luxuries as that.
Edgar:His mind is completely shattered. All he seeks is ruin... Nothing more.
Faris:In order words...he can't listen to reason.
Faris:Isn't this a right awful party member we've brought aboard. What is that Mog thinking?
Ramza:Mog's thoughts aside... What Kefka's deeds wrought are hard to forgive...
Ramza:Sacrificing the innocent and the powerless...!
Warrior of Light:We can no longer trust Mog's judgment... We must rely on our own.
Terra:But how can we find our way in this world without any help...?
Setzer:It's a gamble.
"Ramza:Mog professes he acts at the goddess's word, but we cannot take that at face value..."
"Setzer:Right. But if we watch his actions, we should be able to read his hand."
Edgar:Mog acts toward some goal other than the gods' will...but what...?
Setzer:We're one step behind him.
Ramza:What can we do?
Warrior of Light:We can only prepare to remain staunch in our convictions when the moment of truth comes.
King:...Something's off about the monsters around here.
Galuf:Hrm. There are signs here and there of beasts battling each other.
Faris:That's not all. There's poison spread about over there.
Faris:It's like some big...something was scattering poison as it thrashed about.
"Mog:Kupo!? Someone's collapsed up ahead, kupo!"
Faris:!? It can't be...!!
"Faris:It is you! Hey, snap out of it!"
Galuf:...No good. She's out cold.
"Mog:Do you know her, kupo?"
"Galuf:Yes, we traveled with her back in our world. She's Faris's little sister."
Faris:Lenna! It's me! Answer me!
King:...She's badly wounded. We should tend to her quickly.
Faris:Blast it! Who could have done this...!?
"Mog:Kupooo! It sounds like a ferocious monster is around here, kupo!"
King:It's too dangerous to stay here. Let's get her someplace safe.
"Galuf:Right you are. Good grief, some reunion this is..."
Lenna:...Un...unhhh...
Faris:Lenna! You're awake!
Lenna:Faris...? And Bartz...
Bartz:Thank goodness! She remembers us!
Lenna:...What happened to that poor thing?
Faris:What poor thing?
Lenna:There was a dragon... She was so badly injured...
"Lenna:She kept crying out, ""It hurts. Help me."""
Cecil:What's this? She can understand the words of dragons?
Bartz:Yeah. She has a special connection with all kinds of animals.
"Lenna:I so desperately wanted to help her, but it didn't go so well..."
Faris:...Is that who attacked you?
Lenna:No! It's not her fault!
Lenna:Her body wouldn't move how she wanted due to the pain. She didn't mean to hurt me.
Lenna:She must be struggling by herself somewhere out there. I have to help her...
"Cecil:Despite what you've gone through, you still put the dragon's concerns above your own. You are a kind soul."
"Lenna:...Um, who are you?"
"Mog:Kupo! We're back from scouting, kupo!"
"Terra:Oh, you're awake? Thank goodness."
Lenna:I heard from my sister all that you've done for me. Thank you very much...
"Mog:Kupo kupo! It's nice to meet you again, kupo!"
"Bartz:So, how'd it look out there?"
Terra:...Everywhere you look is corroded by poison. It all seems to have been spread by a dragon.
Faris:A dragon... That must be the one Lenna spoke of.
"Mog:The dragon was also covered in poison, kupo. It must have fought with some venomous creature, kupo."
Terra:It likely spread the poison around as it thrashed in pain...
Bartz:And is still thrashing.
Lenna:Can't we help her...?
"Mog:From the looks of it, it's too late to do anything, kupo..."
Terra:It's already at death's door. All it can do is lash out until it breathes its last...
Lenna:I see...
"Cecil:We might become the target of its frustration at any time, too."
"Faris:Lenna, I know how you must be feeling, but..."
Lenna:...Thank you. I don't want anyone else to get hurt.
Lenna:But I can't stand to see her suffer anymore...
Lenna:Let's go to her now. I want to do what I can.
"Bartz:...Yeah, let's."
Cecil:Lenna... We shan't let your conviction go to waste.
"Serah:You're so amazing, Lenna! I think it's wonderful that you want to save that poor dragon."
Lenna:Of course I do! I can't just leave her out there on her own...
Bartz:Your kind heart hasn't changed a bit. But let's not forget how much trouble that's gotten you into before.
"Serah:Did something like this happen in your home world, too?"
Faris:You got that right.
"Faris:She once crossed apoisonous fieldto getdragon grassfor her sickwind drake, Hiryu."
"Bartz:You even ate the dragon weed in front of him, didn't you?"
"Lenna:Yes. I had to show him it was okay, or else he wouldn't have eaten it."
"Galuf:But it's poisonous to humans, despite being medicinal to dragons..."
"Serah:Poisonous? ...Well, it looks like you made it out just fine."
Lightning:You're a lot braver than I thought.
"Faris:But you need to be more careful. You're the only sister I have, you know."
Lightning:I know how you feel. Having a reckless little sister isn't easy.
Serah:Me? Reckless? You're one to talk!
Bartz:Is Serah really so rash?
"Lightning:She has a bad habit of running off, and she's no stranger to getting caught up in trouble."
"Serah:Hey, Pot! Kettle here!"
Serah:Aren't you the one always rushing headfirst into things without even listening to others?
Lightning:What!? Don't talk like you know!
"Lenna:Please calm down, you two."
"Bartz:I guess Lenna and Serah have a lot in common. They both look calm, but when push comes to shove, they're ready to take action."
Galuf:Ho ho ho! I suppose that toughness is a hand-me-down from their older sisters.
"Faris:...Is that supposed to be praise, Galuf?"
"Galuf:But of course. Blood will tell, after all. Hohoho!"
Steiner:Hm... It's so strange...
"Faris:What is, Steiner?"
"Steiner:You and Lady Lenna are sisters, are you not?"
"Steiner:Yet one is a pirate, and the other a princess..."
Steiner:Never have I heard of sisters like that!
Balthier:It's a valid point. How does a princess become a pirate?
Steiner:What in the world happened?
Lenna:...Faris and I were separated when we were children.
Faris:I was lost at sea and found by pirates.
Ashe:I see... So you two didn't grow up together.
Garnet:How did you two ever find each other again?
"Lenna:And on that journey, I needed a boat."
Faris:The boat she wanted was captained by none other than yours truly.
Balthier:I can't imagine such a meeting was a mere coincidence. Sounds like fate to me.
"Steiner:Princess Lenna, I know you left your home for a noble reason, but you shouldn't have."
Steiner:You are royalty! You must consider your own safety!
Steiner:I cannot condone running away and collaborating with brigands under any circumstances!
"Garnet:...Are you trying to lecture me, Steiner?"
"Ashe:There comes a time where everyone needs some help, no matter the source."
"Balthier:I much prefer a princess who takes action than one who stays locked up in her tower, crying her eyes out."
Steiner:But what about her people?
Steiner:The people want their monarchs to be safe and in good health! Please don't forget that!
Garnet:...He's right. I don't know what to say back...
Ashe:I am chagrined...
"Steiner:P-please, don't lose such heart!"
Faris:Steiner has a point.
"Faris:There are a lot of people waiting for you to return. That's why we need to go back alive, Lenna."
Lenna:Of course. I have no intention otherwise.
"Lenna:I will keep fighting for this world, and the people of Tycoon!"
Balthier:Someone waiting for your return... How nice that must be.
Galuf:That's the last of the Torsions in the vicinity.
"Mog:It's all thanks to your hard work, kupo!"
"Bartz:Kay, let's move on to our next destination."
Yuna:...Hm? Just a moment. I don't see Lenna around.
Galuf:Now that you mention it...
"Bartz:Vivi and Eiko are gone, too. Where'd everyone go?"
Eiko:Guys! Sorry to keep you waiting!
Galuf:You're all muddied up? What on earth happened?
Vivi:The three of us dug a grave for the dragon.
Bartz:A grave for the dragon?
Lenna:Yes... I want her to rest in peace.
Yuna:Is that so...?
Yuna:I am certain she's so terribly happy that you were there to send her on.
Eiko:We left lots and lots of flower seeds over the grave for her!
"Galuf:Ho ho ho, wonderful! Lovely flowers are sure to bloom."
Bartz:Yeah. Let's come back after some time so we can all pay our respects.
"Lenna:Thank you, everyone..."
"Mog:As long as the Torsions persist, incidents like this are bound to happen, kupo..."
Yuna:Monsters from different worlds will come into conflict after passing through the Torsions...
Galuf:Neither side was ever meant to encounter the other.
Galuf:An unnatural struggle... It's no wonder that poor dragon met such a fate.
Lenna:I...want to see all the Torsions closed. I can't bear to see this tragedy repeat itself...
"Mog:Kupo! Those are the words I hoped to hear, kupo! I can feel the kindness flowing form the light of your will, kupo!"
"Vivi:Let's give it our all, Miss Lenna."
Eiko:We'll all help!
"Bartz:Gosh... Don't take on more than you can handle, hear?"
"Galuf:Not to worry, Bartz. When they take on too much, we'll be there to lend them a hand."
Cloud:...You're cornered.
Cloud:So what? Draw your weapon!
Hope:I can't find Cloud anywhere.
Warrior of Light:Have we no hint as to his whereabouts?
"Mog:I sense something powerful over that way, kupo! Two somethings, kupo!"
Sephiroth:...World order?
Sephiroth:Of course... You're the one...
"Mog:K-kupo!? He's gonna attack us, kupo!"
"Tifa:He's not an opponent to take lightly! Help me out, guys!"
Sephiroth:Heh heh... ...That's right. Let me see this.
Sephiroth:...Now I see.
"Mog:Kupo! S-stop looking at me, kupo!"
Cloud:I'm over here!
Shadow:Wait! We're not alone... Manikins!
"Zidane:Aww, c'mon. The real ones are bad enough."
Sephiroth:Heh... A copy that was never even a lab rat...
Sephiroth:...Don't make me laugh.
Zidane:He's gonna fight the manikins!?
"Shadow:""The enemy of my enemy is my friend,"" eh? Cloud, what say you?"
Cloud:There's got to be a catch... There's no way we can trust him.
"Mog:Y-yeah, but...!"
"Mog:There's no way we can fight Sephiroth and his manikin at the same time, kupo..."
Shadow:Hm. Either one alone would leave us in sorry shape.
"Mog:Desperate times call for desperate measures. We need to take the advantage we can, kupo."
Sephiroth:Heh heh heh... So that's how you lead them.
"Mog:Kupo... What amazing energy, kupo. With that"
Sephiroth:Ha ha ha...
Cloud:Sephiroth! We aren't finished!
"Sephiroth:So cold, Cloud."
Sephiroth:This isn't the planet to return to. You lost your reason to fight me long ago.
Vivi:Cloud... What's he talking about?
Sephiroth:It's entirely possible you wouldn't understand... How much do you remember?
Sephiroth:Have you never questioned those memories? Your abilities?
Sephiroth:Things you've lost... And things you're given... Do you plan to repeat this pattern over and over?
Sephiroth:And you're the one using that to gather power.
"Mog:I haven't the foggiest, kupo."
Sephiroth:All you've gathered... Let me see that power for myself...!
"Sephiroth:Ha ha ha... You're joking, right? Don't tell me you haven't been suspicious from the start."
Warrior of Light:Hn... That is...
"Vivi:I-I trust Mog! I know everyone else is unsure, but I decided to trust him!"
"Warrior of Light:Vivi... Indeed, you have the right of it... Although my faith in Mog may have wavered"
Sephiroth:Save your theatrics.
Sephiroth:Cloud... How about you? What crosses your mind when you look at this unfinished world and its unfinished puppets?
Cloud:I...trust Mog...
Sephiroth:That's your answer?
"Sephiroth:Heh heh. Very well... I shall usher you forward, so you can see your own reactions when confronted with the truth."
Warrior of Light:Usher...? Explain yourself!
Sephiroth:Take it.
Sephiroth:That power inside of you... Don't disappoint me.
Cloud:You took his dimensional coordinates!?
"Mog:That's the will I was given, kupo..."
"Mog:I don't understand his intentions either, but I'm sure his strength will be of use to you, kupo."
"Mog:I can't fight, kupo... So I have to help you find your way in this world...and trust...in you..."
"Mog:All I can do...is support you, kupo..."
"Mog:I-I... I want to he...lp you, kupo... I... I..."
"Vivi:M-M-Mog, are you alright!?"
"Mog:What do you mean, kupo?"
"Mog:We've got a new ally! Let's keep fighting and go close those Torsions, kupo!"
"Mog:Cheer up, everyone! Let's go, kupo!"
"Cait Sith:I know what they say about cats and curiosity, but I can't help wondering what Sephiroth is thinking."
Cait Sith:I just can't put my paw on what his goal is. He seems different from Spiritus's other warriors.
Zidane:Kuja wants to change his destiny
Tidus:Seymour said he wanted to liberate us with death.
Celes:And Kefka just seems to be enjoying the carnage as always.
Cait Sith:But Sephiroth's goal here doesn't match up with the kind of things he did back home.
Layle:Maybe we could help if we knew more about him.
Layle:Could you tell us what kind of person he was back in your world?
"Cloud:But...after learning the truth about his birth, he went mad and started spiraling out of control."
Layle:What exactly did he find out?
Celes:Artificially enhanced? Just like me and Kefka...
Zidane:I see. So maybe Sephiroth's not so different from us after all...
Cait Sith:No... He's completely different.
Cloud:I'll never forget the heat of the flames from that day...
Tidus:So Cloud went after Sephiroth for revenge?
Cait Sith:Cloud's hometown was just the beginning.
"Cait Sith:After that, he tried to destroy the entire planet."
"Celes:Then he's just like Kefka, isn't he?"
Cloud:The planet tried to fix itself. And he gathered that energy...
Cloud:Wait. Could he be trying to gather this world's energy like that planesgorger that possessed Mog?
"Layle:Maybe he wants the energy to rewrite world order, like some kind of god."
"Cait Sith:I don't get it. Even if he changed the world order here, what good would it do?"
Cait Sith:All I know is we're all in trouble if he's found a new purpose in this world...
Tidus:This guy sounds like a real pain.
"Zidane:Well, whatever his goal may be, it sounds like he's still as dangerous an enemy as he was in your world."
Cloud:Yeah. We should be on our guard.
Kefka:Heh heh heh. Welcome back! Did you have fun playing with our new pals?
Kuja:Were you waiting here just to ask me that?
"Kefka:Why so cold? We're on the same team, aren't we?"
Kuja:Please don't rope me in with your buffoonery.
Kefka:Oh! Back so soon?
Kefka:It seems like you just can't stay away from that porcupine head!
Sephiroth:Stay out of my business.
Kefka:Aww... Nobody wants to play with me! What's the matter? Am I really that annoying?
Seymour:That is correct.
"Kefka:Well, if it isn't Mister Maester! Did you have some business to attend to with our friends, too?"
Seymour:...I've had enough of your idle chatter. You couldn't possibly understand what I'm doing.
"Kefka:You know, you're absolutely right!"
"Kefka:So why don't you enlighten me? If not for kicks, then why are you helping them?"
"Kefka:Ack! Wait, wait! Come on. It's been so long since we've seen each other, so why don't you stay and chat?"
"Kefka:...We could talk about that moogle, for example."
Kuja:...Mog? He betrayed those fools.
"Kefka:Yeah! But while blabbing on about the big bad Blackened Will, he was oh so sneakily gathering energy!"
"Kefka:And even after all that, those goody two-shoes still kept the scheming sack of fluff around! They're even chummier now!"
Kefka:I can't believe it! How does crazy stuff like this even happen!?
Sephiroth:Sympathy. Forgiveness. But those are all lies... Lies that pitiful humans cling to for survival.
"Kefka:I see! It's all because they're weak, little worms."
Seymour:That's right... Real truth doesn't exist in any world.
Sephiroth:They'll soon feel the sting of betrayal and the coldness of despair...
"Kefka:Oooh, I get it now! It seems we're on the same page after all!"
"Kuja:Silence, clown."
Sephiroth:Learn to hold your tongue...else I'll cut you down where you stand.
"Kefka:Hmph. Alright, alright already!"
Seymour:It seems like the moogle and his friends are calling.
Kefka:Ta-ta! Have fun out there!
"Vaan:You alright, Cloud? You don't look so good."
Cloud:It's nothing... Don't worry about it.
Vincent:He's just airsick.
"Sazh:Aw, man! Even you get sick?"
Sazh:...But I was at the helm. Sorry about that.
Cloud:It's not your fault.
Vaan:Leave the flying to me next time! I'll give you a smoother ride than Sazh's!
Cloud:Please. Don't make things worse.
"Vaan:Tsk, figures... Huh?"
Vaan:Is someone rummaging around over there?
Vincent:That's a familiar backside.
"Cloud:Yeah, it is. ...C'mon."
???:$#&%! Nothing but a pile of junk!
Cid:Cloud! Vincent! Where the hell'd you two run off to?
Vincent:What were you doing there?
"Cid:Huh? Trying to cobble together something to get me airborne, of course."
Sazh:From scratch!?
Cid:Natch! Need some way to track down and reconnect with my group.
"Cloud:In that case, you're all set. Here we are."
"Cid:Huh? I guess so, but..."
Vaan:Look out! Behind you!
Vincent:It appears a Torsion was buried under that rubble.
"Cid:The hell's a ""Torsion""?"
Cloud:We'll explain after we take care of those things.
"Cid:...You don't say. A whole new world, huh?"
"Yuffie:Gee, you caught on faster than I'd expect you to."
Tifa:I don't think he's giving it all that much thought...
Cid:Alright! Let's build a big ol' airship and fly on back home!
"Sazh:Cid, listen. If it's a big airship you want we've got ya covered."
"Cid:That so? Even if you do, I'm warning you, I can be a bit stubborn when it comes to these things."
"Cid:We've got the world's best pilot here, I'll have you know! Even got an airship with my name on it!"
Setzer:And a new competitor enters the race.
"Sazh:Now, now, let's keep our passengers' safety in mind 'fore we talk about racing..."
"Vaan:Hey, Cid! Teach me how to fly, too, will ya? These guys never let me take the wheel."
"Cid:Huh? That's 'cause they sized you up, kid."
"Cid:If they haven't let you steer, there's a reason. All the more so with passengers on board."
Cid:I didn't get to where I am in a day either. Take it one step at a time and you'll reach your dreams.
"Cid:For now, just work on aping others' techniques. Think of it as training."
"Vaan:I guess you're right. You all were young once, too, huh?"
Setzer:I hope that remark wasn't directed at me.
"Cid:Alright, let's see this airship. Could be a tune up is in order."
Vaan:Sure thing! It's over here!
"Sazh:Man, now I want to take a look, too!"
Tifa:We didn't even have to ask him to join us.
Yuffie:Good for Cid hitting it off with his new friends.
"Cid:Hey, Mog. You're the one who provided that airship?"
"Mog:Kupo! Do you like it, kupo?"
"Cid:Yeah, she ain't a bad boat! Got a comfortable clunk to her!"
"Cid:...So, uh, I don't suppose she's got any rockets on her, eh?"
Mog:K-kupo? Rockets...kupo?
Cloud:Not that again...
"Cid:Argh! $#&%, yes, that again!"
"Irvine:""That"" what?"
Yuffie:Cid wants to be an astronaut. The first man in space.
"Irvine:Ohhh, space..."
"Irvine:I guess we beat him to the punch, eh, Squall?"
Squall:(Don't remind me...)
Cid:Beat me...? You kids've been to space?
Irvine:It just kinda happened that way.
"Cid:Just kinda happened!? Holy $#&%, am I jealous!"
"Cid:Hey, what'd the planet look like from space!? Was there anything out there!?"
Cid:Do you really float around weightlessly!? D-don't tell me you went out on a spacewalk!
Squall:(What a pain...)
"Mog:You're as giddy as a kid, kupo!"
Yuffie:I sure don't get it. Just thinking about going to space makes me queasy. ...Urp.
Cloud:Likewise. I want nothing to do with it.
Cid:A s-space station...?
"Irvine:If you felt like it, you could probably go live there."
Cid:Cloud! Yuffie! I've made up my mind!
"Cid:When we're done here, I'm going back to these guys' world! Don't try to stop me!"
Cloud:No one's stopping you...
"Cid:Alright, gotta get to closing those Torsions! For space!"
"Mog:Th-that's not supposed to be why we're closing them, kupo..."
Cid:Irvine! You tell me more about it!
Irvine:What? Me!? Squall!
Squall:You reap what you sowed.
Yuffie:He's all yours.
Cid:What's this all of a sudden?
Cecil:My apologies. I just realized something.
"Cecil:Inmy world, there's also someone by the name ofCid. He was both a pilot and engineer, not unlike you."
"Cid:Well, ain't that a coincidence!"
"Onion Knight:He was an old man who knew his way around an airship, too. He used aperpetual engineto makeour shipfly."
Bartz:TheCidfrommy worldwas an inventor and scholar.
Bartz:He could read ancient texts and remodel our airship. He was a big help on our journey.
Cid:Gahaha! Happy to hear they're doing their namesake proud.
Tifa:You don't seem surprised at all.
Cid:The world is a big place. It's only natural there'd be others with the same name.
Tifa:I guess you've got a point...
"Cid:How 'bout you, Zidane? Any great Cids in your world?"
Zidane:He'sthe ruler of a hugecountry. He likes inventing and even developed airships.
"Bartz:Interesting, isn't it? It seems all Cids have ties to airships."
Cecil:And they've all helped us in their own way.
"Cid:We're pretty nifty, aren't we? I'd like to talk to all of 'em and see what I could learn about technology."
"Cecil:If you're discussing airships, please allow me to join."
Cid:A gathering of men of the sky! I'm already lookin' forward to meetin' like-minded fellas!
Onion Knight:I wonder if they'll all get along...
Zidane:This Cid's sure a roughneck.
"Tifa:Yeah, but he's a reliable one."
Cid:Alright! You ready for this?
"Galuf:Good grief... You may have skill, but that doesn't mean you have to rush into everything like that."
"Cid:What're you saying, old man? Having this kind of energy is a good thing!"
Jecht:That's right! It keeps everyone's spirits up.
Yang:It seems you two have found a kindred spirit in each other.
Sazh:Your kids must be a handful.
"Cid:Sorry, don't have any! I'm living a true bachelor's life."
Galuf:I feared as much...
"Yang:Lord Cid, they say one becomes stronger once having a family."
Jecht:Isn't there anyone you've got your eye on?
"Cid:A-absolutely not! So leave me alone, will ya!?"
Sazh:...You're a terrible liar.
Galuf:Ohoho. Hate is but the other side of love.
"Cid:That's enough out of you, old man...!"
Cid:Sure she takes care of everything at the lab...
Cid:But she's dumb as a rock when it comes to work! She put herself in danger for my dream. She could have died!
Cid:That's why I had to give up on that dream. It was all her fault...
Yang:Hm? You mean you saved her?
Cid:I wasn't about to sacrifice her!
Jecht:Which means she was more important than your dream.
"Galuf:You just don't get it, do you?"
"Sazh:Ahh, youthful romance. I'm almost jealous."
Jecht:Isn't it time you grew up?
Cid:The hell're they talkin' about? Lettin' their imaginations run wild is what...
"Cid:Don't stick your noses into other people's business, dammit!"
"Yuffie:Geez, this rain just won't let up."
"Mog:It's always raining here, kupo. My pom-pom is waterlogged..."
"Firion:I would welcome the rain, but it's bound to wear us down if it stays like this."
"Tifa:We're all gonna catch our death out here. Cloud, let's go look for someplace"
Cloud:Someone's here.
Yuffie:Whaaa!? Who!?
Cloud:...Over there!
Tifa:Ah! Wait! Cloud!
"Mog:Everybody after him, kupo! We can look for shelter after!"
Cloud:!? Y-you...!?
???:Hm? But...where's this?
Mog:Kupo! We caught up!
Tifa:Is that...Zack!?
Hope:He's dressed the same as Cloud. Does that mean he's also from SOLDIER?
Warrior of Light:That would seem to be the case.
Zack:Oho? That crowd back there all your friends?
Cloud:Y-yeah... That's right.
"Zack:Hey, if it ain't Tifa, too! Long time, no see! All healed up?"
Tifa:Yes...thanks to you...
Hope:It looks like they all know each other...but does something feel off to you?
"Warrior of Light:The Torsions warp everything... Our memories, too. There must be some details that do not match up for the three of them."
"Mog:That young man's will is as bright as can be, kupo! I sure hope he'll join us!"
Zack:Huh? What's that fluffy thing? And what's this about my will?
"Mog:Kupo! How nice of you to ask, kupo!"
"Mog:You see, this world is yada yada kupo kupo..."
Zack:...Seriously? Get out.
Cloud:Tifa and I both ended up here that way.
"Zack:Really... Good grief. Never a boring day in my life, huh?"
"Zack:But hey, different world or not, I'm sure glad to see you again!"
"Cloud:...Yeah, me too."
"Zack:Uhhh, the fluffy guy... Mog, was it?"
Zack:Sign me up! A mission that takes me the world over sounds like a blast!
"Mog:Kupo! Just the words I wanted to hear, kupo!"
Cloud:I'm in your debt again. ...Sorry.
"Zack:Hahaha! Don't be so standoffish! We're friends, right?"
"Cloud:Thank you, Zack."
Zack:Heh heh... No sweat!
"Zack:Okay, boys and girls, let's hit the road! Destination: Torsion! Woo, I'm all fired up!"
"Mog:Kupo! Way to show those monsters who's boss, kupo!"
Zack:Yeah! Let's keep it up!
"Rem:If only the weather would clear up, it would do a lot for our visibility..."
"Vaan:I've got nothing against the rain, but it's getting old real fast."
"Zack:Hey, what's with the whining, you two?"
"Zack:Oho? Well, would you look at that? A break in the clouds."
"Mog:Kupo! The sun's so bright, kupo! And warm!"
Tifa:Hard to believe it was pouring like that up till now...
"Zack:As long as you keep looking ahead, the rain's bound to clear sometime. It's only when you give up that you hit the end of the line."
"Zack:Whatever happens, protect your honor! Turn to face your dreams, and keep heading right for them!"
Rem:Right. We've been able to keep this up because we have dreams we want to see come true.
"Vaan:Zack's like your complete opposite, Cloud."
Cloud:(...Don't even bring that up.)
"Zack:You've got it all wrong, Vaan. He may look that way, but Cloud's got a real passion hidden deep down in there."
"Zack:He might be kinda awkward, or anxious around people...but there's no mistaking he's a swell guy!"
Rem:Hehe... You two must be close.
Cloud:...That's Zack for you.
"Mog:I hope you'll motivate everyone with that positive attitude, kupo!"
Zack:You don't need to tell me; I plan to!
"Zack:We'll knock out anyone who stands in the way of our dreams, and protect this world! If we pull this off, we'll all be heroes!"
"Vaan:Heroes, huh... It's got a nice ring to it when you say it."
Cloud:Zack...you sure about this?
"Zack:Of course! We put our heads together, we can do anything!"
Cloud:Yeah... I suppose you're right.
"Zack:Come on, Cloud. Don't give me a wimpy response like that."
"Zack:This is when you turn up the volume and shout, ""Move out!"" or something like that! Alright? Take two!"
Cloud:...If you say so.
"Cloud:Alright, everyone! Move out!"
"Zack:""Dear Mom and Dad, I don't know how, but I'm in a different world now. I'm doing fine, though."" Hmm..."
"Sazh:Hey, Zack. Whatcha up to all on your lonesome?"
Zack:I'm writing a letter to my folks back home.
Yang:How splendid! That is quite admirable of you.
"Zack:I'm sure they're worried about me, so the least I can do is write them a letter to say what I've been up to lately."
Zack:I lived there with my mom and dad. But I had a dream I wanted to make come true ever since I was a kid...
Zack:So I left home when I was thirteen and haven't seen them since.
Sazh:I see... They must be worried sick. I know I would be if you were my son.
Yang:To know that their only son left home to make his dreams come true must be bittersweet for them.
Garnet:What was this dream of yours anyway?
Zack:Thanks for asking!
Zack:I wanted to make friends the world over and swim wherever I had to meet 'em!
"Garnet:It is wonderful to have so many friends, isn't it?"
"Sazh:In a sense, you can say your dream came true. You've even got friends from different worlds now."
Yang:I am certain your parents would be overjoyed to hear as much.
"Zack:Then maybe you should write letters, too! Let them know how you're doing!"
"Zack:Oh, there he is! Hey, Mog!"
"Mog:Yes, kupo?"
Sazh:Could we ask you for a favor?
"Yang:Would you deliver these letters for us, Lord Mog?"
"Mog:L-letters, kupo?"
"Mog:Don't be ridiculous! I'm no delivery moogle, kupo!"
Zack:So you won't?
"Garnet:Oh, that's too bad... I suppose even moogles have their differences."
"Yang:Even though we wrote these letters, it seems there is no way to get them to their receivers..."
Zack:Hey now. What are you two so disappointed about?
"Zack:This is all the more reason for us to get home on the double! If we make it back to our worlds, we can tell them ourselves."
"Yang:Indeed! You are most correct, Lord Zack!"
"Garnet:Hehe. I wrote something for Zidane, but I suppose I could just give it to him in person."
"Mog:That's a great idea, kupo! Now let's get moving so the rest of you can do the same!"
"Cid:Argh! $#&%, it's cold! I'll freeze to death at this rate!"
Quistis:We all will if we don't find a way out soon.
"Zack:Come on, guys! Let's keep moving! There's only forward to go when chasing a dream!"
Seifer:Hmph. Even this weather can't cool him down...
"Tidus:How are you in such high spirits, Zack? Does the cold not affect you at all?"
Zack:Hehe. Let me tell you my little secret.
"Zack:This is how I'm keeping warm! One, two! One, two!"
Zack:That's right! Why don't you all give it a try? You'll be warm in no time!
Cid:Huff... I'm beat...
"Quistis:I suppose I am warmer, but at what cost..."
"Zack:One, two! One, two! Don't tell me you two are done already!"
Seifer:That all you got? I'm not going down that easy!
Tidus:Ha! This is nothing! I'll show you how tough a pro athlete can be!
"Zack:That's it, Seifer! Tidus!"
Zack:Alright! Now this is a real fight! The last one standing is the winner!
Cid:Don't you knuckleheads come whining to me after you've got bigger muscles than brains.
Quistis:There's not much we can do except wait it out. All three hate to lose...
"Lenna:Everyone, we've found a way out! Let's go!"
Zack:Just... Just give us a second...
Tidus:My legs are so sore... I can't walk...
Seifer:Don't...underestimate me... I'm just...getting started...
Cid:See? I told you so.
Quistis:There's no point in tiring yourself out before battle. You need to pace yourselves!
Tidus:...No comment.
Zack:Sorry for dragging you all into this.
"Zack:I take full responsibility, so let them take a break!"
"Quistis:...I suppose as long as you've learned your lesson, all is forgiven."
"Raijin:Take this, ya know!"
"Vivi:You're amazing, Mr. Raijin!"
"Raijin:Hehe, you're makin' me blush, ya know?"
"Raijin:I can't remember the last time anybody complimented me, ya know!"
Vivi:It's really too bad if no one ever compliments you...
"Raijin:Anytime you need me, just let me know, ya know!"
"Raijin:I got a Mr. Raijin Special to help you clobber any problem, ya know!"
Fujin:DANGER!
"Raijin:That's a dirty trick, sneakin' up on a guy like that, ya know!"
Fujin:STAND! FIGHT!
"Vivi:We can do this, Mr. Raijin!"
"Raijin:Y-yeah, just gimme a sec, ya know?"
???:You're safe now.
Raijin:Y-you! It can't be!
"Raijin:...Do I know ya, ya know?"
Fujin:PRIORITY. BATTLE.
"???:Yang! And Edge, too! I'm so relieved to see you again!"
Yang:I...um... Have we met...?
"Edge:You know me, miss?"
"Rydia:Hold on, what do you mean? It's me, Rydia."
Yang:C-could it be? The summoner Rydia!?
Rydia:Yes! Now you remember?
Yang:Goodness gracious... The Rydia I remember was but a child...
"Yang:The resemblance is more than passing, though... Hmmm..."
"Edge:...Even if you say that... Argh, I can't believe I'd forget such a pretty face..."
Onion Knight:It could be the Torsions at play. Let's get her caught up on what's going on first.
"Serah:...In short, even friends from the same world could have memories well out of sync."
Rydia:I had no idea... So that's why you don't remember me...
"Edge:Don't make such a sad face! Aw, heck...how could I have forgotten...?"
"Yang:Whilst we were traveling at sea, we met with an accident and you were lost to us."
Yang:That is the last thing I can remember...
"Serah:But if you've grown up, does that mean you're from the future?"
"Rydia:No, I don't think the time I'm from is so different from everyone else."
"Rydia:Time passes more quickly in the Feymarch, so..."
Onion Knight:You grew up in the blink of an eye?
"Rydia:Yup, that's about it!"
"Rydia:If so many other worlds are in danger, could this be what she meant?"
"Serah:You'll help us out, won't you?"
Rydia:Of course! Let's face this fate together.
"Edge:Yeah! More than just a beauty, you got pep to boot! I like your style, Rydia!"
Rydia:Edge hasn't changed at all... What a relief.
Galuf:It's still hard to believe you were a child until recently.
Galuf:You're clearly a grown woman now.
Bartz:I guess people drifted here from all different times...
"Galuf:What's the matter, Bartz?"
Bartz:It's nothing. I was just thinking about how interesting the flow of time is.
Eiko:This is so annoying!
Eiko:Just how rude can they be!?
"Rydia:What's the matter, Eiko? You seem upset."
Eiko:Zidane still treats me like a child! Doesn't he know I'm a lady!?
Eiko:And then Edgar said something about it being a crime.
"Eiko:And to top it all off, Seifer called me a little brat! Grr! I can't take it anymore!"
Cloud:...Are they wrong?
Eiko:What'd you say!?
"Bartz:Right! If you do, you'll grow up in the blink of an eye!"
Eiko:Hmm... It definitely sounds interesting...
"Eiko:Hey, Rydia. What's the Feymarch like?"
"Rydia:Everyone coexists in peace there. The eidolons manageshops, and there's a hugelibrarywith all sorts of books!"
Eiko:Wow! That's wonderful!
Eiko:A place where everyone is friends and I can become a lady like Rydia sounds like a dream come true!
"Irvine:But, you know, if the passage of time is faster there..."
Irvine:You could become an old lady before you know it if you're not careful.
Eiko:Wh-what!? I don't want that...
"Galuf:Ho ho! There's wisdom you can only gain from experience. But it takes time, and there's no helping that."
Eiko:Nooo! I'm not ready to be old yet! My life's just begun...
"Bartz:No matter what you look like, Eiko, you're still you. Just leave things to the flow of time."
Balthier:Those two seem to have hit it off. Summoners must have a lot in common.
"Tidus:I get the feeling Yuna and Rydia aren't all that alike. Fun to have another smiling face, though."
Tidus:Seymour!!
Balthier:Another sudden entrance. ...Can we help you?
Seymour:You needn't look so frightening...
Seymour:I simply came to speak with this young woman.
Rydia:Huh? Me?
Seymour:Yes. There is something I must know.
Seymour:Why you travel with the one who killed your mother.
Yuna:...Killed Rydia's mother!?
"Tidus:Who do you think here is gonna buy your lies, Seymour!"
Balthier:Is that your idea of a joke?
"Cecil:...Alas, it is not."
"Cecil:Although I was unaware at the time, I am the one responsible for Rydia's mother's..."
Yuna:It can't be true...
Seymour:Hatred and grief are never ending. I know too well how you feel.
"Seymour:For that reason alone, I find your actions difficult to comprehend."
Seymour:Will you not seek revenge while it is in your power to claim it?
"Rydia:...I can't say I understand it well, but one thing I do know..."
Rydia:Revenge can't change the past.
Rydia:I can't wallow in my pity forever! I decided for myself that I would fill the role I was meant to.
Seymour:How truly wretched... You would try to whitewash a bloodstained past with pretty words?
"Tidus:Would you shut up, already! What's so wrong with choosing to move forward!"
Balthier:It strikes me as far more constructive than going in circles as you're bound by the past.
Seymour:It does not seem as though we will be able to understand each other. I wasted my time...
"Tidus:Ahhh! I can't stand that creep! Rydia, forget everything he said!"
Rydia:Don't worry; I'm fine. Though...
Cecil:Rydia... I am so terribly sorry for the pain I have caused you...
"Rydia:You don't need to apologize to me anymore, Cecil. Come on, look at me."
"Rydia:Your feelings came through to me, loud and clear."
"Balthier:As a fellow man of the sky, let me give you some advice."
Balthier:...Don't dwell too much on the past...
Rydia:Don't worry. Cecil has it in him to carry on. I know him!
Cecil:...My thanks.
"Edge:Wow! It was no match for you, Edge!"
"Edge:Do you get it, Rydia? This is the way we fight in this world."
Rydia:I see...
Layle:Edge has been in high spirits ever since Rydia arrived.
Krile:I've never seen him so excited...
"Laguna:Well, I understand how he feels. He wants to show her his good side..."
Edge:No monster is a match for my blade.
Edge:So there's no need to worry!
"Edge:I'll go on ahead. Follow me, everyone!"
Rydia:That's enough! There's no need to rush. Don't you know how to look before you leap?
Edge:Wh-what's that!? We'll be just fine!
"Edge:Now what, Layle?"
"Layle:It's nothing, really. Just that you're such an open book."
Layle:You want to protect those close to you.
"Layle:But it's impressive how you've got such a selfish prince under your thumb, Rydia."
Edge:You're just like the old man!
Krile:Old man? You mean my grandfather?
"Cecil:No, he doesn't mean Galuf."
"Krile:Were Edge and Cid like this back home, too?"
"Laguna:I'll bet! I can just imagine Edge getting excited like this, and Rydia getting mad at him."
Cecil:Haha. Indeed.
Edge:Th-that's enough out of you!
"Rydia:You need to calm down, too, Edge."
"Edge:R-right. Sorry, Rydia..."
"Laguna:Did you see that, Layle?"
"Layle:Yeah, but I thought I was hallucinating for a second. I didn't think that selfish prince knew the word ""sorry."""
Edge:H-hey! Don't you know you should respect your elders?
Layle:You're right. I forgot you were older than me.
"Laguna:Haha! That just means you've got a long way to go before you're mature as me, Edge!"
Krile:Hehe. Everyone gets along so well.
"Cecil:Edge hasn't changed one bit, has he?"
"Cecil:Though he's supposed to have regained some of his memories, he still continues to support me..."
Rydia:I know. I heard about it from Edge.
Rydia:He said he wasn't going to let you shoulder all of this alone.
Rydia:And I couldn't agree more.
"Cecil:...I am blessed to have such wonderful allies. Thank you, Rydia."
"Rydia:Please don't forget to thank Edge. We're all here for you, Cecil."
"Yuffie:Hey, those monster sounds were coming from this way, right?"
"Yuffie:Uh-oh! Hurry it up, guys!"
"Wakka:Take it easy, Yuffie! Running in headlong on your own won't do no good, ya?"
Rem:Oh no! That girl is surrounded!
"Wakka:...Aw, geez! We gotta hurry!"
Yuffie:That's what I've been saying!
Lamia:Grrr... Hisss!
Lamia:Grrr... Hisss!
Rem:Did you just...beat all those monsters by yourself!?
"???:It would appear that way, wouldn't it?"
"Wakka:All at once, too! That's some trick!"
"Yuffie:Even I can tell, you're something else!"
???:...Are you from around here?
"Rem:No, we're traveling together."
"???:Hm. The same as me, then."
Wakka:You're traveling alone!? Even with all these monsters!?
"Yuffie:If you're asking us, that means you ain't from around here either."
???:I have tread my fair share of foreign lands.
Wakka:That doesn't make it any safer. Why don't you come with us?
"???:Are you asking me out? Regardless, I will have to pass."
???:I haven't the time to fraternize with strangers.
"???:...Furthermore, I have mine own companions."
"???:Should we meet again, though, let us work together at that time."
"Yuffie:Ah, well... There she goes. Bummer."
Lilisette:Huh? You defeated them all already?
Wakka:Nope. We didn't do a thing.
Rem:There was a girl surrounded by monsters who effortlessly beat them all with both magic and her sword.
"Yuffie:Man, I coulda taken it easy with her on our team..."
"Lilisette:Is that so...? With all the amazing companions I've met, I shouldn't be surprised to meet another."
Lilisette:But I'm really curious if she's impressed all of you this much.
???:...Ungh! I let my guard down.
Thancred:That'll be enough of that now.
"???:...You have my thanks, Thancred. You've saved me again."
Thancred:Is that... Lady Alisaie!?
"Zidane:Here I was expecting a tough-as-nails warrior woman, but if it isn't a pretty little lady!"
Jecht:So this is the kid with the amazing sword and magic powers?
"Thancred:No, Yuffie and the others must have meant someone else. This is"
Alisaie:My name is Alisaie. I am a companion of Thancred.
Alisaie:And I suppose you are companions of those whom I met earlier.
"Jecht:Yup, if you're the one Yuffie was going on about."
Zidane:...Nasty attack. Maybe I spoke too soon about the tough-as-nails part.
"Yda:I never imagined we'd run into you here, though. It's such a relief to know you're safe, Lady Alisaie."
"Yda:Hm? Yes? Y'shtola and Papalymo are here, too, you know!"
Alisaie:I-I see...
"Alisaie:At any rate, I am also glad to see you all hale."
"Alisaie:But more importantly...please stop with the ""Lady Alisaie."""
"Yda:...If you insist. Then...""Miss"" Alisaie?"
"Alisaie:That is just as much a mouthful. ""Alisaie"" alone will be fine, thank you."
Yda:Alrighty! Alisaie it is!
"Alisaie:So, I understand you're on a journey. Would you mind explaining to me of what sort?"
Zidane:...And that's how it is. Was that too much all at once?
Alisaie:Thank you. I believe I have the gist of it.
Alisaie:Though equal parts may have escaped my grasp.
"Alisaie:In short, if we do not act, our own world will be in grave danger as well, yes?"
"Alisaie:Although I declined your offer once for mine own convenience, would you still let me join you?"
Jecht:I don't see why not.
"Alisaie:Haha, how easily I am accepted."
"Jecht:You're pals with Yda, right? Ain't that good enough?"
"Mog:Let's give a warm welcome to another warrior who shares our will, kupo!"
"Alisaie:Another warrior... Thancred and Yda, you two also share this will?"
Thancred:You could say that.
Alisaie:It has a nice ring to it.
Thancred:I'd say so.
"Alisaie:Very well. It is my pleasure to share it, too."
Alisaie:......
Serah:Is something off?
Alisaie:...It is. I cannot shake this peculiar feeling.
"Alisaie:But if I were forced to put a point on it, I sense I am the one who is out of step."
Lilisette:It's a common occurrence in this world.
Alisaie:Then I can assume the two of you have this sense as well?
"Serah:Yup, though I've gotten used to it..."
Serah:You think Alisaie comes from a different time from the others?
"Lilisette:You think? Probably the past, or the future..."
Alisaie:...I see. So that's normal in this realm.
Alisaie:Phew... It boggles the mind.
"Lilisette:Hmmm, ""normal"" might not be quite it, but I guess it's good enough."
Serah:Right. My sister here is from the past...
Serah:But she's still my sister.
Alisaie:I can go along with that.
"Alisaie:There may be discrepancies in our memories, but it doesn't change my trust in them."
Serah:They're a reliable bunch.
"Alisaie:And in its own way, this might be the more fortunate realm..."
Serah:...I've thought the same at times. It's a happier place than the future I'm from...
"Alisaie:I see... And yet... No, let us leave off these thoughts."
"Lightning:Serah, here you are. This is how you'll end up separated from the rest of us."
"Serah:Oh, give it a rest, Sis."
"Alisaie:Haha, how reliable."
Serah:She's always been like this.
"Alisaie:Well, let's be on our way before we worry your sister any further."
Prishe:You guys really will get lost if you just run around willy-nilly.
Shantotto:Hearing that from you somehow strikes me as rather silly.
"Irvine:You're quite the fighter, Alisaie."
Alisaie:You think so?
Irvine:Sure do! You can hold your own in battle no matter the distance.
Edge:...Though I could learn a thing or two from you about a smooth transition.
Alisaie:It's important to know how to fight in close and ranged combat with this power.
Alisaie:Both my magic and aetherial sword grow stronger when combining different types of swordplay.
Irvine:You mean you can get even more powerful?
Alisaie:I wonder!
"Vivi:That's amazing. You're so cool, Miss Alisaie!"
Alisaie:Thank you.
"Vivi:Hehe, you mean it?"
"Yda:To be honest, I'm impressed you've made it this far, Alisaie!"
Alisaie:Are you implying that I have not been able to fight until now?
"Yda:Wh-what!? No, of course not...!"
"Alisaie:I jest, Yda. I understand what you mean."
Alisaie:And you're right. I am far stronger in battle than I used to be.
Yda:Yes. Did you see how surprised Thancred was?
Edge:The rest of us can't even imagine an Alisaie who can't fight.
Alisaie:I couldn't bear always relying on others.
"Alisaie:To know the truth, I needed only the power to face it."
Alisaie:I hope I've grown enough not to be a burden on others now.
Irvine:That's the path you chose. Maybe it was the only path you could choose...
Irvine:I understand.
"Vivi:I want to be as cool as you some day, Miss Alisaie!"
"Edge:If that's the case, watch and learn! I'm not afraid to face my fate, whatever it may be!"
"Vivi:Okay! I want to learn how to be strong like you, too, Mister Edge!"
"Edge:Haha, I'm gonna blush! Now then, let's get going!"
Yda:The power to face one's fate...
Yuffie:...Something's fishy.
Layle:What's that supposed to mean?
Yuffie:Did you notice that Alisaie is always carrying a book?
"Layle:Huh? ...Yeah, now that you mention it, she does."
Cyan:Perhaps it is a tome dear to her heart. I myself am very partial to books.
Yang:It is moving to see such studious youths.
"Yuffie:So you all know the book! She seems so attached to it, I can't help but be curious!"
"Cyan:Has it sparked thy interest in reading, Lady Yuffie? This is joyous news."
Yuffie:No! The only interest I have in that book is its price!
Layle:And you want our help with this?
Yuffie:That's right. I want you to help me find out more about the book.
"Yuffie:That should be no problem for you, right, Layle?"
Layle:What an audacious request. I refuse.
Yuffie:Wh-what!? But why!? Aren't you interested?
"Layle:If you're so determined, why not just ask her yourself?"
Alisaie:Is there something you want to ask me?
Yuffie:No no no no no! Nothing at all!
"Alisaie:I overheard everything. You're interested in my grimoire, are you not?"
"Yuffie:Umm... Well... Y-yeah, I guess I am..."
Yuffie:But how could I not be? You're always carrying it around like some precious treasure!
Alisaie:But I don't know if it's very valuable otherwise.
Yuffie:I see... A specially made book...
"Yang:You understand now, do you not? This book is not something we can lay a hand on..."
Yuffie:I get it! It's a very special book that she got from her family!
Yuffie:Even I understand the value of something like that...
"Layle:Well, that's a relief."
"Yuffie:But still! You wouldn't want to lose it, right? I can hold onto it for you if you want!"
Alisaie:You're worried about me? I sincerely appreciate it.
Cyan:But something that precious must be kept safe by its owner and no one else.
"Yang:Now that that is settled, shall we be on our way?"
Alisaie:How nice it is to have such friendly allies. This will certainly keep things interesting.
Eiko:We've never gone this way before! I can't wait!
"Yuri:Yeah, who knows what we'll find!"
"Chelinka:Oh, Yuri. You're such a child, getting all worked up the moment you hear, ""explore."""
"Yuri:Aw, don't act like you're the grown-up. We're twins, aren't we?"
"Yuri:You're the one tagging along because you wanted to explore, too."
Chelinka:I-I'm just worried about the rest of you...
Vivi:Wa-wah! A monster!
"Yuri:This, uh...doesn't look good."
???:You okay!?
Chelinka:When did he?
???:I'll handle this! You run!
Vivi:Wait! We'll help!
???:This isn't a job for kids!
Eiko:But we're surrounded!
"Yuri:We'll take care of these guys! Mister, back us up over there!"
???:...Got it!
"Vivi:Thanks a lot, Mister!"
"Eiko:You were strong, but what'd you think of my magic?"
???:So that was magic after all.
Eiko:Huh? Weren't you watching?
Vivi:Is something wrong?
"???:Well, using magic isn't really normal, you know."
???:Man... What have I gotten myself into?
Noctis:I guess that means it wasn't a dream...
Hope:You're the one who helped our friends?
Hope:Thank you very much.
Noctis:I'm not sure they needed it. Those battle-hardened kids are something else.
Zell:Kids have to fight sometimes in their worlds.
"Noctis:""Their worlds""?"
"Balthier:Indeed. You've stumbled into a junction of sorts, connecting multiple worlds to each other."
Zell:We've got folks from all over.
"Noctis:I wonder if anyone I know is here, too."
Zell:I don't think we've run into anyone else with your fashion sense...
Balthier:Thus spake Zell. You may be out of luck.
"Noctis:All on my own, huh..."
"Faris:...We all started out in the same boat as you, summoned here without warning."
"Faris:But after learning of the disturbances affecting this world, we're fighting to end them before they affect ours."
Faris:Would you be willing to fight alongside us?
"Hope:We've never seen anyone with your fighting style. If you'd lend us a hand, we'd be able to cope with that much more."
"Zell:Our clothes are kinda similar, but I don't think our worlds are. Let us hear about where you're from!"
"Noctis:Sure, why not?"
Balthier:Appreciate the quick conclusion.
"Noctis:Well, you asked."
Prishe:Alright! Another one bites the dust!
Noctis:I wonder how many of us that'll feed.
"Tifa:You eat monsters, too!?"
Snow:Is that edible?
"Noctis:Yeah, it's a behemoth, isn't it? You can pick it up at the store. I eat it now and then."
Prishe:Right!? It's delish!
"Penelo:It may come as a surprise, but it's a luxury foodstuff."
"Steiner:Sir Noctis, are you well versed in preparing monster cuisine?"
Noctis:I've never actually made it myself.
Snow:All this food talk is making me hungry.
"Prishe:C'mon, let's go cook something up!"
Penelo:How about fish? There's a river nearby.
"Tifa:Yeah, I'd prefer that than monster."
Steiner:Agreed. It will be easier to prepare dishes we're familiar with.
"Prishe:Oh ho, gonna catch us a big one?"
Noctis:You bet! One lunker coming right up!
"Tifa:If you're that confident, then I won't mind asking you for one, too."
"Prishe:Noctis, teach me how you do it! I wanna hook my own!"
"Snow:I'll come, too. Sounds like you're gonna need help carrying back this haul."
Noctis:You can call me Noct. Let's do it.
"Wakka:Hey, Noct. You okay?"
Noct:I'm fine. Sorry about getting in the way of your attack.
Sabin:Did something happen?
Yang:They pursued an enemy that escaped me and nearly collided with each other. My apologies for being so careless.
"Sazh:These things happen in a fight, especially when fighting close-range."
Sabin:Perhaps you were just tired. Why don't we head back?
Yang:You make a good point. Let us end our search here for today.
Sabin:Did the enemy make any strange movements in battle?
Noct:No. Our timing was just off...
"Noct:Back home, I didn't pay much attention to what my friends were doing in battle."
"Noct:They would just match my style... But here, I have to change the way I fight."
Sabin:It's nice to hear you taking this seriously.
Noct:...Would you mind training with me?
Sabin:I'd like nothing better! Should I call the others?
Noct:Nah. I'd like to go one-on-one with you for now.
Sabin:Are you sure? No doubt my brother would have a thing or two to teach you.
Noct:I'd...prefer if you didn't tell the others about this.
Sabin:Haha! If you insist. It will be our secret.
Noct:Seems like you guys are good friends.
Yuri:Galuf is Krile's grandfather.
Noct:That makes sense. Seeing you reminded me of afamily friendand hisgranddaughter.
Laguna:Must be nice having such a happy family! What's your secret?
Krile:Being left behind once and never wanting to be apart again.
Yuri:Did that happen?
Yuri:...You must have been so lonely.
Krile:I was...
"Krile:My grandfather decided on his own that he wanted to protect everyone, so he left all by himself."
Krile:I was so sad and alone...
Krile:That's why I'm so happy we can be together now!
"Yuri:I know how you feel. It's nice to be with family, isn't it?"
Noct:...Yeah. It is.
"Laguna:Well, you have to forgive Galuf."
Laguna:I'm sure he had his reasons for going off alone.
Yuri:But maybe she could have helped.
Galuf:No. I couldn't let her get involved in such a dangerous affair.
Yuri:Why not?
Yuri:You could have at least talked to her about it...
"Galuf:We had a mission to fulfill, and I did not want to expose my family to danger."
Edge:But I understand how Yuri feels. It's painful to be left behind.
"Laguna:Still, having someone waiting for you will keep hope alive"
Laguna:Hope that you can one day return safe and sound to that person.
Yuri:...You don't understand how it feels to be the one left behind.
Yuri:It's so lonesome without your family around...
Laguna:But the one who leaves has every intention of coming back.
Laguna:And they leave those precious to them behind so they have something to look forward to when coming home.
"Laguna:If they bring their beloved child with them, they'll constantly worry about protecting them."
Laguna:That's why they leave them in a safe place.
Yuri:I see...
Yuri:I understand how it feels to fight to protect something...
Krile:That's why you can't just leave without saying anything!
Galuf:Ho ho! You want to scare me into it?
"Noct:I know how you feel, when circumstances don't let you say what you're thinking."
Yuri:Yeah... Protecting something's a reason...
Noct:...But it's still better to say so.
"Yuri:Hehe. Thanks, Noct."
???:There're no cities or buildings in sight! Not even train tracks! I really stepped in it this time.
???:...Huh? What's that sound?
???:Ahhh! An airship! Alright!
"???:I'll hitch a ride with them! Yeah, that's the ticket!"
???:Wait up! I said waaait!
Kain:...Did you hear someone just now?
"Zack:Yeah... It sounded like a girl shouting, ""Waaait!"""
Squall:You're imagining things. We're all the way up here.
"Zack:Naw, I definitely heard it! She must have a really high voice. ...Get it?"
"Squall:(Oh, brother.)"
"Zell:Hmm... It did sound kind of familiar, though."
"???:Wait up, already! C'mon!"
Zack:See! We're not just hearing things!
Kain:Is that...a girl?
"Vaan:Hey, guys!"
Vaan:Someone's been chasing after us yelling things. Anyone know who it is?
Zell:Who would chase after an airship? Let me have a look.
???:Heeey! Give me a lift!
"Zell:Waugh! Her!? Hey, Squall!"
"Squall:Yeah... Vaan, could you ask them to touch down for a moment?"
Kain:Hm. Not an enemy then.
Squall:(Brace yourself... Things are about to get noisy.)
"???:Whee-ooo! You guys saved my life! And who'da thunk Squall and ya'll would be aboard, too!?"
"Irvine:Who'da thunk you'd be chasing after us? Right, Squall?"
Squall:I don't know how you thought anyone would hear you... Crazy as ever.
???:That's it? You're not surprised to see me?
"Irvine:Selphie, let me introduce you. This little lady is Eiko, and the fella in armor is Cecil."
Selphie:Wow! Nice horn! It's so cute!
"Eiko:Oh, you think so? Hehe...you have good taste!"
"Selphie:And your armor's really cool, man! You think I could try it on?"
Selphie:Isn't it super heavy!? Ah! Don't tell meyou're on a diet! I bet the pounds just melt off in that!
Cecil:No...this...is simply standard equipment in my world...
Squall:You don't have to humor her. This is just how she is.
"Eiko:Cheerful and fun! I can tell you're a nice person! Say, let's go play over there!"
"Laguna:Heyo! There's a new recruit? Introduce me, too!"
"Selphie:Get out! Sir Laguna's here, too!? And he's young! It's that Sir Laguna!"
Selphie:My hero! I've missed you!
Laguna:Whoa! What the!? Is this the dream thing again!? Or the movie thing this time!?
Squall:I could've guessed this would happen... I hope she doesn't say anything she shouldn't...
Irvine:Leave it to me. I'll make sure she understands.
"Irvine:Selphie, let's chat, eh? I've got something real important to tell you."
Selphie:So you two are classmates! It's no wonder you dress alike.
"Deuce:We both attendAkademeia, where we learn how to fight and use magic. Students there are calledAgito cadets."
"Ace:As the war worsened, cadets like us were sent to the front lines. But the academy's main purpose is education...or so they say."
"Selphie:So you're fighters and students, then."
"Irvine:Well, you're in good company!"
"Selphie:Mmhmm! So tell me, what's your school festival like?"
Selphie:Y-you mean...you don't have one!?
Selphie:But school festivals are so much fun! The students scheme up all sorts of events and PAAAH-TAY!
"Selphie:I was on the committee that planned the festival. Or at least...something like it, right?"
"Irvine:Yeah. It was more like a concert, but you still did a great job putting it all together!"
"Deuce:It sounds wonderful. Maybe we could do one, too!"
Selphie:That's the spirit! You need to live it up while you're young!
Selphie:I know! Why don't we have a school festival here? It'll be super fun with schools from different worlds!
"Irvine:Great idea, Selphie. Count me in!"
Ace:...So what exactly should we do?
Selphie:Hmm... Good question.
"Selphie:Deuce can put on a flute concert, and Ace can do a magic show with his cards!"
Deuce:Alright! I won't let you down!
Ace:A magic show? Is that different from using normal magic...? Do I use magic to...entertain people...?
Irvine:I think we need a few more acts. Is there anyone else we can ask?
Lilisette:It looks like you guys are having fun over here! What's going on?
Selphie:Lilisette! Celes! You're just in time!
Selphie:We were talking about finding more acts for our school festival.
"Selphie:You'll dance in our show, won't you, Lilisette?"
Lilisette:But of course! It's what I'm best at! I'll show you the grace of Troupe Mayakov!
Irvine:And Celes will sing!
"Selphie:You're an opera singer, aren't you? That's what Setzer said."
Celes:That no good...!
"Selphie:Then it's decided! Let's do our best to make this the greatest school festival ever! ...After we beat the baddies, of course!"
"Laguna:Haha. It's nice to see them having so much fun. Well, you're only young once!"
Sazh:That so? I can't imagine two old men like us ever being young...
Selphie:Wow. These ruins are really...ruined.
Quistis:Indeed... It's hard to get around with all this rubble.
"Firion:I can't help but remember myhometown, burnt to the ground by theempire. If we don't save this world, the others may share its fate..."
Cait Sith:Hey there! What's got you all looking so gloomy?
"Cait Sith:This journey's supposed to be full of smiles! C'mon now, turn those frowns upside down!"
"Selphie:...Hey, Cait Sith, there's something I've been meaning to tell you."
Cait Sith:What's that? I'm all ears!
Selphie:You really remind me of my friends back home!
Cait Sith:Oh? That so!?
"Selphie:Yeah! I'm fromTrabia, a cold and snowy place in myhome world. Even still, everyone's so warm and friendly there."
Lion:So Cait Sith's upbeat personality reminds you of home?
"Selphie:Not just that. I think he's got the same way of speaking, too! It's like we're old friends!"
"Cait Sith:Happy to hear you think so, Selphie! I do my best to keep a smile on everyone's face!"
Quistis:That certainly is kind of you.
Cait Sith:Think nothin' of it! It puts a smile on my face just bein' here with you all.
"Cait Sith:I hope we can become your warm and friendly home away from home, Selphie."
Selphie:Thanks! I feel better already!
Cait Sith:No thanks necessary! We're like family now!
Firion:Can a way of speaking really bring people so close...?
Wakka:You bet. And these two are birds of a feather. They can befriend anyone in a heartbeat.
Lion:It's fascinating to see such similarities between people from completely different worlds!
Selphie:You got that right! It's super-duper neato!
"Selphie:I feel lucky to know such friendly people in my home world and here, too!"
"Cait Sith:But they had such a serious job to do, they didn't have time to think about smilin'. So I decided to help 'em with that!"
"Selphie:That's wonderful, Cait Sith! I'm sure that, together, we can spread smiles around the whole world!"
Lion:...You sure are ambitious.
Quistis:It can't be helped... Think of it as a good thing.
Wakka:Selphie's got the right idea. We need to keep our heads up. We can't keep looking back.
"Firion:Agreed. I must learn to look on the bright side, or risk forever being lost in dark thoughts about my home..."
Cait Sith:Alrighty then! How 'bout we start by loosening up the way you talk?
"Selphie:With me and Cait Sith as your teachers, you'll be talking friendly in no time. Booyaka!"
Firion:Haha... Perhaps we can begin lessons next time...
"Serah:What's up, Sis? You said you wanted to talk."
"Lightning:Yeah. It might be nothing, but..."
Lightning:It seems there's a secret code going around lately. Do you know anything about it?
Lightning:I overheard Palom and Vivi using it earlier...
"Palom:Booyaka, Vivi! Let's go practice your magic!"
"Vivi:Booyaka! Thanks, Palom!"
"Serah:...So you noticed, too. Actually, just a little while ago..."
"Zack:Booyaka! Aerith, Cloud, would you get this?"
"Lightning:What on earth is...""booyaka""?"
"Serah:Sorry, but I don't know either. Maybe it's some other world's vocabulary."
"Selphie:Booyaka! What's shaking, you two?"
"Serah:Selphie... Can you tell us what ""booyaka"" means?"
Selphie:Oho! How good of you to ask! It's a greeting I made up!
"Selphie:I couldn't quite get it to catch on in my world, but everyone here's got the spirit!"
Lightning:...What does it mean?
"Selphie:Cute, right?"
Lightning:We're not...communicating...!
Selphie:Feel free to use it as much as you can! Later! Booyaka!
Lightning:I can't take any more of this...
"Lightning:Serah! Not you, too!"
Serah:Sis...I kinda like it! It's catchy!
"Serah:Booyaka! Hahaha, I gotta share this with Snow."
Lightning:W-wait! Serah!
Lightning:Serah... Why does it look like you're enjoying this...?
Lightning:Or are you just trying to enjoy your time in this world...? Maybe I ought to follow her example...
???:And yet...what a revolting development this is.
"???:Even I, who has traipsed across countless dimensions, find this place yucky..."
"???:...What might Bartz, that spry, old fellow, and their merry band be up to about now?"
"???:Oh, my! Have we an exit before us!?"
???:This time we shall arrive in some space more respectable-like!
"Mog:Kupo! What's a Torsion doing here, kupo?"
"Faris:There aren't many monsters about... Just a wee Torsion, I suppose."
"Mog:A Torsion is still a Torsion, kupo! Let's get in there and close it, kupo!"
???:Whaaat iiin the!?
Gilgamesh:What ho! If it isn't Bartz! Then this must be...
Gilgamesh:...... ......
"Firion:You...we fought you in the World of Illusions. If you came out of there, then that means..."
"Mog:You're the Torsion's master, kupo!?"
"Gilgamesh:Fwa!? I haven't the faintest of what's going on, but you wish to cross blades!?"
Gilgamesh:Hah hah hah! Very well!
Gilgamesh:The me before you now is in prime condition! Three on one! Bring it!
"Bartz:...I don't know what's going on either, but okay!"
Gilgamesh:Arrrgh! You beat me agaaain!
"Vaan:Hey, the Torsion isn't closing."
"Mog:Kupo!? Then the Torsion isn't his, kupo!?"
Squall:...What a waste of time.
Bartz:Sorry about that Gilgamesh. So why are you here?
"Gilgamesh:Why wouldn't I be? There was an exit, and I took it!"
Vaan:You were lost?
"Gilgamesh:I was not lost! I was wandering! As suits Gilgamesh, the wandering swordsman!"
"Serah:Bartz, this guy's from your world...right?"
"Gilgamesh:Let us not discuss myformer employer. I am now a vagabond, roaming the expanse of theRift."
Squall:Why do you ask?
Bartz:Huh? You all know Gilgamesh?
Gilgamesh:I don't know you!
Squall:Just a passing resemblance...?
"Gilgamesh:Mayhaps we have met, but so long has been my journey, many a detail have I forgotten!"
"Mog:You've been wandering between dimensions without the need of Torsions? How unusual, kupo..."
"Bartz:Anyway, Gilgamesh hasn't done anything wrong. Should we get back to closing the Torsion?"
"Serah:Right, we can't leave it open."
Squall:Our memories of back home aren't spot on in this world either... No point dwelling on it.
Gilgamesh:Hey! You're going already!? Then I shall lend you my aid!
Gilgamesh:You say we have met... What kind of a jerk would I be if I let acquaintances risk their lives!?
Vaan:Sure you just don't want to be lost and alone again?
Gilgamesh:I'm not lost! Nor am I letting your last memory of me be my humiliating defeat!
Bartz:Is it alright if he comes along?
"Mog:He's strong and doesn't seem like a bad guy. I don't see why not, kupo."
Gilgamesh:Then it is decided! You won't regret this!
Gilgamesh:Alright! Consider my honor regained!
Bartz:You were a big help. Sorry about the mixup earlier.
"Gilgamesh:Think nothing of it! You and I are buds, are we not!?"
Galuf:Your skills haven't dulled at all either.
Gilgamesh:Of course not! I have been continually sharpening them!
"Gilgamesh:I am heartened to see you in good health, old man. As for me, I must return to my journey."
"Mog:Kupo!? You won't stay with us, kupo?"
Gilgamesh:Saving the world simply doesn't suit a wandering swordsman.
"Vivi:Are you really gonna go, Mister?"
Vanille:Would you look at that? Even the kids like you despite that scary face of yours.
Gilgamesh:Ulp... Do not look at me with those eyes! I might get emotional!
Vivi:I'm worried about you... I don't want you to get lost and feel lonely again.
Bartz:We were also washed up here away from home and are wandering just the same.
"Gilgamesh:Ho ho... Well, if you insist!"
Gilgamesh:Moogle! Take this!
"Mog:Kupo! These are...dimensional coordinates, kupo?"
"Gilgamesh:My journey has no destination, and when we next meet, it may be as rivals..."
"Gilgamesh:Buuut! Whenever you folks need me, just call my name! I'll be there!"
"Mog:Yay, kupo! Another friend added to our roster, kupo!"
"Gilgamesh:Now then, fare thee well! Hrah!"
Vanille:I feel like our conversation went off the rails somewhere...but oh well?
"Galuf:He can be a hasty fellow, but try to welcome him warmly."
Bartz:Who could've imagined a day we'd be fighting side by side...? What a feeling.
Gilgamesh:Ho! Fancy meeting you here! How fare your travels?
Faris:Why are you here? We haven't summoned you.
Gilgamesh:There's no need to be so cold. You should try to be nicer to others!
Krile:Did you come to check on us?
"Gilgamesh:Even if we fight at each other's sides, there's no way of telling how you're doing!"
"Bartz:You've got a point. A lot's happened, but we're doing fine."
Gilgamesh:Where's that old man? Is he still as sprightly as ever?
Krile:Of course! He's over there with some of the others.
Gilgamesh:...I see. Please take good care of him!
"Faris:Hey, Gilgamesh. Are you...hiding something that happened in our world?"
"Krile:...Because of the Torsions, some people have lost their memories."
"Galuf:Oho, here's a fine guest! What are you folks talking about?"
Gilgamesh:I-it's...nothing! Absolutely nothing! We were just chatting about how strong you are!
"Galuf:Ho ho ho! Your clumsiness hasn't changed a bit, has it?"
Galuf:Perhaps you can see our future after wandering the Rift for so long.
"Galuf:But you needn't worry. In order to fix the distortions and return the world to how it ought to be, I'm willing to accept any fate."
Gilgamesh:Old man...you certainly are an exemplary warrior.
"Gilgamesh:Sniff... Bah, my nose is running... H-how dare this weather aggravate my allergies!"
Gilgamesh:I must be off! Pwing!
Faris:...What a weirdo.
"Bartz:He's a bit flaky, but he's not a bad guy."
"Bartz:Serah... You said you might've met Gilgamesh before, right?"
Serah:Yes... He reminds me of someone I fought once. We eventually became allies.
"Serah:But they're not the same. The person I know uses guns, and the swords are slightly different, too."
"Bartz:This Gilgamesh uses only swords, so they're definitely different. Only their name is the same."
"Zidane:But he didn't use a sword. He didn't fight at all, actually."
Lion:Though his appearance and profession are totally different.
Ace:We also have aGilgameshinOrience. He's the head of theLorican Alliance.
"Ace:Other than the fact that they're both military men, they've got nothing in common."
Seifer:Why does that ugly mug give me such a bad feeling...?
Seifer:Can it. I don't remember ever meeting an idiot like that!
Zidane:Maybe you just lost your memories of him?
"Seifer:Hmph. Lost memories or not, there's no way I'd lose to such a wuss."
Ace:You can never fault Seifer for not being confident enough...
Lion:I'd love for them to meet my dad. But I know it's probably for the best that they don't.
"Bartz:I'm sure he'd be surprised to say the least. Even if it won't happen, it's fun to imagine."
Lilisette:That's Shadow's partner for you! What a trouper!
"Lilisette:There, there, who's a good boy...whoa!"
Lilisette:Did I make him mad? ...Maybe he doesn't like me.
Shadow:...He eats strangers.
"Zell:I guess he's a little rough around the edges, just like his master. Or ""rrruff,"" in his case."
Zell:He almost ate me...
Sabin:Heeey! We got trouble!
"Lilisette:What's the matter, you two? You look like you've seen a ghost."
Sabin:We just saw some things that look like people! That look like us!
"Zell:Manikins? Well, that's nothing special."
"Terra:No, they were different from manikins..."
"Zell:Look like you, but not manikins? What could they be?"
Terra:I don't know...but...
Terra:They remind me of something. Maybe...
Zell:Ah! Interceptor! Where ya going!?
Lilisette:He took off at top speed... Did he find something?
Shadow:It can't be...
Zell:Wha!? There goes his master!
"Lilisette:Let's go, too!"
"???:Good boy, Interceptor. Where's your owner?"
Sabin:H-hey! It's Relm!
Shadow:...Just as I thought.
Relm:Shadow! And the muscle-man!
Cloud:Is she talking about ...Why do I even ask?
Relm:Great! I finally found somebody I know!
"Sabin:If you're here, then those guys we saw earlier must be..."
Sabin:Were you painting pictures of us!
"Relm:Heh heh, ya got me."
"Relm:I was all by myself, lost in a strange place. I got lonely."
Relm:So I had a little fun painting!
"Penelo:Um, sorry, but I don't think I follow..."
Penelo:Does painting have something to do with those doppelgangers?
"Sabin:When Relm paints a picture, the real thing pops out."
Penelo:Her pictures come to life!?
Cloud:...You have to watch out for paintings in your world?
"Relm:What does he mean, ""your world""? Who're they?"
Shadow:They'll fill you in.
Relm:Hmm? If you say so!
"Relm:Anyway, Interceptor! Let's go play over there!"
"Sabin:If you cross her, she'll threaten to paint your picture. Be careful!"
Penelo:I-I'll keep that in mind...
"Palom:Hey, everyone!"
Sazh:What's up? Looks like you kids are having fun.
Vivi:Yeah! Relm taught us how to paint portraits!
Relm:Everyone's so good at it! Look!
"Eiko:Zidane, I, umm...painted a picture of you..."
Zidane:Oh really? Let me see!
"Zidane:Whoa! This looks just like me! Great job, Eiko!"
Eiko:Really? Yay! Ehehe.
"Sazh:I guess it does look like you, but...isn't it a bit TOO handsome?"
Quistis:I had no idea his lashes were this long...
"Vivi:I drew you, Sazh! Here!"
"Sazh:That's wonderful! Thanks, Vivi!"
Sazh:...What's this? Am I nothing but a hairball...?
Relm:I taught Vivi a secret technique: focusing on unique features!
Sazh:I...I see...
"Palom:I drew you, Quistis! I'm sure you'll love it!"
"Quistis:Oh? Thank you, Palom."
"Zidane:Well, this...certainly is...Quistis..."
"Sazh:Are these...horns? And it looks like you have fangs, too..."
Quistis:Palom... What is the meaning of this?
"Palom:Well, you get mad when we misbehave, right?"
"Palom:I wanted to show how scary you look when you're upset! Right, Relm?"
Relm:Capturing things unseen to the eye is also a very important technique!
Quistis:Am I really so...terrifying...?
"Zidane:Aww, don't get so down about it. They're just kids."
"Eiko:Growing horns is no big deal, either!"
"Relm:It'll be alright, Quistis."
Relm:I think you're right to be this scary to rascals like Palom!
"Sazh:You're a rascal yourself, Relm."
"Relm:What did you say!? Take that back, or else I'll draw you next!"
"Sazh:Okay, okay! Just don't draw me!"
Vivi:I like drawing pictures!
"Eiko:Yeah! Let's draw the others, too!"
Tidus:Hyah! Fast break!
Jecht:Haha! Too easy! Take this!
Jecht:Come on. Throwing in the towel already?
Jecht:You won't ever be better than me with those weak moves.
"Tidus:Damn you, old man! One more time!"
Jecht:Alright. Give it your best shot!
Shadow:You're quite lively...
"Relm:You two are really close, aren't you?"
Tidus:Me and this old man? Don't be ridiculous...
"Laguna:Aww, you're blushing. There's no need to be shy, Tidus!"
"Laguna:Aww, I miss her now. I want to be as close to her as you and your father!"
Laguna:What about you Relm? Are you close to your parents?
"Relm:Well, I don't have a father. When I was young, he left home."
Laguna:Oh... I'm sorry for asking.
"Tidus:Even though he left, he could still be alive, right?"
Relm:Hmm... I guess so. But I don't really remember him at all.
Jecht:You're a tough girl. Different from a certain crybaby I know.
Tidus:I hope you're not talking about me! I wasn't lonely or anything!
Squall:Don't you two ever get tired of this...?
Jecht:Who would be cruel enough to leave such a cute little girl behind?
"Laguna:You were both athletes, weren't you?"
Laguna:Maybe Relm and her father were both painters!
Squall:The more important part is the magic. Perhaps he was a mage.
Relm:They're both possible! I hope I can meet him someday!
Tidus:You never know. He may be just around the corner.
Jecht:Hahaha! Yeah right!
"Krile:Are you tired, Grandpa? I'll give you a shoulder rub!"
"Galuf:Oh, Krile, you're too kind. Just the sentiment is enough for me."
"Relm:...Grandpa, huh?"
Relm:Wonder what my old codger is up to about now.
"Tifa:""Old codger""...?"
"Krile:Did you live with your grandfather, too, Relm?"
"Setzer:He looks like any aged fellow, but he's a rather skilled mage."
"Cecil:His magic was also so great as to earn him the title ""sage."" A dependable companion."
"Relm:Oh, really...?"
"Relm:Galuf, or Tellah, or whoever, everyone has such great grandpas."
Relm:Mine on the other hand... He just gave up on his dreams and does nothing but get older...
"Tifa:You're worried about him, aren't you?"
"Relm:Hmmm... He's pretty awful, but I can't just leave him alone."
Galuf:That Strago must be a happy man.
"Krile:I hope you, and Cecil too, can meet them again soon."
"Galuf:I'd like to meet them, too. They must have some stories to tell."
Setzer:You and Strago would get along. You have a thing or two in common.
Relm:Please take good care of him when the time comes!
"Relm:If he starts whining, just clock him one, 'kay?"
"Galuf:S-sure, but gently, perhaps..."
Cecil:Love comes in all forms...I guess.
Tifa:You can say that again.
"Relm:Grandpa... I'm doing fine, so you hang in there, too..."
Firion:This finishes it! Hah!
"Jecht:Oh, not bad, Firion! Got a good arm on ya!"
Tidus:That was a big one. Didn't think we'd run into this sort around here.
???:Good show.
Firion:That voice!
The Emperor:You have grown stronger. I did not expect you to defeat the fiend I sent your way.
"Jecht:""Sent our way,"" huh? What's the big idea!?"
The Emperor:Did I not make myself clear? To test your strength.
The Emperor:And I find that strength increasingly appealing. What do you say? Shall I dominate you now?
"Tidus:You never learn, do ya?"
Firion:Don't make us repeat ourselves! No one wishes to be ruled over!
"The Emperor:Ha... In that case, might the sight of this man sway your position?"
Firion:Leon!
Leon:Unh... Is that you...Firion...?
Jecht:Who's this guy? Friend of yours?
Firion:My best friend... But why is he...?
Tidus:Your best friend works for the Emperor!? The heck!?
Leon:Ngah...! Fir...iooon! Power... Give me your power! If I kill you...then I...!
Leon:I can...! Become the true...ruler...!
"Jecht:Hey, he's spoutin' crazy talk now. You really used to hang out with this nut job?"
Firion:...Clearly something is amiss. The Leon I know would never...
"The Emperor:Well, now what? Here is a bit of fun where former friends battle to the death... Try to entertain me."
"The Emperor:Go, Leon!"
Leon:Fir...ion! You think...you can defeat me!?
"Firion:Leon...snap out of it! Blast, have we no choice but to fight!?"
Leon:Ngh... Firion...
"Firion:Leon, please, come to your senses... This fight is...meaningless."
"The Emperor:Hmph, some opponent you proved to be. Hopeless."
The Emperor:I have no need for useless worms. Allow me to deliver the finishing blow.
"Firion:Stop, Emperor!"
"The Emperor:Oh, you wish to protect the man who betrayed you? And why is that, may I ask?"
Firion:Leon is my friend...and my family!
The Emperor:Hahaha... A truly worthless reason.
The Emperor:I think it best I finish you both here and now!
"Irvine:That'll be enough, Mr. E. Mind stepping away from my friends now?"
Snow:His family is our family! You aren't laying a finger on him!
"Thancred:Do afford us the dashing entrance from time to time, eh, Firion?"
Firion:My friends...!
The Emperor:...Hmph. Your theatrics have spoiled my entertainment.
The Emperor:Well enough. This one is now steeped in darkness. He is certain to betray you in his thirst for power...
The Emperor:Ugly battles amongst yourselves is the most you have to look forward to.
Snow:He got away! Everyone in one piece?
Firion:Leon! Are you alright!?
"Firion:Can you stand, Leon?"
Leon:Y-yes... I am fine now...
Leon:But are you? You heard what he said...
Firion:Why don't you tell us what happened first? Why were you with the Emperor?
"Leon:I realized I was in this world...felt some dark will pursuing me, and lost consciousness...blast it all."
Leon:I was with that monster...
"Leon:I'm sorry. Please, leave me be."
"Snow:Hey, you gonna let him go? I thought he was family."
"Irvine:Yeah, you need to take better care of him than that. Heeey, Leeeooon!"
"Firion:Snow, Irvine... You're right..."
"Firion:Leon! This world isn't ours...so please stay with us, at least as long as you're here...!"
Leon:...Firion... But...I'm sure I will eventually betray you...
"Snow:Geez, don't you make this harder than it needs to be."
Snow:What'd we say? Firion's family is our family! We don't care what your baggage is!
"Snow:Family sticks together! Hey, you guys with me here?"
"Thancred:Aye, I have no interest in digging up the past."
"Irvine:Yeah, and it's safer if you're with us than getting yourself lost and manipulated by some other wacko."
"Firion:Thank you, everyone...!"
Firion:No one among us will hold anything against you.
Firion:I finally found you...
Leon:...Very well.
Snow:Right-o! That settles it! Let's go let the others know we've got a new friend! I mean family member!
Leon:Am I...truly fit for this...?
Leon:I heard you were once a knight who wielded dark powers.
Cecil:Correct. I used those dark powers in battle.
Leon:I did not loathe choosing this power under the Emperor.
Leon:Everything...was for the sake of gaining even greater power.
Leon:But you are different. You did not hunger for power and instead found a different path to tread upon.
Cecil:...That's true. And yet there is a part of me that feels indebted to my current and past form.
"Cecil:Though it was for the sake of my home and lord, I still wielded a sword of darkness..."
"Kain:Dark and light are two sides of the same coin, Cecil."
"Kain:Without light, there can be no shadows. Because there is darkness, the light shines."
Leon:What are you trying to say?
King:Power is not good or evil. It depends on how you use it.
"King:I picked up a gun for the sake of war. It wasn't to protect someone, or so I thought."
King:But a gun is just a weapon. Whether it does good or evil depends on the will of its wielder.
King:Sazh told me that.
Vincent:Even cursed power...can prove useful at times...
"Mog:Exactly, kupo!"
"Mog:You may all be from different worlds, but here you're all warriors of light to me, kupo!"
"Kain:You're no exception, Leon."
Kain:I'd like to see how you choose to use that power of yours.
Leon:...I never thought I'd see the day I'd be called a warrior of light.
Leon:You have saved me. I will not let you down.
"Cecil:I'm certain you won't. Let us hold our wills fast, together."
Chelinka:Yuri!
"Chelinka:You went overboard in battle again! I keep telling you not to get carried away, don't I?"
"Yuri:Sorry, Chelinka. I just get so excited!"
Chelinka:You never change... Listen to what your older sister says for a change!
"Maria:It's like watching ourselves when we were kids, Brother."
Sabin:Hey! Big brother!
Sabin:I just worked out a new technique! Have a look!
Edgar:How exciting. Show me!
"Leon:There are other siblings here besides us, I see."
"Chelinka:They're all very close, too! Like Lenna and Faris, and Lightning and Serah."
"Leon:If it was possible, I would have wanted us to laugh more together..."
Wakka:Stop lookin' at the past. You still got time to make that happen.
Wakka:You should be happy you're still alive to see each other again.
Leon:Still alive... You mean...
Leon:My condolences...
Wakka:No worries. It's like I said: just be happy you guys can still see each other!
"Yuri:It doesn't matter how you meet. What's important is ""now"" and what you'll do from now on."
Vaan:That's right. You can still laugh and smile together from now on.
Leon:I don't know if I can change that quickly...
Yuri:Why don't you try it with just your face? Like...this!
Leon:H-hey! Stop that!
Wakka:Oho! You smiled!
"Maria:Hehe. It's been so long since I've seen you smile, Brother."
Chelinka:Look! Leon's blushing!
Leon:...Why? I don't understand...
Zell:Yo! Leon!
Zell:We're going over what's next for us. You should join in.
Firion:Is there something on your mind?
Leon:Why are you all so willing to accept me?
"Leon:In my thirst for power, I became a knight of the Emperor..."
"Leon:And if that wasn't enough, I turned my blade on you."
"Seifer:I think you're mistaken, dark-wuss. Who said we're accepting you?"
Seifer:We're just letting you tag along because our interests happen to match up.
Leon:Is that all...?
"Zell:No! No, that's just Seifer shooting his mouth off!"
Ramza:It is true we once crossed swords.
Ramza:But we have seen your actions since. Your skills have aided us any number of times.
"Steiner:And how! As a fellow knight, your swordsmanship must be respected!"
Seifer:As a knight...
Seifer:Who wouldn't want power?
Seifer:I don't get your hang-up.
"Zell:...I get nervous when you talk like that, you know..."
"Seifer:Ugh, you're annoying. Mind your own business."
Seifer:Do what you want the way you want. That's how I operate.
Steiner:Graaagh! Why you! How dare you rub salt in Sir Leon's wounds!
Ramza:...Stay. That needn't be all he intended.
Ramza:Seifer's conviction to his own approach should have no small influence on our own way of thinking.
Steiner:Hrm... Perhaps... But do not dwell too deeply on it.
"Leon:...They are an enjoyable lot. You've found yourself some good friends, Firion."
Firion:It's as Seifer says. Do it your way.
Firion:Even if your way is mistaken...
Firion:We have plenty of friends here who will set you right.
Leon:Heh... Right you are.
"Jecht:It's exhausting being around all these kids, treatin' me like an old man."
Jecht:Maybe I can get some rest over Huh?
"???:You may look like her, but you're nothing like her."
Jecht:Nice work! You one of Lightning's friends?
???:What's it to you? And how do you know Lightning?
"Jecht:Calm down, missy. I'm one of the good guys."
"Jecht:But if you wanna fight, you've got it."
"???:Who are you calling ""missy""? How do I know you're not one of them?"
???:I don't know what to believe anymore.
"Jecht:Alright, since you're not gonna listen, we're solvin' this the old-fashioned way."
???:Not bad for an old man.
"Jecht:They do look like us on the outside, you're right about that."
Ashe:There you are. Why did you go off on your own?
"Jecht:Ha! No reason. Hey, Snow, lemme ask you something."
Jecht:She one of yours? Seems to know Lightning.
Snow:Wh-what are you doing here!?
"???:Snow! No, you're one of them, too!"
"Snow:Ahhh, slow down, Fang! Just listen! I can explain."
Ashe:So they do know each other.
Jecht:That's what I thought. This hot-headed little missy here wouldn't listen to a word I said.
Fang:Stop calling me that!
Ashe:Will she listen to what any of us have to say?
King:What do we do?
Snow:We're not fighting her. She's one of us.
"Snow:Fang, listen. Vanille and the others are over there too so why don't"
Fang:Vanille!? Why didn't you tell me!? Where is she?
Snow:Over there. And I would've told you sooner if you'd just listen...
Jecht:She's just riled up because she has no idea what's going on. Can't blame her.
King:She seemed real concerned about Vanille.
Ashe:Are they sisters?
Snow:Kind of.
Lightning:Fang?
Fang:Dammit! Another one!
Fang:Or...are you really her?
Lightning:It's me. Wanna find out?
Fang:It really is you!
"Fang:You look exactly like one of those monsters. It wouldn't hurt to crack a smile, would it?"
Lightning:Same old Fang. I'm glad you're okay.
"Fang:You, too. I'm relieved to see someone I know."
"Fang:Speaking of, where's Vanille? Snow said she was here."
Lightning:She is.
Fang:Vanille!
Steiner:You must be very close friends.
Aerith:I've never seen Vanille look so at ease.
Fang:You have no idea how worried I was.
"Vanille:I was worried, too! I'm so glad you're okay!"
Fang:Sorry it took me so long.
Steiner:Another manikin!
Aerith:What a way to ruin the reunion.
Fang:Is that what you call those things? Those poor imitations of us.
"Fang:That looks nothing like you, Vanille."
Fang:Just like old times. Ready?
"Fang:Hey there, Hope. I see you're here, too."
"Hope:Hey, Fang. I'm glad we were able to find you."
"Fang:We might've been able to see each other sooner, but I just don't trust strangers."
Fang:Thanks for protecting Vanille.
"Firion:We don't see it as ""protecting."""
Firion:We simply take care of each other.
Fang:That's fine for now. But Vanille can be pretty reckless.
Fang:She'll get into all sorts of trouble if you don't keep a good eye on her. That's why I need to protect her.
"Leon:I do not know what transpired between you two in the past, but if you say it is so, then it must be."
Leon:However... That is not all we see in her.
"Firion:You're right. In that sense, perhaps Fang is the only one who can protect her."
"Fang:You think too hard. It's simple: She's someone I want to protect, so I protect her with all my might."
"Auron:That is true... Whatever the truth may be, she's a part of our group now. We share a common fate. That does not change."
Auron:Don't think you have to protect her by yourself. There are others you can rely on.
"Fang:I've got priorities, so I can't make any promises."
"Auron:That's no matter, as long as you understand how we think."
Fang:...I understand. I planned on working together with you from the start. I appreciate you staying with Vanille this whole time.
"Fang:From here on out, I'll protect her, too."
"Jecht:Dammit... If you were one of Lightning's friends, you should've just believed me!"
Auron:I can't say I blame her. Your face is dubious at best.
Jecht:What'd you say!? My mug's as honest as they come for old men!
Fang:I'm sorry. I wasn't sure who I could trust then.
Fang:I didn't have time to think about it. I was worried about Vanille.
Jecht:Well...I guess I understand. At least it worked out in the end.
"Vanille:Then Fang and I... And after that, we..."
Yuri:Whoa! Really!?
"Chelinka:Calm down, Yuri. It sounds normal when you say it like that."
"Fang:What's up, Vanille?"
Vanille:I was telling them about our past.
Chelinka:It sounds like a lot happened between you two. I can see why you're so close.
Fang:So you really told them.
Vanille:Yes. I thought it was no good for us to be the only ones keeping secrets... And I just never had a chance to talk about it.
Fang:I see...
"Yuri:So you've been alive for a long time, then."
Yuri:Does that mean you two are also part of a special race?
Fang:Huh? No. We were asleep for a long time is all.
"Chelinka:Yuri, you need to be more considerate! Some people are sensitive about their age!"
Yuri:Oh... Sorry.
Vincent:Solid advice...
Vaan:Why're you looking at me when you say that?
Vincent:You're hopeless...
Fang:Don't worry about it. I'm about as young as I look.
"Fang:We slept the whole time, so we didn't really age."
Vincent:A similar thing happened to me. I slept for a long time.
"Vaan:You too, huh? I guess you can't judge a book by its cover."
Yuri:I get a feeling you all have trouble getting out of bed in the morning.
"Chelinka:You're one to talk, Yuri! And don't say such rude things to our friends!"
"Vanille:Hehe. You sure are close, aren't you? Fang and I were raised like siblings, too."
"Vanille:It really was, wasn't it? I miss that place."
Fang:You're bound to meet all sorts when traveling in such a big group. I'm glad to see there are others like us out there.
Fang:Huh? Time to move on?
Serah:Fang! Where've you been!? You're bleeding!
Fang:Don't worry. Blood's not mine.
Wakka:You were fighting all by yourself!? That's dangerous!
"Fang:What are you talking about? We all do our part, right?"
"Vaan:Yeah, but we don't do it alone."
Fang:I'm alright. I just needed to move around a bit.
"Serah:Let us know next time, okay? We worry when people go off on their own."
Fang:You two really are nothing alike.
Fang:You and Lightning. Are you sure you're related?
Fang:You worry about everything all the time.
Vaan:Isn't that a good thing? Can you imagine having another Lightning?
"Fang:Fortunately, there's only one."
"Serah:I'm serious, Fang. I was really worried."
Sabin:Serah was worried about your safety. You wanted to get some exercise.
Sabin:Next time let me come along. I could use some training practice.
Fang:Training practice?
"Vaan:Oh man, Sabin and Fang-style training? Count me in!"
Fang:There's no training or practice of any kind! Haven't you heard a word I said?
"Serah:Haha, maybe I'll join too!"
"Fang:...I prefer being on my own, but I can't stop you from coming along."
"Serah:Fang, I know you want to protect Vanille."
"Serah:I want to become stronger, so I can protect Lightning too."
"Serah:We have the same goal, right?"
"Serah:And not just Lightning. I want to protect everyone, and that includes you."
"Fang:That's your business, not mine."
Serah:Stop being so difficult! Don't go off alone! Always stick with the group!
Serah:Got it!?
Fang:Got it.
Fang:I take back what I said earlier. You're more like your sister than I thought.
"Fang:I always knew you were stubborn, but I think it's gotten worse since you've been here."
Serah:Has it?
Serah:That means I've changed throughout my journey. This would never have happened back home.
Fang:Alright. You wore me down. I'll try not to wander off alone.
"Sabin:Good! Whether it's training or the real deal, everything is better if we do it together!"
Vaan:Do you see that!?
Rem:Someone must've slain this monster.
Ace:A battle was fought here.
Yuna:And it wasn't one of us... But maybe it's someone we know.
Yuna:They must be alright seeing they defeated this monster.
"Ace:It may be a friend, but it could very well be an enemy too."
Vaan:Can't you be a little optimistic for once?
Ace:I'm just stating the possibilities.
Thancred:Did you hear that?
Rem:What is it?
"Thancred:I thought I heard a flute. Rather a ways off, though."
Vaan:Really? I didn't hear anything.
Thancred:Perhaps I'm starved for entertainment.
Ace:It's possible you heard something we didn't.
"Rem:Yeah, and if you did hear a flute, it could be whoever killed this monster."
Yuna:A musician who can battle? Or perhaps one who learned to in order to travel?
Ace:I suppose it must seem odd to those from other worlds.
"Rem:Now that I think of it, it's not very common in our world either."
Thancred:A friend may be nearby then?
Thancred:What are we waiting for?
Ace:You're right. Let's go.
Terra:Are you all okay?
"Onion Knight:Yeah, but they just keep coming and coming."
Terra:We must've come across a large pack.
Yuffie:You guys would've been so dead without me!
"King:I appreciate the help, but our situation hasn't changed much."
"King:I know we're all tired, but we need to keep fighting."
Yuffie:Why are there so many of them!?
Onion Knight:It's not strange for monsters to travel in packs.
"Onion Knight:You jumped in to help us because we were surrounded, right?"
"Yuffie:Yes, but I didn't know there'd be so many of them!"
"King:For what it's worth, you can have all the credit."
"Yuffie:I don't want credit, I want rewards!"
Terra:More keep coming.
Onion Knight:We need to stand our ground till the others arrive!
King:Got it.
???:It looks like I made it just in time.
Yuffie:Who're you?
Deuce:I'm Deuce. It's nice to meet you.
Yuffie:Why are you so calm!? Can't you see what's going on!?
"King:Don't worry, she can handle herself."
Deuce:I'm so glad I found you all. I'm ready to give you my full support.
Terra:A flute?
"King:We'll talk later. Right now, we need to take care of this situation."
Deuce:Thank you for letting me come with you.
Thancred:Of course.
Thancred:I knew I heard music back there.
Rem:I'm glad to see you again!
Deuce:Me too!
Thancred:Were you frightened all alone?
"Deuce:No, not especially. Fighting isn't new to me, and I knew Rem and the others were okay."
"Deuce:And because they were, I knew that I had to do what I could."
Vanille:How did you know they were okay?
"Deuce:Because I could remember them all: Rem, Ace, King, and Cater."
"Rem:In our world, when someone passes, they're forgotten."
"Vanille:Wow, and that kept you going."
Rem:But I don't know for certain if that applies in this world too.
Deuce:Why is that?
Rem:There's no way to confirm it.
"Vanille:Whatever the case, I'm glad you're alright and that you found your friends."
Deuce:Thank you.
Vanille:I'm curious. How is it using a flute as a weapon?
Deuce:I don't know. I've never been asked so I've never thought about it.
Deuce:This is what I'm used to.
Vanille:So it's hard to explain...
"Vanille:Oh, maybe you like music?"
Deuce:I do. I love music.
Eiko:Then you and I will become great friends!
Thancred:How so?
Eiko:I can play the flute too! And I'm really good.
Thancred:I had no idea.
Eiko:Of course. I'm a lady.
Eiko:I even played the flute in battle!
Deuce:Will you show me later? I've always wanted someone to play music with.
Eiko:Of course! See? We're great friends already!
Deuce:...That's enough practice for now.
Yuna:What a beautiful sound.
"Deuce:Thank you! Though I've never played outside of battle, to be honest."
Tidus:Really!? That seems like a waste.
Celes:I agree. It's unfortunate that such wonderful music is being used as a weapon...
Deuce:Thank you for your kind words.
Yuna:What's the matter?
Celes:Do I have something on my face?
Deuce:You both have such beautiful voices. Do you like singing?
"Deuce:If you two ever feel like it, I would love to play along. I think we could make amazing music together!"
"Celes:Even if I enjoyed singing, I need to protect this world first..."
"Yuna:She's right. You agree, don't you?"
"Tidus:Yuna, singing? I've got to hear this!"
Yuna:You shouldn't say things like that at a time like this...
Garnet:There's no need to refrain from doing the things you like just because we're in a battle.
"Garnet:Or...do you hate singing, Yuna?"
Yuna:It's not that. I just don't feel confident that I could...
Setzer:I think this is a fantastic idea. Let's strike while the iron is hot.
"Setzer:The audience will be just us for now, but I will prepare a grand stage and the best dress for you, Deuce."
Zidane:Hold it! You can't just go making plans on your own like that...
"Celes:Thank you, Zidane. Tell him this is really not the time"
Zidane:Celes and Yuna aren't the only ones who can sing!
"Garnet:Zidane, you don't mean"
"Zidane:Garnet's got the voice of a goddess! Let her perform, too!"
"Deuce:That's a great idea! You'll sing, too, won't you?"
Garnet:I suppose I don't have much of a choice...
Deuce:Don't worry about it. I know that it's not easy to concentrate now.
"Deuce:But, once things calm down, why don't we give it a try?"
"Setzer:You are a gentle soul, and yet quite persuasive."
"Tidus:Well, now we've got something to aim for!"
Zidane:Yeah! We gotta bring back peace so we can hear these lovely ladies sing!
Prishe:Whoa! I can feel the power flowing through me!
Prishe:There's no way I'd lose to the enemy now!
Firion:Deuce's support can help make quick work of the opposition.
Prishe:I want her to play the flute all the time!
Cyan:Perhaps that is asking too much...
Bartz:I'm sure it would be hard on Deuce to keep going for so long.
Prishe:What? I was just kidding!
Cyan:Are you certain? It seemed you spoke at least somewhat in earnest.
Deuce:I'm happy my music helps.
"Deuce:Doing it all the time would be tough, but I'll gladly do what I can!"
Bartz:That's heartening to hear.
"Cyan:There is no doubt that thou possess great power, Lady Deuce."
Cyan:And your music can pacify or uplift all those who hear it.
Bartz:Is it what's making Lilisette and Penelo move like that?
Lilisette:Wh-when did this happen!?
Penelo:My body moved on its own...
"Prishe:I don't really understand, but...it just means that Deuce is a powerful ally, right? That's all that matters."
Prishe:...Did I say something weird?
"Deuce:No. Thank you, Prishe! I'll do my very best!"
"Bartz:Prishe is right, though it would be nice to hear you play outside a fight."
Deuce:What do you mean...?
Bartz:I'd like to just listen to you play the flute. It's beautiful.
Deuce:...I'm happy you think so.
"Cyan:I concur. Music is something that should be enjoyed, too."
"Lilisette:Agreed! It's a waste of your talent, Deuce."
"Lilisette:What do you think, Penelo?"
"Penelo:M-me!? Well, I think dancing to the music is quite fun..."
Lilisette:Professional dancers like us can't just turn a blind eye to your talent!
Penelo:I just dance for fun. I'm no professional...
Deuce:The thought of playing outside of battle never really crossed my mind.
Deuce:But playing music for fun... I like that.
Deuce:I'll practice the flute for everyone to enjoy!
Agrias:Was that...a knight? But under whose flag?
Agrias:Stay; what is this? Is there to be a battle?
"Steiner:Wha? You!? No, my mistake! Forgive me, but I must find my comrades! They have been surrounded by monsters!"
Agrias:Monsters? Then I shall aid you! Lead the way!
"Onion Knight:That takes care of that. Thanks for holding out, Shadow."
"Shadow:I wasn't about to leave a child behind... More importantly, here's a new face."
"Agrias:I am Agrias Oaks, a knight of the Lionsguard."
"Shadow:Ah, a knight. That explains your composure in battle. ...Not your first."
Steiner:This gentlewoman recognized our distress and came to our rescue!
Onion Knight:That's mighty noble of you to assist complete strangers.
"Agrias:I could not let your plight go unheeded. Also, there is something I would ask you."
Warrior of Light:Please. We will do what we can to help.
"Agrias:Are there no villages in the vicinity? This land is unknown to me, and I am without supplies."
Warrior of Light:You seek a village...
"Agrias:Also, your armor is of a motley sort. Am I correct to assume you do not belong to any knightly order?"
"Steiner:Our providence is varied, but the strength of our wills has gathered us to fight together."
Agrias:I see. So you are a variegated unit formed for the purpose of suppressing fiends.
"Warrior of Light:No, it is not only fiends with which we do battle. We fight under the goddess."
"Warrior of Light:Correct. We were all summoned here from different worlds, and are now comrades-in-arms."
Agrias:Different worlds...? What is this nonsense you speak?
Shadow:Heh. You've confused her.
"Onion Knight:Ahh, we better start at the top. I'm for having her join us. What do the rest of you say?"
"Onion Knight:Follow us back to camp. We'll explain on the way, and you can eat there, too."
Agrias:...Very well.
"Steiner:You can trust us, Lady Agrias! Let us walk together!"
Ramza:Lady Agrias!?
Agrias:Ramza! You are here!
Ramza:I am glad to see you well!
Galuf:So you know each other? That's a relief.
Ramza:She is a capable and reliable ally! With her among our ranks
Agrias:I have yet to say I would join you.
Thancred:Worried about unfinished business back home? That's understandable.
Agrias:To think even now how their schemes may be running their course...!
"Laguna:Now, now, Ramza just got carried away because he was happy to see you."
Ramza:Carried away...?
"Ramza:If you were to lend us your aid, though, certainly salvation would be within our reach."
Agrias:I have...
"Agrias:A tale hard to believe, but from appearances, such may very well be the case."
Thancred:Everyone's world is in danger lest we do something to right this one...or so the story goes.
Ramza:We must unravel the mystery of these disturbances and return the world to order. This fight is ours as well.
"Agrias:Ramza, tell me for what it is you are fighting."
"Agrias:From my understanding, here there are no peoples oppressed or victimized."
Agrias:What reason have you to fight here? What is there to save that is worth putting our world aside?
"Ramza:Just as I met you in our world, I have gained many comrades in this world as well."
Ramza:Saving this world means saving theirs...
Ramza:I cannot simply put mine own needs above that of my comrades!
"Galuf:You're a stouthearted friend, but you'd do well to relax some!"
Ramza:Forgive me...but I have said my piece.
"Ramza:Our world is important, but I cannot leave the others' in danger...!"
"Laguna:Ramza! I never knew that's how you felt! Man, I am touched!"
"Agrias:...For your comrades' sake. No matter where, you still fight for others."
"Agrias:Ever unswerving, you..."
Agrias:Very well. Allow me to join you.
"Agrias:I previously placed my trust in you, and now I shall place it in your sense of justice."
Agrias:You prove again to be an irreplaceable ally to me.
Cyan:...And so Lady Agrias has joined us. Thou said thou art a knight?
"Agrias:Yes, sworn to the crown back in my world."
Balthier:You look the capable one. I suppose you've spent your fair share on the battlefield.
Cyan:Lord Cecil is a knight as well. Perhaps thou may have common stories to share.
"Cecil:Yes, we may both be knights...but to be honest, I am somewhat envious of Agrias."
"Balthier:Don't tell me you wish you could protect a princess, too. I hadn't pegged you for japery."
"Cecil:Please do not tease me. ...No, it is not that."
"Cyan:But not without reason, no?"
"Cecil:Mine was a fine lord, but at some point, he strayed from the path of righteousness, which I could not abide."
Squall:He breached his contract with you. What's there to regret?
"Agrias:I understand, Ser Cecil. Surely you were conflicted."
Cecil:Thank you... He raised me as his own.
Cyan:That...must be agonizing for thou...
"Cecil:I still think, if I was that close to him, should not there have been something I could have done?"
"Balthier:That doesn't make it your responsibility. People change. You can't stop that, even if it's your own flesh and blood."
Agrias:I was also betrayed many times by those upon whom I depended...
"Agrias:Man is soon to drown in desire, and sully his hands for its sake..."
Agrias:Those who can control themselves and adhere to justice are but a handful...
"Agrias:For that reason, Ser Cecil, you served as a loyal retainer."
"Squall:...You mean to say, loyalty isn't just following orders."
"Agrias:Should our masters fall to evil ways, it is our duty to chastise them a thousand times till they are right again..."
Agrias:...And if that loyalty falls on deaf ears?
"Agrias:All the more for your familial bonds, your disaffection should carry far more weight than words."
"Agrias:How heavy a blow it may be, your liege should come to understand it by degrees."
"Cyan:Hear, hear, Lady Agrias. Lord Cecil was ne'er in the wrong!"
Squall:Yeah... Abandoning thought to just carry out your duty is the same as abandoning your humanity.
Squall:You're not a tool or a machine...
Cecil:I thought I can never face him again...
Agrias:You need not waver from your sense of justice. Carry it with pride.
"Cecil:I will. ...When I return, I will venture to meet him again."
"Balthier:...There's no guarantee it will turn out well, though."
Cecil:Thank you for your concern.
Cecil:...But do not worry. I have a little more faith in myself now.
Ashe:Prishe! We need to prepare for departure...
Rem:Are you praying?
Prishe:Sorry! It's a habit of mine.
Yda:I had no idea you were so devout!
"Prishe:I may not look it, but I'm a theologian. I wasn't allowed to leave the cathedral for a long time, so I guess that's when it became a habit."
Agrias:You were kept prisoner!? How terrible...
"Prishe:Naw, not exactly."
"Yda:Oh, that's right! You serve as a knight to royalty."
"Ashe:But your bond runs deeper than that, doesn't it? A mere knight would not speak with such compassion."
Ashe:It is clear you care deeply about your mistress.
Agrias:That is due to how stricken I was by Princess Ovelia's fiber.
"Agrias:Even toward the likes of me is she tender, and quietly she devotes herself to her monastic studies. I have naught but the utmost respect for her."
Rem:She sounds absolutely wonderful. I can see why you're so concerned about her.
"Prishe:I'll bet she also met someone amazing there, just like I did."
Agrias:She also studied at the monastery for a time. They were the closest of friends.
"Rem:Thinking of old friends makes you want to try your hardest, doesn't it?"
Ashe:Their kind words and the memories you made together become your strength.
Agrias:Hmm...
Agrias:I wonder if I have ever given Princess Ovelia strength...
"Prishe:Darn straight you have! You may not believe it, but I sure do!"
Yda:She's right. Some people don't realize how much they're helping others without being told.
Prishe:Just seeing your courageous form might make her feel brave.
Agrias:You mean in battle? I do not understand...
Prishe:You might be like her precious charm. Just having you around makes her feel stronger.
"Terra:Your clothes are a little different from everyone else's, aren't they?"
"Yuna:Yes, indeed. Do you like them?"
"Terra:I think they're beautiful! But it might be a nice change of pace to try on something else, don't you think? Like my clothes, for example."
Yuna:Oh! I would love to give it a try!
"Faris:What's going on over here, lasses?"
"Yuna:Hello, Faris! We were just talking about our clothes. I think you would look beautiful in a dress...!"
Faris:A dress!? You wouldn't catch me dead in one of those!
Terra:Hmm... I wonder what else would match...
"Agrias:Chatting about fashion like young ladies, I see."
"Yuna:It's wonderful to see what people from other worlds wear. I think it would be fun to see everyone try on something different, too."
Agrias:Everyone... Including us?
Serah:Imagine the reactions we might get from everyone if we changed our usual looks.
Y'shtola:We would certainly catch them off their guard.
Agrias:Forgive me for not knowing what to say... My armor was made for battle.
Agrias:Does it matter what you wear as long as it suits your purposes?
Faris:Agrias is right! I dress like this so fools don't underestimate me in a fight.
Y'shtola:...But do you not also wear that outfit because of some attachment to it?
"Y'shtola:No matter how well it suited your purposes, anyone would feel remorse over an outfit they didn't like."
"Y'shtola:It is because we fight that we choose an outfit that lifts our spirits, even if we are not always aware of such."
Faris:And that's precisely why I can't agree to wearing a dress...
"Serah:Well, our outfits aren't limited to just our clothes. How about an accessory?"
Faris:I guess it couldn't hurt...
Terra:I think something like Yuna's pendant would look great on you.
Agrias:It seems like you just want to dress us up...
"Yuna:Do you wear any makeup, Agrias?"
Y'shtola:You never know what might happen from here on out.
"Terra:She's right. If you ever feel like a change of attire, we'll be here."
Yuffie:What's going on!? I don't get it!
Onion Knight:What's the matter?
Yuffie:You haven't noticed yet? There's no treasure here. Anywhere!
Sabin:That's right. You did say you were on a treasure-hunting mission.
King:I didn't think you were serious about that.
Yuffie:Of course I was! Anything that has value winds up mysteriously appearing in my pocket!
Yuffie:But this place has nothing! What a bust.
Yuffie:Unless...someone sneaked in here and stole everything before I could!
"Vivi:Oh, no! A thief!?"
Yuffie:That's the only explanation! Stupid thief got a jump on me! No fair!
Shadow:A thief...?
Sabin:Then he must be around here somewhere.
King:Do you know who this thief might be?
Sabin:A friend from my world. It has to be him.
Yuffie:You're friends with a thief...? You should really choose your friends more carefully.
Onion Knight:I can only imagine what Cloud would say if he were here.
Tidus:Finally! Some fresh air.
"Celes:Look! Someone needs help. ...Wait, that bandanna!"
"Edgar:Not to worry, he's not hurt, he's taking a... Well, she'll find out for herself."
Cloud:A friend?
Edgar:You caught me. Let's go wake him up.
"Celes:Locke! Please, wake up!"
"Edgar:Calm down, he's just napping. Find anything interesting, Locke?"
"Locke:Nah, not really."
Celes:Thank goodness. I thought you were injured.
Cloud:You must be the thief Yuffie was talking about.
"Locke:C'mon, Cloud. I prefer the term, ""treasure hunter""!"
Cloud:How do you know my name?
"Locke:I know everything. You're Tidus, right?"
Locke:A cheerful and upbeat athlete type.
Tidus:H-how do you know that!?
"Edgar:Even in a strange world, you're still as reliable as always."
Cloud:That explains it.
"Locke:By the way, Squall over there?"
"Locke:Despite his attitude, he's kind and has a great sense of humor."
Squall:(Please stop talking.)
Celes:I'm so glad to see you here.
Locke:It's been a while. How's everything with you?
Celes:I don't need you to worry about me. What were you doing on the ground anyway?
"Locke:Once Edgar joined you all, my part was done."
Locke:I've been hunting for treasure all around this world ever since.
Celes:All alone?
Celes:Edgar! Why didn't you tell me about Locke?
"Edgar:If I had, you would've gone off on your own in search of him."
Edgar:Locke has a plan of his own. That's why I didn't tell anyone about him.
Locke:I apologize. It's not that I'd forgotten about you. I'm trying to track something down.
Celes:Then we can help. Come with us.
Locke:That's the plan. I've gotten tired of wandering around on my own.
"Locke:Besides, this way, I can find treasure and help my friends. Two birds!"
"Tidus:Treasure comes first, huh?"
"Edgar:Despite what he said, he's one of the most reliable men I know."
Edgar:...Though you'll need to look past the thieving.
Snow:I hear you're looking for some treasure. Something you've been after for a while.
Locke:A legendary relic that can call back the spirits of the dead.
Yuna:Call back?
Balthier:A nifty toy.
Cater:You can bring back the dead? What would you do with something like that?
Locke:She didn't have to die. She's dead because of me.
"Locke:With that relic, everything will go back to the way things were. That's the only way I can make up for what I've done."
"Locke:At least, that's what I thought."
Cater:Is that a good idea?
"Locke:The memories of people who pass are wiped away in your world, right?"
"Locke:Life would be so much easier if that was how it worked in mine, too."
"Snow:There's no use talking about ""what if."" Your world's ways are just that."
Snow:I know what it means to care about somebody. But you're taking it a little far.
Yuna:If she knew how much her death has kept you from moving on...
Yuna:I think she would be upset. Do you think she wants you to feel like you need to make up for the past?
"Locke:You too, huh?"
"Balthier:Bringing her back and apologizing will make YOU feel better, but what about her?"
Balthier:What happens after she comes back? Applause and happily ever after?
Locke:So you all think I'm being selfish.
"Snow:Come on, guys. We all have our own different ways."
"Locke:It's fine, Snow. Balthier might be right."
"Locke:Back then, I didn't even think about who or what I was doing this for."
Ace:We fight to protect the future.
"Ace:We were taught that in order to move forward, we need to cut our ties with the past."
"Locke:Move forward, huh?"
"Locke:I would never want to forget about her, but maybe fighting for what's to come has some sort of meaning."
"Locke:Ace, you do what you think is best for the world to come."
Locke:I was told those words once. And that's what I'm doing and will continue to do.
"Locke:Or at least that's what I'm trying to do. For some reason, what I think is best always seems to upset Celes... Heh."
Vaan:I snuck into thepalacewhile it was underimperialoccupation and stole back the royal family'streasures.
"Locke:Royal family treasures, you say? Those must've fetched quite the price."
"Locke:That's how you met Garnet, right?"
"Faris:I wouldn't say you ""stole"" so much as ""kidnapped"" a princess."
"Locke:You're a pirate, right, Faris?"
Faris:I suppose so. I was picked up by pirates when I was a child and raised as one of their own.
Locke:I see. And Yuffie...
"Zidane:Even still, I wish you wouldn't steal from your friends..."
"Locke:Haha! It's great to see everyone getting along so well! I won't lose to you all in treasure hunting, though!"
Vaan:But aren't you a thief?
Locke:How many times do I have to say it? I'm a treasure hunter!
Locke:My specialty is finding treasures hidden in ruins and graveyards. I can open any chest!
"Yuffie:Oh, I just remembered! You stole my treasure in the palace earlier!"
"Locke:Treasure? If you want it, you can have it."
Locke:I've just been taking whatever I can get my hands on.
Locke:But the treasure in this world just seems...empty. Maybe I just don't know its value...
"Faris:...You might be right. This world was made based on many others, so things may have a different value than back home..."
"Vaan:You mean what constitutes ""treasure"" here may not be the same as ""treasure"" in our home worlds?"
Yuffie:Aww... What a depressing thought...
Locke:That would make any treasure hunter give up his trade here...
"Zidane:Come on now, you two. Cheer up! It's not like you to sulk like this."
Faris:He's right. Those gloomy faces don't suit you at all. We need to take what we can.
Locke:You're right. It's too soon to be giving up.
"Locke:My fellow treasure hunters: we'll get our hands on that treasure, whatever world we may be in!"
"Firion:Locke... You joined forces with Edgar in the rebel army, am I right?"
Firion:Was there a reason for that? Did you do so out of hatred?
Locke:Someone very precious was taken from me...and I didn't want to see more people suffer the way I did.
"Locke:But I wasn't aware of my own hatred, nor did I feel the responsibility the king did. I was just going with the flow."
Celes:As was your rescue of me.
"Locke:Ah! N-no, that's not true..."
"Locke:I joined the resistance after the person I wanted to protect passed away, and I lost sight of my objective..."
Locke:I decided to help the Returners because I was angry at how powerless I felt. I was...immature.
"Laguna:Someone with a troubling youth, I see!"
Squall:(You're one to talk...)
Locke:That might be true. And I don't plan on getting old anytime soon.
Serah:Hehe... I can tell. You still steal treasure wherever you go!
Celes:You're right. He'll be this immature forever.
"Laguna:He may be young at heart, but he still manages to get things done."
Squall:(Just how much does he remember?)
"Laguna:Haha! I can tell you're that kind of guy, Locke!"
Locke:Hey! I've still got dreams to chase!
"Firion:It may have been different at first, but do you have someone you wish to protect now?"
Locke:Of course.
Squall:(What an insufferable guy.)
"Locke:It's different now than when I was just mindlessly chasing after treasure, not knowing what was really precious."
Locke:But that time came. And I understood what I really treasured...
Locke:It's not just a passing feeling. Even you must have a reason for fighting.
"Firion:Yes... You're right. Even if the reason starts as hatred, it eventually changes..."
Squall:...What now?
"Laguna:I understand... For some reason, Locke's story really hits home..."
Serah:What happened?
"Celes:It seems like you've got quite the past, too, Laguna."
Locke:Didn't you say that your memories were foggy?
Laguna:That's why it's so strange! I wonder what happened in my past...
"Locke:Well, don't let my personal stories get to you. I like you the way you are."
"Firion:Yes. Just continue to be yourself, Laguna."
"Laguna:You're right. I just can't help thinking about it, though!"
Squall:(You keep doing that...)
"Serah:Once you find someone to protect, you grow up..."
"Serah:When you want to protect someone, that becomes your very reason for living..."
Celes:Are you talking about Snow?
"Serah:Not just Snow, but the others as well. Especially Noel... He's such a worrywart."
"Serah:But in this world, everything is fine. There are lots of people around to help."
???:Where the hell am I!?
???:Me? I could say the same for you!
"???:Uh, I mean, you have any idea where we are?"
"Steiner:Even if we did, we would not divulge that information to an adversary such as yourself."
???:Come on!
???:I just need some directions! What makes you think I'm the enemy!?
"Cater:Is that a gun? Wow, that's dangerous, you know."
Kain:Hey may be an ally of someone we know.
"Shadow:You may be right, but we don't know for sure."
Fujin:ANALYSIS. ENEMY!?
Steiner:That does it! We must deal with this miscreant immediately!
???:Why won't any of you listen to me!?
???:Don't assume I'm the bad guy!
???:You bunch of arrogant clowns!
"Cater:If you want a fight, you got one!"
"???:All right, Missy!"
Fujin:FOCUS! BATTLE!
"Steiner:A noble knight should never partake in a fight, but I must protect these damsels!"
Shadow:What a hot-headed bunch.
Kain:Should we stop them?
"Shadow:No. With any luck, someone will do that for us."
Kain:You're quite composed.
Shadow:As are you.
Cater:Stop chatting and come help us!
???:You want some of this? You got it!
Cater:Phew! You're as tough as you look.
Barret:I won't let you stand in my way!
Sabin:I respect that.
"Barret:Shut up! Whoever you are, you're built like a damn bear!"
Sabin:Thanks! I'll take that as a compliment.
Cater:You're both built like bears. But I'm here to back you up!
"Maria:If he's willing to talk, we should hear him out."
"Maria:Besides, remember what Shadow said."
Sabin:He might be a friend of one of us.
Sabin:Change of plan! We may not be on opposite sides.
???:After all that!? I'm not falling for any of your tricks.
"Maria:If you can just wait a little longer, there are more of us on the way."
Barret:Tifa? What are you doin' here!?
Sazh:You know this guy?
"Tifa:Yeah, he's a close friend. He has a bit of a temper, though."
Barret:Hey! I'm standin' right here!
Tifa:But he's a nice man who cares very much about his daughter. Isn't that right?
"Barret:W-well, yeah, of course."
"Sazh:So you're a father fightin' alone, too? Maybe we're not so different after all."
"Cater:Well, this is kind of embarrassing. I wish I'd known he was on our side sooner."
Cater:I feel awful fighting someone's friend.
"Tifa:I'm sorry I didn't get here sooner. When I heard what Shadow said, I thought maybe..."
"Barret:Sorry from me too. I admit, I lost my cool."
Maria:It's alright. I'm glad you found your friends.
Sazh:You really are a tough fellow. Probably what's kept you alive for this long.
Sabin:We can explain where we are later. Wanna go say hi to Cloud and the others?
Barret:Cloud! He's here too?
"Barret:Before we head out, the name's Barret. Lookin' forward to gettin' to know everyone."
Cloud:They thought you were the enemy?
"Barret:Yeah, I was about to get real rough."
Tifa:I wish we knew...
Tifa:We've been fighting to save this world and ours.
Cait Sith:It's good to focus on the goals right in front of you!
Barret:You're here too!
"Cait Sith:Yes, and I've made a lot of friends."
"Barret:Are you, uh, are you okay?"
"Tifa:Oh, right. Cait Sith is"
"Cait Sith:No, no, that's classified information! Just know there's nothing for you to worry about."
"Cait Sith:There's a lot we don't know, including Marlene's well-being."
"Cait Sith:I believe this world is still safe, though."
"Barret:It's like that, huh?"
Barret:Alright then!
Barret:I'll do all I can to protect her and our home!
Barret:I'll do it all for Marlene!
Barret:Wh-who're you?
Palom:Your arm! It's so cool!
"Edgar:I apologize for him, but your weapon is fascinating."
"Barret:Ah, this thing."
Edgar:I've never seen anything like it before.
Edgar:Replacing your arm for a weapon must have been a tough decision to make.
Barret:Not really. Just how things turned out.
Barret:It's a reminder of what I couldn't protect and what I should.
Edgar:Don't be so modest. I can sense your strength and determination in the way you treat it.
"Edgar:It has a few nicks and scratches, but it's well taken care of. It says a lot about you."
"Snow:What he said. I don't know much about machinery, but I can tell there are people and things you want to protect."
Snow:And that in itself is an important part of who you are. It demonstrates strength.
Barret:I haven't done anythin' yet to deserve this kind of praise.
Snow:I can tell you have heart. I like you. Let's talk later. I'd like to hear your stories.
Eiko:Hehe! He'll have to run faster to catch us!
Relm:There's no way he'll catch up!
Krile:He's on his way. Let's go!
Barret:Wait up! Huff... Huff... Guess I'll take a break here.
Barret:The kids here sure can run.
"Eiko:You're tired already? We just started playing tag, too!"
"Relm:Are you alright, old man?"
Krile:Should we take a break?
Barret:What!? There's no way I'll lose to a bunch of kids!
"Galuf:You are quite skilled with children, Barret."
Barret:You think so? This is just me.
Barret:Clashing with others as always.
Galuf:That's a part of being an adult.
"Relm:Come on, old man! Break's over!"
Eiko:Yeah! Don't keep us ladies waiting!
Galuf:Hoho. You certainly are popular.
"Barret:Join us, Galuf. We'll show 'em what adults can do!"
"Krile:Are you going to play, too, grandpa? Barret couldn't even catch us..."
Galuf:What are you saying? There's still life in these bones of mine!
"Jecht:Why don't you join 'em, kid?"
Tidus:I'm not a kid anymore! Why don't you join? You act childish enough.
Jecht:Fine. I will.
Jecht:Hey! Let's play a new game. See that sulky boy over there who looks like he wants to play?
Jecht:The first one to catch him wins!
Jecht:Ready? Start!
Tidus:Wh-what's going on!?
"Eiko:Wait up, Tidus!"
"Relm:If you keep moving, I'm gonna draw your portrait!"
"Krile:Run away, Tidus!"
Barret:Hahaha! I think I'll catch 'im first!
"Tidus:W-wait, Barret! Not you, too!"
"Tidus:Damn you, old man! I won't forget this!"
Barret:......
King:What's the matter? Are you okay?
Barret:Just doin' some maintenance so I'm ready when push comes to shove.
"Barret:I need to listen to what my partner says, else my life'll be in danger."
King:I understand. I make sure my revolvers are always in top shape.
"Locke:But it looks to me like you just let loose in battle, Barret."
Barret:There's no time to think about consequences in a fight!
Barret:You just have to go in with your guns blazing!
Edge:Your personality comes through even in your fighting style. I can admire your passion.
"Cecil:But if your gun breaks at a critical moment, then..."
King:We have no choice but to run. A broken gun is useless.
Locke:But you have us to rely on in that case.
Barret:You've got nothin' to worry about!
Barret:My partner's been with me through all my battles.
Barret:We'll make it through somehow!
"King:""Partner,"" I see... It seems like a trustworthy ally indeed."
King:But I've never seen anything like your gun. Can you replace the attachment...?
"Barret:Well, it's connected here like this... With an arm, I use this bolt and..."
Locke:What a rare pair they are!
Rem:We've come pretty far. Don't you think we should head back?
Kain:You're right. Let's head back and...
Kain:Is that...Rosa!?
Thancred:We must go.
Rosa:There are so many of them...but I mustn't give up.
"Kain:Are you alright, Rosa?"
"Rosa:Kain! Yes. Yes, I'm all right."
Kain:Are you with me?
Rosa:There. That should do it.
Yuri:Thanks! It doesn't hurt at all anymore.
"Chelinka:Yuri, why's your face all red?"
"Palom:Maybe it's because Rosa's a lot prettier than you, Chelinka!"
Yuri:You're right! She's pretty and nice and...
Chelinka:Wait a second! I'm all those things too!
"Palom:Are you, though...?"
Rosa:I see you've made some new friends.
Kain:That's right. They're trusty comrades.
Thancred:How about you introduce us to the lady?
"Kain:She is a friend. Rosa, Cecil, and I grew up together."
Rem:That explains why you rushed off without hesitation.
"Thancred:Just ""friends""? What a shame."
"Rem:Kain isn't like you, Thancred. It's natural to care about someone you've known for a long time."
Rosa:I apologize if I caused you worry. Thank you all so much. I wouldn't be standing here if not for all of you.
Yuri:Then let's go and find Cecil! He'll be happy to see you're doing okay.
Kain:He's nearby. I'll explain everything on the way.
Rosa:Thank you. But let me heal you first.
Rem:You were hurt? I didn't notice at all!
Kain:It's nothing. I thought I hid it well.
"Rosa:You did, but you can't fool me."
Cecil:Rosa!
Cecil:I'm not certain whether I should be happy seeing you here.
"Rosa:I'm fine, Cecil. Kain came to my rescue."
"Cecil:What a relief! Thank you, friend."
"Kain:I told her about this world we're in, and she was determined to come and see you."
Rosa:Knowing I can be of help erases any fear I may have.
"Cecil:Thank you, Rosa, for being strong."
"Cecil:Everyone, this is Rosa. She's very dear to me."
Celes:I knew it!
Bartz:I'm glad you found each other.
Eiko:You must be a good person if you're Cecil's sweetie.
"Kain:She's a bit stubborn, but possesses a strong will."
"Eiko:You must know her well, to be able to spot something like that."
Kain:I must go back to patrolling the area.
Cecil:Already? But Rosa is here.
Kain:What I'm doing helps her and everyone else.
Kain:You should rest and catch up.
Eiko:Wait! I'm going with you.
Eiko:I know how you feel. Chin up!
Cecil:I was hoping we could all talk together.
"Bartz:He's letting you two have some time alone. After all, you must have a lot to talk about."
Bartz:I suppose it's time for us to patrol the area too.
Rosa:Oh! You don't have to...
Celes:Reuniting with someone you've been hoping to see again is nothing short of a miracle. Don't take this for granted.
Cecil:Did Kain tell you how I lost my memory? I would be lost if not for him.
"Rosa:That's just like him. Though he saved me back there, I don't always want to be protected."
"Rosa:I want to do what I can for the both of you, too."
Cecil:I thought you might say something like that.
Cecil:Come with us. Your help will be greatly appreciated.
"Rosa:Thank you, Cecil. I'll always be by your side."
"Rosa:It's your turn, Lilisette."
Lilisette:Wow! I feel much better!
Aerith:That's amazing. This must've taken you a long time to learn.
Rosa:It took a lot of hard work.
Terra:It wasn't so easy at first?
Aerith:Because you care for him.
"Rosa:As a mage, I could keep an eye on him in battle too."
"Vincent:Instead of keeping him away from strife, you joined him."
Vincent:You chose a path that allowed you to watch over him.
Lilisette:Didn't that worry the people around you?
Aerith:It's only natural for a mother to worry about her children.
Terra:But they don't always know what's best for you because of their concerns.
Terra:It's impossible to hold back the feeling of wanting to protect someone you care about.
Snow:Exactly. It's that feeling that makes you stronger and helps you face whatever comes your way.
"Lilisette:I fight, too, in hopes of getting stronger to protect the things I care about."
"Rosa:As long as you hold on to that determination, you can do anything."
Rosa:It will pave the path to the future you hope for.
Vincent:Sometimes the path has obstacles you may need to overcome.
Rosa:Yes. There have been times I wasn't strong enough. I let everyone down.
"Rosa:But I vowed to stay by Cecil's side. And to do so, I need to become stronger."
Snow:Good luck! You're gonna have your hands full with that one. But I'm sure your conviction is a part of what keeps him going.
Rosa:Thank you. I'll try my best.
Galuf:Though you don't know what might emerge from them? You sure are a tough one.
"Rosa:He's right, Vaan. The desert is a dangerous place."
"Vaan:Don't worry about me. If the enemy is too strong, I can just run away. I don't get too far from the city anyway."
Garnet:Were you okay!? What happened?
Rosa:I learned some terrible news and chased after Cecil in concern. It was my fault for rushing out alone.
Cloud:Were you surprised you were so under-prepared?
"Tidus:If I were Cecil, I'd be happy you cared about me so much, but I'd worry about you, too, Rosa."
Rosa:I know... I've reflected on my rash actions that caused Cecil and the others to worry.
Garnet:I can understand how you feel. Being scared after getting separated from someone precious to you...
Rosa:But...I always regretted not going with him at that time.
Vaan:It's better to regret something you did than something you didn't.
"Galuf:It's easy to say now that it's over, but I'm glad neither of you encountered dangerous foes or got swallowed by quicksand."
Garnet:What!? A giant caterpillar!?
Cloud:Are you sure it wasn't a snake?
Galuf:No! It was most definitely a caterpillar! I remember it brushing against my skin...
Tidus:I had tosearchfor acactus! And those things can run fast!
Vaan:You guys were worried about me playing in the desert? Just listen to yourselves!
"Rosa:Yes, you're right... I never thought it could be so fun."
"Rosa:No matter how tough our surroundings, we can overcome it with a smile together."
Vaan:Exactly! Isn't it much better that way?
Seifer:I'll go after the small fry! Their boss should be up ahead.
"Rosa:Wait, Seifer! There might be a strong enemy up ahead. We ought to prepare."
Seifer:Do you want them to get away? What if we never find them again?
"Rosa:That is far better than one of us getting severely injured. It's important to rest, Seifer"
"Seifer:If you're afraid, you can wait here. I'm going to stop them!"
Rosa:Are you trying to act tough? Did you think I wouldn't notice?
Seifer:I don't need any healing!
"Sabin:Haha! You can't win this one, Seifer."
Auron:We'll heed Rosa's advice and take a break.
"Lion:I'm surprised you can be so persistent, Rosa."
"Rosa:I'm sorry, but...I couldn't just let him injure himself."
Auron:You are in charge of looking after your comrades. It would be problematic if you weren't so persistent.
"Rosa:Thank you, Auron. I think I got this stubbornness from my mother."
Lightning:Oh really? I've also got stubborn family.
Lion:I'm going to let Serah know you called her stubborn.
Lightning:...I wish you wouldn't.
Lion:Haha. I'm kidding!
"Rosa:My mother became a white mage to protect my father. I chose the same path, so they worried and we fought a lot."
Lightning:You stuck to your goal...
"Rosa:If there's a chance you'll succeed, you don't want to give up, do you? I wanted to believe in myself and my mother. I wanted to be recognized someday."
Auron:...Indeed. Chance is an impartial arbiter for all.
"Lightning:I didn't want to give up and kept fighting. I kept chasing that chance, however small, and will keep doing so."
Rosa:I don't want to give up halfway and regret it.
Seifer:Yeah? Well me neither.
"Seifer:If we keep pressing forward, there's a chance we'll win. Or is that different?"
"Sabin:You're not wrong. No matter the case, there's always a chance. Even I like to battle with momentum."
"Sabin:But you shouldn't neglect your own health. Next time, let us know when you're hurt."
Seifer:...Tch. Haven't we rested enough? Any longer and I'll fall asleep.
"Lion:What a brat... Can't you just say ""thank you"" like a normal person without being so embarrassed?"
Seifer:Who's embarrassed!? Grr... I'm going on ahead!
Seifer:...'Preciate it.'
Rosa:It makes me happy to hear that. Now we're all prepared!
Rosa:Let's go! The chances are better when we're together!
"Raijin:I don't get it. Golbez shoulda just come with us, ya know?"
Yuffie:Yeah! I thought he cared about Cecil...
"Jecht:Listen, you two..."
Jecht:Just 'cause you care about someone doesn't mean you always gotta be with 'em.
"Yuffie:I know... Well, at least it seems like his heart's in the right place."
"Raijin:Yeah! Galuf sure talked some sense into him, ya know?"
"Yuffie:Hmm... I guess there's not much else we can do, huh."
"Raijin:Seems like it, ya know..."
"Galuf:What are your thoughts, Cecil?"
Galuf:Do you also wish to fight alongside your brother?
"Cecil:Not ""fight,"" per se..."
Cecil:I didn't have much chance to speak with him properly in our world after he had come to his senses.
"Cecil:If we were to journey together in this world, I would like to talk to him."
"Jecht:Well, what're we doin' just standin' around here then?"
"Jecht:...So, I got an idea."
Jecht:Why don't we let Cecil here take the helm for a bit?
Cecil:You mean...pilot the airship?
"Jecht:You can do it, can't ya? We don't have a heading yet, so just take it wherever you want."
Cecil:...Understood. I'll give it a try.
"Cait Sith:Well, well! Aren't you persuasive?"
Jecht:He needed to get his mind off his problems. I just gave him a suggestion.
Jecht:Besides...I got a feelin' that something's about to change.
"Jecht:After all, some people are just drawn to each other by fate..."
Galuf:A forest... Did you sense something here?
"Cecil:Yes, something important... But what that is, I do not know."
Jecht:My kind of guy! Ain't nothin' wrong with followin' your gut. So let's get searchin' already
Cait Sith:A m-monster! And a right big one at that!
Cecil:Over there! Let's go!
Jecht:Seriously!? Not this guy again!
"Cait Sith:So surprised to see him, are ya?"
"Cecil:I refuse! We will fight, too!"
"Galuf:And we do so not to help you, but of our own free will."
Jecht:We'll be responsible for our own lives. I doubt you've got complaints with that.
Golbez:...Do as you like.
Cecil:Wait! Brother!
"Cecil:Why won't you talk to me? Please, tell me what you're thinking!"
"Golbez:...Through my mistakes, I brought misfortune upon this world."
Golbez:It is now my responsibility to fix it.
Aerith:So you're trying to close the Torsions all on your own?
"Galuf:Then our goals are one in the same. Isn't that right, Edge?"
Edge:No doubt about it.
"Edge:But I was prepared for this. Like I said before, that's life for you."
"Galuf:Indeed. If Cecil wishes for us to travel together, then so be it."
Cecil:There's no need for us to fight anymore.
"Cecil:Even with Spiritus's patronage, it's too dangerous for you to do this alone."
"Cecil:So please, come with us"
Golbez:No. I must atone for this alone.
Cecil:But why?
Golbez:There is a chance that the darkness that once possessed me can cross the Torsions to this world.
Golbez:I may yet again be manipulated by that evil and consumed with wicked thoughts...
"Golbez:So I must do this alone, lest I betray you all."
Cecil:No. If that happens...
"Cecil:If that happens, then I'll help you regain your memories. Just like you did for me."
Aerith:Yes! And we'll be there to help!
Edge:I'll knock you back to your senses!
Galuf:You can rely on us. And your brother.
"Golbez:For you, spirit moogle."
Mog:Kupo!? Th-these are dimensional coordinates!
Cecil:That means...!
Golbez:Summon me if you must. I will aid you as long as I am still myself.
"Cecil:...Thank you, Brother."
"Aerith:Is this really okay with you, Cecil? Wasn't there more you wanted to talk about?"
"Cecil:...Yes, but there's still time for us to talk. Perhaps not now, but..."
"Cecil:For now, this is enough."
"Cecil:Thank you, Brother."
Golbez:I do not need thanks... Farewell.
Zidane:Seems like he hasn't warmed up to us one bit.
"Firion:For siblings, you two are nothing alike..."
Sabin:I guess it's because they walked different paths in life.
Firion:Were you two more alike as kids?
Cecil:I don't recall. I grew up thinking I didn't have any blood relatives.
"Sabin:Oh yeah, you mentioned that."
"Kain:As a child, he knew few others besides the king and myself."
Cecil:It seems like all siblings and childhood friends here have such great bonds.
Cecil:Perhaps it's not possible to form such a connection with someone you haven't grown up with...
Zidane:That's not true! Upbringing's got nothing to do with it.
Zidane:I don't know anything about where I'm from. I didn't even know I had siblings...
Firion:And sometimes you'll fight even with those you grew up with.
"Sabin:But a connection can still be strong, even if you aren't together. Like me and my brother!"
Cecil:Thank you. Your words give me strength.
Cecil:There may yet come a day where he and I work together.
Zidane:I have no doubt about it.
Firion:Agreed. We all believe so.
"Kuja:Getting sentimental, are we?"
"Kuja:If you like him so much, you should just join him."
Kuja:What's holding you back?
Golbez:...A fine question coming from someone also assisting them.
Golbez:Does that kindness not stem from a connection to one of them?
Kuja:...Just a whim. Please don't confuse my motives with your own.
Golbez:Hmph... Very well then.
"Sazh:Hey, Golbez!"
Sazh:Thanks for the new airship. It's been a big help.
Setzer:Yes. It's got a great engine and is far faster and more comfortable than the last.
Golbez:You need not thank me. It was a hasty construction made with the power of my will.
Noct:Can you really do something like that?
Golbez:There are several among Spiritus's chosen warriors who have superior strength of will and the ability to manipulate Torsions.
Bartz:Now that you mention it...
Squall:(So was the flower field Seifer was in Ultimecia's doing?)
"Golbez:Spiritus doesn't ask his warriors to work together, so I cannot say what the others have done."
Setzer:So it's no more than speculation at this point.
Bartz:The Regalia?
Noct:My car back home.
Sazh:Same here! I'd love to give everyone a ride in the latest airship.
Golbez:Your strength of will is by no means inferior to those of Spiritus's warriors.
"Golbez:Spiritus, who uses any means necessary, and Materia, who desires resolution without destruction..."
Golbez:The only difference between us may be that way of thinking.
"Bartz:For someone who hasn't summoned anyone dangerous, Materia sure is a worrywart..."
Golbez:What is good and bad depends on the circumstances.
"Golbez:I have not used my power for anything after that airship, and have no intention of doing so in the future."
"Sazh:Good and bad depends on the circumstances, huh... I guess it's natural to err on the side of caution."
"Setzer:He may be our ally now, but those Red Wings certainly made for a tough battle before."
Squall:So things from other worlds mixing together is a danger in itself...
Bartz:I guess it's best if we try not to do it as much as possible.
Setzer:I suppose I'll have to put the Blackjack on hold then.
Golbez:It looks like the monsters are gone for now.
"Chelinka:Thank you, Mr. Golbez!"
Selphie:We'll give you a holler if we're ever in a pinch!
"Cid:Hey, Golbez! Wait up!"
Golbez:...Did you need something?
Cid:What was it like? Tell me all about it!
Selphie:You're bursting with enthusiasm as usual.
"Irvine:At this rate, I doubt he'll let you leave until you give him an answer."
Golbez:And a race known as theLunariansresides on theother.
Chelinka:Other worlds also have people connected to the moon...
Cid:People live on the moon!? I wish I could get close enough to meet 'em!
"Golbez:Most Lunarians hope for friendship with those on Earth, but there are those who planned to invade it."
Golbez:Theonewho oncecontrolled mewas also a wicked Lunarian.
Cid:What!? That's terrible!
"Yuri:In our world, the moon is a symbol of evil."
Chelinka:The people who are corrupted by its power are called Lunites.
Cid:You're all makin' the moon seem like a miserable place...
Cid:Damn... There go my dreams...
Irvine:There's no need to get so down about it. These are stories of our own worlds.
Yuri:He's right. The moon in your world might be totally different.
Selphie:It might be a land of flowers and fluffy animals!
Chelinka:Yeah! Maybe it's a super fun place!
"Cid:...I guess you're right. I won't know for sure until I see it with my own eyes, though."
"Cid:Alright! I'm definitely going to the moon someday, you'll see!"
Yuri:I think it's a lot more fun that way. It'll definitely be different from our moons.
Golbez:I pray your journey is a safe one.
"Cid:Thanks, Golbez!"
Vivi:I wonder where Mr. Laguna went... I thought we told him not to wander off.
Rinoa:Hey there! Looking for someone?
"Onion Knight:...Yeah. We got separated from one of our friends. He's got a lousy sense of direction, so we gotta keep an eye on him..."
Rinoa:Hmm... It sounds like he might be lost... Alright then. I'll help you look for him!
Ace:Don't worry about it. This is our problem.
Rinoa:I knew it! You're no ordinary student!
"Rinoa:Some of my friends are students, too, so I'd feel terrible if I didn't help you out."
Onion Knight:But there are a lot of monsters in this area...
"Vivi:Oh no! There they are! Get behind us, miss!"
Rinoa:Don't worry about me. I'll protect you!
Vivi:M-miss!? Don't just run off like that! It's dangerous!
Ace:Come on. Let's go!
Rinoa:Yay! We did it!
"Onion Knight:What were you thinking, running off like that!? Be more careful!"
"Rinoa:But we won, didn't we?"
"Rinoa:You're all so strong, there was nothing to worry about. Thanks for having my back!"
"Onion Knight:I-I guess... Well, I'm glad nothing happened. But next time, be more careful..."
Ace:It's rare to see you being so agreeable.
"Onion Knight:There's not much I can do about it, not with her looking so darn happy..."
"Vivi:You worried about our safety and fought those monsters, even though we just met..."
Vivi:You're so kind.
"Rinoa:Not at all. I was just keeping a promise. I said I would help, and I'm no quitter!"
"Vivi:Even so, I really appreciate the help."
Vivi:I'm glad to have you with us.
"Rinoa:I know it's hard to help everyone in the world, but I still want to do as much as I can for the people I meet."
???:I thought I heard noises coming from this way... Hmm...
"Quistis:I'm sorry, but if you don't know where we're going, just say so..."
Onion Knight:Laguna! Where were you!?
Rinoa:Quistis! What're you doing here!?
"Quistis:Rinoa! You're here, too?"
Rinoa:What do you mean? Should I not be here?
"Laguna:A friend of yours, Quistis?"
Rinoa:Huh? You're so...young...
Laguna:Another strange response... Have we met before?
"Ace:She helped us fight some monsters earlier. Looks like she's one of Quistis's friends, though."
"Quistis:That's correct. Rinoa is from our world. I can't say I'm surprised she was called here, though."
Rinoa:Called? By who? ...What are you guys talking about?
"Irvine:Hey, Rinoa! We've been waiting for you!"
Rinoa:Even Irvine is here! I almost can't believe this is a different world...
Cater:Hm? Could it be the realization hasn't hit yet? Or have you already calmed down?
"Rinoa:Yeah. But it was scary at first, hearing I was in a different world... Is everyone okay?"
Irvine:Don't worry about us. We're already used to it here.
Rinoa:I see. So everyone's already helping out the goddess?
"Rinoa:Is there something I can do? I want to help, too!"
"Balthier:Plucky lass, here. So trusting and unafraid..."
Irvine:No. But she fought alongside us regardless.
"Rinoa:When I heard what was going on here, I was so surprised."
"Rinoa:Being in a different world, summoned by a goddess..."
"Rinoa:I wasn't sure if I could do it, to be honest. But I knew that if everyone here was doing their best, so would I."
"Rinoa:I'm going to fight, too."
"Serah:I'm happy to hear it! So if you're friends with Irvine, that means..."
"Rinoa:Squall! You're here, too! I'm so happy to see you!"
Squall:Are you okay? You're not hurt or...
"Rinoa:Haha! Are you worried about me, Squall?"
Squall:...What's so funny about it?
Serah:I wouldn't have guessed they'd be such good friends!
Rinoa:It's nothing! I'm fine. The others helped me out. And Quistis told me all about this place.
Rinoa:Thanks for worrying about me. I'm glad I'm here.
Squall:...It would've been better if you hadn't come.
Rinoa:What!? Why!?
"Squall:I'm relieved to see you, but I didn't want you to get involved in this..."
"Rinoa:Hehe. You're such a worrywart, Squall! No matter where I go, I'll be fine as long as you're there."
"Rinoa:Even in a different world, I can be of some help, can't I?"
Squall:...You're right.
Balthier:So the silent-type can't stop talking in front of someone close to his heart. How droll.
"Serah:I don't mind at all. In fact, I think it's wonderful!"
"Vaan:Aww, it's stuck!"
Rinoa:Hmm? What's stuck?
"Prishe:Hehe, sorry! Guess I got carried away!"
Terra:Our ball got stuck in that tree. I'll go and grab it.
"Layle:Don't worry, I'll get it."
"Vaan:Thanks, Layle!"
Rinoa:Whoa! That's handy!
"Layle:Handy? You know it's not normal for people to do that, right?"
"Layle:Back in my world, people would be running away in fear."
Rinoa:Fear? You mean they're scared of you? ...But why?
Layle:Because ordinary people don't have special powers like this.
Prishe:Most people are afraid of things they don't understand. There's not much you can do about it.
"Vaan:But why? Everyone's different, aren't they?"
"Terra:People crave the powers they don't have, but when it's too strong, they get scared."
Vaan:...I see. They think it's dangerous.
"Vanille:Even if you don't mean to use that power for evil, they're still scared..."
"Rinoa:I guess it's the same everywhere. I don't think there's any reason to be afraid of you, Layle. You're a good person."
"Rinoa:I know people who will care about you, even with those powers."
Prishe:I'm happy to hear that.
Prishe:People hated me because of my powers...
Prishe:But I think even having just one person who believes in you is enough.
Terra:That's right. There was a time where I lost control of my powers and got separated from my friends.
Terra:But they found me.
"Terra:At that time, I was afraid of myself..."
"Terra:But my friends didn't fear me. Because of them, I was able to face myself."
Vanille:...That power isn't something you can just throw away. You have to learn to accept it.
Layle:That's right. It's a part of you.
Layle:So it's best to use it the way you wantwithout fear or hesitation.
Rinoa:A part of me... Hehe. I'll take your advice to heart!
"Rinoa:So even though you all knew you were summoned by the gods, it didn't worry you at all?"
"Tidus:It sounds like you were worried, Rinoa."
Rinoa:The Returners? Is that some kind of secret organization?
"Tifa:You were a part of the Returners here, right, Firion?"
Ashe:Joining a similar organization in a different world must be such an odd feeling...
"Firion:But the Emperor is in this world, too. And I wouldn't mind settling the score here."
Firion:I don't know what will happen if he returns to my world. Stopping him here could prevent more harm from befalling my home.
"Rinoa:You look so young, but you're really giving it your all."
"Firion:My all...? Well, I just didn't have any other choices."
Tidus:That's impressive. You both fought for the sake of other people.
"Rinoa:No, not really. I just felt like taking action. But after meeting Squall and the others, I realized how naive I was..."
Ashe:I'm fighting to take back things that were stolen.
"Ashe:No. It's because of pride that I can continue fighting without yielding. What are you fighting for, Rinoa?"
Rinoa:I... I'm fighting so I can be with everyone.
"Rinoa:Squall and the others chose to fight, so I had to take up arms if I wanted to be beside them..."
"Rinoa:Fighting wasn't a means, but an end."
Rinoa:But I learned that I had to fight to keep the future from disappearing. So I decided to do just that.
"Tifa:I know how you feel, and I'm sure the others do, too."
Tifa:We want to be with those important to us and protect those close to our hearts. Those feelings allow us to be strong and fight.
Tidus:I know that looking at ourselves in the past can be...embarrassing.
"Tidus:But if I'm trying hard, I want someone to acknowledge it."
"Tidus:I realized that I was naive, too. I regretted a lot of things."
Edgar:Those who can accept their past failures can grow. I believe both of you will.
"Ashe:Yes. You are serious about it now, right?"
Rinoa:Of course. I won't let anyone take away our future. I'll protect it with my own two hands!
Rinoa:Or am I still being too naive...?
"Ashe:No. Nobody could call you ""naive"" after hearing you say that."
Rinoa:Welcome back! How was the patrol?
Cecil:Nothing to report. But it looks like we may be in for some bad weather soon.
Maria:Oh really? It looks fine to me...
"Krile:The animals said so, so we should get ready."
"Rinoa:You can talk to animals, Krile!? That's amazing!"
Maria:Were you raised with animals?
"Krile:No, but I can understand what they say."
"Rinoa:I can tell when animals are happy or sad, but nothing more than that."
Shadow:Though I get the feeling they can read our emotions pretty well.
"Rinoa:I know! I guess it only goes one way, though..."
"Eiko:Is there an animal you want to talk to, Rinoa?"
"Rinoa:She's super clever and cuddly, too! I feel like we could be even better friends if I could talk to her."
Krile:Just because you can talk doesn't mean you'll be better friends. There are more important things than words.
Rinoa:Oh really?
Krile:Isn't talking what causes a lot of fights?
Rinoa:Won't being together every day help?
Eiko:I don't think so...
"Eiko:Even though I spent every day with the moogles, we still fought all the time."
Cecil:Then I guess it's not much different from talking with humans.
Cecil:I suppose connecting to others with kindness is what's most important.
Maria:You're right. Feelings can be conveyed even with just your eyes.
Eiko:I feel like I can understand Shadow's feelings just by looking at his eyes!
"Krile:Hehe. Even if you don't speak, there are other ways to convey your feelings!"
"Krile:You can tell an animal ""thank you"" or ""I'm sorry"" just by cuddling or petting them!"
"Krile:You understand Angelo's feelings, right?"
Rinoa:Yeah! I think Angelo also likes being with me.
Rinoa:I'll be sure to show her how much I love her from now on!
Lenna:Look! There's someone over there.
Celes:They seem lost... Maybe they're someone's friend.
Celes:Is everything alright? Perhaps we can help.
Lulu:Are you from this area?
"Celes:No. We aren't too familiar with it, either..."
Lulu:I see... Hm...
Lenna:Maybe we should tell her what we know about this world.
Lilisette:Good idea! She's probably a friend of someone from another world.
Celes:Could it be that you're also lost in this world?
"Lenna:Yes. There are others like you, us included. Could you tell us what happened to you?"
Lulu:I was told by a goddess that this is a different world... I'm searching for my comrades now.
Lilisette:Then we can definitely help! What kind of person are you looking for?
Lulu:A young woman. She's a summoner.
Celes:I know some likely candidates. You wait right here. I'll go and fetch who I can.
"Rydia:Um, well... Nice to meet you?"
"Eiko:I don't know this lady, either! But we can still be friends."
"Celes:I'm sorry. You said ""summoner,"" so I thought..."
Lilisette:I guess we got it wrong.
Lulu:I see... You two are also summoners?
Lulu:What fascinating dress... This truly is a different world.
"Lulu:I hope she's all right, wherever she is..."
Lulu:Thank you for your help. I'll continue my search.
Celes:Wait. I can't let you go off on your own.
Rydia:You must be exhausted. Please don't push yourself.
Eiko:Why don't you take a break first? Then we'll all help you find your friends!
Lenna:Indeed. We have other summoners in our group. There's a chance the one you're looking for is among them.
Lilisette:Yeah! You can meet all of our comrades if you come with us to the airship.
Lulu:...I suppose you're right.
"Lulu:Thank you for your kindness. Let us do just that, then."
"Penelo:How are you holding up, Lulu? We should be out of the forest soon."
"Lulu:I'm fine, thank you for asking."
"Penelo:Not at all! By the way, that's a cute doll you have there."
Lulu:Thank you. You must find it weird for me to be carrying this around.
Penelo:What? Of course not! I think it's adorable!
Lulu:Hehe. My apologies for teasing you.
Lulu:This doll is capable of more than just looking cute.
Seven:It moved!
"Seven:You two are from different worlds, right? How is it possible you know that?"
"Shantotto:Though the theory behind it is not the same, I believe something akin to magic is to blame."
"Lulu:...So the idea of magic is the same then. Well, she's right. This moves by magic."
"Penelo:Then you're a mage, Lulu? We've got lots of allies who can also use magic!"
Penelo:I hope we can find your friend soon!
Seven:We're nearly there. Just a little more.
Lulu:I can't thank you enough for helping me. I feel much better now.
Seven:Don't mention it. We all know what it's like to be lost in this world.
"Wakka:Man, this thing just won't quit!"
Seven:Wakka? What's the matter?
"Wakka:Nice timing! There's a monster over there. Come on, help me out!"
Lulu:Wakka! There you are!
Wakka:It's a good thing you're here. My ball just doesn't seem to do the trick.
"Wakka:I need your help, Lu!"
Penelo:Wow! So your magic could do more than just make that doll move!
Lulu:Where is Yuna? Is she safe?
Wakka:Take it easy. She's with us.
Lulu:Thank goodness.
Shantotto:So that's the summoner you were looking for. Finding her among so many would've been a chore.
"Seven:We should've brought Yuna with us. When we get back to the airship, you'll be able to see her."
Lulu:Please don't apologize. Thank you for bringing me with you.
"Lulu:If Yuna is here, I will gladly fight alongside you."
Lulu:Yuna! I'm so glad you're okay.
"Yuna:Lulu! I'm so happy to see you! When I heard that you were all alone, I was so worried."
Lulu:You have my apologies.
Lulu:I regret not finding you here sooner.
Yuna:I'm fine. I've made it this far thanks to all my new friends.
Yuna:I didn't want you or the other guardians to worry about me.
"Lulu:You've gotten stronger while I was away, haven't you?"
Yuna:You think so?
"Lulu:...On second thought, maybe not."
Lulu:Hehe.
Jecht:But we need to fix whatever's goin' on in this world before you guys can go home.
Jecht:And it won't be easy.
Lulu:What!? What are you doing here!?
Jecht:Didn't mean to surprise ya. Not even I understand everything at work here.
Jecht:But I can move my own body and haven't lost control yet.
Yuna:Sir Jecht is also one of our allies now.
Lulu:I see... ......
"Lulu:I can put my faith in you as a legendary guardian, can't I?"
Jecht:Course ya can!
Yuna:Yes. Both Sir Jecht and Sir Auron were legendary guardians.
Lion:So this is like a dream team!
"Layle:We've been traveling with Jecht for so long, it's hard to believe he's some kind of legend..."
"Jecht:Alright, 'nuff talk about dreams."
Lulu:I guess you're right. Though our journey was somewhat of a dream...
"Vaan:Auron is always composed, so I'd believe someone if they told me he's some sort of legend, but..."
Vaan:Jecht is a different story.
Jecht:Hey! I don't care about bein' a legend! Normal's fine with me!
"Lulu:Guardians, Sir Jecht, and all those from other worlds..."
Lulu:I will do my best to protect you.
"Vivi:You use dolls instead of rods to cast magic, don't you, Miss Lulu?"
"Vivi:It's so rare to see, so it's neat to get to travel with you."
Lulu:Is that so? I never really thought about it.
"Vivi:I wonder how it works. You're a black mage too, aren't you?"
Lulu:There are things even I don't understand about it. I do it because it was needed on our journey thus far.
Vivi:It's really cool the way other people cast magic.
Shantotto:Are you saying you are not awed by magic cast with a rod?
Shantotto:No tool is better or worse when reciting a magical verse.
Lulu:She's right. It is a mere coincidence that I happen to use dolls.
Vivi:I see. I guess there are lots of ways to use magic out there.
Papalymo:Rods and wands were originally used to heighten the caster's concentration and magic abilities.
"Papalymo:If anything, it allows one who has the disposition for it to use magic. How does your magic work, Edge?"
Edge:I don't use magic! I useEblanninjutsu.
Edge:I'm no mage. I can't do what Rydia and Rosa do.
"Shantotto:At least according toVana'diel'srules,ninjacast something like spells with tools."
Shantotto:But how do these arts work in other parts?
Shantotto:The flames of my interest have been fanned.
Shantotto:So would you mind lending me a hand?
Edge:N-no way!
Edge:The Eblan ninja arts are a royal secret!
Shantotto:I have no interest in your traditions. This is for the sake of knowledge acquisition.
Edge:Give me a break!
Papalymo:...I suppose there's no sating her curiosity. Forgive me for my question earlier.
Lulu:Do not worry about it.
"Lulu:Our home world, Spira, was full of danger."
Lulu:Magic was a way of fighting those dangers. I never thought of it as something to be researched.
Papalymo:Regrettable that you only ever considered one side of your power.
Lulu:It seems like you all have very inquiring minds.
Papalymo:I also quite enjoy the pursuit of knowledge.
Lulu:I never had the chance to talk so genuinely about magic. It's...fun.
Papalymo:I am glad to hear it. Traveling together will give us many more chances to enrich the other.
Eiko:I'll play with you! What do you want to do?
Lenna:...It doesn't talk after all.
"Aphmau:It seems like Lulu is the one moving it, so it might be difficult for it to talk."
Eiko:...I don't understand how stuff works in other worlds. Does it really move by magic?
"Eiko:There's nothing else moving it? Like a machine, or an animal on the inside?"
"Aphmau:My automatons,OvjangandMnejing, are my precious friends."
"Eiko:Wow! If they're your friends, you must feel safe even when you're alone."
Lulu:But...is it so unbelievable that it moves by magic? How can I prove it to you?
Ace:We don't need you to prove it.
"Ace:There were moogles like that in Eiko's world, too. Your doll might be the same."
"Eiko:Yeah! So if your doll ever wants to make friends, let me know!"
"Eiko:What do you think, Cait Sith?"
Lulu:(Now that they mention it...there are beings like Cait Sith in other worlds. Perhaps a misunderstanding was unavoidable.)
Cait Sith:Hm... I don't understand other worlds very well.
"Cait Sith:But whether they're alive or not, or a doll, monster, or beast...if they're a friend, you need to take good care of them!"
"Aphmau:That's right! It doesn't matter if they're a doll. The most important part is how you've been together, and that you want to continue being together."
"Eiko:Well, will you keep being our friend, Cait Sith?"
"Cait Sith:Huh? Well, I wouldn't mind being friends with all my companions here..."
Ace:Cait Sith said so himself. Even dolls can be friends.
Lenna:Yes. There is more to friendship than just exchanging words.
"Eiko:Hehe. Thanks, Cait Sith!"
"Aphmau:I want to be friends, too! I don't have any other automaton friends besides Ovjang and Mnejing."
Cait Sith:Of course! We're all friends here.
"Aphmau:Yay! Thank you, Cait Sith!"
"Lulu:...Even if our worlds are different, similar magic exists."
Cait Sith:Magic? What do you mean? I'm a fortune-telling machine.
Lulu:To think that a machine can move and have feeling towards friends... Technology is incredible.
"Cait Sith:Now Lulu, don't go spoiling the kiddos' dreams."
Lulu:I suppose you're right. The similarities were just too hard to ignore. I apologize.
"Lulu:But no matter what kind of person you are, you are still a friend."
Cait Sith:I'm a machine with a capital M! But I'm happy to be called a friend.
Lulu:Hehe... I really do enjoy it here.
???:AHHHHHH!
Snow:Did you hear that?
"Terra:Yes, but I don't recognize that voice."
Warrior of Light:It was a scream. We must hurry.
Lann:Ouch! What the honk!? That hurts!
Lann:Here we go!
Lann:A persimmon! If only I had a way to slice this up!
Lann:...Wait a second. Where's my prism!?
Lann:And who put a persimmon in my pocket!? Was itTama?Serafie?
Squall:What's going on here...?
Terra:It doesn't matter. He's in trouble. We have to help him!
Lann:Whew! You really rescued my rear back there. Thanks!
Lann:But I am glad to see you guys again! You've got great timing!
Snow:Do we...know you?
Squall:I don't remember him at all...
"Lann:What!? It's me, Lann!"
"Lann:Why are you all suddenly Jiants, too!?"
Lann:Yeah! Why didn't you tell me you could do that!?
"Lann:Well, it's a bit awkward talking to you from down here, so...up I go! ...Huh?"
Lann:What the what!? Why can't I turn into a Jiant!?
Lann:...And where are we?
"Snow:All right, little guy, calm down. We'll explain everything."
Terra:And that's why we've got to solve this problem.
"Warrior of Light:Indeed. In order to protect our own worlds, we must first protect this one."
Lann:I get it...
"Lann:On second thought, I don't. Could you run that by me one more time?"
Snow:I guess we went too fast. Where did you get lost?
"Lann:Somewhere around the time you said...""We'll explain everything."""
Snow:That was even before we started!
Squall:(Why even bother explaining? This kid's a lost cause...)
Terra:Why don't we explain it again later when we can take our time?
Warrior of Light:Agreed. We must get moving. Will you join us?
Lann:Do you even have to ask? It'll be just like old times!
"Squall:(""Old times""? What a weird kid...)"
Edgar:Welcome back. And it looks like you brought a new friend!
"Reynn:Lann, there you are! I knew you got lost somewhere!"
"Lann:Sis, did you see? Everyone's a Jiant now!"
Reynn:Ugh... Of course I've seen!
Lann:Isn't it awesomely weird?
Reynn:...I'm sorry if you wasted your breath explaining things to my brother. He was born a dummy.
Terra:Don't worry about it. There's always bound to be confusion in the beginning.
"Reynn:If it were just the beginning, that'd be fine..."
Tifa:You must be Reynn's brother. It's nice to meet you.
"Lann:Oh, uh, nice to meet you too, I guess? Looks like you've also grown into a Jiant, Tifa."
Tifa:So we've also met before.
"Tifa:Reynn also knew my name, though she did call me a ghost and try to run away at first..."
"Lann:Aww, you poor thing, Sis. Thankfully someone was around to save the day!"
"Reynn:And what happened to you, huh!?"
Terra:He was being attacked by monsters.
Edgar:I'm glad you escaped unscathed.
Terra:He was saying something about a persimmon in his pocket when we found him...
Lann:Y-you saw that!?
Edgar:And just what did you intend to do with that persimmon?
"Reynn:Don't tell me you were looking for a prism, but pulled out a persimmon instead..."
Lann:How did you know that!?
"Edgar:I'm happy to see you two having fun, but I must remind you that this is a different world than the one you're familiar with."
"Tifa:He's right. And even though you may have met us before, it's still the first time for us."
"Terra:I still have no idea what a ""Jiant"" is..."
"Edgar:And forgive me for asking, but is the form you take...normal in your world?"
"Reynn:We're usually the same size as the rest of you, but we had to change to this form to fit the world we traveled to."
"Reynn:And for some reason, it seems like we just can't change back..."
"Edgar:It sounds complicated, and it seems like you're in a tight spot as well. Let us help."
Reynn:Thank you!
Lann:I see...
Reynn:Are you sure about that?
"Lann:Aha ha ha! Of course I am! Someone, you know, needs our help!"
"Reynn:Yeah, and that person is YOU!"
Bartz:Haha! You guys are funny!
Reynn:Me? Funny!?
"Lann:It's so weird to see you without Boko, Bartz!"
Bartz:You know Boko?
Lann:Of course! You two are always together!
Edgar:...So versions of us really do exist in your world.
Edgar:And their similarities to us go far beyond our names and appearances.
Tifa:Did you hear that? It sounds like there are monsters nearby!
Edgar:You two had better hide.
Lann:You got that right! We're not about to let you guys have all the fun.
"Lann:Let's do this, Sis."
Reynn:Do you think we can win?
"Lann:No doubt about it! Remember, we're not alone."
Reynn:You're right. Let's go!
Tidus:Whew! That should calm things down around here for a bit.
Lann:Over already? Things really get done quick with you guys around!
Quistis:We're happy to be of service.
Lann:I guess we'll be seeing you guys around.
Lightning:You're leaving?
Lann:Yep! But we'll be back soon.
Quistis:Does that mean you've found a way to return to your world!?
Lann:Yeah. Usually we just pass through the gate and... What the!? Where's the gate!?
Lann:How weird... The gate should be right here!
"Reynn:You really weren't listening, were you? There's something we have to do in this world first."
Lann:Seriously!? You mean no more shortcut? My legs are tired just thinking about it!
Faris:What shortcut is he talking about?
Reynn:Sorry about that. Just ignore him.
"Faris:In any case, it looks like you two are also stuck here."
"Reynn:Yeah, I guess so."
"Tidus:That means you're staying with us, right?"
Reynn:Yes! There's still so much I wanna know. It'll be nice traveling together again.
Lightning:What's on your mind? Shocked you can't go home yet?
"Lann:No, it's not that. I've just noticed something terrible..."
Quistis:What's that?
"Lann:This isn't Grymoire, so we can't use the gate!"
Reynn:What do you mean you just noticed that? I said that a few minutes ago!
Lann:Wh-what!? You mean everyone else knew?
Reynn:...You'll have to forgive my brother. He can be a bit...slow at times.
Agrias:We are to work with the other team and bring down the band of monsters ahead with a pincer maneuver.
"Lann:A band of monsters? Well, that doesn't sound so bad. I wonder what kind of instruments they play!"
Reynn:You can't be serious right now!
King:We're working out our battle tactics. A full-frontal attack would do nothing but tire us out.
Lann:Tire us out...? But I don't wanna get squished by tires!
"Reynn:It means ""exhausted,"" not being flattened by wheels!"
"Reynn:Just nod and say ""uh-huh,"" Lann."
Reynn:We're getting nowhere fast by you asking these questions. Got it?
"Zell:Let's leave the strategizing to them, Lann. I know they'll do a good job."
"Reynn:Now then, with the distractions out of the way, let's get on with the strategy meeting."
Agrias:...Very well then.
King:A pincer attack will only gather our enemies and give them the advantage of numbers.
"Agrias:Precisely. It is an unwise plan for us, with so few people."
"Reynn:Why don't we lure in our enemies, starting with the closest, and shave off their numbers that way?"
King:Then I'll lure them in. I can grab their attention without getting too close.
"Agrias:If you lead them to us, we can thin them out by dropping rocks on them from our vantage point."
Zell:Lann and I could do the heavy lifting.
"Reynn:You can say more than ""uh-huh"" if you actually understand, you know."
Lann:Even though you told me not to!?
Agrias:Do not worry. I will go with you.
Reynn:I'll help King.
Agrias:Then let us commence the operation: eliminate the monsters.
Zell:It means we're going to bring down all the baddies.
"Lann:I get it! Your explanations are so easy to understand, Zell!"
"Reynn:I don't think you really understand what's going on here, Lann..."
Lann:Give me more credit than that! I was listening the whole time!
"Zell:Then there's nothing to worry about. Let's do it, Lann."
"Reynn:Really...? I'm not so sure, so could you stick with the"
Lann:We're gonna beat down the baddies! Let's go!
Zell:Lann? Where are you going!?
Reynn:I knew it! He has no idea what's going on! Lann!
Vaan:What's going on!? Lann just ran straight at the enemy!
Agrias:What...! Could you let everyone know there's been a change of plans? A full-frontal assault...
King:That fool... He reminds me of someone else I know...
Reynn:I'm really sorry for my brother...
Palom:Alright! Let's get out of here!
Lann:This is what happens when you scribble on monsters!
Yuri:Phew... That was fun!
"Chelinka:Yuri! Where were you!? I heard something worrying about ""scribbles""..."
Yuri:Huh? Oh... We didn't do anything! Right?
Lann:YES. WE DIDN'T. DO ANYTHING.
Reynn:Blatantly suspicious...
"Reynn:Could it be that someone was messing around with monsters, got found out, then tried to fight them..."
"Reynn:...Only to realize they were surrounded, then notice they were lost in a monster's den, and panicked..."
Reynn:...Then ran all the way back here trying to act like nothing at all happened?
"Lann:That's so specific, Sis!"
"Lann:But, even if that were the case, we're totally fine! Right, Palom? Yuri?"
Palom:Yeah! We're totally fine!
"Reynn:I've got my hands full enough with Lann, but now these two, too..."
"Chelinka:Hehe. I've been here for a while, so I'm used to it. But I know how you feel."
Lann:Why are you on Chelinka's side anyway? She's so responsible.
"Reynn:What do you mean? I'm responsible, too, aren't I?"
"Chelinka:Yes, you definitely are!"
Chelinka:I think we're the same. Though I don't know what happened to you two in the past...
"Yuri:I think so, too. I'm sure you've overcome some similar difficulties."
"Yuri:And you're both scared of ghosts, too!"
"Chelinka:That has nothing to do with this! But...I'm sure there's something different about us, too."
Chelinka:It seems like Reynn kind of enjoys Lann's mischievousness.
"Lann:Really, Sis!?"
Reynn:No no no no no! You've got it all wrong!
"Reynn:I wish you could calm down a bit and learn some manners, or at the very least not be a nuisance to others..."
Lann:That's mean!
Palom:You're way too spoiled by your sisters.
"Palom:Yeah, but I'm plenty responsible. She doesn't need to worry about me at all!"
Palom:It must be hard having such immature little brothers.
Reynn:You know it.
Lann:I don't wanna hear that from Palom...
Yuri:I'm trying my best to be responsible...
Chelinka:Palom's sister...
Reynn:Hm? What about her?
Chelinka:I just thought it would be so much fun to meet her. I think we'd get along very well.
"Palom:I'm sure she's around here somewhere. When you find her, I'm sure you'll be great friends!"
Reynn:Yeah! Let's go find her on the double!
Lann:Right! We don't want Palom to feel lonely being separated from his big sister for too long!
Lann:What?
Reynn:Nothing. Don't mind me!
"The Emperor:So you, too, are siding with them? Those worthless worms..."
Vayne:How to keep the peace is an integral part in the upbringing of the men ofHouse Solidor.
Vayne:Those who stand above exist for those below them.
Vayne:We must now reassess our duties with the crystal core of light gone.
The Emperor:Hmph... What role has duty when one has dominion?
Firion:This looks like theplace where we met Cait Sithand the others.
Onion Knight:It must have been created based on someone's home.
Vaan:It feels...imperial...
Ashe:It seems places like this are normal in other worlds.
"Vaan:Normal, huh..."
"Mog:Why are you here, kupo!?"
Vayne:I understand you're distrustful of me.
"Ashe:What are you doing here, Vayne!?"
Vayne:...I would like you to think of my appearance as my way of showing you my resolve.
"Vayne:If we continue to focus on our petty grudges, we will all miss out on the larger problem at hand."
"Vayne:However, I do not expect you to readily comprehend my meaning."
"Onion Knight:Well, of course not. You need to tell us what you're talking about first before we can understand it."
"Firion:But considering how things got this way, it might not be easy..."
Vaan:Like we could ever see eye to eye!
Vaan:We don't have to listen to you!
"Vayne:My aim is to protect my home, nothing more."
Ashe:Do you know how much blood has been shed for that very reason!?
"Vayne:Not just the boy, but the princess, too... I suppose we cannot talk like civilized people with all that blood rushing to your head."
Vayne:Be that as it may...
Vayne:I'm afraid I must insist on you seeing the larger problem looming above us.
"Vayne:And to that aim, I will first give you the fight you want."
"Vaan:You'll pay for what you've done, Vayne!"
Vaan:Ashe! Are you okay?
Onion Knight:Is this your way of insisting? Just what is your purpose here?
Vayne:I've already told you: I must protect my home.
Vayne:This is for that purpose alone.
"Firion:Mog, summon our allies."
"Mog:I'm on it, kupo!"
"Onion Knight:I thought you were here to talk...but if it's a fight you want, it's a fight you'll get!"
Vayne:I wouldn't have it any other way. Show me what you can do.
Vayne:I will discern for myself whether your strength is of any use to me.
Vaan:Urgh!
Balthier:Can you stand?
Vaan:Just what do you want!?
Vayne:I have already obtained what I want.
Onion Knight:What do you mean? Are you going to run away again?
Vayne:Spirit moogle. These are my dimensional coordinates.
"Mog:You mean you'll be our ally, kupo!?"
Vayne:Call me freely should the need arise.
Vaan:Just what are you scheming!?
Vayne:I no longer wish to play puppet to the gods.
Vaan:Answer the question!
"Cait Sith:Let's settle down a bit, Vaan, hm?"
"Vaan:Why? Do you know something, Cait Sith?"
"Cait Sith:No. But if you won't let Vayne explain, none of us will ever know."
Vaan:I see... So he hasn't even told you.
"Vayne:However, despite the shattering of the crystal core of light, everything here remains unchanged."
Vayne:How things fare in our own worlds is yet a mystery to me.
Onion Knight:Materia said the crystal core of darkness is sustaining the world...for now.
Vayne:I am looking for the crystal core of darkness.
Vayne:I cannot grasp the size of the threat looming over my homeworld. It is an unfortunately grave state of affairs.
Vayne:We need more information before we decide a course of action.
"Vayne:The fight against you earlier was a test of your strength. Of course, I leave the choice to call me to your discretion."
"Vayne:But I am not your enemy. Nor am I your ally. However, this arrangement works to our mutual advantage."
Cait Sith:You certainly are a lad who loves his world. Even coming this far for it...
Vaan:I can't accept this. I know he'll just get in our way again.
"Vaan:Throw those coordinates away, Mog. I refuse to fight alongside him."
"Balthier:That's enough, Vaan. We're not throwing anything away."
Balthier:His Majesty went out of his way to present us a gift. We ought to accept it.
"Mog:In that case, I'll hold onto it..."
Vayne:It will be an honor to be of service.
"Balthier:Don't think this means we like it, though."
"Vayne:It matters not to me. I wholeheartedly accept your hatred. I use my powers for Ivalice, not for the sake of friendship."
Vayne:But there are objectives I cannot fulfill with those summoned by Spiritus.
"Vayne:Which is why I offer my power to you, in exchange for information."
Balthier:Understand that we're not the ones being used. You are.
Vayne:Then I pray you use my power well.
Balthier:Is it so hard for you to accept Vayne's help?
Vaan:Of course it is! Why isn't it for you?
Ashe:Vayne is our enemy. It's not like we can readily fight alongside him...
Cait Sith:Hmm... Think of it as insurance.
"Balthier:Yes, I suppose that's one way to think about it."
Penelo:What do you mean?
Cait Sith:Vayne's goal is clear.
"Cait Sith:If we do nothing about the disorder in this world, it could affect our homes."
"Cait Sith:And if harm is done to our homeworlds, then..."
Cait Sith:This world and all the warriors within it could be erased.
Cait Sith:Or at least that's what he told me before.
Vaan:We can't let that happen...
Balthier:Then you understand. The time to put that grudge to pasture is now at hand.
"Balthier:We have his dimensional coordinates, which means we know where he is."
"Balthier:It's better than not knowing, correct?"
Ashe:Even so... It's hard to just put all that history behind us...
"Cait Sith:Spiritus's warriors always have all our info, so all the more reason to put it behind you."
Vincent:Information even they can't know...
"Balthier:After all, it's not like they'll come together to decide their next move."
Vincent:Indeed. Our enemies move alone. And we'll have more options if we can keep an eye on them.
Vincent:Cait Sith... You're acquainted with him.
"Cait Sith:You got the right of it, Vincent!"
Cait Sith:I'll keep my eyes on the man! Just leave it to Cait Sith!
Cait Sith:I know how politicians like him work.
"Penelo:Still, I can't help but worry..."
Vincent:Don't force yourselves to accept it. The fact that he's an enemy won't change.
Balthier:As does the fact that our troubles never cease to multiply.
"Balthier:Nevertheless, we'll keep an eye on Vayne while saving the world. Playing the leading man was never an easy job."
Cait Sith:We know that your feelings toward him aren't wrong. But leave it to me. I'll find out his true intentions.
Wakka:Oh no! There's that guy again!
Lightning:Why are you here? We didn't call you.
Vayne:I have no intention of hindering you here and now.
Vayne:I am simply interested in the memories you hold.
Serah:Our memories?
Vayne:I heard that people from the same world don't always have the same memories.
"Lightning:Word gets around quickly, I see."
"Vayne:I had my doubts, but if you say it to be true..."
Serah:What do you get by poking your nose in our business?
Vayne:...Forgive me. I am not free to choose my purpose.
Lightning:There is nothing I know that you don't already.
Lightning:What you want to believe is up to you.
Vayne:...I choose to believe you.
Vayne:What say you two? Have you any abnormalities in your memories?
"Wakka:What am I supposed to say to that, huh? ...Any idea, Yuna?"
Yuna:I wonder. I feel like I'm still missing something...
"Wakka:You serious!? ...Hmm, I don't know."
Lightning:There's no point in worrying about what we don't know. What are you scheming?
Vayne:I am interested in the memory discrepancies of the warriors here.
"Vayne:Notwithstanding the circumstances of Ivalice...of House Solidor and my homeland, there may be things I have forgotten."
Wakka:You mean even Spiritus's warriors have lost their memories?
"Vayne:...The key to retrieving your lost memories lies in brilliance, does it not?"
Lightning:And what if it does? Gathering brilliance will revive the crystal core. It doesn't suit your purposes.
Vayne:Just because it fails to suit my purposes doesn't make it extraneous. All the more when it comes to my own memories.
"Vayne:I want to know the current state of my homeland. I must remember what I did, at the very least."
Vayne:Matters of this world will come later.
Vayne:Thank you for your time.
Yuna:You're quite the conversationalist.
Vayne:Despite appearances...
Vayne:The conflict in my homeworld was due merely to a difference of opinions.
"Vayne:Now, I think we ought to be building a partnership. I intend to tell you what I can."
"Vayne:You may not believe me now, but there may come a day when we join hands."
Bartz:This one won't go down easy!
Lion:It's not that tough... Can you keep going?
"Hope:Haha, I'm not so sure..."
Lion:What are you doing!? You can't just appear in front of us like that!
Warrior of Light:We must all work together to stop an opponent this strong.
Bartz:You don't have to tell me that! I know we can't let this thing roam around free!
Hope:Another attack!? At this rate...
Vayne:Stand back.
Vayne:I will take the front lines while you catch your breath.
Hope:You came to help us?
Lion:Just what are you trying to do?
Vayne:It would be problematic for me if you fell in battle here.
Vayne:I would hate to see mankind's history end in this world...!
Bartz:So you're our ally now?
"Vayne:At present, I am merely not your enemy."
Warrior of Light:I'm ready. Let's go!
Bartz:Looks like we cleaned that up!
"Lion:That was a close one, though. Thank you...Vayne...?"
Hope:I don't see him anywhere.
Warrior of Light:It seems he left.
Hope:He really did come to help us this time.
"Lion:That might just be hi way of doing things. He's a politician, right? It's possible he's trying to win us over somehow."
Lion:Though it could just be a way of furthering his own ends.
"Hope:Well, he's definitely got the eloquence and actions to bring people together..."
"Lion:Even so, he started a war and killed lots of people in Vaan's world."
Warrior of Light:...He's willing to do whatever it takes for his own purposes.
"Warrior of Light:He is always thinking of a way to fulfill his duties, even if it means hurting people..."
Warrior of Light:You might say he has an ominous light about him.
"Bartz:For now, he said he's not our enemy. He saved us, so...let's just go with that."
"Bartz:But if he dares hurt Vaan, Penelo, or any of the others...I won't hesitate to fight."
Lion:Of course. I can't just sit back and watch while others get hurt.
Lion:Why don't we head back now? It's time we got some rest!
Prishe:Not again...!
"Prishe:No matter which way we go, we just can't get through."
Maria:It seems like we're in the depths of the forest now.
Freya:Indeed. The structure has become unexpectedly complex.
Auron:We've walked quite a distance. Have we lost anyone?
Y'shtola:...No. Everyone's accounted for.
Prishe:I've had enough of this place! It's taking ages just to find the way out.
Prishe:Let's just knock these trees down and friggin' make our own path!
Fran:You will only anger the wood.
Prishe:Who are you?
Y'shtola:Are you familiar with these woods?
Fran:Walk that way and you will be free of this place.
Maria:Just who are you?
Fran:You need not believe me if you wish not to do so.
Auron:I don't feel like you would lead us astray...
Fran:Such a feeling is for you to decide.
"Prishe:Well, let's give it a try! Not like we have any other choices!"
Freya:You make a fair point. Let us put our faith in this woman's words.
Fran:Then I will be on my way.
Maria:Why don't you come with us? There's safety in numbers.
Fran:I must decline.
Freya:...I see. Thank you for your help.
Maria:Are you sure? Don't you think she could be a friend of someone? Is it okay for us to just leave her?
Y'shtola:...I think she'll be fine on her own.
Freya:...Then we will take our leave. Until our paths meet again.
Fran:Yes. Until that time...
"Vanille:Well, that was easy! And we have that woman to thank for it."
Edgar:She sounds like an absolute beauty. I would love to thank her in person!
Fran:It seems you made it out fine.
Zidane:Are you the mysterious lady who helped them out?
"Balthier:Aha. So it was you, Fran."
Cid:You know her?
Balthier:But of course. She's my partner.
"Cid:Huh? This lady, YOUR partner?"
"Vanille:If we had known you were partners, we would have brought you along!"
Fran:I did not think you one to wander the earth so.
Balthier:It's nice to gaze up at the heavens once in a while.
Cid:What's the point in lyin'? Ain't got one fit for flyin' is all...
Zidane:But if Balthier's a sky pirate...
"Vanille:And Fran's his partner, then that makes her one, too!"
"Edgar:If you knew Balthier was here, why didn't you join him?"
Balthier:You did not take Materia on her word and were biding your time observing us until you were sure.
Fran:That's right.
"Zidane:Well, if you're a friend of Balthier's, you're a friend of ours."
Balthier:That is up to Fran to decide.
"Vanille:In any case, you really knew your way around that forest."
"Edgar:Thanks to you, we can all move forward together now."
"Balthier:Try as you may, Edgar, but this one is no easy prey."
"Balthier:Now then, you've probably already realized it, but it's as the goddess said: this is a different world."
Balthier:Can you hear the voice of the wood here?
"Fran:No, I cannot. I know only the way through..."
Fran:But it seems that unwanted guests followed you out of the woods.
Balthier:Are you certain they didn't follow you?
Fran:Does it matter now?
Fran:I will take care of them. Stand back.
Zidane:We'll fight with you!
Edgar:We must repay you for showing our friends the way out of the woods.
Vanille:That's right!
"Balthier:...How about it, Fran? Will you join our ranks?"
"Fran:I will. You are here, too, after all."
"Yda:Thanks to Fran, we were able to make it this deep into the woods!"
Yda:Now we can get back without getting lost!
Onion Knight:That's a relief. It's dangerous wandering around here for too long.
Garnet:I'm happy we have such a skilled ally among us now.
Yda:I wish we had met her sooner!
Fran:Hearing such praise is pleasant. But know that I do not know my way around every forest.
Yda:What do you mean?
"Onion Knight:The fact that you followed us without saying a word means you know the way back, right?"
Fran:I assumed the one at the front knew the way.
"Garnet:Oh no! At this rate, we'll all get lost..."
"Yda:Let's go back, then! If we keep going forward, we'll forget how we got here."
"Papalymo:Fret not, Yda. I know the way back."
Papalymo:As do you. Am I right?
Fran:You are. My apologies for toying with you.
Fran:There is no need to rush back. Panic will lead you down the wrong path.
Garnet:What a relief... I'm sorry for panicking.
Fran:But please do not assume I know everything about the woods.
Fran:I can no longer hear the green word...
Papalymo:You needn't say anything if you do not wish to.
Fran:...Thank you.
Onion Knight:So what do we do now? Should we go back?
Papalymo:There is no need for that. Both Fran and I know the way.
Onion Knight:Then let's explore a little more. I'll lead the way!
"Yda:We're going to keep going? Well, could you let us know before we reach the point of no return!?"
Garnet:We'll do our best to help.
Fran:...A lively bunch.
"Papalymo:But they're friendly, aren't they?"
Papalymo:And you made a choice to lend us your powers when you decided to travel with us.
Fran:...I have no regrets. I look forward to seeing what this world has to offer.
Lion:Huh? What could Cater and Wakka be talking about?
"Y'shtola:Idle banter, most likely."
Fran:Though it seems as if they wish to keep it a secret.
"Freya:If they have gone through the trouble of coming all the way here, we best not interfere."
Cater:Did you hear us!?
Wakka:That's why I told you to give up already.
"Fran:You were talking about our ears, weren't you?"
Cater:So you did hear us!
Y'shtola:I suppose it's safe to say our kind aren't very common in your worlds.
"Freya:Does it not interest you, Lion?"
"Cater:We weren't talking about anything weird, just so you know."
Cater:I just wanted to know...if I can touch your ears. So can I?
"Wakka:I told you it's not gonna happen. They have pride, too, y'know."
Wakka:You gotta respect that.
"Cater:I know, but..."
"Fran:No, indeed."
Y'shtola:I will have to decline as well.
Freya:As will I.
Wakka:I told you so.
Cater:But it's too soon to give up. Maybe when they're asleep...
"Wakka:C'mon, you can't do that!"
Lion:You seem pretty terrible at keeping secrets. Your plan sounds doomed to fail.
Fran:But I believe it good to be interested in species other than our own.
"Fran:If you manage to catch me unawares, I may just overlook it."
"Lion:Good luck with that one, Cater..."
Fran:There are...so many of you.
"Vaan:Of course. It's been just you and Balthier for a long time! But it must be heartening to have so many allies now, right?"
Bartz:Though some of us are just here in their own interest.
"Penelo:Yeah... And some are pretty scary, too."
Locke:And there are a few who you really don't want watching your back.
Fran:But are there not also those whom you can trust?
Bartz:You're right. I never thought I'd see the day I'd fight beside Gilgamesh.
"Quistis:When moving together with this great of number, it's both unusual and...unifying."
"Penelo:And you want to protect all your allies, not just the ones from your own world."
Vaan:I know I can rely on each and every one of them.
Fran:...You are more grown-up than the Vaan I know.
Locke:Oh really? He still seems like a kid to me.
"Quistis:It wouldn't hurt you to calm down a bit, though I wouldn't take it as far as Squall has... And a little tact would do you some good."
Fran:You may be right.
"Vaan:Well that's not very fair. Everyone's a child to you, Fran!"
Vaan:Even Bartz and Locke and the others...
"Bartz:I've got a bad feeling about this... You better quit while you're ahead, Vaan."
Locke:Why? What's up?
"Vaan:Other worlds I don't know, but in Ivalice, some people live a looong time. I can't say exactly how old Fran is, but yeah..."
Locke:Oh really? Hearing about tribes from other worlds is pretty fascinating.
"Penelo:V-Vaan, hold it!"
Penelo:Think about what Quistis said! You need to be more tactful!
"Quistis:Yes, Vaan... This is exactly what I was talking about."
Fran:Hehe... You really have not changed at all.
Bartz:We had better call it quits here. There are just some things you don't talk about.
???:What should I do...
???:Excuse me... I'm looking for somebody. Would you mind...stepping aside?
"???:...Alright. If you won't move, then..."
???:I'll just have to take you down!
Zack:Whew! Wasn't that last battle a blast?
Zack:Did you see my special technique? It slayed that monster!
Seifer:What are you getting all excited about?
Seifer:I was the one who landed the finishing blow.
Zack:Wh-what'd you say!?
"Zack:Alright, buddy! Let's settle this right here and right now!"
"Seifer:If it'll shut you up, it'd be my pleasure."
"Zack:Likewise! You'll be sorry for picking a fight with me, you"
"Onion Knight:Settle down, you two. What's the point in fighting about it?"
Zack:He's trying to steal my thunder!
"Krile:Hehe... Even though you say that, I can tell you care about Seifer."
"Krile:You don't want him to feel alone, right?"
Zack:H-huh!? How did you know that? What gave it away...?
"Seifer:Hey... Thanks to your big mouth, we've got guests now."
Zack:I-is that my fault...?
"Krile:Everyone, look! Over there! A little girl is surrounded by monsters!"
Onion Knight:We've gotta save her!
"Krile:She seems pretty calm, though..."
Zack:She's probably so scared she can't move! Let's go!
Seifer:Where are you running off to!? Those monsters are mine!
Krile:Hehe. Sometimes I can't tell if they're friends or not...
"Onion Knight:C'mon, there's no time to waste, Krile!"
???:Hyah! Take that!
???:...That should do it.
Zack:Huh!? Did you defeat them all by yourself!?
???:Oh? Did you come to help? Thank you!
"Zack:Oh, uh, you're welcome..."
Seifer:Are you stupid or something?
Porom:Palom!?
Porom:I finally found you! Where have you been?
Palom:I should ask the same to you! But I'm happy you're fine.
Cecil:Porom! I'm so glad to see you unharmed.
"Porom:Likewise, Cecil. It's a relief to see you."
Zack:Is this little girl...
Aerith:Palom's twin sister?
"Palom:That's right! Her name's Porom, and she's super strongjust like me!"
Seifer:Hmph... That's better than useless.
"Aerith:Palom called you a prodigy, and he certainly wasn't exaggerating."
"Porom:I'm no prodigy... We're still in training, after all."
"Porom:...My apologies for being so forward, but who might you be...?"
Porom:...I see. And that's why I'm now in a different world...
Porom:I'm sure it hasn't been easy taking care of my brother. Please accept my heartfelt thanks.
"Zack:...I noticed it before, but you're so polite."
Seifer:Unlike your brother.
Palom:Wh-what's that supposed to mean!?
"Porom:Enough, Palom! Mind your manners!"
"Palom:Urk, now I'm in for it..."
"Porom:I'm sure my brother's caused you all sorts of trouble, playing pranks and the like..."
Palom:Hey! Why isn't anyone defending me!?
Porom:...You warriors from other worlds can take it easy now. Rest assured I'll take care of Palom.
"Porom:From now on, I'll be happy to travel with you while keeping an eye on him!"
Palom:What!? I don't need a babysitter!
"Porom:Quiet, Palom!"
"Cecil:Thank you, Porom. Your presence is a great relief to us..."
Aerith:We're happy to welcome such a reliable new friend on board!
Porom:Hehe. Leave everything to me!
"Mog:Go here, kupo... And then there, kupo..."
"Mog:I'm so busy, kupo... Being a spirit guide sure isn't easy..."
"Mog:Wh-who's there, kupo?"
"Mog:HELP ME, KUPOOO!"
Yang:That's Lord Mog's voice!
Maria:Oh no! Mog is being attacked by monsters!
Auron:There's no time to waste. Let's go!
"Mog:P-please don't eat me! I'm bad for your tummy, kupo!"
Yang:He's too far away! We might not make it!
Maria:No...! Mog!
Palom:Heeey! Over here!
"Palom:This way, big guy!"
Porom:We'll play with you!
"Palom:Now, Auron!"
Porom:Save Mog!
Auron:Hmph. Those kids...
Yang:Understood. Leave the rest to us!
"Mog:That was a close one, kupo..."
"Porom:Are you alright, Mog?"
"Mog:I'm just fine, thanks to you two, kupo!"
Palom:Hehe! Just think where you'd be without us!
"Porom:Quit boasting, will you?"
"Maria:But you two did admirably. If you hadn't been there, we might not have reached Mog in time."
Auron:Indeed. Risking your own life to protect a comrade is no easy feat.
Yang:These two risked their very lives to save us from being crushed by the walls.
Porom:That's right...
"Palom:Well, we couldn't let you guys die like that!"
Maria:How incredible. You two are so courageous.
Auron:The future looks bright for these two...
Porom:Thank you! We'll continue to do our best to help this world.
"Palom:Yeah! We're prodigies, after all!"
Porom:Palom! What did I say about boasting!?
Porom:I'm so glad Angelo's with us! She's such a big help!
Cinque:Yeah! She can sniff out dangerous areas. What a nifty trick!
"Rinoa:Did you hear that, Angelo? Everyone loves you!"
Laguna:Now wait just a minute!
Laguna:My instincts say we should go thataway!
"Cecil:Ah, Laguna's sixth sense at it again..."
"Cinque:Again? But aren't you wrong, like, every time?"
"Laguna:No, no! This time I'm sure of it!"
Laguna:But Angelo's nose is nothing to sneeze at! So why don't we have a vote?
Rinoa:I can already see how this will end...
"Porom:Well, I'm with Angelo!"
"Porom:After all, I can smell monsters from over there!"
"Cinque:Oho, I see, I see!"
"Rinoa:And where there are monsters, there's a Torsion!"
Rinoa:...Wait a second. Did you say you can smell monsters?
Porom:Yes. Let's call it...mage's intuition.
"Laguna:Whoa! Seriously!? That's amazing, Porom!"
"Cinque:If even Cecilski says so, then it must be true!"
Laguna:Alright! Then I'm with Angelo and Porom on this one!
Laguna:Now that you mention it...it really does smell like monsters.
Rinoa:Really? What does it smell like?
Laguna:Hmm... It's sour...or maybe bittersweet...?
"Cinque:Is that true, Poromie?"
Porom:Not even close.
"Porom:If I let him out of my sight for even a second, he's off pulling pranks. He doesn't have any tact, either..."
"Chelinka:If Yuri finds something interesting, he rushes off without thinking..."
"Reynn:My brother hasn't got a care in the world and can't sit still, and he's an idiot on top..."
Porom:Sigh... I guess everyone's got it pretty rough...
Chelinka:We've got to do our best as big sisters!
"Porom:You're right. I guess it's because we're all in the same boat, but I feel closer to both of you than most."
Reynn:Hehe... It must be some sort of destiny to bring us together!
Reynn:I say we start the Big Sister Alliance here and now!
Palom:Grr! All my sister's done since she got here is scold me! I've had enough!
"Yuri:I guess we make them worry a lot, but I wish they would trust us more..."
Lann:Yeah! I won't let her be the boss of me forever!
Palom:Hmm... I guess we've all got it pretty rough...
Palom:We can't let this go on! Today's the day!
Yuri:We'll tell them straight!
Lann:The Little Brother Alliance strikes back!
Palom:Hey! We've got something to say to you!
Palom:So listen up! We always
"Porom:Palom! You drew on monsters again, didn't you!?"
"Chelinka:Yuri, too... What's going to happen if you keep doing dangerous things like that?"
"Yuri:But we're fine... No, um, sorry."
"Reynn:Did you give Mog the message I told you earlier, Lann?"
Lann:Whoops! I totally forgot!
Porom:Good grief. How many times do I have to tell you?
Porom:Go and take care of those monsters right now! They're rampaging all over the place!
"Chelinka:And you're going to help, Yuri."
"Reynn:Lann, go and tell Mog. On the double!"
Chelinka:Phew... It just never ends...
Reynn:Didn't they say they wanted to tell us something? I wonder what it was.
"Porom:...Knowing them, nothing important."
"???:Hellooo? Come in,Class Zero! Anyone?"
???:That's weird... My COMM isn't working. Maybe something's interfering with the signal...
"???:Where did everyone go? If I can still remember them, that means they're at least alive."
???:Magitek armor? But I don't recognize this type. Must be new!
???:...But I don't have time to play with you now. I've got to find the others first!
???:Helloooooo! Ace? King!?
???:Someone? Anyone? Answer me!
"???:Ohhh, how annoying! Stop interfering with my signal!"
???:Now I'm angry! I'll beat you black and blue!
Steiner:...A COMM? What's that?
"King:A ""Crystal Oriented Messaging Medium."""
Cater:It's a communication device... But I guess that doesn't help much. It's basically a magical item.
"Cater:You can use the COMM to talk to your comrades, even if they're far away."
Maria:How convenient!
Steiner:Being able to talk to distant comrades... What a mysterious device.
"King:Unfortunately, we can't use it here."
Maria:That's a pity...
"???:Ahaha! Wait, waaait! We're having so much fun!"
Steiner:Wh-what was that? Is someone fighting around here!?
Maria:That girl over there! Let's go!
Cater:That laugh... It's got to be her.
???:Upsy-daisy! Now crumble!
"Cait Sith:Look, over there! Someone's destroying the magitek armor!"
"Freya:Someone from another world... From the looks of her uniform, she must be one of Ace's schoolmates."
Cait Sith:How impressive. She's swinging that heavy weapon around like it's nothing.
Ashe:Just what kind of magic is she wielding...?
"???:...Hmm? Well, lookie here! People in weird clothing spotted!"
???:Are you their reinforcements? You must be!
Ashe:H-hold it! Don't jump to conclusions!
Cait Sith:We're not your enemies! We just wanna talk.
Cinque:Ace! Seven!
Cinque:I'm so happy to see you! How've you been?
Freya:She's not bothered at all...
"Seven:...And that's the current situation. Did you get that, Cinque?"
"Cinque:Oh, sorry about earlier! I made a big mistake."
"Ashe:You decided we were enemies, even though we'd just met..."
Cinque:I said I'm sorry. It wasn't on purpose.
Ashe:Could you say it like you mean it...?
"Freya:She does not seem to feel any remorse, either..."
"Ace:Sorry, you two. Cinque is just this kind of person."
Cait Sith:It's water under the bridge now.
"Cait Sith:Shouldn't you take it easy, Ashe?"
Ashe:...You're right. People like her won't listen no matter what you say anyway.
"Freya:However...even after finding out she was in a different world, she did not show the slightest hint of surprise."
"Cinque:Hmm? I may not look it, but I swear I'm super shocked!"
Cinque:But I guess I'm just a lot happier to see my classmates!
"Cait Sith:A beautiful friendship, indeed! I'm almost jealous."
Freya:They are very reliable allies.
"Cinque:Of course! We're Class Zero, the cream of the crop!"
"Cinque:And wherever Ace and the others go, Cinque will go too!"
Ashe:Can we really rely on her in a fight...?
Seven:Don't worry about it. You'll see what she's capable of soon enough.
Cinque:I love this new world! Every day is better than the last!
Eiko:You look really happy! How come you like this place so much?
"Cinque:Well, I can do whatever I want with my time now! I don't have any classes or tests here!"
"Zell:Aw, man, I know how you feel, Cinque!"
"Raijin:Same here, ya know!"
"Raijin:But in this world, we don't have to study! There's no homework, ya know!"
"Cinque:That's right! No reports to turn in, either!"
Eiko:Huh? Being a student sounds awful.
"Cinque:You don't go to school, Eiko?"
Eiko:I didn't even know what a school was until coming here. I grew up with moogles.
"Eiko:That's why I'm so jealous of everyone! You can make lots of friends at school, right?"
Cinque:That's right!
"Raijin:If I hadn't attended garden, I would've never met Seifer or Fujin, ya know?"
Zell:You can get a lot more than knowledge at school.
"Quistis:Excuse me, boys and girls!"
Quistis:How long do you intend to keep us waiting?
Serah:Being punctual for a group gathering is important. Try to be more considerate of other people's time.
"Cinque:Yes, maaa'am. We're sorry."
Quistis:I wonder if she really means that...
"Serah:Agreed. The children I can understand. I wish the older ones would be on time, though..."
Zell:...Yup. That brings back memories.
"Raijin:Even outta school, I guess teachers can still get mad at us, ya know..."
Eiko:I see... So this is what it feels like to be a student.
Eiko:I'll work hard to be the best student ever!
"Cinque:Yeah! And with some practice, you can sneak out of all your classes like a pro!"
Eiko:Oooh! So you didn't mean it!
Mog:Just a little further now!
"Mog:Follow me, kupo!"
"Cinque:You're the best, Moglin! I knew we could count on you."
"Mog:K-kupo? What's ""Moglin""?"
"Deuce:Hehe, Cinque is great at giving people nicknames."
"Cinque:That's right! Moglin, Moglin!"
Leon:What an odd way of addressing someone. I simply cannot understand...
"Locke:Have you got a nickname, too, Mog?"
Cinque:Well if it isn't Rinoski and Lockey! You two are looking good!
Rinoa:Hehehe. Of course!
"Locke:I was pretty surprised at first, but you get used to it."
"Mog:I'll try my best, kupo..."
Cinque:Nicknames are a symbol of friendship! They close the gap between people and make you feel warm fuzzies inside!
Cinque:And Cinquey's got so many new friends just waiting to be nicknamed!
"Cinque:Hey! Just where do you think you're going, Leonie?"
Locke:Haha! Did you think you would escape the nickname onslaught?
"Rinoa:Don't be so cold, Leonie!"
"Mog:Hmm... But isn't it a little long, kupo? How about 'Lee'?"
"Cinque:Nice idea, Moglin! Lee it is."
"Deuce:What a wonderful nickname. Lucky you, Lee!"
"Locke:Congrats, Lee. You're officially part of the club now!"
Leon:You guys...
"Mog:You were right, Cinque. I feel even closer to everyone with these nicknames, kupo!"
"Rinoa:It's so much fun, too."
"Cinque:Right? Let's give our other friends super-duper cool nicknames, too!"
Leon:Please leave me out of it...
"Sazh:Man, what a day..."
Barret:You're tellin' me...
"Fang:What's with the long faces, guys?"
"Sazh:See, we were with Cinque and the others in a flower garden earlier..."
Cinque:Wooow! Look at all these pretty flowers!
Selphie:Being in a field of flowers can put a smile on anyone's face!
"Sazh:Flowers or not, aren't you both always smiling anyway?"
"Barret:Hahaha! You said it, man!"
"Barret:What's the matter with you, Cinque? You're staring."
"Cinque:Question! Why do you have a gun for an arm, Barret?"
Barret:Huh? Where did that come from?
"Cinque:Well, I was just thinking your arm would be a whole lot cuter if it were flowers instead!"
"Aerith:Hehe... So you think Barret is cute, too, I see."
"Selphie:Well, there's no time like the present!"
Cinque:Then what are we waiting for?
Barret:S-stop that! Don't pull! It don't work that way! Fine! I'll take it off myself!
Fang:Haha! Sounds like a right disaster you had.
Barret:What are you laughin' at!? I thought they were gonna rip my arm off!
"Fang:So what happened to you, Sazh?"
"Aerith:Whenever I come here, it reminds me of a very special place back home."
Selphie:Where's that?
"Cinque:No kidding! Cinquey wants to grow flowers, too!"
"Sazh:Haha, in this world? Are you going to carry a flowerpot around with you?"
Sazh:...What now?
Cinque:How about we grow some flowers on Sazh's head? Then we wouldn't need a flowerpot!
Aerith:I wonder if that would work.
"Selphie:Well, there's no time like the present!"
Cinque:Then what are we waiting for?
Sazh:L-leave me alone! Don't grow flowers on people's heads!
Sazh:We just can't catch a break...
Barret:Those two are a lot stronger than they look. They're too much to handle.
"Fang:Haha. She doesn't look it, but that Cinque's sharper than she looks."
"Sazh:Don't even joke about it, Fang. I've got enough to deal with as it is."
Prompto:Excuse me! Have you seen a chocobo around here?
Bartz:A chocobo? No. Is it a friend of yours?
"Prompto:Nah. I was taking it out for a ride, but I lost sight of it... I guess it went the other way."
Ace:Did it really come here? It's not safe with all the monsters roaming about.
Prompto:M-monsters!? I better find it quick!
Bartz:We'll help you look. I'm sure an extra pair of eyes or two wouldn't hurt.
Prompto:Are you sure? We just met...
Lightning:Did something happen?
"Bartz:His chocobo ran off, so we volunteered to help him find it."
Prompto:Thanks for your help! I'll be on my way once I find it.
"Lightning:Hold on a second. Chocobo aside, it's impossible to get out of here."
"Lightning:If he's here alone, that means he probably just arrived. Did you tell him he's in a different world?"
Bartz:What!? You mean it might've never arrived? I never thought about that...
"Prompto:Um... What are you guys talking about? I don't have much experience as a hunter, so I don't quite understand all the details, but..."
"Lion:Sorry about that. You might not believe it, but you're in a different world from the one you live in."
Lion:Youand wewere summoned by the gods of this world.
"Prompto:Um... Well that's, uh... Wait, what? No! You're joking, right?"
Lightning:I expected as much... But this is no joke.
Bartz:Yeah. We're all from different worlds.
Prompto:So you're saying I was called here from my home world...by a god? But I'm just an ordinary guy...
"Cloud:Despite what you think, you were chosen. There's no mistaking that."
Lion:One of your friends may be here already. Why don't you come with us?
Lightning:Agreed. There's no point in staying here alone.
Prompto:O-okay... Lead the way.
Cloud:Let's go.
Ace:It would've been nice if you actually came with a chocobo.
"Prompto:Huh? Oh, yeah..."
"Prompto:I hope he's alright, wherever he is."
Bartz:Chocobos are tough. I'm sure he'll be just fine.
"Prompto:Haha, you're right. They're cute, but definitely no pushovers!"
"Prompto:Thanks, you two. What's say we chat about chocobos until we get there?"
Prompto:NOOOCT!
"Noct:Prompto!? You're here, too!?"
"Zidane:A friend of yours, Noct?"
Noct:Yeah. His name is Prompto.
"Prompto:Whoa! You look great, Noct!"
Prompto:And here I was shaking in my boots! I can't believe you're doing just fine.
"Noct:Well I haven't had any problems yet... But if you have any questions about this place, just ask."
Auron:I seem to recall someone who sulked at not having friends from home around... Now who was that?
"Noct:I don't know. You must be imagining things, Auron."
Vincent:So you're close friends. It seems to put him at ease.
"Prompto:I have that effect on people! But I'm happy to see him, too."
"Kain:If you're a friend of Noct's, you must be quite formidable in battle. Can we count on you in a fight?"
Noct:Sure can. He'll be fine.
"Prompto:H-hold on a sec, Noct!"
"Prompto:I mean, I heard what's going on in this world: we were summoned by some gods to fight."
Prompto:But isn't it a little suspicious? Why are you helping them?
Noct:Because they're counting on me.
"Prompto:...That's just like you, isn't it?"
"Prompto:In that case, I can't just run on home, can I?"
"Noct:You couldn't run on home even if you wanted to, so why not lend a hand here?"
"Vincent:If you've got any doubts, it's best to sort those out first."
"Prompto:N-no, I'm fine! If Noct is going to help, I will too!"
Zidane:Are you sure?
Prompto:Yeah. I want to help Noct.
"Kain:You're a kind soul, just like Noct."
Zidane:But aren't we all the same in wanting to help a friend?
"Prompto:Hehe. Well, here's to new friends in a new world!"
Jecht:Alright! This is the last one!
Prompto:Wicked cool! I gotta get this shot...!
"Prompto:Oh, that's right... I don't have it."
Maria:What's the matter? Did you lose something?
"Prompto:No... I was looking for my camera, but I guess I left it back home."
Tifa:Your camera? Why now?
"Jecht:I am pretty cool, aren't I? I can't argue with you there."
Tifa:But in the middle of a fight? Isn't that dangerous?
"Irvine:That's how much he loves taking photos! I have a video camera, so I know how much fun it can be."
"Prompto:You're a video guy, Irvine? Sometimes you just can't control the urge to record something, right?"
Jecht:Sounds like asphere. People were crazy about thoseback home.
Cyan:Art thou perhaps talking about machines?
Prompto:Sorry! I guess cameras don't really exist in your world...
Maria:Are cameras and pictures...fun?
Irvine:Cameras can make instant portraits. Some can even record movement.
"Cyan:That sounds quite convenient. In that case, I had best prepare my finest attire..."
Prompto:Oh! We're not making portraits! I just wanted to make a record of the fight...
Maria:But you can record the moment in your heart. Or is that not enough...?
"Cyan:Indeed. If thou can record those in thy heart, then there's no need to endanger thyself further."
Irvine:It's difficult to explain. I guess the excitement of photography just doesn't come across in words...
"Prompto:But...if you have a picture, then you can show it to other people!"
Maria:Why would you do that?
Prompto:So the people who weren't there can see what you saw. That way you can share your memories.
"Maria:That sounds wonderful! If you can make a moving portrait right away, then you can show people things that can't be described in words!"
"Prompto:Exactly! And not just things like a battle, but everyday things, too."
Cyan:Everyday things... Such as one's family?
"Prompto:Yeah, of course! There are loads of people who keep photos of their children!"
"Cyan:I see... I would like to have one of those, too..."
"Prompto:Well, why don't we take pictures of each other home then?"
"Jecht:But you don't have a camera, do you?"
"Prompto:Oh, you're right!"
Prompto:Guess I'll just have to keep the memories of you folks in my heart!
"Prompto:No matter how many times I see that, I'm always in awe..."
"Terra:Hehe. Is magic rare for you, too?"
Prompto:Yeah! It really feels like we're in a different world when I see it.
Tidus:Haha! I know exactly what you mean!
"Prompto:The guys and I saw so many unreal things on our journey, but I never thought we'd come to another world!"
Shantotto:The universe presents numerous unexpected events.
Shantotto:Or perhaps you're simply ignorant of powers beyond human intellect?
"Prompto:Yeah, but...I never thought it would happen to me. I'm just an ordinary guy!"
"Hope:I was, too. But my life changed in an instant."
Prompto:Wh-what!? No way! I thought everyone here was special.
Hope:I was helpless. I didn't even know how to hold a weapon. I never thought I would have to fight.
"Penelo:Same here. I went with Vaan because I was worried about him, but our journey just kept getting bigger and scarier..."
"Penelo:Even if you lead a normal life or don't know how to fight, you can get swept up in something bigger."
Prompto:I see... So you both had your share of scary moments.
"Tidus:But everyone has their own story. So there's no such thing as being ""ordinary."""
"Penelo:Right. It's like Balthier says. ""I'm the leading man."""
"Tidus:I don't know about Balthier, but you get the point!"
Prompto:Do you think it's all right for that story to be super plain?
Shantotto:By what metric do you decide what's plain? It might be something others wish to attain.
Hope:She's right. Only now I'm realizing how precious those ordinary days were.
Terra:Exactly. Every story is amazing in its own right.
"Terra:So even if you think you're ordinary, you're actually pretty special."
"Prompto:I can't really believe it just yet, but..."
Prompto:It really is special getting to meet all of you here.
Tidus:Oh really? You sure you're not secretly getting tired of us?
Prompto:No way! I'm so glad I'm here!
"Palom:Hey, Prompto! You only attacked to get the monster's attention earlier, didn't you?"
Prompto:Yeah. I thought I would let you land the finishing blow!
"Palom:Haha, you're the best! Let's do it again next time!"
"Prompto:You got it, partner!"
"Laguna:Haha! Prompto, are you one of his henchmen now?"
Palom:Henchmen? Great idea!
"Prompto:For being so small, you sure have confidence and strength, Palom..."
Wakka:You say that because he hasn't pranked you yet. That kid is nothing but a brat!
"Palom:And I'll prank you again if you keep it up, old man!"
Wakka:You're nothing but trouble. Should I call your sister?
"Palom:Boo! You're no fun, Wakka..."
"Prompto:Haha. Well, he does look a little mischievous, but that's made him close to everyone. I was shy when I was that age, so I'm actually kinda jealous."
"Laguna:Oh really? You seem like you could get along with anyone, though."
Prompto:It was just the opposite! I didn't have any friends.
Vaan:How about Noct?
"Prompto:Actually, I worked my butt off because I wanted to be friends with Noct."
"Vivi:I know how you feel, Mr. Prompto. I wanted to be friends with Zidane, so I had to be brave."
Laguna:You admired them. Having people like that around makes you want to try your best.
Wakka:But there are things you can't do well even if you give it your all.
Vaan:Really? Maybe you're just nervous. You need to loosen up a bit.
Laguna:Yeah. I tried to show off how cool I was and it got me nowhere fast...
"Palom:Seriously, Laguna? That's the worst thing you can do!"
Laguna:I know that...
"Palom:But you know, someday I wanna be a sage!"
"Palom:And when I become a sage, people are going to look up to me and wanna be one, too!"
Palom:So I have to be cool. Aren't you guys the same?
Wakka:I get it now...!
Laguna:Right... I think Seifer said he looked up to me or something like that...
Palom:So you guys need to be confident and be cool!
Prompto:But I don't know if anyone will ever want to be like me...
"Palom:But you already changed, didn't you? So it's only a matter of time now!"
"Prompto:Haha. I appreciate it, Palom!"
King:Huh? That guy looks like Alisaie...
Cloud:I doubt it's a coincidence.
"???:Excuse me. I overheard you say the name ""Alisaie""..."
"???:Do you know her, perhaps?"
"Lenna:Yes, we do. Are you her brother?"
"Alphinaud:My apologies. My name is Alphinaud, and I am indeed Alisaie's brother. Is she around here?"
King:Yeah. She's been traveling with us ever since we met.
Lenna:Alisaie went with Y'shtola and the others to scout out the area. Shall we take you to her?
Alphinaud:I would appreciate it.
Alphinaud:...So even Y'shtola is here? What is going on?
Y'shtola:What seems to be the matter?
Cloud:We found one of yours.
Alphinaud:Alisaie! Y'shtola! Are you two alright?
Y'shtola:Master Alphinaud!
"Alphinaud:A-are you alright, Y'shtola?"
King:What do you mean? She looks the same as always.
"Alphinaud:B-but she just called me ""master,"" didn't she...?"
"Alisaie:Come with me, Alphinaud."
"Alphinaud:What is the meaning of this, Alisaie? Is this some sort of joke?"
Alisaie:I understand your confusion. Let me explain what's going on.
Alphinaud:Very well...
Alisaie:Could you give us a moment?
Lenna:Of course. I'm sure you've got a lot to talk about after being reunited.
Cloud:Don't mind us.
Alisaie:Thank you.
Alisaie:You and I are the same.
Alphinaud:The same...?
Alisaie:I'll tell you what I know.
Alphinaud:...I'm listening.
"Yda:You made it, Master Alphinaud! I'm so happy you're alright!"
"Alphinaud:...I see. I heard the tale from Alisaie, but couldn't believe it. It seems to be true, though..."
Yda:Master Alphinaud? What's wrong?
"Papalymo:Give him a moment, Yda."
Papalymo:He's new to this world. He needs time to adjust.
"Papalymo:Welcome, Master Alphinaud. I am glad to see you well."
"Alphinaud:I'm happy to see both you and Yda well, too."
Alphinaud:It's such a relief to see everyone.
Tidus:...I thought you'd be happier to see your friends.
"Krile:Yeah. When I met up with my grandpa, I was so excited!"
Alphinaud:...What!? Do I not look happy?
"Krile:You looked like you wanted to smile, but couldn't. I've seen lots of grown-ups do it before."
"Alphinaud:Grown-ups... I see. I suppose I feel relief at seeing friends, but also uncertainty about the current situation."
Tidus:Doesn't it make you want to scream real loud?
Alphinaud:I'm not very good at expressing my emotions like that.
Tidus:I guess you're more the calmer type.
"Krile:...Or should we call you ""Master Alphinaud"" like the others?"
Alphinaud:There's no need for that.
"Alphinaud:I want to become friends with everyone, without my title. I want to stand on the forefront as equals."
"Alphinaud:Is that clear, Yda? Papalymo?"
"Papalymo:Understood, Alphinaud. Is that...okay?"
"Papalymo:Alisaie wished for the same. Isn't that right, Yda?"
"Yda:Yes! And Alphinaud is a precious comrade to us, too."
Alphinaud:Thank you.
Tidus:...You two sure are alike.
Alphinaud:Alisaie and myself? Of course. We're twins. We were often mistaken for each other as children.
"Krile:Do you also fight with a sword and magic? It doesn't look like you have one, though..."
"Alphinaud:We once studied under the same teacher, but..."
"Alphinaud:Now we walk different paths, despite the circumstances of our birth."
Tidus:Does that mean you don't use a sword?
Alphinaud:Indeed. It's faster if I show you.
"Alphinaud:Come, Obsidian Carbuncle!"
Alphinaud:This is how I fight.
Alphinaud:I see...
Lion:See what?
Alphinaud:I just realized how heartening it is to have such comrades.
Faris:The feeling's mutual. Going it alone out here can be tough.
"Lion:Right. Even if our goals are different, we can still work together."
"Alphinaud:Still, it must be difficult traversing this world with so many people..."
Alphinaud:Do you have an easy way of getting around?
"Sazh:We've got an airship, and a huge one at that."
"Alphinaud:It's a relief knowing there are airships in this world, too."
Thancred:But there are many places you cannot go with an airship. Those we have to walk to.
"Thancred:I'm happy to see you well, Alphinaud."
"Alphinaud:You as well, Thancred."
"Alphinaud:So you proceed by foot then. That requires quite the endurance, especially for children."
Lion:Don't worry about them. The children here refuse to be outdone by the adults.
"Faris:They've all got guts, enough to deserve a ride on my own ship."
"Sazh:Do you think you have it in you, Alphinaud?"
Thancred:Alphinaud needn't worry about such things. He takes the rear and
"Alphinaud:Hold on. The old me may have warranted such worry, but..."
"Alphinaud:I possess even more endurance than you can imagine, Thancred."
Alphinaud:...A lot has happened.
"Lion:In that case, going on foot shouldn't be a problem."
Alphinaud:That's a different issue.
Alphinaud:Walking causes more strain than you can imagine...
Alphinaud:I've got it. I suggest taking the occasional break to avoid exhaustion.
"Sazh:Well, isn't that thoughtful of you?"
Faris:I'm with Alphinaud.
"Lion:Hehe. You're like an adviser, Alphinaud!"
Alphinaud:...An adviser?
"Alphinaud:I do not know if my knowledge and experience are worth anything in this world, but consider me at your service."
"Eiko:You're a summoner too, right? And you brought a wonderful friend!"
Terra:Hmm... But I wonder why I can't hear your carbuncle's voice.
"Alphinaud:So you can both borrow the power of your summons, is that correct?"
Eiko:That's right! And my friends are the best!
Alphinaud:That's good to hear.
"Alphinaud:But like the both of you, I am certain the summoners from other worlds have a history I am unaware of."
Alphinaud:But I am not actually a summoner.
Rydia:Even though you summoned that carbuncle?
"Alphinaud:This carbuncle is a magical entity, an artificially created being."
Terra:A threat? Do they attack people?
"Alphinaud:Yes... Which is why myorganizationtries to stop these ""primals."""
Alphinaud:Carbuncle was made for that purpose.
"Alphinaud:They do not summon primals themselves. They can call upon and use their ""egi,"" or their powers."
Rydia:Primals... Egi... What a different world.
Alphinaud:Hmm... How should I explain this...
"Eiko:You're borrowing carbuncle's power, aren't you? Then you're the same as me!"
"Alphinaud:The fundamentals are vastly different, but when you look at it that way...I suppose we are quite similar."
Rydia:Then we're all borrowing the power of our friends.
Yuna:The world is full of all kinds of summons...
"Yuna:In order to summon inmy world, you need to visit anaeon'stemple first."
Alphinaud:And what do you do there?
Alphinaud:...There are so many things I have yet to learn.
"Alphinaud:That's it...! If you don't mind, could you tell me more about your worlds?"
"Alphinaud:If I know the fundamentals of other worlds, I may be able to further draw out Carbuncle's power."
"Yuna:You're quite studious, aren't you?"
"Terra:In your world, espers were a threat..."
Alphinaud:That's why I don't see the espers in your world as a threat.
Terra:But...espers weren't very common in my world.
"Alphinaud:Even so, I believe in your esper friends. I was able to get where I am now because I believe in my friends."
Terra:...Thank you.
"Alphinaud:Huff, huff..."
Sabin:You okay? It can't be easy keeping up with us...
Alphinaud:I'm fine... Thank you...
Zack:Take it easy. You can lose your footing pretty easy here.
Vaan:He's right. This takes some getting used to. You'll be lucky to get away with just a few scrapes if you fall down here.
Yang:You would do well not to underestimate the challenges of mountain climbing. Take your time.
"Alphinaud:I tried to keep up with the leaders because I didn't want to be a burden, but..."
Alphinaud:I didn't think the others would be falling behind like this.
Alphinaud:You don't try to keep pace with the others?
"Sabin:If I get to the top quickly, I can spend more time training!"
"Yang:A worthy thought, Sabin."
"Vaan:And Mog will call us if there's a battle, so everyone can go at their own pace."
"Zack:I thought this group seemed like fun, so I came along. I'm interested in their training, too."
Sabin:Let's see then... Today we'll move as much as possible with as few breaths as we can manage!
Yang:Breathing and movement are closely connected. Mastering both can increase your defenses and unlock your greatest power.
Zack:No way! This is the real deal! I'm burning up!
Alphinaud:I find it incredible you have so much energy left to spare.
Alphinaud:...I will choose a slower group to climb the mountain with next time.
Vaan:Out of gas?
"Alphinaud:This is more stamina than I've had before. I was confident, but..."
Alphinaud:I realize I was naive to think I could keep up with you folks.
Alphinaud:...The me of the past wouldn't even be able to admit that much.
Alphinaud:Let's go to the summit together. Though I don't think I'll be able to join in your training afterward.
"Zack:Don't push yourself. If you wait a little, the others will catch up."
"Alphinaud:I've made up my mind, so there's no changing it. I'd like to try."
"Alphinaud:Even if they fall, they get right back up..."
Alphinaud:I want to be able to count myself among their ranks.
"Vaan:I don't quite get it, but I think you're doing pretty good."
"Alphinaud:Thank you, Vaan. I hope to be like them someday."
Onion Knight:That looks like the last of them around here.
Aphmau:Oh! You're not Ovjang! I'm sorry.
Onion Knight:Don't worry about it. Are you looking for someone? Maybe we can help.
Papalymo:An automaton...? Isn't that a puppet weapon?
"Papalymo:...I see. If you're looking for them, then that must mean you've lost control of them."
"Aphmau:For other automatons, that might be the case. But not mine."
"Aphmau:They move on their own will. But they won't harm others, so don't be afraid."
Vivi:They're puppets with their own will?
"Vivi:So they have souls, too..."
Warrior of Light:Existences without wills can still have souls...
Papalymo:...Understood. We believe you. Where did you lose sight of them?
"Aphmau:I'm not sure... When I came to, I couldn't hear their voices anymore."
Onion Knight:Do you know which direction you came from? We can go back together.
Vivi:Aht Urhgan... Is that where you live?
Aphmau:You haven't heard of Aht Urhgan?
Aphmau:Just how far from home am I...?
Warrior of Light:You may be the only one familiar with that place.
Papalymo:...Hmm. Perhaps she got separated from her automatons before arriving here.
"Onion Knight:But if she can't remember when they last saw each other, they might be here."
"Onion Knight:And from the looks of it, she hasn't spoken to Materia..."
Aphmau:What's that? Did you figure something out?
"Onion Knight:Well... We need to tell you something that might be a bit hard to believe, but rest assured your automatons are probably fine."
"Aphmau:Since you were nice enough to believe me, I'll listen as best as I can."
"Onion Knight:Great. It's a long story, but..."
Aphmau:W-what!? A different world... Will I ever get back home?
Zidane:We're sorry. Please don't cry...
Snow:Stay calm. Breathe in... Now breathe out and release all your worries.
Aphmau:I left my friends behind... Oh no...
Firion:I understand. It must be hard being separated from those close to you...
"Firion:But there's no need to worry. I was reunited with my friends here, too."
Aphmau:You're right... I'm sure someone will Ah!
Aphmau:What should I do? What if they find out I snuck out in disguise...!?
Aphmau:I need to get back quickly.
"Penelo:We're looking for a way home now. If you come with us, you're sure to get back."
"Aphmau:Everyone? In that case, I'll go with you."
Zidane:When you say you snuck out in disguise...does that mean you're a princess or something?
Aphmau:Me!? N-no... Definitely not...
Zidane:Alright. Sorry for the dumb question. We'll just assume you're an ordinary girl.
"Penelo:...Actually, you're wearing some very pretty clothes, so I thought you were someone of social status."
"Penelo:But if you don't want anyone to know, we won't ask anymore. Everyone has their reasons."
"Aphmau:Really...? I'm happy that people from different worlds are nice, too."
"Firion:Well, it doesn't seem like you would lie to us. And it's not like you're trying to set us up or anything, right?"
Firion:...Hm? What's the matter?
Aphmau:Different worlds...
Aphmau:This is a different world...!
Snow:What's up? You seem happy all of a sudden.
"Aphmau:You don't know who I am, so I can act however I want, right?"
Penelo:What do you mean?
"Aphmau:Normally, I can't be myself. If I don't conduct myself with dignity, I get scolded."
Zidane:So you're just playing a part. There's no need for that here.
Penelo:I see... You can't walk about normally...
Penelo:You don't have to hold back here.
Aphmau:Thank you. I feel so much more at ease!
"Aphmau:Even if I cry, my problems won't be solved..."
"Aphmau:So until I find a way home, I'll enjoy this world to the fullest!"
Snow:That's the spirit! I'm happy you could turn this around.
"Aphmau:It's my friends' advice, so I don't want to prove them wrong."
Aphmau:Wow! You defeated them so quickly! You guys are amazing!
Setzer:Hey... I thought I told you to be careful...
Bartz:What's going on here? Looks like you're all having fun!
Setzer:Don't be ridiculous. We came here to help.
Setzer:This lady carelessly brought monsters along with her.
"Aphmau:I was so curious what was back there, so I just had to check it out!"
"Bartz:A curious kid, I see... I understand. I also want to explore the world."
Bartz:Your elders just need to keep an eye out for you.
"Cater:I know how you feel, too, but next time you should go with someone."
Ramza:Agreed. We must scout ahead and look for danger. Thoughtless actions could put our comrades at risk.
Aphmau:You're right... I'm sorry. I always get scolded for being careless...
"Aphmau:Even though I try to do good, I always end up making a mess of things..."
"Ramza:If you really think so, you should consider your actions more carefully. People scold you because they care."
Aphmau:Because they care... I see. I don't want them to worry.
Bartz:I think it's fine to do whatever you want.
Bartz:There are things that move you down to your core. You shouldn't suppress those feelings.
Setzer:True... I occasionally indulged in dangerous pastimes long ago. You don't look before you leap when you're young.
"Ramza:Not you too, Setzer..."
Aphmau:Hehe. I'm happy it's not just me!
"Ramza:But still, you can't go on your own, especially to dangerous places like these."
"Cater:Well, aren't we overprotective?"
"Ramza:Yes... You two are around the same age, so I'm sorry if I said too much."
"Aphmau:Don't worry about it. Thank you. I can't go making you sad, now can I?"
Aphmau:I'll be sure to invite you guys the next time I go out!
"Cater:There we go! Good going, ""Big Brother""!"
Aphmau:...And that's why Ovjang and Mnejing can speak.
Vanille:It's so amazing that they can talk! I would love to meet them someday!
Prompto:Looks like you guys are having fun! Mind if we join the party?
Yang:These two have puppet friends who move and speak on their own... But I cannot think of them as cute no matter how I try.
"Shantotto:Since you seem interested, allow me to reveal: puppets like hers are common in Vana'diel."
Aphmau:You! Please don't get in our way!
Shantotto:Ohohohoho! There's no need to pick a fight. I just thought I'd shed some light.
"Prompto:So can anyone make puppets like that in your world, Shantotto?"
Shantotto:The technology to produce was originally only for military use.
"Prompto:Military... So I guess not everyone can make them, huh."
"Shantotto:But later that technology became widely known. So with the right knowledge, you could make one of your own."
Prompto:That's great news!
Shantotto:You seem drawn to making automatons.
"Prompto:Well, Vivi and I were talking and thought about making Aphmau's friends if it was possible."
Vivi:We thought you might be lonely without Ovjang and Mnejing.
Prompto:Right! And friends are important! I'll bet Noct was probably super lonely until I got here!
"Shantotto:But I must confess, the ways to make automatons are countless."
Shantotto:You may find your plan unfurled just gathering materials in this world.
Shantotto:You best give up before it ends in dismay.
"Shantotto:And with that, I bid you good day."
"Prompto:D-don't worry about it, Vivi! She never said it was impossible!"
Prompto:She only made it seem really...difficult...
Aphmau:...Thank you.
Prompto:...For what?
"Aphmau:I am sad without my friends, but..."
"Aphmau:Here, I'm surrounded by people who care about me."
Aphmau:So I'm not alone.
Prompto:Then you should thank Vivi! He's the one who came up with the idea.
Aphmau:Vivi... Thank you. I'm happy to have such good friends in this world.
"Vivi:You're not lonely, Miss Aphmau?"
"Aphmau:No, I'm alright. You're my friend, too, aren't you?"
Vivi:O-of course!
"Vanille:Don't forget about me, Aphmau!"
Yang:Friendship is truly a beautiful thing...
"Prompto:Are you fine without being her friend, Yang?"
Yang:I think that is best left to the young. We can watch over them from afar.
"Prompto:I guess you're right... Wait a second. I'm young, too!"
???:And no sign of Aphmau anywhere!
"Ovjang:How can you ask me to be calm? Are you fine without seeing Aphmau, Mnejing!?"
Mnejing:Of course not! But walking around aimlessly like this is..
Kuja:Who are you? ...Puppets?
"Mnejing:And who are you, dressed like that...?"
Kuja:I see... So you're looking for someone named Aphmau.
Kuja:I've seen a girl like the one you described with Zidane and his friends.
Kuja:I'm sure my acquaintance knows her.
Ovjang:I-I see. Could you take us to them?
Kuja:...No. I do not take orders from lowly puppets.
"Kuja:A jest. But knowing you are puppets, I had my reasons."
"Kuja:You too were created by the gods, made to dance upon their stage. In order to change that destiny..."
Kuja:You will become my pawns...
Kuja:Go forth from here and you will find who you seek.
"Ovjang:...You look weird and say some strange things, but you seem like a nice person."
Kuja:...I changed my mind.
"Mnejing:I'm sorry! I'll talk to Ovjang about it myself. Thank you, Kuja!"
"Kuja:...What am I doing, helping puppets?"
Aphmau:Did you guys hear something?
Zidane:There are two little things running this way... Maybe they're those friends of yours.
Aphmau:Ovjang! Mnejing!
Aphmau:I've been looking all over for you! I'm so happy to see you!
Mnejing:We're sorry. We've been wandering around here for ages...
Ovjang:This weird guy named Kuja told us we could find you here!
"Aphmau:I see. I better thank him, then."
Zidane:Kuja helped you guys?
Mnejing:Yes. He seems like a nice man!
Vivi:Kuja... I wonder if he's had a change of heart.
Zidane:I don't know about that... But it seems like he's definitely changed.
Aphmau:Now we can travel around this world together!
"Ovjang:""This world""?"
"Mnejing:What are you saying, Aphmau?"
Aphmau:Hehe. I guess you're right! I've got a lot of explaining to do.
Aphmau:Hmm... Where should I begin?
Zidane:I guess we better get the princess's friends up to date!
Vivi:Right. I hope we can become friends...
"Zidane:I'm sure we will, Vivi. You can start by teaching them all about this place."
"Vivi:N-nice to meet you two! Um, well, this world was made by gods..."
Sherlotta:Where am I?
Sherlotta:I've never seen this forest before.
Sherlotta:Could this be that strange woman's doing...?
Sherlotta:Hmm... What to do...
"Sherlotta:Ooh, sounds like there's someone in here! It'd be nice if it weren't a monster..."
"Vaan:I thought we could get out of here if we kept walking, but..."
Vaan:I guess it's no surprise we keep running into monsters.
Warrior of Light:It can't be helped if they keep blocking our path.
Yuffie:I'm getting sick of this!
Vincent:Would you prefer becoming monster food?
Sherlotta:So I'm not alone after all. This is great!
Sherlotta:I was thrown into this forest and had no idea where to go.
Sherlotta:...What are you guys doing?
Vaan:Umm... Well...
Vaan:We're in the middle of a battle!
"Sherlotta:Well, I can see that."
Sherlotta:I wanted to know what you're doing here.
Yuffie:This is kind of a bad time!
"Vincent:Yuffie, stay focused. This is no time for chitchat."
Yuffie:Chitchat!? I'm totally fighting here!
"Warrior of Light:Our apologies, but could we explain the situation to you later?"
"Vaan:This'll be over in a flash, so go and wait somewhere safe for us!"
Warrior of Light:Is everyone alright?
Vaan:Sorry for the wait. Are you hurt?
Sherlotta:Of course not. I was just watching.
Sherlotta:So could you tell me now? Just what is this place?
Vaan:We've got some people who are better at explaining. Why don't you come to the airship with us?
Sherlotta:Air...ship? What's that?
"Vaan:You don't know what an airship is? Uh, well... You'll understand once you get on."
Sherlotta:O-oh... It's...flying. I'm flying!
Balthier:Are they rare where you come from?
Sherlotta:This is the first time I've seen one! But this isn't what I came here for.
Sherlotta:Where did this technology come from? Just what did you have to sacrifice...?
Balthier:A fine question. I regrettably don't know what drives it.
"Onion Knight:In this world, the power of our wills becomes energy. So maybe the airship is the same."
Sherlotta:Hmm... The power of wills...
"Sherlotta:Well, that sure sounds suspicious! Is this some kind of religious thing...?"
Balthier:An unknown form of power is understandably dubious.
Sherlotta:...But I guess it makes sense. Feelings and wills can give birth to all kinds of power.
Sherlotta:There was someone I watched over for a long time...
Laguna:A love interest?
"Sherlotta:And whenever I thought about that child, I could do anything."
"Sherlotta:My ""feelings"" had that kind of power."
"Laguna:In that case, you need to help us defend this world in order to protect that child."
Sherlotta:But that kiddo's all grown up.
Sherlotta:My help's no longer needed.
Sazh:...Don't say such sad things. Just because someone you want to protect is independent...
"Sazh:It doesn't change the fact that they're important to you, does it?"
"Sazh:That kid may be tough, but even so... It won't change a parent's love."
"Sherlotta:That's true, but..."
Laguna:He's right! You should treasure those feelings.
"Sazh:I've got the same ones, too."
"Sazh:But if you feel the way Jecht does as a parent, then it's hard for your kid to understand..."
Sazh:But you still want to protect them. And you'd give your life to make sure they're safe.
"Laguna:I think you mean ""go back alive"" rather than ""give up your life,"" right?"
Laguna:For the sake of your cute little kid.
"Sazh:Wh-what are you doing, glaring like that?"
Sherlotta:I'm not glaring.
Sherlotta:I was just thinking how serious you can be compared to that hairdo of yours.
Sherlotta:I guess you can't judge a book by its cover.
Sherlotta:...Thank you. I decided to lend you guys a hand.
Sherlotta:You can call me Sherlotta.
"Chelinka:Were you summoned by Materia, too?"
Sherlotta:...Who's Materia?
Layle:A goddess who made this world. You haven't met?
"Sherlotta:Before I met up with you guys, I was lying on my back in front of a crystal. The only person I met was this weird, self-important lady."
Layle:...That's Materia.
Sherlotta:Oho! I didn't know she was a goddess!
Yuri:Did she tell you anything?
Sherlotta:Not really.
"Layle:""Not really""? Didn't you talk about anything?"
"Sherlotta:She just kept talking. She was strange and I had things to do, so I decided to go home."
Yuri:You made it back home all on your own!?
"Sherlotta:Well, as you can see, I'm here and not at home."
Sherlotta:...But I really have to get home. I've got better things to do than this.
Layle:Ha! Materia's summoned a live one this time.
"Sherlotta:...By the way, I've been wondering. Is that a crystal on your face?"
"Layle:If you recognize this, it must mean you have them in your world, too. Can you use crystals?"
Sherlotta:A crystal is something that's part of you.
"Sherlotta:Now that I think about it, after I gave that kiddo the crystal, they were always together."
"Sherlotta:Hm? Is that a crystal, too, Chelinka?"
Yuri:It sure is.
Chelinka:I was born with it.
"Sherlotta:What!? How many other worlds have crystals, too!?"
Sherlotta:But...I see. You all have a responsibility that comes with it.
Sherlotta:That kiddo also had a very important role to play. All those tied to the crystals do...
Chelinka:I can tell this child is very special to you. What were they like?
Sherlotta:Do you want to know? I'm sure you do! There's so much to tell! Get comfortable!
Chelinka:I have a feeling this will take some time...
"Sherlotta:I could tell you everything starting from the baby years, but...there just aren't enough hours in a day!"
"Sherlotta:Don't you have a crystal, Yuri? I can feel the same power coming from you..."
Yuri:I'm borrowing Chelinka's powers.
"Chelinka:Well, not quite... Without Yuri, I can't draw out the crystal's powers very well."
"Sherlotta:Interesting... Now that you mention it, the crystal's power does flow a lot more smoothly when you two are together."
"Sherlotta:Whenever we're together, too, I'm at my best!"
"Layle:You can't help but compete, can you?"
Sherlotta:The crystal... Nevermind. I don't want to talk about this anymore.
Sherlotta:What do we have to do to go back home? Destroy the root of all evil?
"Yuri:Unfortunately, there are lots more roots than you think. First we have to find them before we can destroy them."
"Yuri:It's like Bartz says: if you follow where the wind blows, you'll get to the end eventually."
Sherlotta:But that could take ages. I want to go home sooner than that.
"Sherlotta:I've got a kid to wake up on time, send to bathe, feed properly..."
Sherlotta:I want to make sure everything's okay...
Layle:Haha. Then we'd better get a move on so you can get back sooner.
Yuri:It'll go even faster now with you around!
Sherlotta:But of course.
"Sherlotta:...I didn't think I needed to be so close anymore, but I want to be as much as I can."
Sherlotta:Alright! Thoughts of being together back home will keep me going until I get there!
"Lann:Hey, Sherlotta! Long time no see!"
Sherlotta:Do I...know you?
"Reynn:Don't scare her like that, Lann."
Lann:So you're saying we haven't met!?
Sherlotta:...Are you trying to hit on me?
Bartz:There were people similar to us in Reynn and Lann's world.
"Bartz:It sounds like they met someone like you, too."
"Tifa:I know how you feel, Sherlotta. I was surprised to hear that there's someone like me in another world, too."
"Snow:Well, the more we hear about those people, the more it seems like they're not just similar to us. They are us."
"Sherlotta:If everyone says that, it must be true. It's a little surprising, but...tell me more about this other me."
Reynn:You let us stay at your inn.
Sherlotta:I've never run an inn before. Maybe I'll give it a try when I get back home.
"Reynn:Nothing ever surprised you, plus you were really well-known. It helped us out a lot."
Sherlotta:Sounds like me alright! She must have been wonderful.
Lann:But I was super shocked when I stepped on you.
Sherlotta:You stepped on me...?
Snow:How did that happen? Did she fall in battle?
"Reynn:Actually, Sherlotta"
Sherlotta:Stop right there!
Lann:What? Why!?
Sherlotta:I wouldn't want you spilling any of my little secrets now.
Lann:Uh-oh... She's totally glaring at me.
Lann:I... I'm so sorry!
"Reynn:Please forgive me, too. I almost let it slip!"
Sherlotta:Hehe. I'll forgive you this time.
Sherlotta:...The water's close.
Vanille:How can you tell?
Sherlotta:It's easy-peasy when you're me.
Faris:It doesn't smell like the sea.
Sherlotta:It's not the sea. It's a river.
Vanille:Is it this way?
King:It shouldn't be that easy to locate a river in this terrain. How can you be so sure?
Sherlotta:No reason you kiddos could understand. You're nowhere near as skilled as I am! Hehe.
"Steiner:I should have sufficient experience after all my years, but not even I could locate it."
"Steiner:The waterside is important for supply routes. Please, teach me your ways!"
Vanille:Yes! I would love to learn!
"Sherlotta:You could be a little resentful, you know?"
"King:If you were lying, I might be. But I don't get that feeling from you."
"Krile:Yeah. You may not look much older than me, but..."
"Sherlotta:Alright, that's enough! I have an image to uphold!"
"Sherlotta:I may have kept it a secret, but it's not that tough. I heard it from the animals passing by."
"Sherlotta:Pretty simple, right?"
Vanille:You can understand animals?
"Krile:I can, too! I'm so happy to have more friends like me!"
Steiner:...Though it's nothing I can so easily imitate.
King:Then be glad to have another powerful ally in our ranks. We just need to do what we can.
Sherlotta:Right. There's no need for everyone to be able to do the same things.
"Sherlotta:Besides, you hear some pretty useless things, too. I can't exactly say it's always the most convenient power."
"Krile:Yeah, you're right..."
"Vanille:You must overhear some pretty scary things, too."
Sherlotta:Exactly. Some voices are threatening. But I just threaten them right back!
"Krile:But at those times, you give them a proper talking to, don't you?"
Krile:You're like a kind mother always thinking about her children!
Sherlotta:Wh-what? A...a mother? K-kind...!?
"Krile:It's okay, Sherlotta. I know how sweet you are."
Sherlotta:Stop that... You won't get anything for praising me...
"Sherlotta:Hehe. But it's not a bad feeling. Thank you, Krile."
Sherlotta:I'll keep giving it my all...like a good mother to that kiddo.
The Emperor:Where are you going?
Garland:Have we anywhere else to go but the battlefield?
"Garland:I care not about the will of the gods. You are the same, no?"
Garland:My desire for war is not unlike yours for dominion.
"Garland:In that sense, we are kin."
"The Emperor:A warrior who cares only for the fight...calls me ""kin""?"
Ashe:It looks like we managed to drive back the enemy.
Warrior of Light:They must have been lying in wait to have attacked so suddenly. We can't let our guard down.
Faris:But there's no way we'd be bested in a place like this!
"Mog:Great job, kupo! I feel so at ease with so many friends on our side!"
"Warrior of Light:Indeed. No matter what trials we may face, we can overcome them together."
???:Then overcome this!
Faris:Garland!? You've got some brass launching a surprise attack like that!
Garland:Those who do not tirelessly seek war have no place in this world.
Ashe:What do you mean?
Warrior of Light:Are you still devoting yourself to the cycle of war?
Garland:Of course.
"Garland:It is what I hoped for. If this world was made the same way, then isn't that the answer?"
Faris:What's wrong with this guy?
Garland:Oh?
Warrior of Light:We will use the light gathered here to end your cycle!
Garland:Very well... Then come!
"Ashe:Huff, huff... What a powerful attack..."
"Faris:Are you okay, Ashe? You can pull back if you need to."
"Garland:As I expected. You enjoy this, don't you?"
Ace:Are you guys okay!?
Zidane:Is that Garland!?
Garland:Hahaha! Let us continue the battle!
Ace:Dark manikins...
Zidane:We'll take you on!
Garland:I see... I am not the only one who desires war.
Garland:Our fight is for us. I do not wish for others to get in our way.
Garland:But I had forgotten. When I dedicated myself to the cycle of war...
"Garland:Strangers like these were a part of the cycle, too."
Garland:Take my coordinates.
Mog:Kupo!? You mean you'll work with us!?
Warrior of Light:What is the meaning of this!?
Garland:I yearn for battle.
Garland:It's like he said. We are naught but performers.
Garland:I wish to stage the grandest of battles upon those gods' stage.
Zidane:Don't try to lump yourself in with Kuja!
Garland:It changes nothing. War is the fate from which we cannot escape.
Garland:That's why...I wish you to summon me to your battles.
Garland:And come for my life whenever you wish!
Garland:All war will become mine.
Faris:What just happened here? Why did he give us his coordinates?
Warrior of Light:This is dangerous. I cannot imagine that he truly wishes to cooperate with us.
Zidane:Yeah. Even going so far as to mention Kuja...
Ace:And I highly doubt he wants to be our friend.
Ace:Garland is trapped. The cycle of war is not just his problem.
Ace:People seek strife... War repeats itself...
Ashe:So shall we leave him be...?
Ace:No. That's not what I meant...
"Faris:He means it in a wide sense. Even you should understand, Princess."
"Ashe:Well, when you put it that way..."
Warrior of Light:Everyone shares the fate of fighting. Garland is a mirror that reflects light...
Kuja:How tasteless of you. I have no desire to put you upon my stage.
Garland:Then you must force me down.
Kuja:...Do you truly intend to perform?
Kuja:Then I'll have to find a suitable role for you.
Garland:My only role is that of war. It shall make for a grand spectacle...
Firion:I can't believe that...
Snow:You don't think Garland could've had a change of heart?
Warrior of Light:I can't imagine so.
Cecil:Neither can I see him as a friend.
Firion:But then why would he give us his coordinates?
"Warrior of Light:To put himself in the battle. He wants to make our fight his, too."
Snow:War is...not normal.
"Cecil:If you're uncertain, it's best not to use his coordinates."
Warrior of Light:I continued my fight with Garland in hopes of ending the cycle of war.
Warrior of Light:But there may be some things that cannot be ended with the two of us fighting.
Warrior of Light:Ace said the same. We're also in a cycle of war.
"Snow:A cycle, huh... You might be right."
Snow:But we're different from Garland. We don't want to fight. We have to.
"Snow:There are people that need to be stopped, and we just happen to be the only ones who can do it."
Firion:The reason you take up arms will become your faith.
Firion:I feel that in you. I will fight beside you until you find acceptance.
Cecil:I believe your light will reach Garland someday.
"Warrior of Light:Faith... Yes, thank you."
Warrior of Light:If Garland's actions are heading toward a different end than in the past...
Warrior of Light:We must keep going forward until that time.
Porom:So that Garland guy is our ally now...
"Mog:Even I'm surprised, kupo!"
"Lulu:Though it seems we can't yet call him a friend, nor do we have a united front..."
"Zack:Enemies have fought on our side before, but..."
Hope:I have a hard time believing we have a common interest.
"Zack:Garland wants to battle, right? Maybe he wants to get stronger?"
"Sabin:I would understand if that were the case. To get strong, you need to fight strong opponents."
Hope:Getting strong and seeking out strife are two different things.
"Hope:In war, thoughts and feelings collide, then some get weeded out."
Hope:That goes against our ways.
Sabin:War is definitely different. My brother often struggles in such situations.
Lulu:But conflict without a purpose... That in itself may be a pure sentiment.
"Hope:A ""pure"" sentiment for which things are lost."
Lulu:My apologies. I don't mean to say I agree.
"Lulu:Just that, since we know where to draw the line, we're able to empathize with our opponents."
"Lulu:Because we believe that to be right, even if it means suppressing our own wills."
Porom:Does that mean sticking to your own ideas can hurt others?
Lulu:I wonder. I think sticking to your beliefs is necessary.
"Hope:I'm sorry... I know what you mean, Lulu."
"Zack:Thinking about these things dosn't make it easier, either. In the end, it's hard to know what's best."
"Sabin:If you can't figure it out, move your body! It'll clear your head!"
"Zack:Now we're talkin'! Great idea, Sabin!"
Porom:I get the feeling you just don't want to think...
"Porom:Still, I agree. But let's not go overboard."
Garland:Pathetic!
Vaan:...You really are fighting with us.
Garland:Are you dissatisfied?
Cyan:Though we are supposed to be fighting side by side...
Cyan:I must admit I cannot overcome my fear of thy blade piercing my back.
Garland:Hahaha! Nor should you!
"Garland:I will strike you down the instant your guard falls. We are not friends, after all."
Cyan:Art thou mad!?
"Garland:I should ask you the same, sheathing your swords before me."
Lightning:Do you really think you could win alone?
Garland:Neither victory nor defeat matters to me. Nothing ends in war.
Garland:I would enjoy crossing blades with you in war.
"Vaan:If you want a fight, you'll get one!"
"Zell:Hold it! We defeated the enemy, so let's calm down."
Lightning:Say that to the one who started it.
Cyan:Indeed... We will not be brought down.
Zell:But that doesn't have to be now!
"Garland:Despite trying to foolishly stop the fighting, you do not leave yourself open."
Zell:Getting riled would be playing right into your hands.
"Lightning:That's one way of seeing it, I suppose."
Cyan:I will relent out of respect for Sir Zell.
Garland:How interesting! It seems like there is yet more to be enjoyed!
Zell:Phew... I had no idea what would happen.
Lightning:I guess we had you worried.
Zell:That's fine. I just didn't want to keep fighting.
"Zell:But if you don't want me to be worried, it'd be nice of you to withdraw earlier."
Lightning:I'll try.
Zell:That's good enough for me. Thanks.
Kefka:Those blasted humans... How dare they harm my adorable Blackened Wills!?
Kefka:They'll pay for this! I will have my revenge yet!
"Kefka:Wellllll, if it isn't Madam Sorceress! What brings you here?"
"Kefka:Not that I can help. I'm a bit busy, so if you could kindly BUZZ OFF, I'd be much obliged!"
Ultimecia:Materia's warriors grow stronger by the day.
Ultimecia:It would be unwise of you to attack them head-on again.
"Kefka:You ruin all my fun! Well then, what's your bright idea?"
Ultimecia:Their power stems from will. You need only manipulate that.
Kefka:Yikes! Your face says you're up to no good!
"Leon:Are you alright, Noel? Can you hear that woman's voice again?"
"Noel:You mean Ultimecia? No, not at all..."
Selphie:Seems like she's given up. That's a relief!
Leon:There is nothing for you to fear. We are here for you.
Noel:You're right.
Selphie:A monster! I'll get rid of it on the double!
Selphie:Another one!?
"Selphie:Alrighty! I guess we just need to clean this one up, too!"
Selphie:They sure are persistent... Just how many are there?
Noel:This is weird. It was calm until just a minute ago...
Leon:It appears something is summoning them.
Leon:And this aura... It feels like the Emperor...
Ultimecia:You seem to be in a difficult spot. Allow me to aid you.
Noel:It's you!
Selphie:No way! YOU rescued us!? Why!?
"Leon:If she is not here to fight us, let us get our answers later. We must deal with these enemies first."
Ultimecia:The battle is won.
"Ultimecia:You did well, children of light. You are stronger than before."
Relm:Umm... Thanks for your help?
Relm:But I don't get it. Aren't you that quiet guy's enemy?
Squall:...Why are you helping us?
Ultimecia:I have no intention of fighting you here and now.
Ultimecia:I've been detested since birth as an evil sorceress. I spent my entire life alone and unloved.
Ultimecia:Can you fathom my loneliness?
Balthier:We don't have time for long-winded explanations.
"Ultimecia:...You understand, don't you? Solitude eats away at you..."
"Ultimecia:You found hope in talking to me, did you not?"
Ultimecia:I am the same...
Squall:Don't listen to her.
Ultimecia:You leave me with no choice...
Ultimecia:I cannot imagine you will believe me so easily. Take this.
"Mog:Y-your dimensional coordinates, kupo!?"
Ultimecia:I want you to know the true me...
"Ultimecia:I will lend you my strength, whenever you so desire."
"Relm:The ""true"" her? Is there some kind of misunderstanding?"
Squall:...No. This must be a trap.
Balthier:This is not unprecedented... Let us use what we can.
Balthier:But we should prepare ourselves for when she shows her true colors.
Squall:You don't understand anything!
Balthier:It's natural I don't understand anything of your world.
"Balthier:But I understand that in this world, we can fight side-by-side with our enemies."
"Noel:I know it must be hard for you to hear, but..."
Noel:She really saved us.
Relm:That's for sure.
"Mog:I took it without thinking, kupo..."
Balthier:We just need to get used to it.
Balthier:We had best prepare ourselves for anything that can come our way.
"Balthier:But understand this, Noel: this doesn't mean we support that sorceress."
"Noel:I understand. We're just ""using"" her..."
Rydia:I have to admit...her magic is incredible.
"Zell:Don't be fooled, Rydia! That's just what she wants you to think!"
Rydia:Is it?
Ultimecia:What seems to be the matter over here?
Seifer:Don't play dumb. I know what you're up to.
"Seifer:Ever since you arrived, monsters have been appearing like crazy."
"Zell:That's right! You're just putting on an act, aren't you!?"
"Squall:(Wow, sharp...)"
Ultimecia:...Your accusations are disheartening. I see you do not trust me yet.
Noel:You've saved us. That much I know for sure.
Noel:But I also know that you're an enemy to Squall and his friends...
"Zell:Yeah! I might not remember you at all, but..."
Zell:I know you're up to something!
Seifer:I dedicated myself to being your knight and you betrayed me. There's no way I could ever trust you.
Squall:(...He's right.)
Ultimecia:...I understand.
Ultimecia:But remember this: my heart is always on your side.
Noel:The lonely sorceress... Squall's enemy...
Noel:But she saved me from my own solitude. I don't understand her goal...
Seifer:Hmph. She's trying to trick us.
"Zell:Even though I can't remember her, I feel so annoyed! Just how bad will it be when I actually remember!?"
"Rydia:Calm down, you two."
Squall:(Just what is Ultimecia planning...?)
"Kefka:Welcome back, Madam Sorceress!"
Kefka:I saw it all! From beginning to end!
"Kefka:Getting their sympathy, taking advantage of their kind hearts! You are, indeed, a cunning sorceress!"
Ultimecia:I have no need to be understood by you.
"Kefka:Yes, yes! I get it!"
"Kefka:You'll get them to lower their guard, then hit them where it hurts most!"
Ultimecia:I would have accomplished my goal had they not been there...
"Ultimecia:You and I are different, clown. I did not destroy everything."
"Ultimecia:Nevertheless, the world sees me as evil because of those children..."
"Kefka:Wow, how outrageous! Isn't being despised just the greatest?"
Kefka:You're so full of hate and sadness! You really are scary!
Ultimecia:...But the eyes of that boy who said he believes me...
Ultimecia:Hmph... It's just my imagination.
Lilisette:Hmm... I just don't get it.
Cinque:Thinking about it makes Cinquey's noodle hurt...
Vaan:Hey. What's with the long faces?
Papalymo:We were just mulling over Ultimecia's behavior.
"Fran:We thought she may have some ulterior motive, but nothing has happened yet."
Eiko:I wonder if she really is just lonely.
"Lilisette:Didn't Squall say that she was trying to compress past, present, and future..."
Lilisette:And create a world where only she can exist?
"Lilisette:Not simply traveling through time to change the future, but eliminating all time that should be..."
"Lilisette:Any way you look at it, it's terrible!"
"Cinque:Sounds like a big bad meanie to me! Can she really do that, though?"
Fran:Changing the world changes its principles... Anything is possible.
"Vaan:But that's only in Squall's world, right?"
Vaan:Would it even work if she tried to do that here?
Papalymo:That is precisely what we are discussing.
"Papalymo:Heretofore, her reasons for shadowing us were clear..."
"Papalymo:She planned to use Mog,possessed by the Blackened Will, as a foundation for her time compression."
Cinque:But that evil will's gone bye-bye and Moglin's A-okay now!
Fran:So she no longer has reason to pursue us.
Papalymo:And even less to help us in battle.
"Eiko:But I still don't get why she would say she's lonely, then try to erase everyone else!"
Eiko:Isn't this what they call a...contra...contradiction?
Fran:...One feels loneliness only because of the presence of others.
Eiko:What? Really?
Lilisette:Ahaha! I guess it's hard for a kid like Eiko to understand.
Eiko:Hey! I'm not a kid!
"Vaan:...I was an orphan, too, so I can understand."
"Vaan:When you realize you really are all alone, nothing matters anymore..."
Lilisette:So you mean Ultimecia is getting desperate?
Cinque:That's scary! There's no telling what she'll do next!
Cinque:So? Any idea what might she be up to?
Fran:...We are back to where we started.
"Papalymo:At the very least, we must keep our wits about us."
"Papalymo:I will not say to not sympathize, though..."
Yuna:Here I go!
Garnet:Me too!
Ultimecia:...You both have great skill in magic.
Ultimecia:Continue to devote yourself to magic. I will support you from the shadows...
Wakka:Yuna!
Steiner:My apologies for being so late! Please tell me Ultimecia has not laid a finger on you!
"Garnet:I'm fine, Steiner."
"Lulu:And you, Yuna? Nothing, I hope."
"Yuna:No need to worry. But thank you, Lulu."
Wakka:I can't tell what she's thinking... But there's no need for you to worry.
"Steiner:Exactly! Whatever happens, we will be here to protect you!"
Seifer:...How pathetic. Making a show out of it...
Wakka:What are you talking about?
Seifer:You! Fawning over your masters like a bunch of lapdogs.
Seifer:Like you don't have any will of your own! It's annoying just looking at you!
Wakka:You're just trying to pick a fight now!
"Lulu:I think he's jealous, no longer the sorceress's knight."
Seifer:Shut it! Unless you want me to shut it for you!
"Yuna:Please, stop this."
Steiner:I protect the princess because of her graciousness!
Steiner:Make no mistake: it is not only out of duty as a knight!
"Wakka:Lu and I are the same. Before we were guardians, we were her family."
Lulu:We are just protecting our family... I hope you understand that.
Seifer:Tch... Did I ask you for excuses?
Garnet:Listen to what you're saying...
"Wakka:Then let me ask you, Seifer: why did you become Ultimecia's knight?"
Steiner:Isn't it because you sympathized with her and her feelings?
Seifer:...I don't care about those things.
"Seifer:My dream was to be knight, ever since I was a kid."
Seifer:That's all...
"Wakka:Y'know, since Seifer joined us..."
"Wakka:Wasn't he boasting about being the god's knight, too?"
"Lulu:He is young yet, and full of dreams."
Yuna:There's no chance he'll become her knight again...is there?
"Garnet:For now, let's hope not..."
Spiritus:This is a place of respite.
Spiritus:The goddess Materia and I created this world to give battle-weary warriors rest.
"Spiritus:However, all worlds connected to this one now hang in the balance..."
Spiritus:Because of the planesgorgers.
Spiritus:Of course. It is no exception to the danger that faces all.
Spiritus:Many warriors from other worlds have already been summoned here as a new battle unfolds before us.
Spiritus:You are free to collude with whomever you wish to accomplish your goals.
Spiritus:...Even if they may be Materia's warriors.
"???:You don't care about anything but yourself, do you?"
???:I guess I don't have much of a choice...
"???:I have a lot of things to do back home, so I'll do whatever it takes to get back."
"???:...Even so, I don't know where to begin."
???:Summoned by a god and not given any concrete orders...
Golbez:What are you doing here?
Golbez:...My apologies. It seems I have mistaken you for someone else.
???:Someone else?
Golbez:One of those who don a similar uniform.
???:...That can't be.
Golbez:So you are one of them. In that case
Golbez:You seem troubled...
"???:...I don't know if I could face them now, after what I've done..."
Golbez:It sounds like a complicated situation.
Golbez:It is up to you whether to see them or not. I have no intention of forcing you either way.
???:But if they're really alive...
"???:I want to see them with my own eyes, even if only for just a glance, and apologize...!"
Golbez:Just a glance...
Golbez:...I understand the feeling well.
Shadow:...Someone is following us.
Zell:What!? Seriously!? Where are they!?
Shadow:Come out. I know you're there.
Machina:Ace. Deuce... Is it really you?
Machina:I can't...believe it...
"Deuce:We're so glad you're here, Machina!"
Ace:We were worried about you. But you look unharmed.
Machina:Y-yeah. I'm fine...
Ace:What's the matter? Is something wrong?
Deuce:It's been so long since we've seen each other! The least you could do is smile!
Shadow:So you're a friend of Ace and the others.
Zell:What were you doing sneaking around like that!? There's no need to hide!
Machina:(Could it be...they don't remember?)
"Rem:It is you, isn't it!?"
"Rem:I'm so happy to see you, Machina!"
"Machina:Me, too. Are you okay?"
Rem:I'm fine! Hehe.
Ace:She sure got a completely different reaction than we did...
"Deuce:I guess that's to be expected. Those two are special to each other, after all."
Machina:...I heard all about the situation from the god.
Deuce:That's a relief. Now we can fight together again!
"Ace:Come on, Machina. We'll introduce you to the others."
Machina:I don't...deserve to go with you.
Rem:What are you saying?
"Zell:What do you mean ""deserve""? You're friends, and that's all that matters!"
Deuce:Zell's right. I don't understand why you're so hesitant...
"Rem:Please come with us, Machina. I want you to be by my side."
Machina:Rem... You're right. I promised.
Machina:I'll go with you. I want to help.
"Zell:Was that so hard now? Man, you're weird!"
Shadow:Let's get moving.
Deuce:Yes! Let's go!
"Rem:We can take our time catching up later, Machina."
Machina:They're all...the same as back then...
Machina:I'll protect you this time. I'll atone for everything.
Tidus:...And then the crowd goes wild! It's a blast!
Tidus:You can't beatblitzballwhen it comes to fun inSpira.
King:A giant sphere filled with water...
"Cinque:Wouldn't it be great if we had that in Orience, too?"
"Cater:You have something amazing inyour world, too, right? An...amusement park, was it?"
"Aerith:That's right. They have all sorts of games and rides, and you can take part in a stage show there, too."
Aerith:You can even watch the fireworks from a gondola. It's such a beautiful sight to see.
"Cinque:Ooh, we need an amusement park, too! I never get tired of hearing about it!"
"Cater:I'd love to hang out in all the other worlds! Once the war is over, let's go!"
King:That's not a bad idea...
Cinque:I'm looking forward to it already! We've got to make tons of plans for the future!
"Machina:The future, huh..."
Machina:(But they don't have a... No. I can't say things like that...)
"Cinque:Lookie, lookie, I found a Machy!"
Cater:You must've heard us just now! Is there anywhere you want to go?
Machina:Hmm... Well...
King:You don't need to think so hard about it.
"Machina:Well, I... As long as I'm with you guys, anywhere's fine with me."
Tidus:What? Don't be so indecisive!
Aerith:Of course you'll all go together! But we want to know what you want to do once the fighting's over.
Machina:Uhh... I guess if I had to choose...
Machina:I'd like to go to school with Class Zero again.
Cater:What!? That can't possibly be your dream!
"Cinque:You're so serious, Machy!"
Machina:I'm not serious...
Machina:I'm just being honest.
"Cinque:Are you okay, Machy?"
Cater:A-are you crying? At a time like this!?
Machina:I-I'm not crying! Don't be ridiculous!
Machina:It started raining! I'm going to take shelter over there!
Aerith:But it's not...raining...
King:He's a terrible liar...
"Tidus:He's a little...strange, isn't he?"
"Cinque:He's at a sensitive age, you know! Don't be too hard on him."
Machina:They don't know...about Class Zero's future...
"Machina:But in this world, I can save them..."
"Vaan:So, you two have known each other for a while, huh?"
"Rem:That's right. We were separated when we were young, but we were reunited at Akademeia."
Penelo:Really? What are the chances!?
Machina:I was as surprised as you are.
Machina:Our village was attacked when we were just children. Burned to the ground to contain a disease.
"Machina:We fled together, but got separated along the way. I thought I'd never see her again."
Tifa:That's terrible...to have your home taken like that.
"Rem:When we ran away, he made a promise. Do you remember?"
Rem:He said he was gonna become a great warrior and protect me from all the bad grown-ups.
"Vaan:Ah, so that's why he came here."
Penelo:How heroic! I wish someone would do that for me.
Cloud:What's so funny?
"Tifa:Oh, nothing..."
Penelo:Weren't you two also...?
Tifa:Yeah. We went through a lot as kids.
Cloud:That's in the past. Let's keep it there.
"Penelo:Aw, I'm so jealous! To have a friend you can depend ona friend you've known since forever."
"Penelo:Maybe you should learn a thing or two from Machina and Cloud, Vaan."
"Vaan:You don't have to worry about any of that, Penelo."
"Vaan:Once I'm the world's most famous sky pirate, you'll be the first one I share the wealth with."
"Penelo:Uh, were you even listening...?"
"Machina:Vaan, if you're going to protect someone, you have to be ready to do whatever it takes."
"Machina:If you only focus on being strong, you'll lose sight of what's really important."
Vaan:Uh... Right... Got it.
"Rem:You know... You seem different, Machina."
"Rem:I can't really put my finger on it, but you seem...a little bit more grown up."
Cloud:Something wrong with that?
"Rem:No, not necessarily..."
"Tifa:It's not always easy to talk about the past. Sometimes it makes us...heated. Right, Machina?"
Machina:Yeah...that's it. There's nothing to worry about.
Machina:(I need to be more careful...)
"Machina:Nobody knows anything, do they? Not about my mistakes...not even about their own fates."
"Jecht:Hey kid, come on! What's eating you?"
"Machina:Nothing, don't worry about it. Even if I told you, you wouldn't"
Kain:You remember events that your allies do not. Am I wrong?
Machina:What!? How did you know?
Kain:It was the same for me.
Machina:And Jecht? You too?
"Jecht:Yeah, suppose it was."
"Jecht:Looks like Spiritus summoned you here, just like he did us. I'd wager on it."
"Mog:Many of the warriors summoned by Spiritus still have memories of their old world, kupo! Not so with the warriors summoned by Materia."
Machina:I see...
"Machina:Well, it's reassuring to know I'm not alone."
Kain:Doubtless there are things you remember that you'd prefer to hide from Ace and the others.
"Jecht:You know, I think you're right."
"Jecht:Better not keep it all festering inside. If you need someone to talk to, we're all ears."
"Jecht:You can't remember your own brother? Ah, wait, I heard about your world. That explains it..."
Machina:I was consumed with hatred at Class Zero. I blamed them for his death. I couldn't let it go.
"Machina:I lost sight of everything else... And in the end, because of me, she...she..."
Kain:I see. You have my sympathy.
"Mog:Painful memories create powerful will. That's why Spiritus called you here, kupo..."
Machina:It's better that the others don't have their memories. At least they can smile and laugh like they're back at Akademeia.
Kain:Perhaps that is so.
"Mog:Don't worry, my lips are sealed, kupo. I won't say a single word."
Machina:Thanks. And...sorry to put this on you.
"Jecht:Is that really all you have to say, kid?"
Jecht:Sitting there moping won't fix anything. You have a chancedon't waste it!
Jecht:Are you deaf? I said don't waste it!
"Jecht:You're guilty because you let your friends down, right? Well, now's your chance to do something about it!"
Jecht:Not everyone gets an opportunity like this. Today's your lucky day!
"Kain:For all his bluster, he has a point. We cannot change the past. The future, however..."
"Mog:That's right, kupo! You know what's to come, but that doesn't mean it has to come."
"Machina:The past is set, but the future can still be changed...is that it?"
"Jecht:Ah, you're a clever one!"
"Jecht:If you ever need an ear to bend, just give us a shout! Spiritus's warriors need to have each others' backs!"
"Machina:Thanks, I will."
"???:I was told to lend them my aid, but I have yet to find them..."
"???:""Princess""? Could that be..."
Steiner:Are you alright!?
"Garnet:Yes. I'm fine, Steiner."
Galuf:You are quite the tough princess. You do not easily fall in battle.
Rem:Leave it to me. I'll heal you right up.
"Garnet:Thank you, Rem."
Steiner:You! Identify yourself!
???:You are not Her Highness... Though she should be with you.
Galuf:It seems you mean no harm. Are you looking for one of our allies?
"???:Forgive me for asking, but are you Materia's warriors?"
"Rem:Yes, we are. And you are...?"
"???:You may not believe me, but I am not your enemy."
"Garnet:I can see you're on your guard. But if you really are one of Materia's warriors, we want to believe you."
???:My apologies. I cannot risk mistaking the ones I must protect.
"???:Protectors of the princess, I leave them to you. I will also join the fight."
Galuf:Oh my... It seems we were surrounded whilst in conversation.
???:I will draw this one's attention away. I hope then you will believe me.
Steiner:You mean to fight it alone!?
"???:If I can win your trust this way, then yes. Afterward, please tell me about your other comrades."
???:Lady Ashe. I am relieved to see you unharmed.
"Ashe:As am I to see you, Basch."
Steiner:So you are a knight of Lady Ashe.
"Faris:Something terrible must've happened to you. Your equipment is completely tattered, Mr. Knight."
"Basch:Because of what happened back home, I had to don myself with whatever was available."
"Basch:Besides, a general in shining armor is hardly credible."
Basch:More importantly...it seems Her Highness has been blessed with great allies.
Basch:My apologies for what I said earlier.
Basch:Materia told me about this place...
"Basch:She said there are many warriors hailing from different worlds here, and among them are villains masquerading as allies."
Basch:I had to be sure that you were truly traveling with Lady Ashe.
Steiner:It is natural for a knight to worry over his princess. I would have done the same were I you.
Basch:Thank you. I think we will get along well.
Setzer:I suppose it isn't easy being a knight.
Setzer:Yet another caught up in troublesome politics and conspiracies added to our ranks.
Basch:My apologies...
Setzer:Don't be so serious. We're used to it.
Basch:Haha... So even you can tell how humorless I am.
Steiner:But is it not for the sake of the one you protect?
"Steiner:I could tell you were such a knight from the moment I met you, Sir Basch."
Basch:I am grateful.
"Basch:Allow me to introduce myself properly. Basch fon Ronsenburg, at your service."
"Vaan:Hey, looks like you're alright."
Basch:In a manner of speaking.
Basch:My apologies on taking so long to find you.
Vaan:You don't need to apologize. We were doing fine.
Basch:I'm relieved to see you haven't changed at all.
"Cait Sith:That must mean you're happy to see him, huh, Vaan?"
Vaan:No! I just wasn't sure if he'd show up or not...
Basch:Vaan isn't the sort of man to get lonely.
"Basch:When I first heard about warriors from another world, I wondered what type of people they could be. You're a fearsome bunch."
Basch:I can see why Lady Ashe and Balthier trust you so.
Bartz:We feel the same. They've helped us out a lot.
Bartz:Everyone has things they need to do back in their world.
Bartz:It's only natural we'd help each other out.
"Vanille:Those things aside, though, traveling with everyone is just plain fun!"
"Vanille:What's considered ""common sense"" for one is different for the others. I've learned so much!"
Vaan:I wonder if those things would shock Basch.
"Basch:I'm not sure, so perhaps we should take it slowly."
Basch:But it's like Bartz said... I can't help thinking about the things I must do back home.
"Cait Sith:Vayne is here, too. He also doesn't know how his home world is doing, so why not focus on that instead?"
Basch:I see... He must be scheming something. We need to stop him.
"Basch:Since Her Highness is here as well, it is my duty to protect her."
Vanille:Sounds complicated. But I'll do my best to make sure you get back home safely.
Basch:Thank you. Having such comrades is heartening.
Basch:I know I cannot lose sight of my objective...but I would also like to enjoy this adventure with my new allies.
Vanille:I'm certain you will!
Basch:Good. This will do nicely.
"Serah:Cleaning your weapons, huh? Looks like a lot of work."
"Basch:In battle, life rests on a sword's edge, and only those with a keen blade will fall on the right side of it."
Basch:Victory goes to the prepared more often than not.
"Basch:At least, judging from my own experience."
"Firion:I agree. You have to be ready for anything, or it'll come back to bite you."
"Firion:That being said, it's not easy to keep all of my weapons as sharp as I'd like."
"Basch:If you ever require aid, you only need ask. Your arsenal is impressive, but I know my way around an armory."
"Firion:I might have to take you up on that. I usually try to do it all myself, but sometimes it becomes a bit much..."
"Basch:When it does, consider me at your complete disposal."
"Firion:Thanks. You know, it's good having you around. I can tell you're dependable."
Basch:Is that so? I've never thought that to be among my qualities.
Serah:It's nice to see you two getting along!
"Basch:My offer of aid is open to you as well, Serah."
"Serah:But I do make sure to check up on him, ask how he's doing... I guess that's sort of like maintenance?"
"Basch:Your moogle? I'm familiar with the word, but it seems themooglesin my world are...unlike yours, to say the least."
"Basch:You said it ""transforms."" How exactly does that work?"
"Serah:You know, I'm not sure. You seem pretty good with your handswhy don't you take it apart and see what makes it tick?"
Basch:You will...uh...have to forgive me if I pass on that opportunity.
"Serah:Hehe, gotcha!"
"Serah:But jokes aside, you do know a lot about weapons, right? Does that mean you can use a bow?"
"Basch:To a degree, yes. Mastery is but a matter of practice, after all."
Maria:Practice and time. There's not much you can't do with those two things.
"Firion:Maria would know. She might use a bow here, but that's not all she's good at."
"Maria:If I could get by without wielding a weapon, I'd gladly do so. Alas, we do what we must."
"Cait Sith:You guys really are warriors, huh? Maybe I could stand to learn a thing or two from you all."
"Cait Sith:I'd love to fix up my trusty megaphone, but that's not really an option in this world."
"Cait Sith:You see, it's a bit more complicated than it seems. You need nimble fingers and quick hands to make the most of it."
Basch:At a glance it seems simple enough. May I?
Cait Sith:Be my guest.
Basch:What!? A machine?
"Basch:I am afraid this is beyond my ken. Balthier could make more sense of it, perhaps..."
"Cait Sith:Ah, so you have mechanics in your world too, huh?"
"Cait Sith:I'd ask Cid to take a look, but I'm sure he'd think the task was beneath him. A broken megaphone sounds better than his endless grumbling!"
Basch:I would hate for you to suffer through that on my account.
Serah:Hehe. I just love learning about other worlds!
Basch:......
"Ace:Alright, we're heading out soon."
Celes:Basch? Is something the matter?
"Basch:Ah, no, it is nothing."
Lulu:You seem surprised by your surroundings.
Basch:Surprised? I suppose. I hail from a country surrounded by endless desert. Seeing this...makes me keenly realize how far from home I really am.
Ace:Do you think everyone's doing alright? It can't be easy living under another empire's thumb.
Basch:I can do little at present but hope that my countrymen are safe.
"Cecil:The empire's caused you much suffering, some of it at Vayne's behest. It must be difficult for you to see him again."
"Basch:That it is. However, while the empire is the enemy of Dalmasca, Vayne himself is well-loved by its populace, even trusted."
Basch:I can't deny his skill with wordsa skill which has won men's hearts and set entire armies in motion.
"Celes:Given your circumstances, I'm surprised how calm you sound. He's your enemy, isn't he?"
"Basch:The people of a country may be united under the same flag, but they are still people."
Basch:My aim is to restore Dalmasca to her rightful place. That does not mean I must hate the citizenry of a whole nation.
"Basch:That being said, Vayne had his part to play, and for that he deserves no forgiveness."
Celes:Your brother fights against you?
"Basch:Aye, he does. Although I can hardly say we're on good terms, I don't believe either of us wishes to be enemies."
Basch:I wonder if perhaps we'll be reunited here.
"Lulu:It's possible, but I've heard of no one who might fit his description."
"Basch:I see. Well, I sense our reunion is inevitable, be it here or elsewhere."
"Basch:We have been on opposing sides ever since we parted ways. He is still of the empire, even if we are kin."
Ace:Isn't there any way to compromise?
Basch:We are both alike in that we refuse to make concessions in our beliefs. That will make things difficult.
"Basch:And although we are siblings, there are still those words which do not come easily."
Cecil:I know what you mean. It is a difficult situation to be in.
Cecil:I'm struggling to find the answers myself.
Basch:Blood ties can be a cumbersome thing. More often than not they can feel restricting rather than liberating.
"Basch:Sometimes severing those ties seems like the only way to break free. But in the end, one is always left with a burden. How heavy was the burden I left him?"
"Cecil:Even brothers can't always know what the other is thinking. And even if they do, some gulfs are too wide for even the bonds of family to traverse."
"Basch:I understand that now. There are yet truths I must seek out, truths that I must confront. No matter how much I'd rather look away."
Onion Knight:Is someone there?
Cid:Can't tell if this guy's on our side or not.
"Cid:Hey, say something!"
Deuce:Maybe he doesn't speak our language?
Ashe:Wait. We cannot judge by appearances.
"Ashe:And among any of the races, there were those who were hesitant to speak."
Ashe:Maybe he is lost.
"Ashe:If our words can get through to him, then we should explain the situation."
Onion Knight:...Are you listening?
Freya:Wait. Are you looking for something?
Cid:What!? Did he just ignore us!? Some nerve!
Deuce:But I didn't sense any hostility in him.
Freya:Those were unmistakably the eyes of a knight. I could sense his resolve to protect.
Freya:He will prove a formidable addition should he be our ally. Perhaps someone will know who he is.
Kimahri:......
Cait Sith:Isn't that over there that silent fellow whom we can't tell if he's friend or foe?
Cait Sith:What should we do? Tell the others?
Sazh:Let's try to talk to him first. He might be friendly.
Cait Sith:He doesn't...look friendly...
Jecht:What are you guys gossiping about?
Cait Sith:Jecht! I feel like this is going to get complicated with you here... Or maybe easier?
Jecht:It's you!
Sazh:You know him?
Kimahri:......!?
Cait Sith:He looks surprised. Are you sure you know him?
Jecht:Looking for Yuna? She's with us.
"Sazh:See? Everything's okay. And it seems like he can talk, too."
Kimahri:Kimahri is happy if Yuna is safe.
"Sazh:""Happy""? What're you gonna do then?"
Cait Sith:He's standing on two legs...
Cait Sith:Gee... There are so many different types of folk across the worlds.
"Cait Sith:Now that I think about it, though, I guess Freya and Y'shtola do, too..."
Jecht:Says the fortune-telling machine I ain't never seen the likes of.
Cait Sith:Ahaha! Good point. But I'm custom-made!
Cait Sith:What? Yipes! We've got company!
Kimahri:Kimahri tracking. Protect Yuna.
Auron:Yuna wouldn't let someone fight alone while she escapes.
Kimahri:New world with new enemies. Kimahri not know what will happen.
Auron:You've done well. But now we're here to help.
Jecht:Let's not make this complicated. We just need to bring 'em down!
Sazh:Let's do this!
Cait Sith:A friend of a friend is still a friend! Let's go!
Kimahri:Separated from Yuna. Kimahri at fault.
"Yuna:Don't worry, Kimahri. I'm happy to see you safe."
"Cid:If you're on our side, why didn't you say something when we met!?"
Cid:We wasted a lot of time trying to get a word out of you!
Kimahri:Kimahri know not if friend.
Kimahri:Kimahri is Yuna's guardian.
Cid:Gah! You're too hard-headed for me!
Fang:It makes sense to me. I don't see a problem.
Yuna:Kimahri is just like this...
Yuna:He often gets hurt or worried because of me.
Fang:Sounds like a trustworthy ally.
Firion:Being able to protect what you want until the end isn't an easy thing...
Warrior of Light:Indeed. It takes courage and a strong will.
"Cid:Yeah, well, would it kill him to be a bit more sociable? Bah, but that's all in the past now."
Kimahri:Kimahri protect Yuna.
Kimahri:Kimahri practice sociable if sociable protect Yuna.
Cid:I didn't say that!
"Yuna:Hehe. No matter where Kimahri goes, he never changes."
Firion:You seem like good friends.
Yuna:We've been together since I was little. He's always protected me.
"Fang:Then you're like family. If you're together for so long, I can imagine him getting overprotective."
"Kimahri:Yuna try to do all alone, so Kimahri protect."
"Warrior of Light:He has a will to protect his friends, and he's not the only one."
Warrior of Light:We also wish to do the same. Shall we fight together?
Kimahri:...Kimahri glad Yuna travel with good friends.
Fang:I sure feel at ease having you around.
Kimahri:Protect Yuna. World matters not.
"Tidus:Hey, Kimahri. I see you made it here, too."
Kimahri:...Kimahri does not understand many things.
Kimahri:This world. What gods want. Why Kimahri and others called.
"Tidus:Don't worry about it, Kimahri. We all feel the same, so lighten up."
"Tidus:If you keep thinking so hard, your face will get stuck like that."
Tidus:Come on. You'll make Yuna worry. Did you practice smiling?
Kimahri:Kimahri practice.
Tidus:Then show me what you got.
Tidus:It's still a little stiff. You're going to have to do better than that.
"Palom:Hey, Kimahri! Are you practicing smiling? Sounds weird! Let me see!"
Edge:...Does this mean Tidus and the others come from a world where people don't smile from the heart?
Fujin:PRACTICE. DIFFICULT.
Edge:...Sure looks like it.
Palom:Err... Aren't you all thinking about it too hard?
Shantotto:The little one is right! A smile won't come when thinking with all your might!
Kimahri:Shantotto always think when smile.
Kimahri:But Shantotto's smile is real smile.
Kimahri:Kimahri practice. Learn from Shantotto.
"Shantotto:Hmm... A commendable resolve! Under my tutelage, your smile's sure to evolve!"
"Palom:I'll try, too! Ohohohoho!"
Tidus:Kimahri... Do me a favor and don't laugh like Shantotto.
Kimahri:Kimahri not learn laugh...
Kimahri:Kimahri learn feeling of laugh. Then Kimahri make true smile someday.
Edge:Good. Because I'd hate to hear anyone else laughing like that...
Eiko:Oh no! Your horn is broken!
Kimahri:Kimahri horn broken long time ago.
Kimahri:Broken horn symbol of strong Kimahri.
Eiko:So it doesn't hurt? That's good.
"Eiko:My horn is great, too!"
"Krile:So summoners have horns in other worlds, too?"
Eiko:But Kimahri's not a summoner. I can tell when we fight!
"Krile:You're not a summoner, Kimahri?"
Eiko:Isn't it tough having a broken horn?
"Kimahri:Broken or not broken, Kimahri proud of horn."
"Eiko:I see... Yeah, I get it!"
"Eiko:I'm proud of my horn, too!"
Kimahri:But horn is not Kimahri. Kimahri still proud with no horn.
Kimahri:Kimahri have pride as Ronso.
"Eiko:Yeah. Even though Zidane doesn't have a horn, he's super strong and reliable!"
Kimahri:Friends with horns or no horns...
Kimahri:All have pride and determination. Kimahri think everyone reliable.
"Leon:What is the matter, Locke?"
Locke:I was just thinking about how incredible Kimahri is.
"Leon:Has he inspired you to grow a horn, too?"
Locke:Not quite...
Locke:He said he's proud of his horn...
Krile:But still proud even without it?
Locke:Having pride isn't easy.
"Locke:If that pride is broken, you can lose yourself..."
Leon:...That might be true. You can no longer believe in what you used to believe in...
Locke:That's why I think he's incredible. He had pride in his horn.
Locke:But even though that's been broken...
Krile:He hasn't lost his pride. He keeps believing and fighting...
Locke:Yeah. He didn't lose himself.
Kimahri:Kimahri happy. Friends from other worlds accept Kimahri.
Kimahri:Thank you.
"Chocobo:Kweh! Kweh, kweh!"
Terra:That's a good chocobo.
Firion:Looking at this almost makes me forget we're in the midst of a battle.
"Layle:Playing around is fine, but try not to ruffle their feathers!"
Firion:Wh-what is this trembling!?
"Mog:I've detected powerful magic coming from over there, kupo!"
"Mog:I've got a bad feeling about this! We should go check it out, kupo!"
The Emperor:Insufficient... This simply won't do...
The Emperor:I need more power to see my ambitions through...
Firion:The Emperor!
"The Emperor:Ah, the worms have come crawling."
Layle:Did you just take out some monsters? Weren't they your subordinates?
Terra:Don't tell me you also mean to destroy all life...!?
The Emperor:They have offered their magic energies up to me. A far more significant purpose than meaningless destruction.
The Emperor:It will become a part of my new castle...
Layle:That didn't turn out so wellbefore. And now you're trying to make a new one?
"Layle:I'd almost think you're being vindictive...but really you've just got a lot of time on your hands, huh?"
Firion:Emperor! We won't let you do as you please!
Firion:We'll stop you here! Let's go!
Layle:Leave it to me!
The Emperor:The girl born with magic powers and the man imbued with the power of the crystal...
"Layle:...Quit staring, would you? You're creeping me out..."
The Emperor:I hope you have no qualms with being sacrifices.
Firion:You can't mean...!
"The Emperor:Submit your power to me, you worms!"
The Emperor:Consider it an honor to be a cornerstone of my ambition! Ahahahaha!
The Emperor:You impudent worms...!
"Leon:Give up, Emperor. Your ambitions end here."
The Emperor:Traitors have no right to speak.
The Emperor:Have you forgotten that I was the one to gift you that power?
Leon:Enough! My strength comes from the desire to protect my comrades!
The Emperor:Emotions... How useless.
The Emperor:But it would be hasty for me to give up here.
Maria:What are you saying?
The Emperor:I see now that even worms can be strong when they band together...
The Emperor:So tell me: what is the secret to your power!?
Bartz:Secret? Fighting together.
Ace:Not something you could understand.
The Emperor:It is because I do not understand that I cannot overlook this.
The Emperor:I look forward to seeing you grow into worthy human sacrifices...
Leon:He got away...
Bartz:Just what was he trying to say?
Ace:He called us human sacrifices...most likely to complete his plans.
Ace:What's that?
Maria:Dimensional coordinates!?
Bartz:Did he leave them here!?
Ace:He said he looked forward to seeing us grow... I get it.
Ace:Should we keep it?
Firion:Throw them away. I have less than no desire to cooperate with him.
Maria:Me neither! How horrid!
"Bartz:I understand how you guys feel, but..."
Chocobo:Kweh? Kweh?
Maria:The chocobos...
Bartz:It seems like they're interested in those coordinates.
Bartz:We just can't leave something like that lying around...
Ace:If any harm came to the chocobos...!
Leon:For heaven's sake... Your love for chocobos knows no bounds.
Leon:I suppose we had best pick them up then...
"Firion:L-Leon, are you out of your mind!?"
"Bartz:I understand how you guys feel, Firion, but the chocobos are blameless."
Ace:It's up to us to decide whether or not to call on the Emperor in battle.
Ace:There may come a time when we have no choice...
Leon:...And must we simply accept the conditions.
Maria:How did it come to this...?
Barret:I can't take this...
"Barret:It's fine if he comes to help, but how long is he going to keep calling us ""worms""!?"
"Selphie:It's so weird, right? I guess it's because he really, really looks down on us."
Deuce:Why did he decide to work with us after all this time?
Firion:The Emperor?
Barret:Yeah! I can't stand the jerk!
"Selphie:He keeps saying ""ambition"" this and ""ambition"" that! Just what does he want?"
Firion:To dominate the world.
Maria:He used monsters to conquer our world...
Maria:I think he plans to do the same here. Now there are just more worlds he can invade.
Barret:...That's simple enough.
"Selphie:""The world is mine! Mwahaha!"" A for real, by-the-book villain!"
Deuce:You might call it refreshing...
Leon:But that is what makes him so terrifying.
Leon:He believes that his dominion is the only justice.
Leon:Those who stand in his way are obstacles he has no choice but to destroy.
"Selphie:Ahhh, that's why he calls us worms!"
Deuce:That's what cleared things up for you...?
Leon:He will use whatever means necessary to gain total control...
Barret:So he's like a monster that can speak? Great...
Barret:So? What's got that monster wanting to hang out with us?
Firion:The Emperor judges a person's value by how much he can use them.
Maria:Do you remember when he worked with Seymour?
Selphie:Yes! And he totally betrayed him!
"Firion:The Emperor can't use any of Spiritus's warriors, so they don't have any value to him."
Deuce:I see... That's why he's setting his sights on us.
Firion:Whether he uses us or eliminates us only spells out trouble...
Selphie:Then why don't we just pretend to be super weak in front of him next time?
"Selphie:Then he'll think we're useless, attack us, and we can beat 'im up!"
Barret:I don't think we can do that...
Maria:There is a chance the Emperor will try to trick us in the future.
Leon:So we shouldn't let ourselves be deluded by his words.
Leon:Like...someone before.
"Seifer:Hey, chicken wuss!"
Seifer:You got guts making fun of my dream!
Zell:What are you talking about? I don't remember doing that!
Seifer:Don't play dumb! I'll teach you to make fun of my dream!
"Prishe:Enough, Seifer! Zell's telling the truth! There must be some mistake."
Seifer:Stay out of this! It's none of your business!
Steiner:Graaagh! Lady Prishe!
"Steiner:How dare you slight the princess! I cannot forgive you, even if we are allies!"
Prishe:M-me!? Insult Garnet?
Zidane:What's all the fuss?
"Seifer:Just what we needed, another pest..."
"Zidane:Nice to see you, too, Seifer... So what's going on here?"
Seifer:I was walking in the forest earlier and...
Zell?:You think your dream is romantic? Don't make me laugh!
"Zell?:Only a child would dream of being a goddess's knight! You should be ashamed, Seifer!"
Seifer:...It was definitely his voice!
Zell:I'm telling you: it wasn't me!
Steiner:So it happened to Sir Seifer as well! I was in the forest earlier too when...
Prishe?:Ugh... Garnet's always getting in the way!
Prishe?:Just who does she think she's helping here? She's nothing more than extra baggage!
Prishe:Do you really think I would say something so terrible?
Steiner:You cannot trick me! That was most definitely your voice! I demand you take it back at once! Graaagh!
Zidane:...You two are making a big mistake.
Zidane:We were all together until just now.
Seifer:Wh-what are you talking about!?
"Zidane:You only heard their voices, right? You didn't actually see them."
Prishe:That's right! Lamia can speak with human words.
Zell:So they were probably imitating our voices to stir up trouble.
Zidane:Steiner and Seifer are quick to jump to conclusions.
Zidane:So they make easy targets.
Seifer:Tch... So you mean someone set me up?
Steiner:Why would someone do that? It is a trick in very poor taste...
Prishe:The Emperor!?
Zell:So it was your doing!?
The Emperor:I wished for you to turn your blades on one another until only the strongest survived...
The Emperor:But I see now the limits of a lamia's power. I must reconsider my next move...
Seifer:Damn you!
Steiner:Unforgivable! I will have your head for this!
The Emperor:Hahaha... Hahahahahaha!
"Zell:Man, that guy sure is a pain..."
Prishe:I'm worried about what else he's got up his sleeve...
Cecil:This area appears unaffected. Let us regroup with the others.
Kain:Indeed. My reconnaissance detected no hostile forces.
Kain:Why do you laugh?
Cecil:It's been some time since we've been on a mission together. It reminds me of old times.
"Kain:Cecil, I'd prefer if you forgot those days..."
The Emperor:And why is that? What manner of farce are you so ashamed of?
Cecil:The Emperor!
"Kain:We have not summoned you, so why have you come?"
"The Emperor:...Reveal your true self to me at once, dragoon."
Kain:My true self...?
"The Emperor:You envied and hated that man, did you not?"
"The Emperor:You haven't a single reason to affect friendship now, do you?"
Cecil:What are you talking about...?
The Emperor:Friendship and unity are naught but hypocrisy. His own desire is all that pushes him forward.
Kain:Are you implying there is some other motive behind my actions?
Cecil:What would you know!?
"The Emperor:Haha. You've no need to put on an act. You have no intention of forgiving him, do you?"
"The Emperor:With your sacred power, you no longer have any use for him. You are merely waiting for a chance to punish the traitor."
Cecil:I will abide this no longer!
"Kain:Calm yourself, Cecil! He is trying to provoke you!"
"The Emperor:The traitorous dragoon and the cruel former dark knight. Deep down, your hearts belong to darkness."
The Emperor:I will bestow you both with a befitting place and power! Become my new dark knights!
"Cecil:...Us, dark knights?"
Kain:To think that is where this conversation was headed... How absurd.
Onion Knight:Cecil! Kain!
Palom:I'm gonna get old wait Wait! What is the Emperor doing here!?
Kain:He brought an invitation...for us to be his dark knights.
Palom:What? You and Cecil?
Quistis:You can't be serious...or are you?
The Emperor:Of course. I am extending a benevolent helping hand to these two.
Onion Knight:But didn't you say you didn't need any more helpafter Seymour betrayed you?
The Emperor:I suppose simple worms like yourselves could not understand.
"The Emperor:I have no need for those who question everything. A pawn should move as directed, without a second thought."
Quistis:What a way of thinking... Is this what dictators are like?
Cecil:Emperor! I have no intention of siding with you!
Kain:And I am the same. I will sully the title of dragoon no further. I will not betray my friends again!
"The Emperor:Hmph. Swayed by sentiment, I see. You truly are fools..."
The Emperor:Then you will regret your folly! Haaaaaa...!
Palom:Yikes! Does he really want to fight us!?
Onion Knight:That's fine with me. He's really getting on my nerves.
Quistis:Indeed. Let's teach him a lesson...!
???:So this is a different world fromOrience...
"???:For a place created to give ""respite,"" it looks an awful lot like a battlefield."
???:Huh? Are those...
???:Magic bullets! Are these from Cater's pistol...?
"???:These are Ace's cards! Used in battle, no less."
"???:So they're here, too..."
???:That goddess was telling the truth after all.
"Kefka:Well, well, what do we have here?"
???:Who're you?
???:Cadets? So you know Ace and the others?
"Kefka:Know them? Yes! I absolutely, positively abhor them!"
"Kefka:They're always meddling in my plans! And there're so many of them, babbling on about friendship and bonds! Blargh!"
"Kefka:Andnot too long ago... Why, my poor baby Blackened Wills...!"
Kefka:Ooh! Just thinking about it makes me want to scream!
???:(There's no mistaking it. He's definitely an enemy.)
"Kefka:Which is why you, my fresh-faced foe, will be paying the price for your friends' transgressions!"
"Kefka:If you want to hate someone, hate your dear friends! Prepare for a whooping!"
???:(Let's see if I can't turn this around...)
"???:P-please, don't hurt me!"
Kefka:...Oh? What's this now?
???:I'm unarmed! I'm no threat to you!
Kefka:What's wrong with you!? You're nothing but a coward!
Kefka:How annoying! You've ruined all my fun!
???:So you'll let me go?
Kefka:Puh-leez. Where's the fun in that?
Kefka:There's no way I'm letting you get away so easily!
Kefka:I'm sure there's something we can do...
"Kefka:Oho, I have a great idea! Watch this!"
???:(...What a fool.)
Kefka:Heh heh heh!
Auron:To what do we owe this unexpected visit?
"Kefka:Ladies and gentlemen, today is a special day!"
Kefka:I've come to give you my heartfelt thanks!
Cater:What are you talking about?
"Kefka:Not long ago, you had the audacity of trouncing my Wilburinos!"
Ace:Not this again...
Yang:We will destroy them however many times it takes. When will you learn your lesson?
Kefka:Nobody asked you! Go jump in a lake!
"Kefka:Now then, I have a question for you."
Kefka:Can you still keep that cheeky attitude up after seeing this?
Cater:How did you get captured by Kefka!?
"Eight:Hey, Cater! Looks like you're doing well."
Cater:This isn't the time for casual greetings!
Yang:It appears he is a friend of Ace and the others.
Auron:This is troublesome...
Kefka:Heh heh heh! Feeling helpless yet?
"Kefka:If you value this chump's life, you'll let me beat you up for what you've done!"
"Cater:Kefka, you coward!"
Ace:You fiend...
"Kefka:Oh, thank you! Thank you! What high praise!"
Eight:Alright. I guess I've been in here long enough...
Kefka:Wh-what!? Did you just get out of my prison!?
"Ace:Are you alright, Eight?"
Eight:I'm fine.
Eight:He was nice enough to take me to you guys.
"Kefka:You, you...used me! How dare you!?"
"Eight:Thanks to you, we were reunited. Much obliged, Mr. Kefka, sir!"
Kefka:Damn you! You told me you were unarmed!
Eight:I'm not really unarmed...
Eight:My weapons are...my fists!
Kefka:Why you why you why you little! You're gonna pay for making a dupe out of me!
Eight:Maybe this will teach you to judge your hostages better.
Kefka:Oooh! I've had it with you and your cheek!
Eight:Mission complete!
"King:Good job, Eight. Seems you haven't lost your touch."
"Deuce:I'm happy to see you unharmed, and to fight beside you again."
Zell:Looks like you pack quite the punch!
Sabin:I'm sure you can knock some sense into your enemies with those fists. You must have trained very hard!
Eight:So you're the warriors from other worlds. I heard about you from the goddess.
Relm:I thought you'd be a total weakling because you got captured by that silly clown!
"Eight:Clever plan, wasn't it? I was able to turn the tide in my favor."
"Zell:You managed to stay so calm, even though you just got to this world. It's amazing!"
"King:He's known for his quick wit, even among the other Class Zero students."
"Deuce:No matter what happens on the battlefield, he never loses his cool."
Relm:How awesome!
"Relm:Your fighting style's like the overfed muscle-man and the rowdy punk, but your personality is completely different!"
Zell:Hey! Who're you calling rowdy!?
"Sabin:Hahaha! She has a point. We're more likely to act first, then think later."
"Sabin:All the more reason that martial arts was the right path for me to walk! A perfect match, don't you think?"
"Deuce:Well, when you put it that way..."
"King:Zell, Sabin, Yang, Snow..."
King:There certainly are a lot of hot-blooded martial artists from the other worlds.
"Zell:So why did you decide to become a martial artist, Eight?"
"Relm:I want to know, too! Tell us!"
"Eight:Hmm... Well, if I had to say, it's because of my beliefs."
Sabin:Your beliefs?
Eight:Having a weapon that easily takes the life of others doesn't suit me.
Eight:That's why I want to remember my opponents through the pain in my fists.
Zell:You've got so much passion! Why didn't you say anything sooner?
Sabin:We've been waiting for someone like you!
"Relm:Whoa, they're so moved!"
"Zell:C'mon, let's not wait another second! Let's get to talkingwith our fists!"
Sabin:We'll introduce you to the others and start training right away!
Eight:I like the sound of that.
Deuce:Their personalities are total opposites...
King:But it seems like their hearts understand each other.
"Snow:Alright, alright! Here I go!"
Yang:I won't hold back...!
Eight:I think my fists will get plenty of good training in this world.
Kimahri:Hyah!
Eight:Nice one. I could never hope to put such force behind an attack...
"Cater:Oh, what's that I hear? Is that jealousy in your voice? Sad you aren't as big as our friend here?"
"Eight:...No, that's not it."
"Lann:Now that you mention it, Eight is pretty small compared to King and your other classmates."
Reynn:Hah! Like you have any right to call someone small!
"Cater:Well, he has grown a little since we first met. Just a little..."
"Eight:You've been keeping track, huh?"
"Zidane:Hahaha! Don't take it personally, Eight!"
"Zidane:What Eight and I lack in size, we make up for in speed, right? No need to be ashamed of that."
Reynn:Uh...like what?
Lann:Um... Well...
Lann:Ah! We're cuter!
Cater:Really!? I find that hard to believe!
Zidane:I guess it goes to show you there are all sorts of places out there.
"Kimahri:Kimahri small, so he must train harder than all other Ronso. That is how Kimahri become strong."
Eight:Right. Size isn't everything. Training is where true strength lies.
Eight:Effort is how the wheat is separated from the chaff. And we can prove that.
Zidane:Now you're talking! I like the sound of that!
"Lann:Yeah, we can stand toe-to-toe with the biggest of them! Team Mighty Minis assemble!"
"Reynn:Ugh... Can we go with a different name, please?"
Kimahri:Kimahri joins Mighty Minis too.
"Eight:You're more than welcome. Alright everyone, time to get training!"
"Cater:Ah, looks like everyone's getting along like pigs in a blanket."
"Cater:I'm glad you made some new friends, Eight, hehe..."
"Eight:Phew, I'm glad everyone's okay."
"Seven:You kept a cool head, as always."
"Cinque:You know, it might be fun to see you get in a tizzy every once in a while. Give it a try!"
"Eight:You still only see the bright side of things, huh?"
Deuce:What is it?
Eight:Machina seems...different somehow.
Machina:You...remember me?
Eight:Of course. You transferred to Class 0 at the same time as Rem.
Machina:Anything else?
Eight:Uh...not really. I can't remember much after meeting you.
Machina:I see...
Rem:But even you can tell that he's different somehow.
Ace:He's trying to hide it. He knows something we don't.
Deuce:Not something we don't know... Something we've forgotten.
Eight:What? What do you mean by that?
Rem:Well...all of us were called here by Materia. All of us except Machina.
Seven:And the warriors called here by Materia don't have all of their memories intact.
Eight:What!? Are you serious?
"Cinque:Yeah. We're here to fight, fight, fight!"
Rem:And apparently our memories would only weigh us down.
"Deuce:Yeah, but there is a way to recover our lost memories: by finding brilliance."
Ace:More than a few of our new allies have recovered their memories that way.
"Ace:But they don't always remember good things. We aren't afraid of that, thoughwe're ready for whatever they show us."
Cinque:Even if the memories make us want to cry our eyes out.
"Ace:You should keep that in mind, so you can prepare yourself."
Eight:I understand. Even if our past is full of suffering...
Eight:It was the past we chose. We can't look back on it with regret. We have to face it head-on.
Seven:That's right.
Cinque:Denying who we are would be more sad than anything I can imagine.
Rem:Machina always looks so sad...
Deuce:I can understand why. He must feel so alone right now.
Eight:That's just another reason we can't run from our past. We can't leave him by himself.
Eight:We're classmates. We're a team. We're friends.
Eight:I think we can all agree on that.
"Rem:The ground here is uneven, so we should tread carefully."
"Edge:Don't worry. If you fall, I'll take care of you!"
"Vanille:Monsters! Would you take care of those, too, Edge?"
"Warrior of Light:No, we'll fight it together. Let's go!"
Vanille:Whew! Glad that's over.
Edge:Wait. There's someone there.
Edge:Do you think he's someone's friend? He doesn't look like an enemy...
Gau:You! You bully Gau before!
Vanille:He seems upset at us!
Rem:Were you attacked by our dark manikins?
"Gau:Gau no know you! You, go!"
Vanille:Is he angry?
Rem:Can't we talk this out?
Edge:I wonder. I don't think it's the dark manikins at fault. I think we've invaded his territory.
Rem:Please listen to us! We promise not to harm you.
Vanille:Yes! We want to be friends.
"Gau:Gau, gau!"
Warrior of Light:A peaceful resolution may be out of the question...
Warrior of Light:That was no ordinary attack. We won't escape unharmed at this rate.
Gau:You want fight? Gau is strong!
Warrior of Light:......
Gau:Uwao... Me so hungry...
Galuf:What a rascal. You're gonna be a handful.
"Vanille:Please, listen to us!"
Gau:Gau no lose!
Galuf:Good grief...
Sabin:Are you guys alright? ...Gau!?
Gau:You...Sabin!? Me no fool!
"Gau:You fake! Sabin, fake!"
Sabin:You're calling me a fake!? Are you sure you're not just hungry?
Gau:Dried meat!? Gau! Gau!
Gau:Tasty meat! Me happy!
"Gau:Sabin, real! Gau miss you!"
Sabin:Haha! I'm happy to see you're as lively as ever.
"Warrior of Light:So he's a friend of yours, Sabin?"
Sabin:Yeah. His name is Gau. He's not a bad guy.
"Vanille:He recognizes you as being the real deal, but what about us?"
Vanille:I think he was attacked by our dark manikins and doesn't trust us...
Sabin:I see. That's why he called me a fake.
"Sabin:Gau, these people are our friends. They're not the ones who attacked you. Do you understand?"
Gau:Smell...not same. Gau make mistake.
"Galuf:Ho ho, what an honest child."
Warrior of Light:What is it?
"Gau:Shiny! Shiny, shiny!"
Gau:Gau...?
Gau:Me see you raggedy now.
Gau:But shiny before.
Warrior of Light:What do you mean?
Vanille:Perhaps he noticed something while fighting?
Warrior of Light:Shiny...? Like a light...?
"Gau:You amazing! Gau strong, but you also strong!"
Gau:Gau was surprised. Me think together be fun.
"Warrior of Light:If you're a friend of Sabin, you're a friend of ours."
Gau:Gau! Me go together!
"Onion Knight:Now that I think about it, didn't Gau tell us to leave when we first met?"
Onion Knight:Has this area always been your territory?
Gau:Where is here? Me no know this place.
Edgar:Were you lost?
"Gau:Gau meet Materia, then come here."
"Balthier:Well, that certainly sounds like the goddess."
Balthier:Then what happened? What did Materia say?
Gau:Gau forget!
Edgar:It's no matter. There are a lot of things we don't know.
Edgar:Materia should understand as much...
Edgar:I'm sure she said the same to you as she did to our other comrades: that you can help us fight.
Tidus:We're happy to have you on the team!
Gau:Gau strong! Me help you!
Onion Knight:I'm sure you will.
Tidus:Your intuition in the wild must be something else!
Tidus:You really are...something else...
Gau:You! Get food!
Tidus:Why me!?
"Balthier:I'm rather famished myself. While you're out, could you grab me something fresh as well?"
Tidus:You've got to be kidding me! Is there even anything to eat around here?
"Onion Knight:Alright, that's enough. We've got plenty of food on the ship."
Gau:Food!? Gau!
Balthier:...I hope he doesn't eat it all.
Yuffie:Alright! Recon team in action!
"Kain:""Recon team""? I suppose that means us...?"
Layle:It's hard to get our footing here. Must be why the most nimble of us were chosen.
Kain:Then let us carry out our duty.
"Bartz:No need to be so glum about it! Hey Gau, break through that boulder!"
Gau:Gau! Me won't lose!
"Yuffie:Just one sec! No distractions! This isn't play time, you know!"
Kain:Indeed. We should focus on the task at hand.
"Yuffie:Yeah! I don't know what you guys thought we were doing before, but keep your eyes on the prize."
"Yuffie:The prize being treasure. Treasure which, need I remind you, I've called first dibs on."
Layle:I thought you said no distractions?
Yuffie:And I meant it! Anyways...where to next?
Layle:There's a cliff just up ahead. I can get us down to the bottom.
"Layle:But if there's nothing there, then...I suppose we go back."
Yuffie:And if something is there?
"Layle:That's up to you. Don't venture off too far, though."
"Layle:I'm the one who'll have to watch your back, after all."
"Yuffie:Hey, who do you think you're talking to!? The legendary ninja Yuffie needs no protection!"
"Kain:Whether the cliff be high or low, we'll find our way to the bottom easily enough."
Bartz:You seem pretty confident about that...
Gau:Gau scared...
Kain:Scared? Of what?
"Bartz:Of heights, of course. He's scared of heights! Too bad..."
"Yuffie:Wow, I would've never thought..."
"Gau:Gau scared, but...Gau try!"
Bartz:Wh-what!? But...it looks so high...
Layle:There's no need to do something you're not comfortable with.
"Layle:It might take a bit of effort, but if heights are that difficult for you, then we can look for a way down that doesn't involve jumping."
Gau:Gau! Thank you!
"Gau:But Gau must try! If Gau no try, Gau no learn!"
"Yuffie:You said it, Gau! And you'll have me right by your side at every step!"
"Yuffie:It's settled then! Let's go, Gau! Bartz, you too!"
Bartz:M-me...? Uh...I'll pass.
"Gau:If Gau no fear heights, then Gau get stronger! Bartz should get stronger too!"
"Bartz:R-right! Okay, I'll give it a shot!"
Gau:Gau happy! Let's learn together!
Yuffie:Let's! Now this is the kind of partnership that can lead to great thingsand great treasure!
"Kain:I've no doubt this will be fruitful for you as well, Bartz. Let us see each other through this trial together."
Gau:Thou! Thou!
"Cyan:Thou art in characteristically high spirits, my friend."
Gau:Spirits? Where?
"Steiner:Your spirit, lad. He means to say you're as lively as ever."
Gau:Yes! Gau lively! Mr. Thou has high spirits too!
Quistis:Gau seems to find your way of speaking highly entertaining.
Cyan:As he did when we first met. I don't believe he'll ever tire of it.
Cyan:I can't help but wonder if that's all he remembers about me.
"Yang:Regardless, meeting you seems to have put his mind at ease."
Gau:Gau was lonely. Gau's friends gone.
Steiner:It must have been frightening for you. Luckily you were able to find your allies.
Quistis:It's only natural to be afraid. No one can really prepare for being thrust into an unknown world.
Gau:Was Quistis scared too? Lonely without friends?
Quistis:Hmmm... I wonder.
Gau:Quistis doesn't know? Then Gau ask Squall!
"Quistis:There's no need for that. Okay, I admit it...I was scared."
Gau:Gau happy you find your friends.
"Quistis:Yes, I am as well."
"Cyan:I waited too long before coming to meet thou. I am truly sorry, Gau."
"Gau:Don't worry, Mr. Thou! Gau is happy now!"
Yang:His respect for you is plain to see. A trustworthy friend is an invaluable ally.
"Cyan:We art in agreement there. Gau, thy presence warms my heart."
Gau:Thy! Thy!
Laguna:Whoa! What's going on!?
"Cid:I hope there aren't any numbskulls up on deck! If there are, hold on tight!"
"Laguna:Careful, Cid! Both hands on the wheel!"
Setzer:Don't blame this one on the pilot.
"Cecil:No question, that's the cause there."
Laguna:Where? Is that...a giant Torsion!?
Setzer:It seems someone wants our company. Talk about tacky invitations.
"Cid:Exactly! At this rate, we'll be sucked in!"
"Cid:I can't shake it! If we're gonna be swallowed, it might as well be nose first!"
Cid:I'm takin' her in!
"Laguna:Hey, hey! You can't be serious!"
Cecil:Is this really someone's trap? There aren't even any monsters around...
Setzer:Kam'lanaut... You were waiting for us? Do you enjoy kidnapping people by the airshipful?
"Cid:Airships're full of delicate instruments, y'know! You're paying for anything broken!"
Laguna:Yeah! And I was outside! You almost broke my neck!
"Cid:Aww, you're tough. You can take a bump or two."
"Setzer:Let's not make this any more complicated. Just keep quiet for a bit, please."
"Laguna:Oh, right. It can wait. Let's find out what he wants."
Cecil:Eald'narche isn't with you?
Kam'lanaut:I have come to you to discuss a matter.
"Setzer:""Come"" to us? That's a funny way to put it when you dragged us in like that."
Setzer:I've about had it up to here after what you did to our airship. Care to explain?
Kam'lanaut:I need not answer you. Let us do battle.
Laguna:Well this is going nowhere. Talk about an unreasonable yahoo...
Kam'lanaut:......
"King:...He's still standing, even after all we've thrown at him."
Lion:That just shows how desperate he is.
"Snow:If you're tired, rest up in the back. I'll cover you!"
Sabin:As will I. You won't see me lose in a battle of endurance.
Kam'lanaut:...That's enough.
Snow:What's that?
"Kam'lanaut:Continuing the fight is pointless. As long as there are traces of our fight, there will be no doubts."
Kam'lanaut:Take my coordinates. Use them as you see fit.
King:What was the point of antagonizing us? Was this some sort of charade?
Kam'lanaut:Say whatever you will.
Lion:You made fools of us... We were trying our hardest to defeat you!
"Kam'lanaut:It would have been a problem had you not. If you had gone easy on me, I would have crushed you completely."
Snow:But why do you want to join us?
"Kam'lanaut:How presumptuous. I am simply lending you a hand. I am not ""joining"" you."
King:Then why help us?
Kam'lanaut:To put it simply...
"Kam'lanaut:To discern the intentions of Spiritus and his warriors, I must see things from Materia's side."
King:Spiritus's warriors... Including your brother Eald'narche.
Kam'lanaut:Yes. All of his warriors.
Kam'lanaut:I opened this Torsion with my own hands...
Kam'lanaut:Only those existences I permit may enter.
"Snow:Does that mean you secretly wanted to become our ally? In that case, there was no need to fight."
Kam'lanaut:I suppose such lowly humans wouldn't understand.
Kam'lanaut:People will be suspicious if you emerge unharmed from a Torsion.
King:You don't want Spiritus's other warriors to suspect...
King:No. You want to avoid Eald'narche's suspicion.
Sabin:You really don't trust him? Even though he's your brother?
Kam'lanaut:It is because I trust him that I am being used.
King:So now you want to use us.
Kam'lanaut:Think of it as using each other.
King:And what will Eald'narche think if he saw you fighting beside us?
Kam'lanaut:It matters not. It is enough that I could contact you first.
"Kam'lanaut:If not, it would have been difficult for us to talk."
Kam'lanaut:...That is all. Do as you please.
Lion:We don't trust you.
Kam'lanaut:The feeling is mutual.
"Eald'narche:You failed, didn't you? I expected as much, but useless nevertheless."
Eald'narche:They hardly looked hurt. You should have tried harder.
Kam'lanaut:Choosing who will be of use is not easy.
Eald'narche:No matter. I care not as long as you stay out of my way.
"Kam'lanaut:I have no intention of hindering you. But, in that case, I would like to hear everything from you."
"Kam'lanaut:Why are you working with me, whom you once tossed aside?"
"Eald'narche:Trust in me, my little brother."
Kam'lanaut:...I do.
Lyse:Just taking Kam'lanaut's coordinates isn't easy.
"Lyse:He used our dark manikins for his own purposes, after all..."
"Mog:I know how you feel, kupo. I hate it when people mess with my pompom!"
"Sabin:It's hard to just accept it. You have a connection to him, right, Lion?"
Lion:...He's someone I could never trust.
"Lyse:I don't quite understand, but...if we toss these aside just because we don't understand, we'll never know."
Lyse:This might be our chance.
Lion:Chance to what?
"Lyse:To talk to him, properly. We might be able to learn something from him."
"Lion:Gosh... You're a gutsy one, Lyse..."
"Lyse:I've been around all kinds of people, so I'm sure I've gotten it from them."
"Lyse:You're curious about him, too, aren't you, Sabin?"
Sabin:Yeah... Though I haven't thought it out as far as you.
"Sabin:Kam'lanaut said he believed in Eald'narche, didn't he?"
Lyse:It sounded a bit cynical if you ask me. Maybe it was his way of saying it.
Sabin:I think that's probably right. But I think he truly believed in him before.
"Sabin:He believed in him, but something happened that changed that."
Sabin:I can't imagine what that's like. If I were betrayed by my brother...
"Lyse:Edgar would never do something like that! You know that, right?"
Sabin:Of course. But that's why I feel bad for him...
Sabin:Not that that excuses anything he's done. I'm not clear on it all anyway.
Sabin:And while I have no desire to understand Kefka...
"Sabin:Kam'lanaut's from a different world, and I wonder if we might be able to understand and save him, is all."
"Lyse:What do you think, Lion? You don't need to agree with us. We'll respect your opinion."
Lion:...I just can't think anything good of him.
"Lion:But, like you two said...something happened to him. If we have the chance to talk to him, maybe we can understand each other, and maybe he can change."
Sabin:It would be great if he could.
Shantotto:How naive you are to believe that change comes with such ease! Shall I teach you a simpler way to sway your prey?
Lyse:A simpler way?
"Shantotto:If you wish his change to actualize, a pecking order you should devise."
"Shantotto:I care not what you do, just that he's alive once you're through."
Shantotto:His existence will be of great assistance to my research. Ohohoho!
Sabin:I'm so glad she's on our side...
"Bartz:What's taking so long? Kam'lanaut said he'd handle the monster over there, but I don't see him anywhere."
Edge:He probably found an excuse to get away from us and took it.
"Cyan:Regardless, the hour is late. Perhaps he has already slain the beast and returned."
"Deuce:Or he might be in over his head. In that case, we better help him!"
Edge:Hold on! We don't need to all go!
"Edge:Leave it to me. Don't worry, I won't be long."
Bartz:Will you really be alright alone?
"Cyan:If you require assistance, you know where we are."
"Deuce:Take care, Edge."
Edge:Don't worry about me. Take a nap or something until I get back.
Edge:How far out did he go? Maybe he really did go back already.
Edge:Who's there!?
Edge:Thancred?
Edge:......
Kam'lanaut:Monster hunting provided me the perfect excuse.
"Kam'lanaut:His scent may be faint, but it is unmistakable. My brother is nearby."
Kam'lanaut:It is time to seek him out.
Edge:So this is where he got to.
"Thancred:It appears that whatever he's planning, he wishes to do so without Eald'narche's knowledge. He hasn't done anything nefarious as of yet..."
Edge:You're spying on him?
"Thancred:Well, he did use the dark manikins for his schemes."
"Thancred:Something that doesn't quite inspire trust, wouldn't you agree?"
Edge:Hope you know what you're doing. I'm sure some people wouldn't approve you putting yourself in danger.
Thancred:There isn't always a safe path to take. It would be more dangerous to leave him to his own devices.
"Edge:Even so, we can still be cautious."
"Edge:You have a ninja of unequaled skill by your side, after all. Spying is what I do best."
Thancred:Many thanks.
"Alphinaud:If I may, could I ask your opinions on a certain matter?"
Hope:Of course. What's up?
Alphinaud:I am curious to know everyone's thoughts on Kam'lanaut's motivations.
Cait Sith:It's hard to have any thoughts at the moment. We've only known him for a bit. I think we should wait and see.
"Paine:He can do what he wants. But if he gets in our way, then I'll take him down."
Hope:No way I'd be able to trust him completely. I wouldn't be surprised if he attacked us sooner rather than later.
Ashe:It's useless to try and understand what drives him. We are simply too different.
Alphinaud:It is as I thought... It appears we all view the issue differently.
"Alphinaud:Too differently to say there is any general consensus among us, in fact."
"Alphinaud:Regardless, I believe we can all agree that Kam'lanaut's goals in this world are elusive at best."
"Cait Sith:Well, he's one of Spiritus's warriors. Even if we told him to get lost, we'd only be putting out a fire with gasoline."
Alphinaud:Indeed. 'Twould afford neither us nor him any benefit.
Hope:He's at least putting in an effort to seem like an ally. It's only understandable that he can't cut ties to his old world completely.
"Alphinaud:Of course. However, I cannot shake the feeling that there is something we have overlooked. We must needs take a different perspective on the matter."
"Alphinaud:Dimensional coordinates permit Spiritus's warriors to grasp our strength, but we have no means to gauge theirs. This puts us at a distinct disadvantage."
"Alphinaud:I have pondered how exactly to make up for this shortcoming, but I am afraid our options are somewhat limited."
"Alphinaud:That being said, I have not exactly been treating the matter as urgent."
Paine:And...? So what are you planning?
"Alphinaud:I am of a mind to agree with Lyse, Sabin, and the others who would show a willingness to reconcile our differences."
"Alphinaud:However, we must proceed with caution."
Alphinaud:There is a wealth of experience among usexperience which we can use to our advantage.
"Alphinaud:Should Kam'lanaut and the others act in rashness or violence, we must be prepared to react in kind."
"Alphinaud:And we should prepare now, ere our reservations are justified."
Cait Sith:It's hard to disagree with that. Leave the prep to me. Working in the shadows is what I do best.
Hope:That's not a bad approach. We can be friendly without leaving ourselves open to trickery.
"Ashe:A delicate task, but one I shall help with in any way I can."
"Paine:I know a summoner who might just fit the buddy-buddy bill, too."
"Alphinaud:Thank you, everyone."
Materia:That is correct.
Materia:And I wish for you to fight as one of my warriors.
Ciaran:Fight? But I already have work to do...
Materia:You possess a strong will.
Materia:You held fast to your memories on your long journey. We need that will.
Ciaran:There are lots of strong people out there. Does it have to be me?
Materia:...The crystal guided you to me.
Ciaran:The crystal...?
Materia:A different one from that in your world. It is one that wishes for the warriors' respite.
"Materia:We, the gods, created this world as a land of respite..."
Materia:It was once a place where battle-weary warriors from other worlds could rest.
Materia:I took away their tragic memories to give them peace of mind.
Ciaran:You took away...their memories?
Materia:I once thought depriving them of such painful memories would bring them tranquility.
Materia:But reality was different. They now seek those lost memories.
"Materia:They claim that, no matter how painful those memories are, they are what strengthen their wills."
"Ciaran:...I feel the same way. You were mistaken, Materia."
Materia:I couldn't understand... But I regret what I did.
Ciaran:You can't hold on to all of your memories. Some spill out here and there.
Ciaran:But having them stolen is...sad.
Materia:This world is no longer one of respite. It is being threatened by monsters and those harboring ill will.
"Materia:Please, lend us your strength."
Materia:Your journey has been unlike the others.
Materia:Those experiences will be a new guiding light to my warriors.
Ciaran:Alright. I'll give it my best shot.
"Ciaran:I'm nothing like those heroes that appear in tales, so there might not be much that I can do..."
Ciaran:But this is a journey of hope for the future?
"Ciaran:If that's what they're traveling for, then I hope I can help them."
Mog:Kupo! I sense a new friend over that way!
Ciaran:Hey there!
Ciaran:Thanks for finding me. I thought I was lost.
"Warrior of Light:Are you one of Materia's warriors, too?"
Ciaran:Seems that way.
Ciaran:My name's Ciaran. Materia told me to come here.
"Chelinka:I think you're right, Yuri."
Layle:So we're the same tribe. He doesn't look like a bad guy to me.
Rem:A friend of yours?
Yuri:No. But he might come from a similar world to ours.
Layle:Just like me and these twins here. Our worlds have some tribes in common.
Ciaran:So you're also Clavats. What a relief... I thought I'd be the only one.
"Yuri:Maybe from our past or our future...somewhere in the infinite possibilities, no doubt you're out there somewhere."
"Rem:Just hearing ""Clavats"" is enough to put your mind at ease?"
"Chelinka:As the tribes go, Clavats are said to have very peaceful temperaments."
Yuri:We're often called the tribe of unity and friendship.
"Sazh:No kidding. That apply to you, too?"
Layle:Can't say. I'm just one Clavat.
"Layle:There are plenty of argumentative ones, short-tempered ones..."
"Yuri:Right. Rather than focusing on tribes, it's more important to look at the way we each live our lives."
"Chelinka:There are bad Clavats out there, and lots of kind and warmhearted people from other tribes."
Layle:Exactly. And you can usually tell just by looking if a Clavat is up to no good. And he doesn't look it at all.
"Yuri:If anything, he's got good-guy vibes just gushing outta everywhere!"
"Chelinka:I know what you want to say, Yuri, but pick your words better..."
Warrior of Light:Very well. We believe you. Let us fight together to save the future.
"Ciaran:Oh, um... Gotcha, so it is that kind of journey."
Ciaran:It might be some time until I get the hang of things. I'll take it slow for now.
Sazh:Easy-going fella.
Rem:Hehe. But it's good to have someone like that around.
Warrior of Light:Indeed. I can tell that there is a comforting warmth about you.
Layle:You seem pretty skilled. You must have plenty of experience under your belt.
"Ciaran:I don't know... I've spent some time on the road, but I don't know if that makes me ""skilled."""
"Ciaran:Still, I'll do what I can. It's a pleasure to meet you all."
Yuri:Great! Welcome to the team!
Sazh:I can't believe Materia's dragging more kids into this fight.
Layle:Kid? He's older than me.
"Sazh:Geez, my bad. I thought I could tell, but I guess it's different in other worlds."
"Ciaran:Don't worry about it. There are lots of things I don't understand, either."
"Ciaran:I hope you'll all take your time telling me about yourselves, too."
"Cecil:What did you hear from Materia, Ciaran?"
Ciaran:Why do you ask?
"Cecil:We are warriors that were summoned by Materia, but we no longer move according to her orders."
"Cecil:Her way of thinking and ours are somewhat different, so we want to know what's on her mind."
Ciaran:I heard that you're confronting the memories that you lost.
"Tidus:We forgot a lot of important things, so we're trying to get them back."
Ace:...Those who've forgotten can't even discern what they've lost.
Ashe:...Yes. I...may not have all my memories either.
"Vivi:It's sad to think of forgetting something, so we're taking our memories back little by little."
Ciaran:I see... Hmm...
Ciaran:It seemed like a part of Materia was afraid of you facing your memories.
"Ciaran:She seemed unsure if losing them was a bad thing, or if those painful memories would weigh you down too much."
Ciaran:I think I was chosen because of that.
Vivi:Really? Why?
Ciaran:There were beings in my world who ate memories.
Tidus:Ate memories!? That's terrible...
"Ciaran:...But people eventually forget things, don't they?"
Ciaran:They would feed off of people's fading memories as part of the world's natural cycle.
Ciaran:You can't hold onto every single memory. It's natural to forget things.
Ace:You mean that memories can sometimes be a burden...
Ciaran:One of those beings taught me that memories are like a pack we carry into the future.
"Ciaran:If it becomes too heavy, it can weigh you down."
"Ciaran:If it's too light, your journey will end before you've gained anything."
"Ciaran:A traveler's journey into the future nurtures his or her heart, and becomes a source of new life."
Ashe:Memories can be a burden... I wonder if that is the case for me...
"Cecil:There may come a day when I can also think that way, that it's natural to forget some things..."
"Ace:...We believe that forgetting is a divine blessing. That for everyone else, memories are something they dwell on trying not to forget."
Ciaran:I heard a bit aboutyour worldandyour crystal...
Ciaran:But I can't give you answers. What's right probably depends on the world you're in.
"Ciaran:But if you feel warmth from your memories, I think you should cherish them."
"Ciaran:Even if you forget a lot of things, having warm memories close to your heart is what makes a journey wonderful."
Ace:Warm memories...close to my heart...
"Ace:I see... Even if the future is uncertain, they'll light the way."
"Ciaran:No matter what memories you have, you're on a journey with hope for the future, right?"
Cecil:Right. Without getting caught up in the past...we believe that there is light in the future.
Ciaran:Then what's say we get a move on?
"Ciaran:Even if the light is faint, you'll reach your destination as long as you keep going forward."
"Ciaran:Yeah, but it fell a long time ago. All that's left now are ruins."
Ciaran:What I wouldn't give to see it bustling with people of all different tribes.
"Sherlotta:Ohhh, are you guys talking about your homes? Mind if I butt in?"
Layle:Me too. Sounds like an interesting conversation.
"Ciaran:Of course, the more the merrier. Well...have you guys ever had a striped apple?"
Sherlotta:One of my Lilty friends just loved her tales of glory.
"Layle:And theSelkieare fleet of foot, while theYukehave heads too large for their bodies. I imagine we all have similar stories."
"Ciaran:Haha, you're right. Our worlds really are mirror images of each other, aren't they?"
"Ramza:My apologies, but I cannot help but ask..."
Ramza:Does it not bother you that different worlds share such fundamental similarities?
Ciaran:Huh? What do you mean?
Ciaran:I suppose...a little?
"Layle:Yeah...well, if a Yuke or Lilty were here, they'd be making a fuss about it."
"Sherlotta:""Fuss"" is an understatement. A Yuke would set up a whole institution to study and pore over ancient documents to get to the bottom of it."
"Ramza:You seem to be taking it in stride, all things considered."
Yuri:There is more to the world than what we can see in the present. It's filled with limitless possibilities.
"Ciaran:I mean, if this really were important, then I guess I could come up with a reason to let it bother me..."
"Ciaran:But the differences between the worlds that were born by our journeys don't really matter, do they?"
"Ramza:Perhaps...personally, the sole fact that the worlds share the same name would bother me."
"Vaan:Ciaran is right, though. If you think too hard about something you can't understand, then you'll just end up with a headache."
"Ramza:Of course you would say that, Vaan."
"Mog:It's so hot, kupo!"
Mog:Kupo? What is it?
Bartz:Did you spot something?
"Ciaran:Ah...sorry, it's nothing. That just reminded me of someone from a long time ago."
"Ciaran:He was...sensitive, to say the least."
"Ciaran:When it was hot, he'd say, ""It's so hot, kupo!"" and, ""I'm tired, kupo!"" when we're in a hurry. We might've spent more time resting than moving."
Serah:I guess Mog isn't the only one who likes to complain about the heat.
"Mog:I wasn't complaining, kupo! Just...making an observation!"
"Ciaran:Hah, of course. Anyways, sorry to worry you guys. Sometimes I forget this place is completely different from my home."
"Zidane:It seems plenty of worlds are filled with moogles, huh? What'd you and yours get up to?"
"Ciaran:Right, I guess I forgot to mention the details."
"Serah:So, you needed thesecrystal chalices, was it?for people to go outside? And you carried them with you?"
"Ciaran:Yes. When my friends were up to the task, we would take turns holding the chalice while we traveled."
"Ciaran:But as I said, sometimes I was forced to travel alone. That was when my moogle friend would help carry the chalice."
"Ciaran:Every year we would venture forth, then come back with a chalice full of myrrh. Looking back on it, I really enjoyed those trips."
Squall:You had to go every year?
"Ciaran:Yeah, and I think I've been doing it for, oh, more than ten years now."
Bartz:Ten years! Now that's what I call a quest!
Serah:Even though you had to carry that chalice with you all the time!?
"Ciaran:Well, you get used to it after a while. It stopped being a ""quest"" or a ""journey""it was just something I did."
"Ciaran:Every city had a caravan, and anyone could joinso long as they were young and energetic, that is."
Ciaran:Every year we delved further and further into the miasma...
"Zidane:And all that took more than ten years, huh? You're barely the same person you were when you started."
Ciaran:Maybe. Things don't surprise me as much anymore. Comparing my early diary entries to recent ones makes that clear enough.
"Ciaran:And every time I went out into the world, I'd return with some of my memories gone."
"Ciaran:Still, I grew from the experience. And I picked up a few interesting stories along the way, too."
Squall:(I wonder if I'd be that calm after all that time...)
"Zidane:Slow and steady wins the race, eh? There are as many travelers as there are roads."
"Serah:That's right, and we're all shaped by the roads we take. Ciaran took a long and winding path, and that made him calm and collected."
"Ciaran:I don't know about that, but I do like the sound of it. I'd be glad if I could live up to it."
Edgar:Heh... Even more beautiful today...
Setzer:Quite right...beautiful enough to fly away with.
Steiner:Graaagh! Do not harass Her Highness with your sleazy solicitations!
Steiner:Wheeze... Blast it! A stubborn bunch you are!
"Edgar:You're far too riled up, Steiner. We were merely exchanging pleasantries."
"Garnet:Yes, you worry too much."
"Steiner:No, I think I do not!"
Steiner:It is one of a knight's finest responsibilities to protect the princess from indecent temptations!
"Setzer:""Indecent""? Tell us how you really feel..."
"Steiner:Hrmmm, this world has more philanderers than I can bear!"
Steiner:...What would Beatrix do in a time like this...?
Edgar:Beatrix? Who might this be?
"Steiner:If she were here, too, how my anxieties would be lessened..."
"Garnet:But...if she did come to this world, I wonder...if she would defend us..."
Edgar:Isn't this person a knight in your service? Why should that be in question?
Garnet:We were for a time enemies with her...
"Setzer:...I see. Depending on her memories, there's a chance she'd be turning her sword on us..."
"Edgar:A fault of fealty, eh? Things are never simple for royalty."
"Steiner:If in this world she were being used by villains, why..."
Garnet:I know well the strength of her loyalty.
Garnet:I have faith she wouldn't allow herself to be used that way...
???:I once killed a hundred knights single-handedly. You're hardly a threat!
???:Isn't there anyone who is worthy of facing me in this world?
Onion Knight:Are you alright!?
Bartz:...Huh? Where're the monsters?
Steiner:Wha-wha? Could it be!?
Beatrix:Your Highness! And Steiner!
"Beatrix:Your Highness, it is good to see you safe. I beg your pardon for having left your side."
"Garnet:I am glad to see you well, too."
"Steiner:You need not fear, for the princess has been in my care!"
"Beatrix:Haha... As stalwart as ever, Steiner."
Onion Knight:It doesn't look like you need to worry about her attacking us.
Beatrix:Attack Her Highness? Why would I do such a thing?
"Bartz:We heard you were enemies before, so we were a little unsure."
Beatrix:Is that so...? I suppose that could be.
"Beatrix:Forgive me for not introducing myself. I am Beatrix, a servant of the Kingdom of Alexandria."
"Beatrix:I was summoned here by a god, but upon learning Princess Garnet was here as well"
Beatrix:I made all haste to reunite with her. I am so relieved to have found you...
"Bartz:...So, uh, what happened to those monsters?"
"Steiner:Erm, I do not think it bears asking."
Onion Knight:Did you beat all of them by yourself!?
"Beatrix:Heh, exterminating such beasts couldn't have been simpler."
Steiner:What did I tell you? The continent's finest!
"Beatrix:Even should this be some other world, it is my duty to defend the princess."
"Beatrix:My allegiance to you is as everno, greater than ever before."
Steiner:Well said! Here is a true and honorable knight of Alexandria!
Steiner:Let us do all in our power to keep Her Highness from harm!
"Garnet:Thank you, both of you... I am ever in your care."
"Beatrix:Yes, Your Highness!"
Beatrix:Out of my way...
"Sabin:Talk about skill! Man, am I impressed."
Edgar:Indeed. She is as lovely as a rose itself...
Edgar:But her swordsmanship is second to none in this world.
"Steiner:Hear, hear! Go on!"
Zidane:...What're you so pleased about?
"Zidane:Beatrix beat us black and blue before, too."
Vivi:Y-yeah... She was really strong.
"Vanille:Oh, yeah. You guys were enemies before."
Beatrix:About that...
"Vanille:Ah! I'm sorry! I stepped in it, huh?"
Zidane:All water under the bridge. She had her own business to deal with.
Beatrix:I wonder if it's fair to sum that up as simply business.
"Beatrix:Even to say it was under orders, my deeds cannot be undone..."
"Sabin:I don't know what happened, but it sounds like you regret it."
"Edgar:Your actions were out of loyalty to your country, no?"
"Sabin:And you've since repented and are helping out Zidane and the others, right?"
"Beatrix:I took the lives of many, many people..."
"Beatrix:No matter how I repent, it won't bring them back."
Steiner:...It is as she says.
Steiner:Her past sins will not disappear...
Steiner:But she can atone for them.
"Steiner:I've made many comrades in this world... They've all had their own troubles, and they've conquered them."
Steiner:There is nothing they can do that Beatrix cannot!
Beatrix:Th-thank you.
Vanille:Right. And yesterday's enemy is today's friend and all that.
"Vanille:You've already been a big help to us! Thanks, Beatrix!"
"Beatrix:I should be the one to thank you, for here I can lend you my strength without being ordered to."
Sabin:Feel free to keep doing so!
Beatrix:You can trust in me. I shall defend Her Highness and my comrades unto death.
Beatrix:Princess Garnet.
Beatrix:I've finished patrolling the western front. Nothing to report.
"Garnet:...Thank you, Beatrix."
"Beatrix:You needn't thank me, Your Highness."
Beatrix:I'll continue with the eastern front.
Yuri:Poor Garnet. She looks troubled.
"Bartz:You think so too, huh?"
"Garnet:Wait, Beatrix!"
"Beatrix:Yes, Your Highness?"
Garnet:I'll go with you. I want to help.
Beatrix:Nonsense. It's too dangerous!
Beatrix:We don't know what sort of monsters are lurking out there. Please wait here where it is safe.
Garnet:No. I insist on going with you!
"Beatrix:I am sorry, Your Highness, but..."
Noct:Why can't she go? It shouldn't be a problem if they're together.
Yuri:I think Beatrix can't see Garnet as anything but a princess.
"Bartz:Alright, then it's us to the rescue!"
Beatrix:I cannot in all good conscience let you venture into enemy territory
Bartz:You worry too much.
"Warrior of Light:Indeed. Your blade strikes true, and with it, you can protect her no matter what dangers await."
"Yuri:We've been saved by Garnet's magic plenty of times, too. You can count on her!"
Garnet:Exactly. You can't treat me like a child forever.
"Garnet:I refuse to forever be on the receiving end of help. I wish to give it, too."
"Beatrix:You've grown into a splendid woman, Your Highness. I admire your resolve."
"Beatrix:Very well. Let us go together, then. I am counting on you to watch my back."
"Garnet:As I will count on you to watch mine. Thank you, Beatrix."
Bartz:Do all royals really have to be so fussy?
"Yuri:With certain people, they do. But it's different with us. We're friends."
Bartz:You got a point there. It's help and be helped on the path we walk.
Warrior of Light:Precisely. And we shall not let them walk alone.
"Vaan:Huff, huff... Can't...breathe...!"
Beatrix:Throwing in the towel so soon? You're out of practice.
Firion:You don't leave a single opening one-on-one...
Tidus:I totally believe you killed a hundred knights...
Seifer:You're embarrassing yourselves.
"Vaan:Like you're one to talk. You lost, too."
"Firion:You're certainly a force to be reckoned with. I suppose you've never lost a battle, have you?"
"Beatrix:I have, but just once. To Steiner."
Beatrix:Is it really so shocking? Steiner is stronger than he looks.
"Vaan:I know that, but...I never imagined you losing to him."
"Beatrix:We had a contest before the lord, and he was the victor."
"Beatrix:He claimed it as merely a fluke, but there is no such thing in battle."
Beatrix:That crushing defeat fueled me to become better.
Firion:So you dedicated yourself to your training.
"Beatrix:If you wish to grow strong, find a good rival and hone your skills against each other."
Seifer:Hmph. Big words for such a little lady.
"Tidus:By the way, Seifer, have you fought Squall before?"
Firion:Good question. I'd like to know what someone with a real rival thinks.
Seifer:You think he's worthy of being my rival? Don't make me laugh.
Seifer:We aren't even on the same level. I'm just toying with him.
"Vaan:He never changes, does he?"
Tidus:Are you hoping for another duel with Steiner someday?
"Beatrix:To be frank, I do indeed."
"Beatrix:But we're working together to protect Princess Garnet, so there's no point in settling the score now. And..."
Vaan:And what?
"Beatrix:We never show the other mercy, and Princess Garnet would be the one to suffer should anything happen to either of us."
Tidus:No mercy? Even against us?
"Firion:That means she sees us on equal footing. Alright, I'm ready for another round!"
Cecil:So the Crystal Core of Darkness went out of control and Spiritus's warriors tried to take advantage of that power...
Rinoa:It's all so confusing. How do we stop it?
"Bartz:I think even the gods are at a loss here, so I don't know what we can do..."
"Sazh:Hey, Vaan! What're you doing? The ship's gonna capsize at this rate!"
Vaan:The rudder's not working! Maybe the ship's broken?
Rinoa:Whoa! Isn't this...bad?
"Bartz:Hold on tight, everyone!"
Cecil:...It's no good! We can't hold on like this!
Rinoa:Owiee...! Is everyone okay?
Bartz:I think so...
Sazh:Damn... Look at this mess. I guess it's still too early to let Vaan drive.
Vaan:I told you it wasn't me! It was the rudder!
Bartz:Yeah?
Cecil:Does this forest...look familiar to you?
"Bartz:Familiar? Any way you look at it, it's just your average"
"Bartz:No, wait a second..."
Exdeath:This is a space distorted by the Torsions.
Exdeath:It was all too easy to trap you worthless fools here!
Vaan:See! It wasn't my fault!
"Sazh:We get it. We're sorry. But could you save the celebration for later, Vaan?"
Rinoa:So why did you lure us in here?
Exdeath:...What a foolish question.
Exdeath:Isn't it obvious? I will banish you peons together with this space!
Cecil:Like you did with my brother!?
Bartz:And you really think we're just gonna sit back and let you do whatever you want!?
Exdeath:It is time you felt the power of the Void once more.
Exdeath:Consider it a reward for hindering my ingenious plan!
Exdeath:Urg... The power of your wills is so great...
Yuffie:What the!? How creepy! He just started laughing for no reason!
"Faris:Don't let your guard down, Yuffie! I'd wager he's got somethin' up his sleeve!"
"Exdeath:My plan ended in failure, thanks to you. However..."
Exdeath:The power of wills and the Void may just be enough to see my ambition to fruition!
Lenna:What are you saying...?
"Exdeath:Must I spell it out for you, fool? I am saying it may be worth my while to join your ranks."
"Exdeath:...If you can escape from this place, that is."
Vincent:This space is no longer stable... We need to get out before we're imprisoned in here.
Yuffie:Wha-wha-what!? Hold on! Where's the exit!?
"Vincent:Calm down, Yuffie. Can you do it, Mog?"
"Mog:Leave it to me, kupo!"
"Mog:Uh oh, kupo... Something is interfering with my power, so I can't get us out of here."
Vincent:Interference...? This can't be a coincidence.
Lenna:Oh no... Is this the end for us?
Faris:There's no way we're kicking the bucket here! We'll just have to find an exit ourselves!
"Gilgamesh:Ha ha! Guess who it is, just in time to save the day!"
"Gilgamesh:We'll get out of here, even if I pry open an exit myself! Come on! RAAAAAAH!"
"Mog:This is crazy, kupo. It's ignoring all the laws and rules of the world!"
Gilgamesh:Rules were made to be broken!
"Yuffie:Whoa! You're so cool, Gilgamesh!"
"Gilgamesh:Thank me later! For now, we need to make like lightning and bolt!"
Bartz:Whew. That was a close call...
"Faris:We owe you one, Gilgamesh!"
Gilgamesh:Ha ha! Think nothing of it or my dramatically impeccable timing. The hero is always the last on the scene!
"Vincent:But just what was Exdeath's aim, I wonder."
Yuffie:I wish he would at least have a reason for attacking us! ...Oh?
"Yuffie:Lookie, lookie, Vincent! A treasure chest!"
Vincent:...That is most definitely a trap.
Faris:He's right. Treasure's got no right being here so conveniently!
Vincent:Don't waste your breath on her.
Yuffie:Huh!? This is...!
Bartz:...Dimensional coordinates.
"Faris:But who...? You know, forget I asked."
Yuffie:No way! This treasure was a total bust!
Vincent:I wonder how far he plans on following us.
Lenna:But isn't it strange? He tried to banish us to the Void not long ago.
Bartz:Perhaps either would've worked fine for that lunatic.
Gilgamesh:I'll just pick this up then!
"Yuffie:Are you serious, Gilgamesh!?"
Gilgamesh:Aren't I always? Think about it carefully!
Gilgamesh:Exdeath is a spooky phantom. You never know when he's going to appear!
"Gilgamesh:But if you have these coordinates, he won't be able to catch you unaware anymore."
Faris:I suppose it does have some merit...
"Gilgamesh:But even I, the great Gilgamesh, won't be able to stop him alone."
"Gilgamesh:If we're all together, though, I'm sure it will work out. We can use this against him."
Vincent:Balthier always says the same...
Yuffie:Though I prefer the direct approach! It's a lot easier!
"Gilgamesh:Ha ha, how unexpected of a ninja! Well, it sounds like we're all in agreement, so I'll take a look into his movements."
Gilgamesh:And don't forget: I'm your friend forever! You can always trust in me! Hasta la bye bye!
Yuffie:Is that guy a double agent...?
Lenna:Let's put our faith in him for now...
"Bartz:Right... He did save us, after all."
Vivi:Err...
Eiko:Hey. What's the matter?
Vivi:Well...my back is stinging...
"Eiko:That's all? Come on, Vivi. You've handled worse!"
Irvine:So he's the incarnation of the evil souls sealed inside a tree? What a pain in the butt that Exdeath is...
"Krile:Back inour world, he had the power of theVoidand tried to erase all existence with it."
Krile:His goal must be the same here. He's not someone you can reason with...
Irvine:So that's why he's looking for some great power in place of the Void?
Tidus:Can't he just keep his crazy ideals to himself?
Irvine:Agreed! Trying to erase everything is just nonsense.
???:You simple-minded fools. You could never understand the meaning of power.
Vivi:H-huh!? That wasn't me!
Vivi:AHHH!
Exdeath:I changed myself into a thorn and heard you talking.
Eiko:So that's why Vivi's back was hurting!
Krile:He did the same to me before. I totally let my guard down...
Exdeath:It seems you fools understand nothing.
Exdeath:So I will teach you. The Void is truly magnificent.
Tidus:Nobody asked you!
Exdeath:There are two sides to every coin
Exdeath:Bonds and loneliness. Hope and despair. Happiness and sorrow. Everything exists within that reason.
Irvine:What are you trying to say?
Exdeath:That life infers death. Things that exist will return to nothingness.
"Exdeath:In sum, existing in this world is meaningless."
Exdeath:Which makes the Void the single greatest of all entities. And its divine providence will be known to all worlds!
Eiko:Hold it! That's just plain crazy talk and it's making me mad!
Vivi:Don't deny the meaning of life! Everyone's doing their best to go on living.
"Irvine:You said it, Vivi!"
Exdeath:Humans are such a pitiful existence...
Exdeath:Understand this: your actions are meaningless. Someday you will all return to the Void.
Tidus:I guess we should have expected that much from an incarnation of evil souls.
Krile:I told you so. It's pointless trying to reason with him...
Eiko:And what are you so happy about?
Vivi:My back doesn't hurt anymore!
"Eiko:Ah... Good for you, Vivi."
Freya:Huh!? Who is that!?
Lulu:Kefka! Kuja!
Zidane:I don't remember calling you here. What do you want?
Freya:Zidane!
Cyan:Are you hurt!?
Zidane:Just what's the big deal! Not even gonna greet us before attacking!?
Lulu:Wait... Something isn't right here.
Freya:You have a point. The clown has never been able to resist opening his mouth.
"Cyan:Zidane, wait! I remember nowthey're the same as the ones we encountered in the labyrinth!"
Zidane:You're right! They're just like the manikins.
"Lulu:They may appear similar to you or I, but look closely. Does the light of life burn within them?"
Cyan:No! They exist only to kill!
"Zidane:Yeah, they're just dolls, and I think we can guess who made them. Exdeath!"
Exdeath:Mwahaha! You're more perceptive than I give you credit for!
Zidane:How am I not surprised?
Exdeath:I have turned crisis into opportunity! The crystal core of darkness proved most useful in making even more powerful servants!
Exdeath:And in greater numbers than before! None other than I could have raised an army so magnificent! Mwahahahahaha! HAHA!
Lulu:That means more worries for us...hardly a laughing matter.
Freya:Exdeath! We will not let this stand!
Exdeath:Hahaha... Won't you? Show me the conviction of your words.
Exdeath:Test the limits of your newfound strength on my minions! For what other purpose does strength serve than to crush your enemies!?
Sabin:Hyah!
Sabin:Ugh... There's too many! They just keep coming!
Exdeath:Mwahahaha! Beaten already? Disappointing!
"Exdeath:Then let the strong conquer the weak, so they may begin their rightful reign! Vanquish your foes, my servants!"
Exdeath:What!? Who was that?
"Kuja:Your ambitions are as prosaic as ever, Exdeath."
Kefka:What a bore! I'd vomit in disgust if I had any left in me!
Galuf:You two!
Sabin:Are they for real this time? I've had enough of fakes.
Kuja:None other. We're here to put a stop to these abominations. I won't suffer such ugly things to exist.
"Kefka:Talk about copyright infringement! If you're gonna use my face, I better be getting a fat purse of coins in return!"
Kuja:No one asked your opinion.
"Steiner:Well...as much as I hate to agree with them... I don't know what a ""copyright"" is, but my likeness is not one to be used lightly."
Galuf:Indeed. They speak some sense for once.
"Kuja:It seems you've ruffled some feathers, Exdeath. We will show you mercy today. Tomorrow, however..."
"Kefka:Tomorrow we'll bring our lawyers! Or failing that, we'll simply kill you!"
Exdeath:Hmph. The weak are ever envious of the strong.
Exdeath:No matterI was becoming bored anyways. It was clear who was outmatched.
Sabin:Uh...I guess we should thank you.
Kuja:Do not misunderstand me.
Kuja:I simply cannot abide ugliness in any form.
"Kefka:And I can't have anyone killing you guys but me! Could you imagine if a fake pulled it off before I did! Boy, would I have egg on my face!"
"Galuf:Heh. If you insist, we will withhold our gratitude."
Kuja:We do. Until next we meet.
Kefka:Smell ya later!
Steiner:It appears Exdeath has no friends even among his own kind.
Galuf:Don't start feeling sorry for him.
Galuf:He is a villain through and through. I don't believe he could relate to the likes of us even if he tried.
Serah:I think we've cleaned up this area. It looks like the monsters are all gone.
Noel:Got it. Then let's... Who's that?
"Firion:Noel! Don't run off alone! Come on, let's go!"
Seven:...What an odd place. It feels...stagnant.
Serah:Wh-what's that!?
Quistis:The monsters are fighting each other! What in the world...
"Caius:Here, one can efficiently absorb power. It is a space to guide a visitor into the world..."
Caius:A distorted mechanism made to sate the desires of one from your world.
Firion:Our world... You mean the Emperor!?
Seven:...Then why are you here? I'm sure you didn't come here just to tell us that.
Caius:I will take advantage of his plans...
Caius:And use that power for myself!
Firion:Shinryu!? I see... The Emperor wanted to lure it in!
Caius:Unfortunately it is still a larva... But it can still open holes in dimensions and connect worlds.
Caius:Turning order into chaos...
Quistis:Wait! We must deal with Shinryu first!
Quistis:I doubt we'll get any answers if we don't.
Serah:Everything seems fine for now.
"Seven:I told you before. Even if you connect to our world, the rules won't change. Even if you forget, the past stays the same."
Caius:Can you prove that is not your own false assumption?
"Caius:You've experienced it before. When someone is erased from everyone's memories, they cease to exist."
"Serah:...You're right. When everyone forgot about Lightning except for me, she disappeared."
Caius:Memories and reality are closely linked. Is this not the greatest proof there is?
Serah:Well... Even so...!
Caius:Memories of sadness will be buried. People can revel in happiness and the timeline will be restored to its rightful path.
Firion:Do you really think that's right...!?
Noel:You won't find happiness there.
Noel:You're supposed to protect Yeul.
Caius:...What makes you think that?
Caius:What's the matter? I thought you were better than this.
Noel:I've got my reasons!
"Noel:Locke, a little help!"
Locke:Got it!
Locke:We'll be taking theseyour dimensional coordinates.
Caius:What do you intend to do with them?
Noel:The others told me I could see where you are with these.
Fran:We will know if you make any suspicious movements. So behave.
"Caius:If you are so wary of me, why not strike me down now?"
Caius:Wouldn't that be easier for you?
Warrior of Light:No. We heard that you trapped Noel.
Noel:I won't make the same mistake again. I'm sure you're scheming something.
"Caius:...You are on your guard. So there are no missing fragments in your memories, Noel."
"Noel:...I don't want to strike you down, Caius."
Noel:I wanted to be better than you and stop you...
"Noel:Think it over. Don't get this world involved, too. I think Yeul would be...sad, if you did."
"Caius:...Use my coordinates as you see fit. No matter what you say, I will not change my mind."
Caius:I stayed true to my oath for a long time. Do not underestimate the power of my will.
Noel:...It didn't work.
"Rosa:Don't lose hope. There will be another chance, I'm sure of it."
Rosa:We'll call for him as many times as it takes.
"Locke:Right. We have his coordinates, after all. So we know where he is."
Noel:Right... It's a lot better than chasing after him in the dark.
Noel:I believe...
"Noel:""We'll meet again."" Those were the last words Yeul left me."
"Noel:The seeress said so, so there must be another way."
"Fran:...With such composure, the possibilities are many."
"Warrior of Light:Caius's will is strong, but so is yours. We won't give up."
Noel:As I am now...I won't lose again.
"Ignis:...If you don't mind, could you tell us more about Caius?"
Serah:Of course. It's best for everyone to know what we know.
"Lulu:Noel and Caius were Guardians of someone named Yeul, correct?"
Serah:That seeress is named Yeul.
"Vincent:So Noel, Caius, and Yeul are all from the same tribe."
Ignis:The power of prophecy... So they protected that power from being abused?
Serah:Agoddessgave Caius thepower to live forever.
"Serah:So he's been the seeress's Guardian for a long, long time."
"Vincent:Is the seeress immortal, too?"
Serah:...Yeul doesn't live very long.
"Serah:In exchange for seeing the future, her life is shortened... But she's reincarnated time and time again."
Vincent:So Caius saw the person he was supposed to protect die over and over again.
Lulu:A Guardian who lost the one who he was supposed to protect...
"Ignis:...His story is sympathetic, but such an action is high-handed."
"Vincent:If his will is that strong, he might try to do the same in this world."
Serah:...We weren't able to stop him that time. But with all of us here...I think we can do it.
"Lulu:Well, there is strength in numbers."
Ignis:And we are happy to be of service.
Serah:Thank you!
Garland:...I heard an interesting tale.
Garland:A tale of someone caught in a cycle of death and rebirth.
Garland:Have you acquired the power of chaos?
Caius:It's not that simple.
Garland:Hahaha! And yet you persist.
Garland:There will be many more chances.
"Garland:If you continue fighting, this world will be filled with chaos!"
Caius:I am well aware. I am merely exhausting all possible means.
Rinoa:Alright! I think that's all of them.
Caius:Then my job here is done.
Auron:Stay and talk a while.
Auron:...Is it true you were once a Guardian faced with an endless cycle of death and rebirth?
Caius:What do you hope to gain by knowing the answer?
Auron:Proof that we are not much different.
"Auron:After I lost my friends to this monster, I went on a journey to end the cycle."
Auron:So I can understand the regret you feel being unable to change a terrible fate.
"Caius:Say what you will, but we are not the same."
"Caius:The one at the cycle's mercy was not a monster, but a young girl."
Rinoa:A girl!? You mean...Yeul?
"Caius:She perishes before she can even reach your age, yet is reborn time and time again."
Rinoa:(How awful. I can't imagine someone even younger than me having to face that...)
"Caius:She was a victim to her cruel fate, and I bore witness to her countless deaths."
Caius:Could you bear to see someone given life anew for the sole purpose of dying years later?
"Auron:So that was also part of your duty as a Guardian... For that, you have my condolences."
"Rinoa:Umm... If you don't mind me asking, is that really the only reason you wanted to save Yeul?"
Caius:A strange question.
Caius:How many reasons does one need to save another?
"Cyan:I would rather he acted in self-interest than for another, but it appears he has his own beliefs to follow."
"Rinoa:If I were Yeul, I think I would be happy to know someone cares so much about me."
Rinoa:(Like when Squall came all that way to find me...)
"Lenna:Be that as it may, we cannot forget that other people got hurt because of it."
"Lenna:No matter how much you want to save someone, you cannot sacrifice others to do so."
Lenna:...I know because I have made that same mistake before.
"Barret:You're right, Lenna. We can't go forgettin' all the trouble he caused Lightning and the others!"
Rinoa:(Right. I have to accept my fate... Squall didn't try to push my powers onto someone else.)
Auron:We cannot let sympathy lead us astray. Thankfully we have his coordinates.
Cyan:Indeed. It puts me at ease knowing we can track his movements. Now let us regroup with the others.
Rinoa:Right! I'm sure Noel and the others could use a hand.
"Onion Knight:You said you were Caius's protg, right?"
Noel:Yeah. He trained me and taught me all sorts of things.
Noel:But I was just a pawn in his plan.
Tifa:That must have been shocking to find out.
Noel:I can't really say. All I could think was that I would never forgive him.
"Sabin:That can't have been easy, doubting your trusted master."
Tifa:Even more so because you admired him.
"Noel:If only I had been better, I could have seen through his scheme and stopped the flood of chaos..."
Shantotto:Why so blue? It sounds like your teacher saw great promise in you.
Noel:What do you mean?
Balthier:Must you be so cryptic? You can simply say that a teacher has no use for an incompetent student.
Shantotto:A good mage doesn't cast a spell not knowing if it will go well.
Shantotto:Did he not take you under his wing knowing what promise you bring?
Tifa:We can't say for sure. He may have chosen Noel because he was the last of his tribe.
"Balthier:If Noel hadn't any potential, I doubt Caius would have gone through the trouble of training him."
Balthier:He could have spent that time getting stronger himself.
Noel:...Caius was always telling me to get better and better.
"Shantotto:So we agree, unexpected though it may be."
Onion Knight:...A student might never know what their teacher is thinking.
Onion Knight:But how you use what you learned is entirely up to you.
"Sabin:Right! You're a good guy, Noel, so you'll choose the right path."
Noel:Thanks. Maybe there's still hope for my world.
"Onion Knight:It hasn't vanished yet, right? That means it can still be saved even if it might be flooded with chaos."
Noel:I won't give up. Let's hope for a miracle.
Balthier:There are no such things as miracles.
Balthier:Whatever happens is a reward for doing everything you possibly could.
Tifa:He's right. Nothing gets done just waiting around.
Sabin:And you can rest easy knowing we're here with you! We'll always be your friends.
Noel:Thanks. I'm counting on you guys.
"Noel:(I won't give up, Caius. I'm going to stop you...for Yeul's sake, too.)"
"???:Where is ""here"" anyway? I wonder if that god was the real deal..."
"???:What's the big deal summoning someone if they can't get home? Well, I accepted the terms...so I guess this's my fault."
"???:That Materia didn't have much life in her, so it's not like I could say no anyway."
"???:Haha... She really played me for a fool, didn't she?"
"???:I guess there's no point standing around and complaining. I better get looking for a clue, or at least find out what's real or not here."
Ignis:What happened to these monsters?
Laguna:Looks like someone beat us to 'em. Guess that means there's someone else here.
"Ignis:One of our comrades, perhaps?"
Ignis:No...I've heard nothing of the sort. Which means it must be an enemy...or a new ally.
"Ace:If it's one of our enemies, then maybe it's Kefka. He likes destruction. Or Garland, who's always looking for a fight..."
Ace:But I doubt either of those two would be satisfied fighting ordinary monsters.
"Cyan:I agree with thou, Sir Ace. Furthermore..."
Cyan:These are katana wounds. Neither of those two could have caused these.
Ignis:Katana wounds? Then perhaps Sephiroth or...
Ace:I guess we had better check with Cloud and the others first.
Cyan:Indeed. Those lines may be suspicious...
"Cyan:But I do not think that this creature was struck down for fun, as Kefka would do."
Cyan:Garland is the same. And I do not think Sephiroth would go around slaying monsters...
"Laguna:Come on, Cyan... Let's not get too gloomy here."
Laguna:It might just be a new friend fighting some monsters up ahead.
"Ignis:If it were an ally, our comrades may have some hint as to who wields a katana. However..."
Ace:It doesn't change what's happening around us. There's a high chance we'll run into them eventually.
Ace:Sephiroth's done some terrible things before. So we had best be prepared.
"Cyan:Indeed. If it is a new comrade, we must find them..."
"Cyan:But if it is our enemy, we cannot let our guard down. No ordinary man could cause such a wound..."
Ignis:Of course. Let us proceed with caution.
"Laguna:If someone like Sephiroth shows up, we can just say ""that's enough!"" and send them off."
Ace:If only they were so reasonable...
Cloud:This isn't Sephiroth's doing.
Cloud:He wouldn't be so roundabout.
Cloud:Someone who tried to steal the god's throne would come at us more directly.
Cyan:So it is as I suspected...
Cyan:But this monster was taken down in a single stroke.
Cyan:Hm? I hear something...
King:It sounds like a battle...
King:That way!
"???:Whew. Well, that does it for this area."
"???:I'm all for a workout, but I've been doing nothing but fight since I got here. This is getting old fast!"
???:Come on... Where is everyone?
King:Hold it!
???:Hm? Who could that be?
???:Oho! So you finally show your faces! I guess that goddess was telling the truth after all!
Ace:I see...
"???:Oh? So it's like that, is it?"
King:I'm going to stop its movements for just a second!
"???:Yes, sir!"
"???:Whoa! That thing was huge, yo!"
Cyan:A magnificent display of teamwork. And judging by his clothing...
Ace:Yeah. One more from Class Zero.
Jack:I'm Jack! Nice to meet you.
Cyan:Sir Jack. We saw what thou can do with a blade while on our way here.
Cyan:Thou wield thy katana without hesitation. It appears thou hast considerable training.
Jack:Nahhh. I'm not that good!
"Cyan:In contrast to thy sharp swordsmanship, however, thou seem to be quite the relaxed youth."
Cloud:So you're the type who changes with a weapon in hand.
Ace:No. He's the same on the battlefield.
Cyan:So his true heart makes his blade strike true...?
King:Don't read so deeply into it. This is just the way he is.
King:But his skill with a katana is solid. There's nothing for you guys to worry about.
Jack:Psssh. Praised by King? This really is a different world!
"Jack:Well, I guess I better get used to it since I'm part of the team now, yo!"
"Seven:Haha! We thought it might be an enemy, but it was just you, Jack."
"Jack:Awww, and there I was just trying to stay alive!"
Noel:I'm glad you're one of Ace's friends. If you were an enemy
Paine:We would end you.
Jack:Whaaat? So I was in danger? Ahaha...
"Jack:Well, it all turned out alright in the end. No harm, no foul!"
"Locke:Well, you defeated the enemies so that we didn't have to."
Locke:Like some kind of unknown hero.
Jack:A hero? Psssh!
"Jack:Being the cool leader type is good, but being a nameless hero who rescues people from the shadows ain't so bad either!"
"Seven:Rescuing people from the shadows? I don't think you're that subtle, Jack."
"Jack:But that's what I looked like, right?"
"Paine:I guess to the others, maybe... But not me."
"Jack:If I had known, I would have come out more gallantly! I could've played the cool hero!"
"Seven:Keep that up and you won't have a chance at looking ""cool,"" Jack."
Paine:Only those with skill can pull that act off.
"Noel:Well, it's not impossible. If you keep it up, some day you could be that guy."
"Jack:Really? Then I'll give it my best shot, yo."
"Locke:What's the matter, Jack?"
"Jack:I thought the ""cool"" types were strong and silent. I was just giving it a try!"
"Seven:I told you, Jack. You're a far cry from being the ""cool"" typein a good way."
"Jack:Praised by Seven, too!? I think I'm blushing!"
"Noel:Jack's a good guy, no doubt about it."
Paine:Certainly a lot nicer than most guys I know.
Jack:Everyone's so nice here!
"Locke:Well, would you like to meet one of those ""cool"" hero types?"
Locke:His name is Squall.
"Locke:He's always frowning, but he's a good guy. I can introduce you!"
Jack:Really? I'd love to make some new friends!
Jack:I'll be a cool hero someday! I'm sure this Squall guy is full of good advice!
Seven:Squall's not going to like this...
"Jack:We've been through all sorts of stuff together, but exploring a new world with all these people is a first, yo."
Jack:Though we're still down a few cadets. Hope they get here sooner than later.
Cecil:Will your world be okay if all of you come to this realm?
"Jack:Psssh, they'll be fine! There're plenty other cadets outside of Class Zero. And it's high time we all had some fun!"
Snow:I agree. Lately things have got a little too serious. We should be enjoying ourselves.
"Prompto:I didn't want anyone to think I wasn't taking things seriously, so I didn't say anything, but I'm totally with you guys!"
"Prompto:I'm glad you're here, Jack! It's nice to know I'm not alone."
"Prompto:I know the world's in trouble, but I'm still happy it brought me to you guys."
Jack:Same! We gotta take it easy once in a while and there's no better time than the present!
"Jack:Awww, I hadn't thought about that. Poor Mother..."
Deuce:We might even get lectured for leaving...
"Jack:I hate lectures... But we'll cross that bridge when we get there, yo!"
"Cecil:Haha, ever the optimistic one. You never wallow long in despair, do you?"
"Jack:How can I? We have a star pupil with us and we're all gonna get scolded together! I'm counting on you to smooth things over, Machina."
"Machina:Usually people dread getting scolded, but knowing we'll be together...I can't find it in myself to mind."
Jack:Seriously? Mother's gonna rip us a new one! Wait... Don't tell me you like getting scolded.
Prompto:Whoa! We've been traveling together all this time and I had no idea!
"Machina:W-wait, hold on! It's not like that!"
"Jack:Say no more! Your secret is safe with us, Machina."
Deuce:I won't tell a soul! Not even Rem!
Machina:You got it all wrong! I don't like getting scolded!
Cecil:You seem to enjoy each others' company.
Machina:...I get it now.
"Deuce:I think Jack wants you to be more positive, Machina."
"Jack:Nahhh. I just want him to enjoy this a little more, yo."
Jack:But if you wanna read that deeply into it...you're not wrong.
"Machina:Haha! You're in for a long lecture when we get home, Jack."
Jack:No! You traitor!
"Machina:Besides, you guys are getting off easy. Rem and I will probably be punished by thecommandantanddivision head."
"Jack:Oof, tough break."
Machina:But we'll be fine. They're bound to be lenient when I tell them we were kidnapped by Class Zero.
Jack:You wouldn't dare! They'll definitely believe the teacher's pet!
Machina:I doubt it. I can't imagine anyone believing we went to a different world.
"Snow:If they don't, I'll gladly testify as your otherworldly friend."
Prompto:Same here! I gotta see this Orience place myself.
Jack:Thanks! I'll keep that in mind.
Jack:But it's not time to go home yet. We've still got plenty of time to have fun in this world!
Jack:This airship is huge! Thank goodness there's so many of us or I'd definitely get lost.
"Jack:On the other hand, it does make it pretty hard to get any time alone..."
"Jack:Hey, guys. What're you gossiping about?"
Tidus:Uh oh...
Sherlotta:Hold it. I get the feeling Jack is one of us. Let's let him in on the secret.
"Reynn:I suppose... But you better not betray us, Jack."
"Lann:You're scaring me, Reynn..."
"Jack:Well this sounds like fun! Tell me more, yo."
Lann:This is a top-secret meeting to exchange information on the best napping places in the ship.
"Sherlotta:The deck is one of my favorites, though the wind can get a little strong at times."
"Lann:Hey, you scolded me for being up here last time! It's not fair if only you get to use it!"
"Sherlotta:You were interrupting my nap. But don't let my little scolding bother you, Lann."
"Reynn:Something tells me it wasn't very ""little""..."
"Lann:The engine room is usually empty, so there's no one to catch you napping there."
"Tidus:And it's warm too... Sometimes too warm, though."
Lann:That's when I treat myself to one of these secret popsicles from the pantry!
Reynn:...How did you find that?
"Lann:Did you want one too? Sorry, but this is the last one."
Reynn:Well enjoy it because it'll be the last thing you ever eat!
Lann:What the honk! I didn't realize they were yours!
"Tidus:Speaking of the pantry, it's not a bad place to nap."
Sherlotta:True. It is nice and cool in there.
"Jack:Come on! Get serious, you guys!"
Reynn:...Oh no. Are you not one of us after all!?
"Jack:Listen, you've gotta get serious if you want a good nap. I used to line up books on my desk to make it look like I was studying!"
"Jack:And the text would put me right to sleep! If you rest your chin in your hands, you'll even look like you're awake!"
Lann:That's it! You're a genius!
Reynn:Should you really be praising him for that...?
Basch:What are you all doing here? Having a strategy meeting?
Tidus:Basch!? Uh oh...
Reynn:We can't let him know...
"Lann:We, uh, were definitely talking about strategy! Yup! You'd never catch us napping on the job! Right, Reynn?"
Reynn:You are terrible at this!
"Jack:We were talking about the importance of getting a good nap in! Care to join us, Basch?"
Sherlotta:That's a bold strategy... Do you really think he'd join?
Basch:I see. It's certainly an intriguing topic worth discussing. Getting sufficient rest throughout the day is important.
Basch:Naps could help us recharge before battle. I'll propose it to the others. I think they would agree to sleeping in shifts.
"Jack:Yeah! Glad you have you on board, Basch!"
"Lann:Still, it won't feel like a real nap if I can't do it when I want..."
"Jack:We'll leave it to you, then!"
Jack:Now we can have on-the-clock naps too!
"Sherlotta:""Too""? Oho, Jack, you scoundrel!"
Reynn:You really are a genius!
"Rem:Cough, cough..."
"Aerith:Are you okay, Rem? You've been coughing for a while now."
Rem:I...I'm fine. It's just a little coughing fit...
"Rem:Cough! Cough, cough!"
Lenna:There's nothing little about it. Doesn't it hurt?
Yuna:Stay still. I'll heal you!
"Rem:Cough, cough! Cough...!"
Aerith:I'll help!
"Rem:Cough, cough... Huff..."
Lenna:It's okay... It's okay now.
Yuna:Magic doesn't seem to work... Maybe it's ineffective against sicknesses from other worlds...?
"???:Please, use this!"
???:This thyme moss should help suppress the cough. Quickly now!
Aerith:Thyme moss...?
???:How do you feel?
"Rem:Better, thank you..."
"Aerith:Thank goodness, Rem!"
Lenna:It looked like that medicinal herb helped calm your cough.
"Yuna:By the way, who are you?"
"???:Oh, how rude of me. I'm"
Lenna:That voice...!
"Aerith:Monsters! We'll have to do introductions later, I suppose...!"
Rem:Thank you for earlier. I feel much better now.
Cater:I appreciate you helping my friend!
???:I'm glad I could help.
Arciela:My name is Arciela V. Adoulin.
Arciela:From one of the Twelve Orders in the Sacred City of Adoulin.
Lion:Sacred City of Adoulin...? Would that by any chance be to the far west of the Middle Lands?
Lion:I heard that they were recruiting adventurers to help develop Ulbuka.
Arciela:Oh? Then you must be in this forest as pioneers...
Cid:It seems like this lady doesn't have a clue what's going on.
Auron:Then we had better explain it.
Arciela:...I see. I thought it was strange that I couldn't see the spirits.
Rem:Everyone here was summoned from a different world by a god.
Lion:I'm also from Vana'diel. I passed through a Torsion just like you did.
Arciela:...I'm not sure I understand. Why is thyme moss growing here if we're in a different world?
Cid:Probably because this world was made to look like ours.
Auron:Or perhaps because your world and this one are connected by a Torsion.
Arciela:Is it because I came here...?
"Cater:No, no! It's not your fault!"
"Rem:You saved me, Arciela. I can't thank you enough."
Auron:It's not easy to judge whether to help complete strangers or not.
"Cid:In short, we like you, miss!"
Arciela:Th-thank you! I'm happy to hear that.
"Lion:As you can see from these woods, Vana'diel is in trouble..."
"Rem:In order to save our worlds and get back home, we need to gather brilliance."
Cid:So will you help us? Rejection would be hard for us to stomach at this point.
Arciela:I can't stop here. I have a duty to the people of Adoulin...
"Arciela:Please, let me come with you. I want to help!"
"Cid:Well, well! You look like a sheltered noble, but you've got guts, kid!"
"Zack:Alright, guys! We're almost out of the woods! Just follow me!"
Ace:Is it really a good idea to follow him...?
Quistis:Indeed. Having him lead makes me very nervous...
Arciela:There are poisonous plants growing over there. And I can sense monsters.
Zack:Wh-what!? How did you know that?
"Zell:Oh, brother..."
Arciela:Let's go this way instead. It's a safer route out.
"Quistis:You really saved our necks, Arciela. You're very well versed in the forest."
"Zell:You know a ton about medicinal plants, too! Almost like you've lived in the woods before."
Ace:Arciela? Is something wrong?
Arciela:...I just remembered how they used to call me a witch back home.
Zack:A witch? But why?
Arciela:I've had the power to be attune with nature ever since I can remember.
"Arciela:Before I knew it, people started ridiculing me of being a witch protected by the woods."
Arciela:This power has caused me unhappiness. I've even dragged in people around me...
Quistis:That's terrible.
"Zell:A witch, huh..."
Quistis:Sorceresses often used their great powers as a weapon to become dictators.
"Quistis:Because of that, people came to hate them. But not all sorceresses are evil..."
"Arciela:People hated them, too... Just like me."
Zell:What are you saying? You're completely different.
Zell:You're nothing like Ultimecia at all!
"Ace:You saved Rem, and you helped us avoid danger."
"Zack:You do have a mysterious power, but how you use it is up to you."
"Zack:So even if you're a witch, you're a good one!"
"Zack:So, how about it?"
"Arciela:Thank you, everyone. You're right. I need to be more positive!"
"Arciela:If I can save someone with this power, I don't care what people call me!"
Zack:That's the spirit! Now let's get going!
"Arciela:Wait, Zack! Not that way!"
"Edgar:Arciela, you mentioned before that your country was involved in colonization."
"Edgar:As a king, I find the subject of how other nations are governed to be fascinating. I would like to hear more, if you would indulge me."
"Arciela:Of course. The Sacred City of Adoulin consists of the capital city and its many surrounding islands, both large and small."
"Arciela:Since its expansion as a mercantile city, the population has increased several times over."
"Cait Sith:That sounds like music to my ears. The more the merrier, I say."
"Ashe:Your home was built on trade, as was mine. I am sure they share much in common."
"Edgar:All those people, and only so many islands. I think I see the reason its rulers would push for expansion."
Onion Knight:So you guys ran out of land?
Arciela:That's right. The islands could not bear the burden of so many people.
"Arciela:So we have expanded into the west, through the forests, forming new colonies along the way."
Barret:Did I hear that right?
"Barret:Did you say ""through the forest""? Does that mean you're cuttin' those trees down?"
"Arciela:Yes, unfortunately. There are those in Adoulin who would share in your surprise."
Barret:You got that right! Nothin' makes my blood boil like humans thinkin' they can trample over nature's gifts!
"Onion Knight:Whoa, calm down there. Seems like this hit a sore spot."
Barret:So what if it did!?
Barret:It's because of thoughtless bastards like that that my home...my friends...
Cait Sith:H-hey! Don't look at me like that!
"Ashe:I understand how you feel, Barret."
"Ashe:However, rulers have a responsibility to their subjects as well. They can't leave them without a place to live."
"Barret:Yeah, I know that. I just... I just..."
"Onion Knight:It's not easy to balance your respect for nature with your peoples' prosperity. And the more there are, the harder it is."
"Arciela:In Adoulin, the debates between those who supported expansion and those who opposed it went on for ages."
Arciela:Adoulin's previous attempt at pioneering had met with failure.
"Arciela:Those who opposed the plan feared the wrath of the forests, and went to extreme lengths to make their opposition heard."
"Cait Sith:""Extreme lengths""... Where have I heard that before?"
Barret:H-Hey! Don't look at me!
"Arciela:Expansion is possible, but we must let the voices of nature guide us along the way."
"Arciela:We are inextricably linked. We can't face the future in opposition, but must look to it in unity."
"Arciela:That should be what we strive for, in any case."
"Cait Sith:Sounds a bit over my head, but if she believes it, then I'm behind her!"
"Ashe:With someone like you to guide their way, I'm sure your people will see your ideals realized."
"Edgar:Well, I do have some experience in the matter of leading others."
"Edgar:If you ever need advice, then I will offer what I can. You only need to ask."
Arciela:Thank you! It's reassuring to know I can depend on you.
Prishe:Aaargh! I can't take it anymore! I won't last another step at this rate!
"Freya:Wh-what is it, Prishe?"
Prishe:I'm out of energy. If I don't have something sweet soon...
Agrias:And that concerns us how?
"Arciela:I'm in agreement with Prishe! We need to find something sweet to eat, and quickly!"
"Relm:You can count me in, too! Sweets must be found!"
Chelinka:What kind are you thinking of?
"Arciela:Mmm, a chocolate crepe topped with white honey! Heaps of witch nougat made with maple sugar!"
Relm:You know what I want? Fluffy pancakes smothered in maple syrup!
Prishe:That sounds delicious! I want those too!
Arciela:Just talking about sweets makes me feel so much better.
Freya:You three are quite...enthusiastic.
Arciela:Don't you have a sweet tooth at all? There's nothing you like to snack on?
Freya:Something sweet? Well...
"Freya:Princess Garnet was partial to peach pudding, as I recall."
"Arciela:Pudding? Ah, so Garnet is one of us!"
Arciela:A chocobon? Hmm...
Arciela:That's a new one. I wonder what's in it.
"Prishe:Ahhh, I can't take this anymore! Someone, please! Maaake me something!"
"Yuri:How about it, Chelinka? We could have a go at it."
"Chelinka:Maybe. I suppose if we had the ingredients and a little guidance, we could at least try."
Relm:You two can cook?
"Yuri:Yup. We've had a lot of experience improvising, and got pretty good along the way."
"Yuri:So should we give it a shot? If we all put our heads together, what's the worst that can happen?"
"Chelinka:Well, now you've gotten everyone's hopes up. Alright, can we trouble you all to look for ingredients?"
"Chelinka:We could recruit Ignis, too. If we're going to try it, we might as well do it right!"
Relm:You got it! I'll put on my best gathering pants!
Arciela:Now we have a quest! To make the perfect confectionary!
Prishe:Nothing can stop us! Let's gooo!
Agrias:I have never seen them attend to any duty with such vigor. All because of sweets?
Materia:Yes. This world draws ever closer to danger. Won't you lend us your strength?
???:Haha! Are you serious?
???:You're asking the guy who refused a queen's request. As if a goddess would be much different.
Materia:So you are in need of a different reason.
Materia:I understand. I will open the way for you. Then you can judge this world with your own eyes.
???:Where does it lead?
Materia:One of your comrades is ahead. He should be able to help you understand our world.
???:I feel like I've seen this before...
"???:Well, no point in waiting around. Thanks, goddess Materia."
Keiss:Never been here before... But that doesn't necessarily mean I'm in a different world.
"Keiss:If I'm going to judge this place with my own eyes, I need to get my hands on some information."
Keiss:...Didn't that goddess say one of my comrades would be here?
"Keiss:Could she have meant Layle? I couldn't find him anywhere, but..."
Keiss:(What's that guy up to? Is he setting a trap?)
"Keiss:(But judging from his demeanor, he's upper class. Perfect for getting information.)"
Keiss:(I'll trail him for a while. He won't notice me at this distance...)
The Emperor:So you managed to evade my attack.
Keiss:(He noticed me!? I underestimated him.)
"The Emperor:A new face, I see... Who are you?"
The Emperor:No... Tell me: who summoned you?
Keiss:(I see... So the goddess has enemies. I had better tread carefully.)
Keiss:You appear to be of noble blood. Could you please help me?
Keiss:I was suddenly thrown into this place and don't know what to do with myself.
Keiss:But it appears this world has seen better days.
"Keiss:Even if only for a little while, would you mind if I accompanied you?"
Keiss:You've seen how I can move. Why not let me work for you?
The Emperor:...Hmph. You bore me.
Keiss:Could you find it in yourself to help me?
Maria:What is that man doing!?
Layle:(Huh? Is that...Keiss?)
"King:Scheming something, most likely. I guess it's up to us to cut it short."
Layle:(He's talking to the Emperor. Maybe he's trying to get information out of him...)
Keiss:Stop right there!
Layle:I get it. I won't go over there.
Keiss:He's a long-time rival of mine... Why don't you leave this to me?
The Emperor:...So you two hail from the same world.
"Keiss:Let's settle this, crystal bearer!"
The Emperor:There's no need for that.
Keiss:Gck...!
Maria:But...I thought you were friends!
The Emperor:I have no memory of such folly. He was just a worm wriggling where he didn't belong.
The Emperor:Did you really think I would believe you? What a pathetic spy...
Celes:Then who is he...?
"Layle:A fine performance as always, Keiss."
Keiss:Seriously? That's how you greet me after all this time?
"Keiss:Well, I owe you one, crystal bearer."
King:I see. So Layle sent you flying before you could get caught in the trap.
"Layle:Pretty good teamwork, wasn't it? We've worked together before."
"Keiss:More importantly, Layle..."
Keiss:What are you doing here?
Layle:It's not my fault. I was just brought here.
Keiss:Don't you know how worried everyone was about you!?
Keiss:I've had my hands full restoring the guild while looking for you!
"Layle:...Well, at least you got one thing squared away now."
"Layle:Since we've got some time here, why not come with us?"
Layle:This is Keiss. He's an old partner of mine.
"Celes:I'm sorry for my mistake earlier. You're one of Layle's friends, then."
"Layle:He catches on quick, so don't go easy when teaching him about this place."
Keiss:(Layle sure is friendly with these people... And they don't seem afraid of his power.)
"Keiss:(I thought something shady was going on, but I have no choice but to believe it if Layle says so... I've made up my mind.)"
Keiss:Nice to meet you guys! It looks like I'll be in your capable hands from now on!
"Freya:Interesting, isn't it? It makes one realize how diverse the worlds out there are."
"Keiss:If there were this many races back home, I feel there would be fewer quarrels."
"Terra:There were wars in your world, too, weren't there?"
Keiss:Well...a certain tribe monopolized power.
Keiss:So there was inequality between the four tribes.Selkieslike me created aguildto survive.
Penelo:Inequality... I guess that exists anywhere.
"Penelo:Themanwho looked after me was from adifferent tribe, but he was very popular and good at his job. So I was surprised."
Ramza:...But even people of the same tribe can experience inequality.
"Barret:If there weren't, the slums wouldn't exist."
Penelo:You're right... There's disparity even among us here.
"Keiss:Right? In that case, you can't keep quiet. You need to take power back with your own hands."
Keiss:That's why I joined the army. To pull down those on top.
"Keiss:I was able to climb the ranks that way, but the stubborn Guild Master told me never to show my face around there again."
"Barret:Hahaha! You've got guts, kid!"
Ramza:But don't you feel uneasy without that support? It's like having no one at your back.
"Keiss:Selkies tend to value our independence, so I wasn't too torn up about it."
"Terra:...Even still, you worked hard for your tribe?"
"Penelo:You're very thoughtful of your friends, Keiss!"
"Keiss:Hah, that's a new one."
Freya:Perhaps you are fit to become a guildmaster yourself.
Barret:She's right! That's right up your alley!
"Keiss:You guys don't miss a thing. Actually, I'm doing something pretty similar now."
Penelo:Then your world will definitely change! As long as there's one person who wants it to change.
"Terra:Right. Even if they're from a different tribe, you can join hands and work together."
Keiss:And she wanted me as High Commander. I don't think she has any intention of monopolizing power.
Ramza:How nice... The beginning of a new age for your world.
Keiss:That's why I want to show it to Layle. He helped make it all possible and still doesn't know.
Keiss:Yeah. He's the hero who saved our world.
Keiss:And after he saved the world...
Keiss:He disappeared without a word.
Keiss:Almost like he was blown away by the wind. Like some kind of nomad.
"Terra:Haha. He sounds like Bartz! Exploring the world, going wherever the wind takes him."
Penelo:That's right. I wonder why they stay here with us... They don't act like that at all around us.
"Keiss:Yeah. To be honest, I was quite surprised to see Layle staying in one place here."
"Keiss:...Oh, and he hates talk like this, so don't tell him I told you."
"Keiss:Hehe, thanks. Well, I guess it's off to our next destination!"
Keiss:How weird...
Keiss:Maybe it was more comfortable for him being treated like a normal human here.
Keiss:Tch. I probably gave him too much credit to think it didn't bother him.
"Keiss:Well, he was treated like a heretic back home."
Keiss:I wonder if he thinks the world still rejects him...
Keiss:What an idiot. I have to drag him back home on the double and have everyone give him a piece of their mind.
"Auron:You're a friend of Layle's, I hear."
"Keiss:Yeah, but he and i are nothing alike. I'm not a crystal bearer like he is."
Porom:So are you two friends?
Keiss:Friends? Not quite...
"Keiss:We're from different tribes and don't see each other much outside of jobs, but we're partners without a doubt."
Papalymo:Partners are truly a splendid thing. It seems Layle and I have more in common than I thought.
Keiss:It's far from splendid. That guy's nothing but trouble.
Tifa:Trouble? That sounds...unfortunate.
Keiss:You don't know the half of it.
Keiss:He gets stuck fighting huge monsters that come out of nowhere and loses his way chasing Goldenrod.
Keiss:And don't even get me started on vehicles. What goes up must come down!
Keiss:You see? Being partners with that guy means putting up with all that!
Tifa:I hate falling...
Quistis:How can someone without any responsibilities get into so much trouble?
Porom:A fair question. doesn't it ever worry you?
Keiss:Not really. He's lived to tell the tale every time.
Porom:It must be nice to trust your partner like that! I can't take my eyes off Palom for one second...
Porom:But I guess I can't compare the two. Palom's trouble is of his own making...
Papalymo:...But I'm sure any trouble is more manageable with you at his side.
"Quistis:And even if you do cause trouble, I suppose it's fine as long as it doesn't affect others..."
Tifa:But even among friends...
"Tifa:There's trouble that you will and won't tolerate being dragged into, right?"
"Tifa:Sometimes trouble is inevitable, but if it's caused by your own greed I don't want any part of it!"
Auron:And I don't want to pay for anyone's drunken mistakes.
"Keiss:All fine examples. But you can't just abandon them, right?"
Tifa:Like they could make it without us! They're our friends because we go through these troublesome things together.
"Keiss:He may be nothing but trouble, but Layle's reliable and tries to do the right thing. I could do worse than him for a partner."
"Layle:There you are, Keiss. We could use another set of eyes for the next patrol."
"Keiss:Alright, alright. I'm coming."
Quistis:I thought he just said Layle was nothing but trouble.
"Porom:Then it's up to Keiss to watch his back, right? Haha!"
"Keiss:Hey, quite the group you've got here."
Keiss:I'm going to have a look around the area. Does anyone want to join me?
"Sabin:I'd be happy to. Overflowing with curiosity for the new world, are you?"
Keiss:Not really. I just want to know more about it.
"Keiss:I've got to see the outside with my own eyes, y'know?"
"Fang:Quite the earnest adventurer, aren't ya?"
"Keiss:Is it really that strange to go exploring? The people back home thought it was too, but..."
Keiss:You'll never learn about the outside world by staying in one place.
Fran:Some things you learn only by leaving homethings you cannot learn through rumors alone.
Keiss:Glad it turned out to be a false alarm! There are plenty of things you just have to see with your own eyes.
"Eiko:You didn't think the outside world was scary, Keiss? I know I did..."
"Keiss:I definitely felt more at ease at home with other Selkies, but you'll get left behind if you never leave the nest."
Eiko:Left behind? By who?
Keiss:The rest of the world.
Keiss:I hated the Lilty for what they did to the Selkie. We got left behind and struggled just to survive.
Fran:You wished to reclaim your pride.
Noct:Then you've got no choice but to fight.
Eiko:So that's why you left home!
Sabin:You faced any fears you may have had to claim what you desired.
"Fran:Even you left home for something you wanted, no?"
"Eiko:...Right. I wasn't sure what to do at first, but I really wanted to go with Zidane and the others."
Keiss:Then you and I are the same. We both wanted to know more about the outside world.
"Keiss:The world is always changing, so it's important to know what's going on."
Keiss:So I'll ask one more time: I'm going to have a look around. Does anyone want to join
"Eiko:Come on, Keiss! Let's go!"
Fang:Hurry up now. Wouldn't want you getting lost on my watch.
"Keiss:This is way more people than I expected, but I'm not complaining."
Kam'lanaut:...Have you been waiting here for me?
Eald'narche:You needn't be so wary of me. I merely want you to pass my dimensional coordinates onto Materia's warriors.
"Eald'narche:Since you're traveling with them, it should be no problem. Right?"
Kam'lanaut:I wonder. It's not as if we trust each other.
Eald'narche:That matters not. I'm sure they'll take it.
"Eald'narche:...You think I want to see things for myself, don't you?"
"Eald'narche:You're right, but make no mistake. That is but a means to an end."
Eald'narche:To undo the failures of the past and make the right choices to obtain the future.
Kam'lanaut:What are you talking about?
"Eald'narche:By using the principles of this world, I may be able to settle that time I cast you aside."
Kam'lanaut:...What nonsense. The past cannot be changed.
Eald'narche:Think what you want. I suppose arguing here was inevitable.
Eald'narche:Give them my coordinates. Understood?
Kam'lanaut:Just what is he scheming...?
Kam'lanaut:Hmph... I suppose I'll do what he asks for now.
Kam'lanaut:I need only discern what to do once handing them these coordinates...
Kam'lanaut:You worms need only listen.
Sabin:Listen to what?
Kam'lanaut:Take these.
"Mog:Dimensional coordinates, kupo!?"
"Firion:But we've already got yours, Kam'lanaut."
Mog:...These aren't Kam'lanaut's. They're Eald'narche's!
Sabin:Eald'narche!? You mean the one you betrayed...?
Kam'lanaut:He betrayed me first. And he asked me to give you those.
Kam'lanaut:Use them as you see fit. It is no concern of mine.
Firion:What is Eald'narche thinking...?
Kam'lanaut:He saw me lending you a hand...and decided to cooperate.
Sabin:Does he want to help for the same reason as you? To understand our motivations?
Kam'lanaut:You have a praiseworthy memory for a primate. Now you two can use each other.
Kam'lanaut:His strength is absolute. He will no doubt be a worthy comrade in battle.
Firion:But we can't trust him!
Kam'lanaut:Trust... Hmph. There is a chance he'll throw you away as easily as he did me.
"Kam'lanaut:But for a moment, see how the scales balance."
Kam'lanaut:A great power like Eald'narche's against fragile sentiments like trust...
Kam'lanaut:Which will be more beneficial to you in the end?
"Firion:...Could it be he can't trust him, either?"
"Sabin:Let's talk with the others, Mog."
"Mog:Right... We can't decide this on our own, kupo."
Eald'narche:So you didn't throw my coordinates away. Perhaps you fools are worthy of being saved after all.
"Lion:We don't need your saving, thanks."
Eald'narche:No matter. I did not come here to discuss something so pedantic.
Eald'narche:I will be your ally. It will be to our mutual benefit.
Quistis:What made you change your mind? I thought we were enemies.
Eald'narche:Enemies...? I was merely cleaning up my brother's mess.
Eald'narche:One cannot create a fake Paradise. There was no need to make things worse than they were.
"Eald'narche:As a result, we became enemies. That's all there is to it."
"Edge:You want us to believe you, even though you tried to destroy Lion's world!?"
Eald'narche:Destroy? I was trying to make a paradise for the chosen. It's the same as the gods of this world.
Lion:The same? How...?
"Eald'narche:Then tell me: what's different? Not that I expect us to understand each other, but..."
"Eald'narche:Our goal is the same, isn't it?"
Quistis:Goal? What do you mean?
"Eald'narche:By using the principles of this world, we may be able to return to our respective homes without the help of the gods."
"Kam'lanaut:(To fix the past, we must return to our world. I should have known Eald'narche would think that far ahead.)"
"Eald'narche:To that end, it became necessary for me to see things through your eyes."
"Eald'narche:Returning home is your goal, is it not?"
Eald'narche:So adding me to your ranks helps us both. Don't you agree?
Lion:...Just because we have the same goal doesn't mean I'll work with you.
"Eald'narche:How annoying... All I did was rid the world of its scum, and yet you say that!?"
"Eald'narche:As long as you have value to me, I won't harm you. You can share in the profits of others."
Eald'narche:To simplify for you fools: I will let you know once I figure out a way to return to our home worlds.
"Eald'narche:...You won't be won over, you say? How about you? Your heart seems to be wavering."
"Edge:That's true, but...I won't be so easily drawn in by you!"
Quistis:Exactly. There's too great a risk in making you our ally.
Eald'narche:...Hmph. Very well then.
Eald'narche:Let me tell you something interesting. Something Kam'lanaut hasn't even heard...
Eald'narche:There are some perculiar things occurring in this world.
Eald'narche:Those who have died in our home worlds can be brought back here.
Eald'narche:The time you'd wish to return to varies before and after reclaiming your brilliance.
"Eald'narche:Do you not think it strange? If we return to our original worlds, when do you think we will go back to?"
Chelinka:You don't mean...
Yuri:We might be able to return to whatever time we want?
Galuf:Is that possible!?
"Eald'narche:How perceptive of you. In this hypothesis, we can fix the mistakes of our past."
Kam'lanaut:(I see... So one could both return home and start over.)
"Lion:I understand what you're thinking, but...we'll still stop you no matter how many times you try!"
"Yuri:Wait, Lion. I don't think that's it..."
"Yuri:If you go back home, you two might not have to fight. You'll return to different worlds."
"Eald'narche:...I see. I thought you knew something, but you speak from experience."
"Eald'narche:Thanks to which, I have confirmed my hypothesis."
Eald'narche:It is as he says. To put it in simpleton's terms: there will be parallel worlds.
Eald'narche:You will each be given a fair chance to fix your past mistakes.
Eald'narche:What do you think?
"Chelinka:But if you go back to that world, will you still hurt lots of people?"
Eald'narche:And if I do?
"Eald'narche:...I see. We could not be allies, then. Despite how much I've explained..."
"Lion:If you can read our minds, you understand. We don't need your power."
Eald'narche:I know. But your understanding is pitifully shallow.
Eald'narche:You've been so focused on me that you haven't noticed the benefits for yourselves.
"Lion:There's nothing I want to fix in my past. No matter what it is, it's made me who I am today."
Eald'narche:I wasn't talking about you. Or have you forgotten since coming here?
"Eald'narche:If you do as I say, those who should have perished can still live."
Ignis:...Do not underestimate us.
Eald'narche:Ahaha! Those eyes!
Eald'narche:But what about the others? If they knew of the possibility...
Eald'narche:I welcome you at any time. We can work together for a better future.
"Lion:If we can prevent some from dying, I want to save them, but..."
Ignis:No. It's as you said. Everything in our pasts has made us who we are.
"Lion:I thought about throwing away his coordinates, but...it wouldn't change anything."
Lion:And I can't just leave them here. Maybe I'll give them to Mog until my heart is ready...
Yuri:I think you should do what you want. Don't think you have to shoulder this alone.
"Chelinka:I understand a little of how Eald'narche feels... But if lots of sacrifices need to be made, I'll do whatever it takes to stop him."
"Lion:Yeah... Thank you, everyone."
Kam'lanaut:Do you really intend to do things over?
"Eald'narche:Of course. And this time, everything will go according to plan."
"Eald'narche:You understand what you must do, don't you? Do not betray my expectations."
Kam'lanaut:So that we do not fail this time...?
Eald'narche:What boring opponents.
Yuna:Thank you...for helping us.
Eald'narche:Don't thank me if you don't mean it. Empty gestures disgust me.
Eald'narche:Why thank me if you don't believe you can trust me? Or if you only think I helped you out of self-interest?
Yuna:I... Uh...
Edgar:Don't you think it's a little rude to be reading people's thoughts without telling them?
Eald'narche:And it's considered polite not to say what you mean? I have no interest in false friends.
"Edgar:Don't take it personally, Yuna. Some people are just...rough around the edges."
"Lion:I know you like to try your best to put everyone at ease, but there's nothing to be done with Eald'narche."
"Basch:He might've been the one to come to us, but that doesn't mean we have to trust each other."
Yuna:I just wanted to make him feel welcomed.
Yuna:But I could feel the way he looked down on us and just couldn't do it...
Yuna:I'm sure he was able to sense that feeling too.
Lion:We'll have to be satisfied with the fact that he cooperated with us at all. It's not like Spiritus's warriors are clamoring to help us out.
Lion:Just imagine if it were Seymour instead. Would you still want to make him feel welcome?
Yuna:Hmm... I see your point.
Edgar:He joined up with us because he's looking for a way back to his world. We don't need to expect anything else from him.
"Edgar:He might have information we can use, and we might have information he can use. It's better than being enemies."
"Basch:It certainly is... However, it doesn't seem he has much in common with Kam'lanaut."
"Yuna:Even though they're brothers, or so they say. Judging by how they treat each other, you'd never guess."
Edgar:Take it from me: siblingseven twins have their differences as much as anyone else.
"Edgar:But even so, those two are different. There's not an ounce of brotherhood between them."
Lion:Indeed. I have no doubt Eald'narche would do anything to achieve his goals. Even in this world.
"Basch:Kam'lanaut claimed to have trusted him, but I wonder what he believes now. Once broken, trust cannot easily be mended."
Yuna:It must be frightening to even consider trusting someone who has betrayed you before.
Basch:And doubly so with someone who possesses such an uncanny ability. Even your slightest vulnerability can be laid bare.
Lion:That's right. I can understand why Kam'lanaut would be worried.
Edgar:I can't imagine what it'd be like to have a sibling you couldn't trust...
"Edgar:But then again, I'm not inclined toward evil acts. To them, trying to see eye to eye is probably more trouble than it's worth."
"Yuna:I suppose they're a special case... I guess I shouldn't let it get to me. I have you guys to worry about, after all!"
"Basch:Indeed. The stronger our bonds, the harder it will be for Eald'narche to find and exploit a weak link between us."
"Lion:I agree, but I don't think we have much to worry about. If he tries something funny, he won't stand a chance against us!"
"Lion:As long as we trust each other, there's nothing we can't stand against."
Warrior of Light:We've made contact with one of Spiritus's warriors. They've asked to join forces for the fights ahead.
Materia:You speak of Eald'narche.
Onion Knight:So you know about him already. Good. We don't have to waste time explaining.
Onion Knight:Something was off. I think he's up to something.
"Onion Knight:He wants to know more about how this world works, and it seemed like he had it in mind to come visit you."
"Warrior of Light:If his intention is nefarious, we will protect you."
"Materia:Thank you, my warriors. Having you by my side sets my heart at ease. However..."
"Materia:Lest you forget, I am a god. You needn't worry about me so much."
Onion Knight:Don't forget what happenedlast time! I don't ever want to feel so powerless again.
Materia:You are too kind.
"Materia:With guardians such as you, I have nothing to fear. Can I depend on you to come to my aid, if Mog summons you?"
Warrior of Light:Of course. There is no task too great.
Materia:Thank you. I feel safer just hearing it.
"Cecil:There's no way for me to know. I doubt Eald'narche knows for certain either, for all his confidence."
"Cecil:Even if there were a way, it requires power beyond even his. I suspect that's why he came to us."
Firion:Wonder if he's taking advantage of us...
Cecil:I doubt he has any interest in us personally. He wants to get close to someone elsesomeone who knows much of the way of the world.
Firion:You mean...Materia!?
Onion Knight:We had that same thought. So we checked up on her.
Firion:Why am I not surprised? Should've known you'd have a hunch.
"Onion Knight:Heh. Well, I guess I'm just that good."
Cecil:How was she? Did anything seem odd with her?
Warrior of Light:Not as of yet. She said she would summon us the moment something seemed amiss.
"Cecil:Thank you. She is our guiding light, and we must keep her safe."
"Onion Knight:We need to be careful. We don't know where or when our enemies will strike, but we'll be ready with both eyes open."
Onion Knight:I'll do whatever needs to be done.
Warrior of Light:The dimensional coordinates give them many avenues to approach from. We must be vigilant.
"Warrior of Light:I won't let the past repeat itselfnot ever. Materia must be protected, at all costs."
"Eald'narche:Hmph. That one's quite full of himself, isn't he? Regardless, he's told me what I need to know."
"Eald'narche:The two gods are the pillars of this world. If they disappear, it will begin to crumble."
"Eald'narche:Such an easy target, if not for their meddling. How troublesome."
"Eald'narche:It doesn't matter, I suppose. Another chance will present itself before long."
???:Or could it be...that I was spared? Me alone?
"???:Ace, Cater, Cinque, King... Could it be that, while I remain, they"
???:No. That simply can't be.
???:I have retained my memories of them. It then stands to reason that they are still alive and well.
"???:...No, I mustn't jump to conlcusions. I need to remain calm and consider all possible situations."
???:Perhaps this means that the crystal itself is gone. But is such a thing even possible?
???:...Not that anyone is here to answer me. How terribly lonesome this place is...
"???:At any rate, I will suppose that I am alive and shall set out to find the others."
"Materia:It seems you've awoken, Trey."
Trey:Excuse me?
"Trey:My apologies, but...who are you?"
"Materia:I am Materia, one of two gods governing this world."
Trey:A god named Materia?
Trey:I regret to inform you that I've never once come upon such a name in the countless books I've read.
Materia:This is a world different from the one you are from.
Materia:Allow me to tell you about this place and the reason you're here now...
"Vivi:I... I'm really sorry, Mog..."
Tifa:Did something happen?
"Zidane:They're Mog's favorite, aren't they?"
Tifa:It must be quite a shock to have him looking so sad...
"Zidane:Then let's turn back! We can ask the others to be on the lookout, too!"
"Vivi:Really, Zidane!?"
"Mog:Thank you, thank you, thank you, kupo! You're my hero, Zidane!"
Tifa:I really hope we can find those kupo nuts...
Trey:How utterly shocking. To know that every world's very existence now hangs in the balance...
"Trey:And that not just myself, but warriors from other worlds were summoned for this purpose..."
Trey:What could that be...
Trey:Nuts? I wonder why they would be amongst all this rubble...
"Mog:Found 'em, kupooo!"
"Mog:Those are my prized kupo nuts! Thank you for finding them, kupo!"
Trey:...You are most welcome.
Vivi:I'm so happy we found them!
"Cait Sith:Well, we can check that off the list now!"
"Trey:Hmm... From your appearance, I gather you are warriors from other worlds."
Vivi:Huh? Your clothes...
Vivi:Could you be a friend of Mister Ace and the others?
Trey:So you know my classmates?
"Mog:Of course, kupo! We've been traveling together for a while now!"
Trey:So they're alive after all. What a relief...
Trey:How rude of me. Please call me Trey. I am a member ofClass ZerofromAkademeiain theDominion of Rubrum.
"Trey:But I suppose I am getting ahead of myself. According to legend,Agitoare meant to be the saviors of our world,Orience..."
Mog:K-kupo? What's he going on about?
"Cait Sith:Not sure, but he seems pretty enthusiastic about it. Let's hear him out."
Trey:...And that is the abridged history of our dear Akademeia and Class Zero.
Cait Sith:I get it now...
"Vivi:Thank you for teaching us that, Mister Trey!"
Trey:It was my pleasure. Thank you for listening!
"Cater:Wow, someone actually listened until the end... I guess there's a first time for everything."
Trey:Cater! Deuce!
"Deuce:It's nice to see you, Trey."
Cater:We came to check on Vivi and the others. We didn't expect to see you here!
Trey:I am relieved to see you both in good health. Where are the others?
Cater:Waiting over there. You had better go say hi!
Trey:I will.
Vivi:I'm so glad you can see your classmates again!
"Mog:And we found my kupo nuts and a new friend! Today was a great day, kupo!"
Trey:Take that!
Barret:Haha! Not bad at all!
"Trey:Why, thank you."
"Ace:It looks like your shots are as dead-on as ever, Trey."
Cater:And his stories as long as ever.
"Machina:...It's been a while, Trey."
Trey:What a surprise it is to see you in your human form...
Wakka:What's that mean?
"Machina:...I see. So you have all your memories, then."
"Machina:Trey, I owe you an apology."
Trey:Whatever for...?
Trey:...I see. So that's what transpired...
Machina:I won't ask for your forgiveness. I just...had to tell you the truth.
"Trey:Thank you for telling me, Machina. From now on, let us fight side-by-side."
Trey:Looking back at the past changes nothing. What matters is how we choose to live our lives from here on out.
"Trey:It seems like we cannot escape our fate of having to fight, but..."
Trey:I am happy that I can do so with everyone by my side.
Machina:...Thank you.
Cater:Hehe. That went well!
Ace:I knew Trey would understand right away.
"Barret:Lucky for us, he's got both brains and a heart!"
"Wakka:And brawn, yeah! That last battle was somethin' else."
"Trey:By the way, Machina, I have something to ask you."
Machina:What's that?
Trey:What happened to Orience after we died?
"Machina:...We started rebuilding. It wasn't easy, but everyone's doing the best they can."
"Trey:You were always a responsible one, Machina."
"Trey:How would you even begin to rebuild such a broken Orience, though?"
"Trey:Please, I'd like to hear more about your endeavors."
"Machina:...Heh, it's like old times."
"Machina:I want to hear your opinion, too, Trey. I can tell you all about it on the airship."
Trey:I insist!
Cater:I'm going to be old before this conversation is over...
Ace:What's the harm? Machina seems happy.
"Cater:Yeah, I guess so... Hehe."
"Cinque:Something on your noodle, Trey? You don't look so okey dokey."
Eight:You looked totally out of it.
Trey:Allow me to explain...
Trey:...I see. So you have a grandfather?
"Relm:Yeah! He's grumpy, smelly, and slow, but I've never seen anyone better at magic!"
Trey:Huh? A man of his age can use magic?
"Trey:Well, I suppose I've heard of stranger things."
Relm:What does age have to do with it?
"Trey:Quite a bit! In my world, only the young could wield magic."
"Trey:Please, when you have the time, tell me more about the machinations of magic in your world."
Trey:And she wasn't the only one I spoke with...
Eiko:...I used to live with moogles!
Eiko:With Mocha and Chimomo. And Momatose and Morrison! No one could ask for a better family!
"Trey:All of those moogles, just for you?"
Trey:I see... You must be from a war-torn world. You have my sympathies.
"Eiko:""War-torn""? What's that?"
"Trey:Well, if you have that many moogles to report on the battlefield for you, there must be fighting around every corner..."
Eiko:You aren't making any sense!
"Eiko:We never fight! Mostly we nap, go fishing, or cook. Ah, I miss those relaxing days with my moogles."
"Trey:I've never heard ""moogles"" and ""relaxing"" in the same sentence before..."
Trey:And furthermore...
"Trey:How does your weapon work, Squall? I've never seen anything like it before."
Squall:(Do I really have to talk to this guy?)
Zell:He pulls the trigger right as he brings down the sword and BAM! A bullet shoots out and the blade starts vibrating like crazy.
Zell:It cuts through steel like butter! There's not much that can stand against a gunblade at full strength.
"Squall:Thanks for explaining, Zell."
Trey:That's...the most moving thing I've heard today...
Trey:Your explanation. It was so succinct. So powerful.
Trey:It made me feel the fury of the gunblade. I heard its might in your expression!
Trey:I must ask you to teach me how to be so exuberant in my own speech!
"Zell:Uh, sure! Yeah, no problem!"
Cinque:Cinquey sees now! Your big brain got fried like an egg learning about the other worlds!
"Eight:It makes sense, I guess. You must've been even more shocked to be here than us."
"Trey:I want to know more. So much more. My hunger for knowledge has been piqued, and must be satiated!"
Cinque:Now that's the Trey I know! Full of passion!
"Eight:Yeah, maybe too full..."
"Trey:Hey guys, you having a strategy meeting?"
Laguna:Huh? A strategy meeting?
"Trey:Since you've all taught me so much, let me return the favor. I'll tell you all I know about warfare."
"Trey:First, you must find a high vantage point, so you can survey the entire battlefield."
Trey:A famous commander used to say a hundred troops could beat even ten thousand if they had the advantage of terrain.
"Cid:Read the room, buddy! We aren't talking about that!"
"Selphie:Yeah, we're talking about what we'll do when we get back home. Hmm... What should I do first?"
Trey:Get back home?
Bartz:I'm hopping on my chocobo and setting off on an adventure.
Arciela:I plan to eat cake until I burst!
Selphie:I'll plan another Garden Festival!
"Trey:Ah, it's just idle chitchat..."
Laguna:What should I do? Hmm... Travel the world I guess. Take on the challenges as they come.
Laguna:Yeah... I can think of a few places I wanna visit first!
Cid:I'm goin' to space. Nothin's gonna get in my way this time!
Trey:Space? That's a lofty goal.
"Laguna:Let me tell you, youngin'you gotta dream big!"
"Bartz:What about you, Trey? What'll you do when you get back home?"
Arciela:I'd love to hear. Tell us!
"Trey:Well, if you insist... I want to learn everything I can. I have the same appetite for knowledge that Arciela has for sweets."
Trey:And it's not just weapons or magic I want to study. It's everything. Everything and anything.
"Selphie:Wow, you're quite the student. Even when you're not in school!"
"Bartz:That doesn't surprise me. Trey seems like the smart type. Well, if you want to learn anything from me, just ask!"
Cid:Same with me! You don't have to wait till you get back home to start chasin' your dream!
"Cid:You wanna know anything about rockets or space, I'm your man! Just give me a shout!"
"Arciela:I've studied the forests, fields, and flowers quite extensively. I would love to give you a lesson."
"Trey:I... Thank you, everyone. I'll definitely be taking you up on your offers!"
Trey:Maybe this place isn't so bad after all. It's been a while since I've been able to relax and chat like this... Hmm...
"Materia:One of the pillars supporting this world, the crystal core of light, has already been shattered."
???:A shattered crystal... So this world is in peril.
"Materia:Indeed it is. The crystal's fragments become brilliance, which scatter across the world."
"Materia:But if gathered, the crystal core of light can be revived."
???:Like the resurrection. I see. Please continue.
???:...Is something the matter?
Materia:...Will you truly listen to my story?
"???:I find it quite fascinating, to be honest. Why do you ask?"
Materia:There are few here like you. Most warriors are first and foremost concerned with how to get home.
???:Understandably so. I am merely interested in what this world is like.
???:It is also the first time I have met a god. Perhaps you could say I am...enchanted by the situation.
Materia:I see. What I have told you is the essence of what has happened here.
"???:I understand the situation, and even the reason you have summoned warriors here."
Materia:Truly? Then will you lend them your strength?
???:I regret to say that that is a different matter.
Materia:...How so?
"???:There is something I must discern for myself. Before that, I cannot promise anything."
Materia:And what might that be? You can ask me anything.
???:It is not something you can tell me. I must ask Layle himself.
"???:What happened since then, if the world was saved or not... Until I know for sure, my heart cannot be at peace."
Materia:I see. Then allow me to help.
Materia:I have opened the path to Layle. Please take it.
???:I feel like I have seen this before...
???:But I cannot travel with this. Layle must pull me from the other side...
Onion Knight:Layle! Quick! Over here!
Onion Knight:A Torsion opened up and all these monsters came pouring out!
Onion Knight:Everyone's doing their best to stop them. We have to help!
Layle:You can leave that one to me...
Layle:But it seems like you and I won't be enough to take them all.
Garnet:This looks bad... There are still so many of them.
Cecil:Could it be a coincidence this many appeared near our base? Or is this someone's scheme?
Layle:But there's no mastermind in sight. So it might be a coincidence after all!
Layle:Torsions are the result of dimensional warping... So this might just be what happens if Torsions open up one after another.
Warrior of Light:Then we must rout the enemy. Perhaps we can put an end to this if we can stabilize the area.
Garnet:Alright. But...!
Cecil:This doesn't look good. I don't think we can take down this many.
Layle:And another Torsion just opened up. Who could it be this time
"Layle:(No, it can't be... Is it someone with the same armor?)"
"???:...Well, here we are again."
???:Have I come at a good time?
"Layle:It really is you. Perfect timing, Amidatelion."
Amidatelion:I am glad we could meet. There is something I must ask you.
"Layle:That's my line. But first, we've got to take care of this!"
Amidatelion:Very well. Allow me to take this side then!
"Amidatelion:It is good to see you, Layle."
Layle:...Yeah. I never thought we'd meet again. This world really is something else.
"Layle:But you seem the same as ever, powers and attitude included."
Warrior of Light:Thank you for your help.
"Garnet:So you're a summoner, too. I was surprised you defeated those monsters so quickly."
Amidatelion:I had something to ask Layle. Their interference was unwelcome.
Layle:Something to ask me? ...So some of your memories are missing.
Amidatelion:Do not worry. I remember everything.
Layle:And yet you're still in such high spirits... You're incredible.
"Amidatelion:More importantly, Layle, answer me this: does your presence in this world mean the resurrection was not completed?"
Layle:...You can rest easy. It was.
Amidatelion:I see...
"Amidatelion:Thank you, Layle. You have repaid your debt to me."
Layle:It's no big deal. I still owe you...
"Amidatelion:No, you do not. Even if it were only to hear those words from your mouth, coming here was worth it."
"Amidatelion:By the way, why have you stayed in this place?"
Layle:Uh... Well...
Cecil:We were summoned here to save this world.
"Amidatelion:Ah, yes, because this world is in peril. I have heard as much from Materia."
"Layle:That makes things easier. In sum, we can't leave until we save this place."
Layle:Would you help us get home?
"Amidatelion:When you ask me like that, I suppose I cannot deny you. But Layle..."
Amidatelion:You owe me one. Again.
"Edge:Well, if it isn't the newcomer!"
Amidatelion:Are you referring to me?
"Zidane:We haven't met anyone like you before, so we were asking Keiss about you."
"Keiss:In our world, Amidatelion is also a raritythe lone survivor of the Yuke tribe."
"Keiss:I'm aSelkieand Layle is aClavat, so you're better off asking Amidatelion directly if you're curious."
"Noel:Thanks, Keiss. That explains almost nothing."
Edge:Which is why we want to hear it from you.
Amidatelion:The reason we Yukes vanished was because our Tribal Crystal was shattered during the war.
"Amidatelion:Without it, we fell into the void between existence and oblivion...and were erased from the world."
"Zidane:So even though your tribe lives on in that void, you're no longer part of the world?"
"Keiss:Layle said he met other Yukes, so they weren't annihilated."
Edge:But living in hiding against your will...
Edge:That must be miserable.
Keiss:We Selkies were the same. We needed to reclaim our tribe's dignity.
"Amidatelion:Yes. It is a mission that must be accomplished, even if one must do so alone."
Ashe:Reviving your race all on your own? Your will is truly remarkable.
Noel:Isn't it...difficult sometimes?
Amidatelion:It was a mission given to me by the crystal. It is only natural I obey the Crystal Principle.
Zidane:I'm starting to see the way your mind works.
"Keiss:As a result, we were made to help. But everything worked out in the end."
"Amidatelion:It seems that way, yes."
Edge:What do you mean? You make it sound like you weren't there.
Amidatelion:I was not. I had to entrust my mission to Layle...
Amidatelion:I wish I could have witnessed it with my own eyes.
Ashe:Was this not your ardent desire? I would think it best you see for yourself.
"Amidatelion:Well, by that time, I had already"
"Edge:Even if you return, you have no future..."
Edge:I wonder what will happen to people like you after this world is gone...
"Edge:But since you're still alive here, you need to fight for your home world."
Ashe:Is the future of your world one worth protecting?
Keiss:...It is.
Amidatelion:...Indeed. It is as you say.
Amidatelion:Let us save this world...for the future of my people.
Eiko:Ohhh nooo!!
"Rydia:Eiko, what is it!?"
Eiko:I totally forgot about Mog! I promised I'd bring him along to the flower fields up ahead!
Eiko:Oh no... I feel so bad for breaking my promise...
Yuna:Don't get too down on yourself. I didn't see him when we got out either.
"Prompto:Yeah, there'll be a next time, I'm sure. The flower fields aren't going anywhere."
Eiko:Maybe... Hey Prompto... Are you sure we can't go back?
"Prompto:Ah, well... I dunno about that..."
Rydia:What do you think? Should we go back for Mog?
"Mog:Wha-!? Where am I, kupo!?"
Eiko:Mog! I'm sooo sorry!
Amidatelion:I take it this is satisfactory?
"Eiko:It is! Thank you, Amidatelion!"
Yuna:Did...did you just summon Mog?
"Amidatelion:Yes. So long as I know what to summon and where it is located, I can do the same for anything."
Yuna:Amazing... So it's not justaeonsoreidolonsthat can be summoned.
"Prompto:Hey, you knew that already! What do you think Noct does with his weapons?"
"Mog:And the gods, kupo! They summoned you all here!"
Rydia:That's right. It seems summoning takes on many different forms.
Yuna:What type of training did you undergo to learn this skill?
"Amidatelion:There was no training, Yuna."
"Amidatelion:I was chosen by the crystal, and given this gift."
Prompto:Chosen by the crystal?
"Amidatelion:That is correct. I was chosen to revive the Yuke, so that the four tribes could work together to restore the world."
Yuna:You would restore the world with the power of summoning? I didn't think it could be used for such noble goals.
"Rydia:Yeah! Like, if we ever forget something, you could just summon it!"
Yuna:Huh? That...wasn't what I had in mind.
"Eiko:If I could summon whatever I wanted, I'd have so much fun..."
"Prompto:I dunno... If you could just warp everywhere willy nilly, that'd take the fun out of the journey."
Amidatelion:He is correct. I do not use my abilities to serve others lightly.
Amidatelion:Consider this summoning a favor. I expect to be repaid in time.
Eiko:What!? I... Uh... If you want me to...
Eiko:I'll make sure to give you all the support you need during our next battle!
"Amidatelion:You will? Something tells me to expect the same amount of support as usual. You do seem earnest, however..."
Amidatelion:Very well. I accept your proposal. I look forward to seeing you fulfill it.
"Relm:That's some pretty neat armor. Could I paint you, pretty please?"
"Relm:Don't worry, it'll just be a regular portrait. Sounds fun, right? Right?"
"Amidatelion:Very well. If you wish to paint me, so be it. Allow me to strike a position that will make your work easy."
"Lulu:What are you doing, Relm? Painting? Quite the model you have there."
"Relm:That's right. I've never seen anything like Amidatelion's armor, so naturally I just had to paint it."
"Sherlotta:Wow, you captured everything down to the smallest detail. You've really pinned down the essence of the Yuke."
"Cait Sith:Why don't you two take a break? It's about time to eat, after all."
Relm:Sure thing. Be there in a bit.
Amidatelion:I will stay here. But know that I appreciate the invitation.
Yang:Hmm? You won't eat? Or you don't need to?
"Amidatelion:I have no need. This body is but a hollow suit of armor. And armor, as you know, does not require food."
Amidatelion:A Yuke's armor is less a garment than it is a house for their soul.
Relm:Whoa! Now I get it! That's why I can see right through your stomach!
"Sherlotta:So if your being is imbued into the armor, you can't just change bodies whenever you want."
"Cait Sith:It's sort of like me, but different. I suppose there's all types."
Yang:A body of pure armor must be nearly indestructible!
"Amidatelion:Yes, if my body falls to pieces, it is a relatively simple matter to reform."
"Amidatelion:However, if I lose a piece of myself, matters will soon turn grave."
"Lulu:Ah, so you do have your weaknesses."
Sherlotta:I see. You have to take care that your armor doesn't become too damaged.
Yang:Is that...not similar to our flesh and blood bodies?
Yang:The only difference being that Amidatelion's body is made of steel instead of bones!
"Amidatelion:I suppose that is not an incorrect observation. Indeed, while we may be different in many ways, in that matter we are not."
"Cait Sith:Hey, we might not all have bodies of steel, but we're all in this together. That means you too!"
Amidatelion:You are very welcoming. It feels...strange.
"Lulu:We may appear different to the eye, but that is all."
"Lulu:You speak frankly and logically, but not in a manner that I ever found odd."
Amidatelion:I see...you have put quite a bit of thought into this.
Relm:All done! Check it out!
"Yang:Oh my! She painted us too! Thank you, Relm!"
Cait Sith:So fast! I didn't even see you paint it! You really brought out my eyes.
Relm:Amidatelion is in the middle!
Amidatelion:It is an honor to be allowed a place among you all.
"Cait Sith:Hey, there's no need to be so formal! Now you've got friends from all different worlds."
"Lulu:Yes, quite a few of them, in fact."
Sherlotta:You don't have to be alone if you don't want to. It's all a matter of perspective!
"Amidatelion:I see. While I admit, being by myself has never been a cause for loneliness..."
"Amidatelion:...Your words are reassuring nonetheless. For now, I believe, I am happy."
Maria:Tidus! ...Where did he go?
"Cater:I know he said he saw someone, but why did he run off by himself?"
Onion Knight:I guess there's no point in asking. We had better get to searching.
Onion Knight:Hm? Someone's coming...
???:Hey. Looking for someone?
Cater:...Who's this? Do you know him?
"Maria:No, I do not. Which means..."
"???:You lost one of your friends? You're the same loser as always, I see!"
???:Oh? Are you the one with amnesia this time? It seems like you can't even remember my name.
Onion Knight:I don't have amnesia.
"Onion Knight:I was just surprised. I never thought I'd see you here, Desch."
Maria:Desch...is it?
"Desch:A pleasure. Look at you, traveling alongside these beauties!"
Cater:And here I thought you were the only one from your world.
Onion Knight:Is it so weird that I have friends?
"Cater:A little. I mean, you haven't talked about them at all."
"Maria:But at least you weren't fighting alone. Without friends, it would have been such a trying journey..."
"Maria:I know you are a fine knight, but I had my concerns since you're still so young."
Tidus:Found you!
Maria:We should be saying that. Please don't run off alone again.
Cater:Seriously... Then we'd have to look for two people.
Tidus:Never mind that. That's the guy I saw earlier! He's definitely one of us
Cater:Hey! It's rude to point... Huh?
Cater:A dragon!?
Tidus:And he's taking that guy with him!
"Desch:Put me down right now! ...No, I take that back! Put me down slowly! And gently!"
Onion Knight:You've got to be kidding me! Desch!
Maria:Shooting it down would be too dangerous...
"Onion Knight:Tch. I guess we have to go save him. Come on, everyone!"
Desch:Heeey! Over here!
Onion Knight:Kidnapped again? Just which of us is the loser now?
Desch:Hah hah! You got me there!
Sherlotta:What a carefree guy... There's no point in worrying about someone like this.
Desch:Did you young ladies worry about me?
"Sherlotta:Young ladies? Listen, kid"
"Onion Knight:Alright, alright. That's enough, Sherlotta. He didn't mean it like that."
Onion Knight:And Desch isn't worried because he isn't the type to die so easily.
"Steiner:Even so, you looked quite concerned earlier."
Onion Knight:Me? No way.
"Porom:Say what you like, but you couldn't hide your worries."
Desch:Oho! What a heartening thing to hear.
Onion Knight:Enough about me. I had better introduce you to the others.
Onion Knight:This is Desch. We journeyed together back home.
"Onion Knight:He's got a soft spot for women, but a trustworthy ally all the same."
Desch:You certainly don't forget a thing...
"Desch:In any case, I look forward to traveling with you all."
Sherlotta:Welcome to the team.
Desch:By the way...
Onion Knight:What is it?
Desch:You seem to have comrades from all over. Any from the same hometown?
"Onion Knight:Ah, well..."
Desch:It must have been lonesome for you. You should've summoned me sooner.
Onion Knight:That sort of stuff isn't up to me. The gods decide.
Porom:...Uh-oh. It looks like that dragon's back.
Desch:Let's save the catching up for later then.
Onion Knight:...Should we run?
"Desch:You're asking me? Well, considering there's a flock of them this time..."
"Onion Knight:Alright. Everyone, let's make a run for it!"
Desch:Run! Run for your lives!
Desch:Hahaha! Just like old times!
Onion Knight:Geez! I never thought I'd be running from dragons with you again!
Desch:Oh my! Look at these two lovely ladies!
Onion Knight:Good grief...
Lightning:As if we needed more guys like this...
Celes:Maybe he's like Edgar and thinks making a pass at someone is a form of courtesy.
"Desch:They're both very wary of me, I see... What ever shall I do?"
Desch:Haha! I was just kidding. I wasn't planning on making a move.
Zell:Who's Salina? Your girlfriend?
"Onion Knight:Well, you see"
"Desch:Okay, okay! You win!"
Zell:Hehe. Tell me more about it later!
Celes:It's interesting... Your expression changes when you talk to Desch.
Onion Knight:My expression?
Zell:Yeah! You look like you're enjoying yourself more than usual!
Lightning:I guess meeting an old friend's put him at ease.
Desch:Is it that different? That's nice to hear.
Desch:I felt relieved when I saw you here and surrounded by all these people.
"Desch:Saving this world, too..."
Desch:Didn't I tell you to call me when you go on another adventure?
Onion Knight:Saying things like that will make Salina worry.
"Desch:That's a different matter. You were here by yourself for a long time, weren't you?"
"Desch:I guess you weren't alone, but...you carried it on your own, didn't you?"
Desch:Didn't you ever feel homesick?
"Desch:Or a little lonely, wanting to reminisce about home...?"
"Desch:You're always so responsible. If others ask you for help, you can't say no, can you?"
"Onion Knight:...I am a knight, after all."
"Lightning:And a fine knight, too, regardless of age."
Desch:Those with a great destiny truly have a different resolve.
Desch:...But you're not the only ones.
Desch:You won't have to fight alone for our world.
Desch:I'm here to help now.
Celes:A reassuring thing to hear.
Desch:Oh? Have you had a change of heart?
"Onion Knight:But this journey is a dangerous one, too. Maybe even more so than before."
Desch:All the more reason for me to be here and share that burden with you.
Desch:I'm a reliable partner. And you'll regret it if you don't ask me for help.
"Onion Knight:Haha, I guess you're right. Thanks, Desch."
Rem:What!?
Setzer:I said we're having engine trouble!
Vaan:Engine trouble!?
Setzer:Our speed is petering out... I won't be able to maintain altitude!
Setzer:Is Mog over there? Ask him to fix this for us.
"Mog:I'm here, kupo... But, I don't think this is an easy fix."
Vaan:There's gotta be a way!
Cid:You lot are useless! I'll do it myself!
"Cid:You're coming too, Vaan. Don't know if that'll be enough, though..."
Rem:Is there anything I can do to help?
Desch:You can count on me. Just lead the way to the engine room.
Cid:Huh? What do you know about ships?
"Desch:You're short on hands, right? Let me come, and I'll figure out a way to help."
"Desch:I may not know much about the machinery in this world, but at the very least I can offer words of encouragement!"
"Vaan:I think we can make this work, Cid."
"Cid:Words of encouragement!? Whatever, there's no time to argue! C'mon!"
"Cid:I thought you were gonna be dead weight, but you got grit, and more know-how than you let on. Impressive work back there."
"Desch:When there's a task at hand, you either set yourself to it or suffer the consequences."
"Desch:Besides, I've repaired engines bigger than this ship's."
Rem:Bigger? How big?
"Vaan:Huh? Did you say ""continent""?"
Rem:That's what I heard...
"Mog:Really, kupo!? A whole continent!?"
Desch:Hah hah! You should see the looks on your faces! I have to mess around with you guys more often!
"Cid:Don't get my hops up like that, boy... All for a lousy joke."
Desch:There you are! I was looking for you!
Lightning:Why? What happened?
Desch:There's something I wanted to tell you and Celes!
Celes:So urgently?
Desch:Yeah. I wanted to apologize for uh...being a creep before.
Rem:Huh? What'd you say to them?
"Lightning:There's nothing to apologize for. Besides, your partner stopped you."
Lightning:So don't worry about it.
"Desch:You're letting me off too easy, Lightning."
Desch:It was just...it had been such a long time since me and him had traveled together. I was in such a good mood.
Desch:I think I was just trying to act cool. That's why I said those things.
"Celes:Well, I appreciate your honesty."
Rem:Does this have anything to do with Salina?
"Desch:So you heard about her, huh?"
Rem:Hehe. Thanks to Zell.
"Desch:Well, like I said, I'm happy to be adventuring with my partner again in this strange new world."
Desch:But I can't help worrying about Salina all the same.
Desch:I didn't even get to leave a letter behind. She's probably worried sick about me.
Bartz:And she can't even look for you. Sounds rough...
Desch:Her mother already thinks I'm a good-for-nothing.
Desch:And I guess this isn't going to do me any favors in that regard.
"Desch:Adventuring's not as carefree after you've set down roots, huh?"
"Lightning:Of course. Once you have something to protect, that's all you care about."
Rem:Do you want to go back home?
"Desch:Yeah, I suppose I do."
"Bartz:Then the adventure must go on. And at the end of it, hopefully we'll find a way for you to get home."
"Celes:That's right. Let your will to return home drive you on your journey, and you'll be guided back."
Desch:My will?
Lightning:That's what's important in this world.
"Desch:Right, of course. And I just want you to know: I really do want to help you guys. And my partner."
"Desch:But I also don't want to make Salina cry. It's probably too late for that, though..."
"Rem:I'm sure she hasn't given up hope. She's probably waiting for you even now, and when you return, you two can celebrate together."
Desch:Yeah! I hope so!
Desch:Then I guess I know what I'm fighting for! To find a way home! For Salina!
Cid:Hey! Anyone up top!?
Ignis:Yes. What seems to be the matter?
"Cid:This ain't no time to be spacin' out, boy! Knock that thing outta the sky right now!"
Ace:It's over there! In front of us!
Maria:I can hit it from here.
Ignis:Allow me to help.
[Monster]:Guaaah... Guh...
Ace:The monster's...gone?
Cid:You really made quick work of that thing! Great job!
Maria:But it isn't our victory to celebrate.
Cid:What? Then whose is it?
Ignis:A spear came out of nowhere and knocked that thing out of the sky.
"Ace:That's right. I didn't see where it came from, though."
"Cid:Then Kain's the hero of the day, is he?"
"Kain:Unfortunately, I'm not. It came from below."
Maria:From below? That means...
Ignis:Someone managed to hit their mark from all the way down there.
Ignis:It appears Kain may have some competition.
Ace:I only know one other person who's that good at using a spear...
"Maria:Everyone, look! There's someone on the ground!"
Ignis:You can see all that way? Impressive.
Maria:A keen eye is as important to an archer as bow or arrows.
"Ignis:Right, of course..."
"Ignis:Cid, lower the airship."
Cid:Roger that! Descending now!
"???:Oh, look. That got their attention."
"???:About time. Let's get this reunion started, yo."
Yang:Was it you who threw the spear? Hmm?
Yang:(That uniform... It resembles those worn by Ace and the others.)
"???:Hmm, don't recognize you. Is this flying hunk of junk yours, yo?"
???:Were you brought here bywhat's her name?Materia or whatever she's called?
Yang:You have the right of it. Are you
"Cid:Hunk of junk!? Didn't your parents teach you any manners, boy!?"
"???:What do you know about manners, old man!? You should be thanking me for saving you, yo!"
"Cid:Oh, so you do have a mother!? I guess she never told you to respect your"
"Yang:Calm down, you two. Arguing will get us nowhere."
Cater:Sounds like you both need to work on your manners.
"Seven:Glad to see you're as chatty as ever, Nine."
"Nine:There you are! I had a feeling you guys were on that ship, yo!"
Nine:How's everyone else? Hiding under the decks?
"Yang:Nine, was it? If you are a friend of my allies, then you are a friend of mine. It is apparent you meant us no harm."
"Cid:If he did, he wouldn't be standin' right now! And he's lucky that spear of his didn't miss!"
"Cid:If it had punched a hole in my precious hull, there'd be hell to pay!"
"Nine:That's some thanks! I should've let that monster wreck your ""precious"" ship, yo!"
"Seven:You can rest easy, Cid. Nine may look like a loose cannon, but his skill with a spear is unmatched."
"Cater:Still, everybody makes mistakes. Good thing he hit the right target this time."
"Nine:Have a little faith, okay? Besides, what was I supposed to do when I thought my friends were in trouble?"
"Nine:Anyways, as rickety as that thing looks, it's not like a single spear would smash it to pieces. Right, old man?"
Cid:Damn right it wouldn't! Especially not one thrown by those noodle arms!
"Nine:Materia told me you were out here, and when I saw the ship I had a good feeling."
"Nine:When that monster attacked you, I did the first thing that came to mind"
"Cater:And threw your spear. Well, your impulsiveness is as dependable as ever."
"Yang:Nevertheless, his aim was true and we were spared the beast's wrath. None can deny thatnot even you, Cid."
Cid:Yeah... Guess you're right on that count. Better that he acted than sat there twiddling his thumbs.
"Nine:Glad we can agree on something. Anyways, I've been looking for you guys all over. I need to take a load off, yo."
Seven:Just how long have you been here?
"Nine:How long? Well...I haven't really been keeping track! All I know is that I'm beat, yo."
Yang:You may rest inside the ship. I am sure your friends will be delighted to see you.
"Lann:Alright, Palom, how're we gonna prank everyone next, yo?"
"Palom:We need to be patient, yo. Let's wait until everyone is asleep, then we can scheme, yo!"
"Reynn:Hey, use your regular voices when you're being creepy!"
"Nine:What's up with those two, yo? They know they sound like idiots when they talk like that, right?"
"Reynn:Oh, Lann would sound like an idiot no matter how he talked."
"Lann:Ouch, that one hurt, yo!"
"Reynn:But now he's imitating people, too!"
Nine:Huh? Who are they imitating?
Deuce:I see you're already fast friends. I didn't know that was Lann at all!
Reynn:Don't encourage him!
King:I had a feeling you would get along.
"King:Lann always did remind me of you, Nine."
Reynn:I can see why. No offense.
Lann:That's right! We're bestest buds!
Deuce:Speaking of Orience...
"Nine:Everything, yo! Why wouldn't I remember it all?"
Nine:Wait... I guess I don't remember the people who died...
"King:I see... We need to talk, then. We"
Nine:I know. You made a choice.
"Nine:Everything from back then... It all feels like a dream. I don't even know what the hell's going on now, yo!"
"Nine:I just have to keep moving forward, and it'll come back to me eventually, right?"
"Nine:I'm glad we're finally back together, of course. But under that gladness...I dunno, something feels off..."
Deuce:I know what you mean.
"Palom:Come on, guys, smile! That's what friends do when they reunite, right? Everyone's safe and sound."
"Lann:Yeah! Be happy you met each other again... Oh, and be happy you met us, too!"
"Reynn:Hey, it only took thirty seconds for you to interject yourself into the conversation this time!"
"Nine:Yeah, you're right, yo! You guys aren't half bad!"
Lann:See! He likes us!
"Palom:I'm surrounded by children! I suppose that means I must be the responsible one. Everyone, follow me!"
"Nine:Are you coming too, Reynn? I mean, if Lann is..."
Reynn:What? Are you serious? I am so not like him! But I guess I will come along to keep him in line.
King:He hasn't changed. Still not a thought in his head but how to move forward.
Deuce:Still the same old Nine. I'm glad some things can be relied on here.
King:We all made our choiceswe all chose how to live. This must be the path he wanted to walk down.
Serah:What's going on over there? I don't like the looks of it...
"Wakka:They're...talking? I dunno, seems a bit heated. Fighting, maybe?"
Sherlotta:Does it matter? They look like they're having fun.
"Wakka:Well, we should keep an eye on them either way."
"Machina:I'm sorry, Nine. I don't expect you to be able to forgive me for what I've done."
"Nine:Is this why you called me here, yo?"
Machina:I'm talking about what happened in Orience. I don't know what came over me...
Machina:I caused trouble for everyone in Class Zero. Caused trouble for you. I understand if you guys hate me.
"Nine:I don't know what you're talking about, yo. I don't remember any of that."
"Nine:Look, I just do what I wanna do. Not everyone has to be a comic hero."
Machina:Huh? You mean a tragic heroine?
"Nine:You wanna be a heroine? I mean, that's cool, you do you, yo! Machina the heroine!"
Machina:I'm not talking about myself! That's what it's called! Haven't you ever read a book!?
"Nine:Hey! Don't get mad at me! I was just trying to be supportive, yo!"
Sherlotta:You. Are. So. Annoying! I can't stand watching you two bicker!
"Wakka:If you wanna fight like kids, maybe you should go to bed without supper."
"Nine:A fight? Well, call it what you want. That's what family does, yo."
Machina:You thought we were fighting just now?
"Sherlotta:Whatever it was, I bet you guys would be at it for days if we didn't interrupt you!"
"Machina:Seems strange to call it fighting. That's the same way I act with Ace, too."
"Sherlotta:Yeah, just because you were family, doesn't mean you'll never fight."
"Serah:I know how that is. My sister gets mad when I stay quiet, but whenever I say something it turns into an argument."
"Wakka:That's because you respect each other, or you wouldn't bother arguing. It's the same with you two, right?"
"Machina:Respect? To be honest, I thought he might not ever talk to me again..."
"Nine:You think too much, yo! You shouldn't spend so much time worrying about things by yourself!"
"Machina:I know, but...that's just how I am. I'll try not to keep things bottled up, just give me a little more time."
"Nine:A little more? Come on, Machina, don't be so glum!"
"Nine:I've said it before: if you're Class Zero, you're as good as family!"
Machina:You mean that?
Machina:Maybe...maybe that's all it takes.
"Machina:Thanks, Nine."
"Nine:My head hurts, yo! I gotta take a break."
"Jack:Yeaaah, you can say that again. I'm all studied out!"
"Quistis:My apologies, I was having too much fun. Yes, let's take a quick break."
Ignis:Time passes quickly in good company. I was absorbed in your lesson.
"Quistis:Good. I was worried that since our worlds are different, my lessons wouldn't stick. But if you enjoyed them, then they're worth continuing."
Ignis:They were more than enjoyable. I forgot how much I missed sitting in a classroom.
"Porom:I had fun, too! We might be from different worlds, but your lessons can apply to so much!"
Porom:Promise to teach us more?
Nine:Glad someone's having fun.
Jack:You guys are weird. We didn't come here to study!
Quistis:King and Seven asked me to watch over your studies.
"Nine:I don't mean to brag, but I never studied and no one ever got on my case, yo!"
Jack:How am I not surprised.
"Nine:It's all about how you perform in battle, yo! What do I need books for!?"
Porom:But how often do you have the chance to learn from such a skilled teacher? You should relish the opportunity!
"Jack:...Weeell, if you put it that way."
"Nine:I can't say no to that, yo."
Ignis:I appreciate your honesty. Then perhaps you wouldn't mind learning with us a while longer?
"Nine:Sure, why not."
"Nine:I'm not gonna last much longer, yo."
Jack:Ugh. I don't think my head can fit any more stuff in it.
Quistis:Hmm. Maybe we were going too fast.
Ignis:Then allow me to explain it to them and review the material at the same time. Teaching others often increases your own understanding.
Porom:That's a good idea! Hearing it from someone else might shed new light on the material.
"Nine:Well, I dunno about"
"Nine:Dang, we gotta get rid of this thing first, yo!"
Quistis:Of all the times! Can't it wait until the lesson is over!?
Porom:What do we do!? The wind is messing everything up!
Ignis:We must calculate the wind resistance before striking. A slight misstep would be grave.
"Jack:Nice one, Nine! Leave the rest to me!"
"Quistis:Great job, you two! That was impressive."
"Nine:Easy peasy. I never miss, yo!"
Porom:Now what does this mean?
"Ignis:I think I know. These two learn through practical experience. Analysis is not their forte, action is."
"Nine:Duh! In the heat of battle the one to act first wins, yo! You gotta think with your body, not your head!"
"Quistis:I'd never thought of it that way before, but it certainly is an interesting perspective! I might just have to consider more experimental lesson plans..."
"Nine:Hey now. Don't get any funny ideas, yo!"
Nine:I'm not gonna be your guinea pig!
Rydia:Take that!
Celes:Tch...! There's no end to them...
Cid:And I'm runnin' outta gas. We need to do somethin' or else
Cid:...What's that noise?
Rydia:It sounds like a harp.
Rydia:It couldn't be...!
Celes:Look! The monsters collapsed!
Cid:What the heck's going on here!? Those monsters fell down the second they heard that music!
???:Thank goodness. It looks like I made it just in time.
Rydia:Edward! It really was you!
"Edward:Good to see you again, Rydia. Are those the warriors from other worlds?"
"Celes:Is he a friend of yours, Rydia?"
"Rydia:Yeah! That music sounded familiar, so I had a feeling it was him!"
Edward:A pleasure to make your acquaintance. I am Edward Chris von Muir.
Edward:I heard about your plight from the goddess. She said that the dimensions are
"Cid:Hey, watch out!"
Edward:What? Waaah!
"Rydia:Edward! Ohhh, you're as oblivious as ever!"
Edward:Here it comes!
"Celes:We can talk later. Everyone, get ready!"
"Cecil:Are you alright, Edward?"
"Edward:Haha. That was a close one. Thank you, Cecil."
Cecil:Allow me to introduce you to our friend Edward.
"Yang:Precisely, Lord Irvine. Though he is more than your average bard."
Faris:Royalty masquerading as a bard? You've got some weird hobbies.
"Edward:For generations, the Damcyan royal family has been both merchants and minstrels."
"Edward:It seems the skills of the latter flow more strongly in my blood, however..."
"Mog:I'm glad they do, kupo! Your song saved us!"
Yang:I expected no less of Lord Mog. It seems he has already noticed.
Irvine:Noticed what?
Cecil:The timbre of Edward's harp can seal the powers of monsters.
Irvine:No way! I've never met anyone like that before. That's incredible!
"Faris:You don't look it, but you're a fighter! I had you all wrong, Edward."
"Irvine:When you fell over earlier, I thought you were a complete coward, but..."
Edward:I guess...I am a coward...
"Cecil:No, Edward."
Cecil:You are a kindhearted and brave man.
"Yang:Indeed. Even when you were bedridden, you aided us with the song from your harp."
Yang:You are a trustworthy ally.
Irvine:Whoops! I guess I should've been clearer. That was just my first impression!
"Faris:You seem about as delicate as you look, though."
"Mog:But his courage is true, kupo! Without a doubt!"
"Mog:I want you to use that courage to help us save our worlds! Will you come with us, kupo?"
"Cecil:I hope you will, Edward."
Yang:Lend us your strength once again. Everyone here wishes it so!
Edward:Thank you...
"Edward:If you insist, I will gladly join you on your journey."
Edward:...That should do it. We can keep going now.
"Cecil:Thank you, Edward. You're as reliable as ever."
Rydia:I know! You're so different than the Edward back then.
Vivi:What do you mean?
Rydia:He was always crying.
Edward:I would prefer you didn't speak of that...
Hope:I remember being just like that a long time ago.
"Edward:I would like to hear about it...if you don't mind, that is."
Hope:I always pushed the responsibility onto someone else in a fight and only ever thought of running away...
Hope:But Lightning made me realize that nothing would change if I kept running.
"Vivi:I was also afraid of fighting. Even now, I get scared sometimes..."
"Vivi:But when I'm with everyone, I understand... Not doing anything is even scarier."
Edward:I see... So I wasn't the only one who was weak at the start.
Firion:No one is born strong.
Firion:We become strong when we find a reason to fight or something to protect.
Cecil:Love for one's companions turns into extraordinary courage...
Cecil:You are proof of that. So you can hold your heads up high.
Edward:...You're right. I became strong because of my friends.
Rydia:So no more hiding?
Edward:...I think not. I want to protect everyone.
"Vivi:...I think you and I can get even stronger, Mr. Edward."
"Vivi:Because I want to protect all of our friends, too."
Edward:I won't let you down. I will hold the courage you gave me in my heart!
"Raijin:Hey, Edward. Mind if I ask ya somethin'?"
"Edward:Oh, you look distraught. What's wrong?"
"Raijin:Well, it was on the airship, ya know? I was bringin' Seifer a drink."
"Raijin:But then the ship started shakin', ya know? And I spilled it all over him!"
"Raijin:And he's mad as all get out! He won't listen to a word I say, ya know? I dunno what to do."
Locke:Why's he getting so mad over a little spill?
"Raijin:But it drenched his coat, ya know? Seifer loves that coat more than anythin'!"
Freya:We all have our peculiarities. Perhaps there's something we could do to calm him.
Freya:Seifer isn't one to show his true feelings in front of others. He enjoys bluster.
Edward:True. Perhaps we could use this to find out how he feels.
"Raijin:Eh? How do you mean? That's just a piece of grass, ya know?"
Locke:Really? Now that's what I call a treasure! Mind if I have one?
Edward:...Perhaps when this fight is over.
Seifer:Ugh. Finally the stain is gone. What a pain.
Seifer:What do you think!? That clumsy good-for-nothing!
"Edward:Now, now. There's no need for name calling."
"Edward:Raijin was only looking out for you. In fact, he was getting you something to drink. You did know that, right?"
Seifer:Huh? A drink? Really?
Seifer:So let's say he is. It doesn't change what he did...
Seifer:Gah! I don't wanna talk about it anymore! Just get outta here!
"Edward:Whatever you say, Seifer. Farewell."
Seifer:He thinks like a kid. Like a drink would make me feel better...
Seifer:...Maybe I was a little hard on him.
Seifer:Fine. I'll forgive that blockhead.
"Seifer:""Fine. I'll forgive that blockhead."""
Raijin:Did ya hear that? He's not mad at me anymore!
Edward:It appears your friendship is safe after all.
"Raijin:Thanks, Edward! If it weren't for you, who knows how long Seifer would've been sulkin' for, ya know?"
"Raijin:I'm gonna go talk to him. C'mon, Fujin."
Locke:You sure went to a lot of trouble to fix their drama. Not everyone would have the patience.
Edward:It's because of my own friends that I've become what I am. And friends can't help each other when they're fighting.
Freya:You are wise beyond your years. That was a clever strategy.
Edward:I'm just glad I was able to help my allies.
"Serah:You know, something has always interested me."
"Serah:Edward and Thancred are both bards, but I couldn't imagine two more different people."
Thancred:Is that so?
"Tifa:Yeah. As soon as you see a girl that catches your fancy, your head is filled with sonnets and romantic rhymes."
Tifa:Edward isn't so easy with his words.
"Thancred:Now, now. I take great care with every word I speak."
Edward:No two bards are the same in their role. I assume it's the same in all worlds.
"Lion:Where I'm from, mostbardsserve to boost morale and support soldiers in battle."
Lion:Their melodious voices bolster others beyond their limits. Every troop needs one.
"Agrias:A song sung with conviction has power on the battlefield. Inmy worldas well,bardsare often sought after as mercenaries."
"Thancred:Mercenaries? I suppose that isn't so odd, considering how common it is to hear their songs on the battlefield."
"Thancred:That being said, my songs aren't fit for fighting. I simply aim to express my love for beauty when I see it."
"Serah:And you see beauty everywhere you look, no doubt."
Edward:Expressing love proper is no simple matter. You can't hope to find inspiration from just anyone.
Edward:It's a decision that's made by your heart. A rare decision. A beautiful decision.
Serah:Now that's the kind of love song I want to hear.
Tifa:Me too. A love song just for me.
"Lion:Hmm, it sounds like Edward is the true romantic here."
Thancred:Hah. Perhaps.
Agrias:No arguments?
Thancred:Our heart's desires do not take on the same form for everyone. Who's to say what's proper and what isn't?
"Thancred:That being said, I would very much like to hear an ode to love composed by our dear Edward."
Tifa:Me too!
"Edward:Apologies, but a song of that nature may be quite difficult for me at present."
Serah:Really? That's too bad.
Edward:(I must first confront my past self.)
"Edward:(I hope you're looking down on me, Anna. I hope my actions in this world bring a smile to your face.)"
???:Not a soul to be found no matter where I go... Where could Relm be...?
???:Hm!? Who's there?
"???:Just some monsters, and at a time like this..."
"???:Ho ho ho! You couldn't beat me, not in a hundred years!"
Zell:What was that noise?
"???:Oho, human voices! It's about time."
Selphie:Owwie! My head is throbbing!
Barret:What's an old man doing out here? Are you the one who made that noise!?
"???:Indeed, that was me."
???:Would you happen to know a little girl named Relm? She's my granddaughter
"Cinque:Hey, didn't that noise earlier sound like one of those icky monsters?"
Zell:You have a point...
Selphie:I got it! He's a monster in disguise!
"???:Wh-what!? N-no, I'm"
"Barret:Hold on a sec. Didn't he just say ""Relm""...?"
"Zell:You may look like a harmless old man, but we know what you are! Prepare yourself"
???:Gah! I can't believe this!
Cinque:He's getting away! After him!
???:Huff... What a mess I've gotten into. What is wrong with those people?
"Tifa:Are you okay, sir?"
Cecil:Were you attacked by monsters?
???:...They look more likely to listen than those brutes from earlier...
"Strago:My name is Strago, and I was attacked not by monsters, but four humans..."
"Strago:But more importantly, do you know a young girl named Relm?"
"Tifa:We do! Are you, perhaps, her grandfather?"
Strago:That voice...! Relm!
"Relm:It is you, Grandpa! I missed you!"
"Strago:I missed you, too! Unh... My vision's blurry... I can't see anything...!"
"Cecil:We heard about this man before. He's Relm's grandfather, right?"
Tifa:Looks like it. Haha... I'm so happy they could see each other like this.
Selphie:Whaaat! So he wasn't a monster after all?
Selphie:We really got ahead of ourselves there... Sorry.
Tifa:Good grief... You act as if we don't have other blue magic users in our group.
Barret:I tried to tell 'em. He said he was looking for Relm...
"Strago:Your apologies could use some work, but...I found Relm, so it matters not."
Strago:I was so focused on looking for her I wandered into a place I've never seen...
Strago:But I never expected it to be a completely different world.
Cecil:Strange occurrences in this world are posing a threat to the existence of all others.
Tifa:We're trying to stop that.
Strago:What a grave and depressing tale...
Strago:And now my back hurts. I think I threw it out while running away...
"Barret:You okay, old man? Maybe you should sit down over there."
Selphie:I guess that's just the joy of getting older!
"Relm:Oh, don't baby him! My grandpa looks old and frail, but he's super strong!"
Relm:I'll prove it to you! Just give me a sec to draw a picture!
Tifa:Hey...Relm. What're you drawing? I hope it's not what I think it is...
"Relm:If you think it's a monster, then good job! Ta da!"
Strago:Relm... Did you really have to draw this?
"Relm:Hey, old man! Don't let them hear that pitiful voice! Whining won't win you any points now!"
Relm:Show them what you're made of! Or are you okay with us treating you like an old fuddy duddy!?
Strago:Hmph... Alright already! If you insist...
"Strago:There's still life in these bones! Take that, you monster!"
Barret:Whoa! He beat it with a single spell!
Selphie:Incredible! Relm was right! He only looks super-duper-duper ancient!
Strago:Heh. That was nothing. I'm just getting warmed up!
Strago:You kids have nothing to worry about now! You'll be safe as long as I'm around.
Tifa:...He sure got on board fast.
Cecil:Haha. He's just trying to make his granddaughter proud.
"Cecil:And besides, we'll always welcome another reliable ally to our ranks."
"Relm:Yay! Welcome to the team, Grandpa!"
"Mog:This area is all clear thanks to everyone's hard work, kupo!"
Strago:Over so soon...
"Zack:Something wrong, Strago? You seem disappointed."
Strago:I was looking forward to seeing all sorts of monsters since I came to this world.
Lenna:Monsters? But why?
"Locke:Strago is more than just a mage. He's a monster researcher, too."
Zack:What!? Really!?
Lenna:I see. That explains why you're so good at blue magic.
"Strago:When I was young, I traveled the world to study monsters."
Strago:I was in my prime! I wish you kids could've seen me then! Ho ho!
Zack:That's amazing! I can't imagine you ever being young!
"Strago:You know, sometimes just a compliment is enough..."
Lenna:I imagine you've seen every monster there is out there by now.
Strago:...Not quite.
"Mog:It must be super rare if you've never seen it, kupo!"
"Zack:I hope you find it, gramps! I'm rootin' for you!"
Strago:It was a dream of my youth. But I don't care anymore...
"Relm:Stop being such a bore, Grandpa!"
"Relm:You hate being treated like a dusty old man, don't you? So stop acting like one!"
"Strago:Ouch! I never need to find another monster when I have you, my dear!"
Locke:I've found all kinds of treasure I've never even dreamed of since coming here.
"Locke:So there's a chance you'll run into that monster of yours here, too."
Zack:He's right! You should never give up on your dreams! It's never too late to accomplish anything!
Strago:You can make your dreams come true no matter how old you are...
"Strago:You're right. I feel twenty years younger already! I'll keep on looking, then!"
Relm:That's the spirit! Now you're really acting like the grandpa I know!
Strago:Let's go! We have monsters to discover!
"Strago:I see I'm not the only one with grandkids around here. We'll teach these young whipper snappers a thing or two between us, Galuf."
Galuf:That we will. It's a shame it took us so long to meet.
"Galuf:Well then, Krile, go on and introduce yourself."
"Krile:Krile, at your service. Nice to meet you, Strago."
"Strago:Ah, such manners. Would that the young ones I know were all so polite."
"Palom:Hey, gramps! Heads up!"
Strago:Huh? Uwaaah!
"Strago:Ugh, my head..."
Krile:Strago! Are you hurt?
Galuf:That looked painful.
Strago:I'm tougher than I look.
"Palom:Sorry about that, gramps!"
"Yuri:Come on, Palom, we have to apologize properly."
"Yuri:I'm sorry, Strago. We were playing with Wakka's ball, and things got a little out of control."
"Strago:Well, I just thank the heavens you weren't playing with a weapon."
Galuf:I've seen that ball be used to deadly effect...
"Porom:Hey, you two!"
Chelinka:We need to talk! Get over here!
Palom:Oh no! They saw us!
Yuri:We're going to catch an earful now...
"Porom:I'm so sorry, Mr. Strago. It won't happen again."
Chelinka:Please forgive our brothers. They're always like this.
"Strago:Not to worry, not to worry. Relm has taught me to expect much worse."
Krile:She's lucky to have such a kind grandfather.
"Galuf:I suspect he's kind in spite of her, and not thanks to her."
"Galuf:I'd take a dozen Paloms over a monster like this, however!"
"Strago:It's our time to shine, Galuf! Protect the children!"
Krile:Grandfather! Strago!
Porom:Leave this one to us! We can handle it!
Strago:That's some impressive magic! Perhaps you should be protecting me!
Palom:Over already!? But we just got here!
Yuri:We didn't even have a chance to help.
Krile:You'll have to be quicker next time.
Palom:Over there! Another monster!
Yuri:Come on! Last one there's a rotten egg!
"Chelinka:Krile, Porom! We have to go after them!"
"Galuf:They hardly need the likes of us, do they? Such brave souls."
Strago:And I thought Relm had spunk...
"Strago:Well, we shouldn't let all our new grandchildren out of our sight."
Strago:Wait for me!
Strago:Phew... So...tired. Can't walk another step...
Relm:Grandpa! What're you doing? Pick up the pace!
Freya:We've been walking for some time. Perhaps he needs a rest.
"Eight:Ah, right, gotta respect our elders and all that. Let's take a break, yeah?"
"Relm:Hey, don't give him special treatment! You're just spoiling him!"
Relm:I'm going ahead. You guys better not keep me waiting for long!
"Strago:Hehe... She never lets up, does she?"
"Snow:Hey old timer, need me to carry you?"
"Strago:I can walk, I can walk. I'm not that old yet."
"Snow:Hey, there's no need to act proud in front of us."
Freya:That voice. It's...
Strago:Relm! She's in trouble!
"Strago:Don't worry, Relm! Grandpa's coming to save you!"
"Snow:H-hey! Strago! He doesn't look very tired now, does he?"
Eight:We better follow!
"Relm:Get away, you monster!"
"Strago:I made it just in time. Are you okay, Relm?"
Relm:Wh-what're you so out of breath for!?
Relm:I could've taken that monster down all by myself!
"Strago:Hahaha, is that so? Then I apologize for interrupting your fun."
"Strago:And by the way, Relm..."
Relm:What is it? I hate when you get that serious expression on your face.
"Strago:...Promise me you'll stay safe, Relm. Don't run off like that."
"Strago:If anything were to happen to you, I don't know if these old bones could bear it."
"Relm:I... Ah. I understand. Sorry for worrying you, Grandpa."
"Strago:You don't need to apologize, Relm. Just keep my request in mind, okay?"
"Snow:Did you see that? I thought he was just a grumpy old man, but he smoked that monster!"
Eight:Yeah. Relm is the source of his power.
Freya:The love between family members is a sight to behold. There is little that can stand against it.
Mog:Kupo! Mateeeria! I'm baaack!
"Materia:Welcome, Mog. It is good to see you, as always."
Materia:How fare Ace and the others?
"Mog:Better than ever, kupo!"
"Mog:It hasn't always been easy, but they're keeping their heads up high!"
Materia:I see. That is heartening to hear...
Mog:Kupo? What's wrong?
Materia:I'm troubled by the negative will they seem to bear...
"Materia:Those of evil intent can sense it, and will stop at nothing to use it to their advantage."
"Mog:Hmm...now that you mention it, kupo, Machina did tell me about a strange person that he encountered."
"Mog:They all seem in high spirits now, but they're still on their guard, kupo. I'm not sure what else I can do..."
"Materia:I see... Well, then it is obvious that they may need a guiding presence to look toa beacon, if you will."
Materia:And I have found just such a warrior. May he see you through these troubled mists.
"Mog:Oh, you're always looking out for us, kupo! We're so lucky to have you on our side!"
"Deuce:Alright guys, we're almost done here!"
"Cater:The sooner we finish up, the sooner we can rest, so let's get going!"
"Steiner:Ah, it truly is refreshing to be among such enthusiastic faces."
"Zell:I was worried about youwhen your memories came back, but it looks like I didn't need to!"
Zell:Even Machina is looking...almost normal. I better not see that frown come back!
"Machina:Yeah, sure."
???:I see you have not forgotten your pride.
Steiner:Who is this? One of your classmates? His uniform resembles yours.
Cater:I've never seen him before.
Deuce:Do you know us?
"???:Ah, theCrystal'sblessing at work, I see."
Machina:What!? You wanna fight!?
???:Of course. I was sent here to usher you to your final resting places.
"???:And now, allow me to fulfill that duty."
Zell:Hooold up! That didn't sound very friendly to me!
"Steiner:Indeed. Zell, let us not leave our allies to their fates. If he means to harm them, then he must fight through us."
"Machina:Thanks, guys. All right, everyone, let's put this guy in the dirt!"
???:...I had thought perhaps this new world had made you soft. I am glad to see you have not neglected your training.
Ace:Don't talk to us like you know us! We don't have any idea who you are!
Kurasame:I am Kurasame Susaya.
"Rem:Wait, are you...?"
"Kurasame:Your teacher? Yes. Or perhaps ""Commander"" is more appropriate."
Ace:What!? You!?
Zack:I'm confused. How could you forget your own commander?
Auron:It's not unheard of in their world.
"Rem:Yeah, thanks to the Crystal's blessing..."
"Rem:That's why we don't remember you. I suppose someone must have taught us what we know, though..."
Kurasame:The graveyard? Hmph.
"Auron:When someone returns from the dead, it's usually for a reason."
"Mog:Hello everyone! Let me introduce the newest warrior of light, kupo!"
Zack:Now here's a familiar face. Care to fill us in?
Ace:I see. So Materia sent him.
Kurasame:Sorry for the little deception before. I had to make sure of your skills.
Zack:You didn't look so sorry when you were fighting.
Rem:Now it makes sense. You seemed to know all our moves.
Rem:Almost like...you taught us them yourself.
"Kurasame:If your memories have not been knocked loose by now, then there is no point in standing here. Let us go."
"Ace:Wait, hold on!"
"Ace:You've come to help us, and I appreciate that. But we can't just let you join us."
Mog:Kupo!? Why not?
"Ace:In this world, we fight by choice. Our own choice."
Ace:I don't want to go back to following orders. That would mean going back on everything that's happened.
Kurasame:Very well. I will not force my company upon you.
Kurasame:But I have no intention on passing down orders.
"Kurasame:If it helps, simply think of me as a classmate. I may be older, but we will be equal."
"Kurasame:In fact, I welcome the change."
Ace:Uh... Okay...
Rem:I uh...don't really get it either.
Zack:That's 'cause you aren't older yet! You'll get there!
Auron:Hmph. That they may.
"Cinque:Ooh, that's it!"
"Cinque:Cinquey saw his name before! And not just in the spooky-wooky cemetery, either..."
"Jecht:""Knowing Tag""? What's that?"
Eight:It's a form of identificationit has all our personal information written on it. Everyone in Akademeia is given one from the time they're born.
Prompto:So it's like an ID?
"Cinque:Something like that... When someone dies in Orience, everyone forgets they ever existed."
"Eight:Right. By collecting the Knowing Tags of the deceased, we can confirm that they once lived."
"Eight:It's the only thing that's left behind, the only evidence of their life."
"Tidus:So, if all of you remember seeing this guy's tag, that means..."
Kurasame:Hah. That means they collected it. I suppose that I really have died.
Jecht:Hmph. Usually that's not a laughing matter.
"Eight:Aren't you scared? After this ends, we'll..."
Kurasame:Scared? Why would I be? I am overjoyed.
"Kurasame:To be given life anew, and step forth into this land of respite... Heh, or so some like to call it."
Cinque:Doesn't that make you sad? That would make Cinquey cry...
"Kurasame:Memories of my life may have been washed clean in Orience, but here, in a different world, memories of my deeds will remain."
Kurasame:I will leave behind proof of my existence. That is all I wish for.
"Prompto:Makes sense. Even if you're gone, we'll still remember you."
Prompto:The time we spent together won't be gone. Neither will the things you teach us.
"Tidus:Yeah, just because you can't see something doesn't mean it was never there. Some things live inside us forever."
Eight:Like our fighting styles. The commander taught us everything we know.
"Cinque:That's right! Even if we can't remember him, that proves he was here!"
"Cinque:And everyone will remember me in that way, too!"
"Kurasame:You were all exceptional students, and did not shirk from even the most dangerous missions."
Kurasame:I expect the same from you in this world as well. Do not disappoint me.
Cinque:We won't! We're no scaredy-cats!
"Tidus:Did you hear that!? A monster, from over there!"
Eight:All right. Time to hustle!
"Jecht:Heh, I think it'll be good to have you around, Commander."
"Jecht:This world is just a continuing dream for both of us, eh?"
"Jecht:A gift from the gods. Best not waste it, eh?"
"Kurasame:Heh, a dream, indeed..."
Kurasame:A more fantastic one than I've ever seen.
"Kurasame:So, Nine. Can you recite the four major countries of Orience?"
"Nine:You making fun of me, yo!? What kind of question is that!? Even a kid knows the answer!"
"Nine:There'sRubrum...andMilites. Oh, andLorica, of course. And then... Uh..."
"Kurasame:So, you've been keeping up with your studies? Impressive. There was a time when you wouldn't have been able to answer that question."
"Nine:Hey, you don't get to make fun of me! I'm not Wait...how'd you know that?"
Jack:Om nom nom...
Kurasame:Jack. What's Akademeia's policy on food in class?
Jack:I Ack! Something's...stuck...
Serah:Hah. He knows those two so well.
"Shantotto:A teacher must know his students' propensities, or else his lessons will be met with naught but enmity."
Quistis:Quite true. Many lessons have been ground to a halt because a teacher couldn't stop their students from acting up.
"Shantotto:So you have known the tribulation, doubtless suffering much frustration!"
"Serah:I can't wait to see my students. I wonder if they're studying while I'm gone. Not all of them are, I'm sure."
Kurasame:Every class has its problem students. It's enough to make you want to quit teaching.
"Shantotto:If the importance of study you seek to impress, then the depth of your skill you should try to stress."
Kurasame:An instructor's role is to tell them how to act on the battlefield. Why should I have to prove anything to them?
Serah:Don't you think the difficult students are just a little more interesting than the obedient ones?
"Quistis:Hmm... Sometimes, I suppose."
"Kurasame:Ah, so you are all teachers as well? I suspected as much."
"Kurasame:My students may need your help again in the future, so I apologize ahead of time for the imposition."
"Shantotto:A willing teacher learns as well, and I'd be happy to help you excel."
"Serah:It won't be an imposition at all. Your students are honest, and I can tell they're kind at heart."
Quistis:Indeed. They've been taught well.
Kurasame:Hmph. Sometimes I wonder.
"Nine:Hey, teach! Ask me more questions, yo!"
Shantotto:Your students call for their educationmake this next lesson a revelation.
"Kurasame:I'll do what I can, but kids can be so cruel."
"Quistis:Hmm... He's quite shy when receiving praise, isn't he?"
"Trey:Is something the matter, Commander? You've been staring at Interceptor for some time now."
Eiko:Ah hah! Kurasame used to live with a dog!
Rinoa:A tonberry...
"Rinoa:Wait, what!? A tonberry!?"
Eiko:How? Why? Wheeere! That's weeeird!
"Kurasame:When I was a child, I nursed a wounded tonberry back to health. Ever since then it followed me everywhere I went."
"Rinoa:Then you got attached to it, and couldn't bear the thought of returning it to where it came from."
"Kurasame:Well, not exactly..."
Trey:I never thought the infamous Ice Reaper would be so compassionate. You truly can't judge a book by its cover.
Kurasame:The Ice Reaper? I have not heard that name in a long time.
Rinoa:What's that? Who's the Ice Reaper?
"Trey:One of theFour Champions of Rubrum, a group of the strongestAgito cadets. Our Commander was the Ice Reaper."
Trey:His skill with ice magic was fearsome to behold and would chill the hearts of his foes on the battlefield.
"Trey:At least, according to the books I read."
"Eiko:Hmm. I didn't know he was such a scary guy. He seems nice enough to mea little quiet, though."
Trey:Him and Shadow have more in common than their taciturn demeanorthey're naturally attracted to animals.
"Eiko:I don't know if I agree with calling a tonberry an ""animal""..."
Trey:I see! It must be their loneliness that attracts animals.
"Rinoa:Yeah, they need someone by their sides!"
Eiko:Makes sense to me! I get it!
Shadow:We can hear you.
"Kurasame:If you insist on blathering on about matters you do not understand, please do so over there."
"Trey:Ah! Sorry, Commander!"
"???:Looks like that ""goddess"" might not've been full of it after all..."
"???:Damn you, Ardyn."
???:Showing up like that and sending us off to gods know where.
"???:Either way, I better find the others... Huh?"
"???:Brand new world, same old pains in the butt."
"???:Whew, still got it."
Seifer:You're pretty good.
"???:Happy to entertain. Would've been happier if you helped, though."
Seifer:And why would I do that?
"Seifer:Goddess, huh? Well, now we know which side you're on."
???:Side? What're you
"Seifer:Sorry, question time is over."
"Raijin:Seifer came here to help you out, ya know. But, eh..."
Seifer:What?
"Raijin:Looks like we were too late, ya know. You made quick work of that monster."
"Seifer:Yeah, yeah."
"???:Well, if you meant me harm I think I would've known by now. Anyways, I'm"
Seifer:Who cares. Let's go.
Edgar:Don't take it personally. That's just how they treat all of Materia's warriors.
"Edgar:Not all of them are so bereft of manners, but regardless of what he said, we're all on the same side here."
Locke:A fact that some of us have a hard time accepting.
"Edgar:Anyways, judging by your looks, I'd guess you're a confidant of Prince Noctis."
Gladiolus:So he's with you!? That's good newsI'm Gladiolus Amicitia.
Gladiolus:Noctis's protectorhis shield.
"Locke:Ah, so you're Gladio? We've heard a lot about you."
"Gladio:Well then, I'm following you guys. If that's all right, of course."
Edgar:We'll gladly have you. We have a lot to fill you in on along the way.
"Gladio:Is that so? Guess I'm late to the party, then. Sorry about that, guys."
"Gladio:Hope Noct and Prompto aren't drivin' ya crazy, Ignis."
Gladio:Good thing I'm here to shoulder some of the burden.
"Noct:Well, well, look who finally decided to show."
"Prompto:Gladio! The gang's all here, finally!"
Gladio:I see you haven't lost your spunk.
"Noct:Don't think he ever will. Man, I never thought I'd see the day we were back together againin another world, no less!"
Prompto:We've been through a lotgood times and bad.
Prompto:And our entourage has grown beyond just us four.
"Noct:Yeah, well..."
Noct:That hasn't always been for the better. We've seen our share of trouble.
Ignis:Trouble which I'm sure you had no part in causing.
"Prompto:Noct, a troublemaker? No way!"
Noct:Can it!
Gladio:Hah! Just like old times. I'm glad that hasn't changed.
"Noct:Yeah, me too."
Gladio:Sorry to have kept you waiting.
Noct:No worries. It's not like you had a choice.
Prompto:So what're we gonna do to celebrate?
"Ignis:Don't be so hasty. As happy as this reunion is, we should introduce Gladio to our new allies first and foremost."
"Noct:Ignis is right. And since he volunteered, he can do the honors."
"Prompto:Ah, delegating responsibility, the princely thing to do!"
Noct:Shut up.
"Gladio:Alright, then, shall we?"
"Ignis:Gladio, do you...?"
"Gladio:Have my memories? Yeah, and so do you, from what Materia told me."
"Ignis:I see. And you look like us, too."
Gladio:Yup. Could you imagine if I was the only one of us who was older?
"Gladio:Anyways, Ignis... You know it's only a matter of time before Noct remembers too, right?"
Gladio:But I'm sure you don't need me to tell you that. I'm just saying we'd better be ready when he does.
Gladio:And we'd better be ready to protect him.
"Gladio:Because that's what we do, right?"
"Ignis:Indeed. ""At all costs."""
"Ignis:I meant those words when I said them, and I mean them now."
"Gladio:When you forget about all the monsters, this place definitely has its charms."
"Gladio:Really. Nothing beats eatin' with the boys. Right, Ignis?"
"Ignis:Noct might not see it, but I agree. There's something special about sharing a meal outdoors."
"Prompto:Special? Well, we've been eating outside plenty since we've gotten here, and I haven't felt anything special."
"Gladio:That's cause we don't have our camping equipment. If we did, then you'd see."
Palom:How much camping equipment did you need in your world?
"Gladio:Well, we had chairs, tables, tents, tools for cooking... And that's just for starters."
Palom:But who needs all that stuff?
Gladio:All that stuff is what makes it special. Sets it apart from the day to dayturns it into an adventure.
"Gladio:You go out and search for ingredients, then you cook those up with your gear."
Tidus:So you guys have tools that are made just for camping?
"Gladio:Yup, and I try to never leave home without 'em. Most are small enough to be folded up, but they do their jobs better than anything else."
Tidus:No way! I'd like to see some of those!
Gladio:Now you're gettin' into it. Settin' everything up is the most exciting part.
Gladio:Doin' regular things in special waysthat's the spirit of camping. At least from my perspective.
Prompto:Gladio's always been the outdoorsy type.
"Selphie:Oh, I know what you mean! It's like the excitement I feel when trying on new clothes or a new piece of equipment!"
Palom:So it's excitement you want? Leave that to me!
"Tidus:Excitement? Not sure I'd call your ""tricks"" exciting."
Gladio:You never know. Sometimes a trick can spice things up a little.
"Palom:Hehe, they sure can!"
"Gladio:But let me give you some advice: if you wanna spice things up with the ladies, then tricks won't cut it."
Gladio:Bring 'em flowers when they least expect it. Show up suddenly with a present they've been wanting. That's how you should catch them off guard.
Selphie:Oooh! I like the sound of that!
"Gladio:Don't overdo it, though."
Palom:That doesn't seem very fun... I don't get it.
"Tidus:Oh man, I better write this down!"
"Yuna:Ah, we're back at last."
Balthier:That was a harder fight than expected. The sun will soon be upon us.
Gladio:Hyah! Yeah!
"Gladio:Oh, you guys are back. Good job finishing up the night patrol."
Firion:Do you always train this early?
Gladio:Of course. What else would the King's shield do?
"Squall:(Right, this guy's a bodyguard. Still...)"
Gladio:Can't argue with that. I bet it's pretty strange in this line of work.
Gladio:But I'm just the youngest in along lineof royal guards.My dadandNoctis's dadwere childhood friends.
Gladio:Noctis and I grew up as close as brothers.
Yuna:I see. So you were put upon the same path as your father.
Kain:You take your responsibilities more seriously than you appear to.
Kain:Do you wish to become as your father did?
Gladio:Not really. I'll do things my own way.
Balthier:As you should. A child should always be encouraged to walk a path of his own making.
Balthier:A father's footsteps are not always suited to his offspring.
"Gladio:Haha, good point! I could never be part of the council like him."
"Squall:Maybe not, but I'm sure Ignis could."
Gladio:You're right on that count.
"Gladio:My father died without fulfilling his duty. In that respect, too, I don't want to be like him."
"Gladio:If I'm gonna protect Noct until he becomes king, I need to be stronger than anyone else out there."
Firion:That's why you train earlier and harder than anyone else.
Gladio:You got it.
Firion:Then let me help you.
Firion:I'll spar with you any day.
"Gladio:Alright, you're on!"
Galuf:Hmm. We must tread carefully here.
Selphie:At least there aren't any monsters around. Let's check over there!
"Gladio:Selphie, slow down. What if there's a trap ahead?"
Selphie:It'll be fine!
Gladio:Saying it doesn't make it so.
"Selphie:Doesn't it? You worry too much, Gladio."
Gladio:That's not the point. You're being reckless.
"Selphie:Reckless? What're you, my big brother?"
"Lulu:You bicker like siblings, anyways."
Edge:I get it. You can't help but worry. It's a trait you've acquired.
"Selphie:But I'm not your little sister, Gladio. You don't need to worry so much."
Lightning:Don't be too hard on him. He can't help it.
"Edge:You would know, Lightning. You worry a lot, too."
"Lightning:Yeah, but it's different. I just don't want to see you guys get hurt or feel sad."
"Lulu:Oh, the burdens of old age."
Galuf:I can't help but feel responsible for you younglings.
"Gladio:Anyways, sorry about lumping you in with Noct and my sister."
"Selphie:No problem, all is forgiven."
Galuf:You might use this chance to put yourself in each other's shoes.
"Galuf:You obviously care about her, or else you wouldn't worry. If Selphie gets that, maybe she'll be more careful."
Galuf:But you also have to trust her to be able to hold her own.
"Galuf:No matter how fragile she looks, you do not know the struggles she's faced to get here. She is stronger than you know."
Lightning:Right. Just like Serah.
"Lulu:It doesn't matter how close you are, you can't read your sibling's mind."
Lulu:But you can speak with each other. It would be a shame if you went your separate ways due to a mere misunderstanding.
Gladio:I just don't want to see my friends in danger. Seeing Selphie in front makes me nervous.
"Selphie:There's a simple solution to that! You go in front, Gladio!"
Selphie:But if we see any cool vehicles then I get to go first.
Gladio:Hmph. I really should stop trying.
"???:She said it was ""another world."" But I still don't believe it."
"???:That goddess was fishy, too... Even if I did believe her, this is nothing more than a fantasy."
???:I don't even wanna think about it.
???:We need to find a way back.
"???:And by any means necessary. But first, we need to find out where we've been taken to."
???:What's that?
???:Let's split up.
"???:I'll leave that one to you, then."
???:Now where could this lead... I hope it's a way outta here.
"???:Just as I thought. I have no idea where this is, but at least I got out of that weird place."
???:Huh? A fight?
Lion:Careful! It's wounded and desperate!
Onion Knight:Let's keep a safe distance! There's no telling what it'll do!
???:Are those the warriors summoned by the goddess?
Lion:Oh no! There's someone over there!
Cecil:Run! It's dangerous!
???:What a drag. This wasn't in the job description.
Onion Knight:That speed... He's no ordinary guy.
Lion:Who are you...?
???:Just passing through. In any case...
???:I'm the least of your worries right now.
Cecil:...It appears you're right. We haven't the leisure of talking now.
Onion Knight:Just wait right there! We have something we want to ask you!
???:Sure thing.
Onion Knight:Don't go anywhere!
"???:Sorry, but...this is above my pay grade."
"Cater:Hey, you! Wait right there!"
"Reno:Already finished with that monster, huh... That was fast."
Vanille:We asked you to wait. Why did you leave?
Wakka:This area is dangerous. You could get ambushed walking around all alone.
Reno:I don't work with others unless it's a joint op.
Cater:Work? A joint op? What are you talking about?
Reno:It's top secret until I know I can trust you guys.
Wakka:That doesn't answer our question...does it?
Vanille:We understand if you can't trust us yet.
Vanille:But some of your friends might be with us. Why don't you come along?
Reno:I'll pass. I know my partner is here already. And I can handle myself no matter what happens.
Wakka:Would it kill you to be a little more friendly...?
Cloud:What's going on here?
Cloud:Reno!
"Vanille:Is he your friend, Cloud? He wouldn't answer any of our questions."
Wakka:Enemy!? You mean he...!
Cloud:It depends on his mission.
Reno:You can rest easy. I don't have any business with you...for now.
Reno:(So he's one of the goddess's warriors. The chance of getting dragged into trouble with him around is too high.)
Reno:(I need to regroup with Rude...)
"Reno:It's nice to see a familiar face, but I still have my doubts."
Reno:And I'd rather not get into a fight in some other world. See you around.
Cater:Hold up!
Cater:He's so suspicious. Maybe we should keep an eye on him if he's an enemy agent.
"Wakka:He mentioned a partner, so I guess it means he's not alone."
Cloud:...Right. And I can't imagine those two acting blindly.
"Cloud:Sorry, Reno, but you're coming with us. It's for your own good."
Reno:That's fine with me.
"Vanille:What should we do, then?"
"Cloud:Those agents are a violent lot. But since he was summoned by Materia, he could help us fight."
"Reno:(Well, this'll make a fine stepping stone. Don't mind if I poke around.)"
"Reno:A goddess and her warriors, with Cloud among them..."
Reno:Huh? What was that sound?
Lulu:Did no one tell him that it's dangerous to go out alone?
Layle:He probably just stepped out for some air.
Edge:He seems pretty confident in his abilities. He should be fine as long as he hasn't strayed too far.
"Zack:Still, I can't help but worry. I'll help you find him. What did he look like again?"
"Reno:Leave me alone, will you!?"
"Zack:Hey, I recognize that guy."
Layle:And he's brought company. Like we needed more trouble around here...
Edge:No point in complaining now! We've got some saving to do!
Reno:I appreciate it!
"Zack:I'll help, too! Uh...Reno!"
Reno:...Maybe this is a dream after all.
Lulu:There are still lots of unknowns here. It's dangerous for a newcomer like you to wander around.
"Layle:You don't strike me as the type who can wait patiently, though."
Reno:This was my bad. I'll be more careful from now on.
"Edge:Well, looks like he's learned his lesson. Let's head back!"
"Reno:Hey, Zack... Sorry for the trouble."
Zack:No worries! We're all in the same boat here.
"Reno:Are you okay? I mean, your body and..."
Zack:Worried about me? You were the one getting the runaround by a monster just now.
Zack:I bet the Turks would've laughed themselves silly if they heard...but they won't.
"Zack:...It's okay, though. I know about everything."
"Zack:I appreciate the concern, but I've got all my thoughts in order."
"Zack:I want to do what I can here and I'd be happy to have your help, Reno."
Reno:...That's fine with me.
Zack:Woohoo! That means the Turks will be helping out.
Zack:Let's talk over dinner! I can't wait!
Reno:So this really is a different world...
Reno:I can't believe the guy we looked high and low for is alive and well here.
"Reno:So if this place is really real, then could I atone for the past?"
"Reno:In any case, it looks like I've gotta face the truth."
"Reno:Alright, looks like we're done for the day. Feels nice to have solid earth under our feet."
Snow:Tell me about it. You can only see so much from up in the sky.
Snow:I prefer to do my investigating up close.
Gau:Gau thinks so too! Gau no like sky!
"Snow:You really are a man after my own heart, Gau."
"Reno:It's honest work, if anything."
"Reno:I miss all the perks of Shinra technology sometimes, though."
"Reno:Hey, you got something to say, Rude?"
"Reno:We did the rounds and cleaned up the monsters. The way I see it, you have no right to complain."
Rude:Sounds like you had a rough go. Our patrol was cake.
"Tidus:Sure was! Cute, cuddly animals everywhere!"
Rinoa:We even had our share of fruits and nuts. I haven't eaten anything that good in a long time!
"Tidus:Yeah, Rude picked the fruit from the tallest trees for us!"
Reno:You guys are making me jealous.
Gau:Gau want fruit! Gau want nuts!
"Snow:I'll grab some for you later. You want some too, Reno?"
"Rinoa:Hehe, actually..."
Tidus:Ta da! We brought some for everyone! Let's head back so we can feast!
Gau:Gaaau! Gau hungry! Gau hungry!
"Snow:Nice, let's go. I could use a pick-me-up."
"Reno:You aren't settling down here, are you?"
Rude:Ask yourself that question.
"Rude:Anyways, I don't think I've seen these animals and plants before."
Reno:Me neither. It's all new to me. Their powers are a mystery as well.
"Rude:We also have Aerith, Zack, and Sephiroth walking around."
"Reno:Well, it's a different world, so I guess we can't be too surprised. Can't contact the rest of the crew, either."
Reno:From this point on we're practically civilians.
Rude:Don't make me laugh.
"Rude:Even so, those guys are doing all they can to protect their world by fighting in this one."
"Reno:Seems like a lot of trouble with no end in sight, but they're trying their best."
Reno:Gotta admire them somewhat. I don't see any harm in sticking with them for a bit.
"Reno:Another hard day's work squared away. Let's grab a bite to eat, huh?"
"Reno:It's on me! ...Or well, that's what I would say, if we were back home. Doesn't really work here, does it?"
Gilgamesh:Hah hah hah! My disappointment is immeasurable! There's nothing I like more than a free meal!
Reno:I used to go out with my buddies all the time. It's my duty to make newcomers feel welcome.
Squall:(Newcomers? Is he talking about us?)
Eight:You sure like looking after others.
Kain:I wonder. Is it all an act? Perhaps we should ask Rude.
Reno:Go ahead. You think I'd lie to you?
"Eight:Seeing you like this, I can't help but wonder."
Eight:Why were you guys fighting against Cloud and the others?
Eight:It doesn't seem like you guys have anything against each other now.
Squall:What happened in your world?
Reno:What happened? Nothing. We were just doing our job.
"Reno:The Turks follow orders, that's all. Sometimes those orders involve kidnapping and roughing people up."
"Reno:Sometimes we were on opposite sides, sometimes we weren't. That's just the way things go."
"Eight:I see. I guess in times of conflict, allegiances can be fluid, depending on who is giving the orders."
Eight:All because of orders.
"Desch:But, if you knew another would come to harm because of your orders, you would still follow them?"
"Kain:There are people who will. If there wasn't, then organizations would collapse."
"Kain:But there are also people who will turn their back on orders, and choose a different life."
"Gilgamesh:Hah hah hah! Indeed, indeed!"
"Reno:Work is work, it isn't always fun. And you can't only choose the fun parts."
Desch:I see. I suppose that makes sense.
"Reno:I'm glad I ended up here, though. It sucks to be separated from your partner."
Desch:Indeed. Being among friends is a precious experience.
Reno:I understand why some people might view the work we did with skepticism. But we were fighting against something terrifying.
Reno:Cloud and his friends simply got in our way. They were on the other side of things.
Reno:We didn't fight them out of any sense of malice.
"Squall:(Maybe, but I bet both sides think they're the good guys.)"
"Reno:Anyways, there's no reason for us to fight anymore. It's all water under the bridge."
Desch:Good. I wouldn't want an enemy like you.
Kain:Indeed. But it may be best to keep one eye on him just in case.
"Eight:Yeah, in case his boss shows up."
Reno:Hah. Whatever floats your boat.
???:IfTsengfinds out...
Reno:I don't even wanna think about it.
???:We need to find a way back.
"Reno:And by any means necessary. But first, we need to find out where we've been taken to."
Reno:What's that?
???:Let's split up.
Tifa:Everything seems fine around here.
"Aerith:Well, since we came all this way, why not stay and play a bit?"
Prompto:Great idea! I love the sea!
Firion:This is no time to let our guard down. Who knows what's lurking around here?
???:What a walk...
Tifa:Rude!?
Rude:Tifa? ...Aerith!?
Prompto:He looks pretty tough! You guys know each other?
Aerith:I guess you could say that...
Rude:What are you doing here? What's going on?
"Firion:He seems confused. Since he's been summoned like us, we should explain the situation."
Aerith:Right... I never thought his passion for work would extend this far.
Rude:...I work hard when I'm on the job.
Prompto:Is he like your bodyguard? He looks like VIP security.
"Tifa:Good guess, but...not quite."
Rude:Another unexpected turn... I suppose it's time to roll with the punches.
Firion:What's the meaning of this!?
Prompto:Is he not your friend?
Tifa:No. He's part of a group that tried to kidnap Aerith.
Rude:That was our job.
"Aerith:Please, give up already. You didn't need to follow me all the way here."
"Rude:I may not know anything about this place, but I can still fulfill that old mission."
Rude:I lost...
Vincent:Did you pull your punches?
Aerith:Maybe you're just shaken from being in an unknown world. I can understand that.
Rude:So you've just accepted the fact that you're in a different world?
"Vincent:This place doesn't really give you a choice, no matter how hard you deny it."
Zidane:And we won't go easy on you if you keep chasing after Aerith!
Rude:...Relax. All that's in the past.
"Aerith:I thought as much when you called it your ""old"" mission."
Aerith:So now what? Am I free?
Rude:...I can't say.
Zidane:Well that doesn't inspire much confidence. You mean that your stance might change depending on your mission?
Vincent:That's what life's like for a Turk. Orders are absolute.
Vincent:...Which is why he can't give a straight answer.
"Vincent:But as long as his boss isn't around to give orders, I don't think he'll be a problem."
Terra:That puts me at ease.
"Aerith:In that case, then..."
Aerith:Do you want to come with us?
Zidane:Wh-what!? Are you serious?
Terra:Wasn't he your enemy at one point?
"Aerith:Even still, I know him. And I wouldn't be able to rest knowing we left him here alone."
Aerith:It'll be okay...I think.
Rude:...This feels like a dream.
"Aerith:You still don't believe us? I'm sorry, but it's true: you're in another world."
"Rude:Maybe this is how we can atone...for Tseng, too..."
Zidane:Did you say something?
"Rude:No... I'll take you up on that offer, Aerith."
"Zell:Alright, that should do it for today! We finished exploring the designated area."
Barret:What're you sayin'? We still got plenty of time!
"Fang:We can check out the rest tomorrow, right? Let's head back and get something to eat."
"Garnet:It looks like we're divided... What do you think, Rude?"
Rude:...I don't work overtime.
Zell:That's what I'm saying!
Barret:Hey! C'mon now! Don't walk away from me!
"Barret:If we'd gone a little further, we might've found somethin' back there."
"Barret:Plus, whatever we explore today, we don't gotta do tomorrow!"
Fang:What are you getting all fired up at Rude about? Zell's the one who said to go back.
"Barret:I haven't accepted you as one of our own yet, and here you are lookin' all smug like some kind of leader!"
"Rude:...Scouting is part of my job, but it's not my whole life."
Rude:Sacrificing everything for your job doesn't make you a pro.
"Rude:That's what Reno says, at least. But I agree."
Zell:You mean being able to switch modes is important.
Rude:Pacing is important. There's no point in tiring yourself out.
Barret:I guess you got a point there.
"Barret:You've been actin' weird since we got here, so I had my doubts. My bad."
Fang:Don't get quiet on us all of a sudden. It looks like you've got something on your mind.
"Garnet:If it's no trouble, why don't you talk to us about it?"
Rude:...I never thought I'd actually believe the goddess's story when I first came here.
Rude:But then I met you guys and unbelievable things happened...
Rude:So I had to acknowledge that this was some unknown world.
Rude:Being unnerved by that means I've failed as a pro.
Fang:Haha! So you can't tell whether you're on or off these days. Is that why you've been acting weird?
"Garnet:I'm sorry to hear that... If there's anything we can help with, just let us know."
"Rude:No, I've got my thoughts in order. I can handle anything when I'm on the job."
"Barret:I need to be sure: when you say ""on the job,"" do you mean when we're fightin' together?"
"Rude:For now, yes."
"Rude:You'll need my help getting back home, too. I'll give you that as a bonus."
Barret:Tch. Stop sayin' it like you're better than us!
Rude:Sorry to keep you waiting.
"Reno:Ah, no worries. What's got you so sweaty?"
Rude:Sweaty? It's nothing.
"Reno:Fine. If you don't wanna talk, suit yourself."
Quistis:Have you guys been here the whole time?
Reno:We just got here. You guys look pretty beat. Did you come here without healing up first?
"Tifa:We caught sight of a mysterious shadow while we were fighting. We followed it here, but..."
Sabin:It should be around here somewhere. You guys haven't seen anything?
Reno:Nothing. What'd it look like?
Tifa:It's a bit tough to describe since we didn't get a good look. It was big...and black as the night.
Rude:You sure it wasn't a monster?
Quistis:Not judging by the sounds of its footfalls. It moved like a human.
Rude:That doesn't really mean much around here.
"Sabin:Well, we found a dead monster while we were following it. You think they'd fight each other?"
Quistis:I doubt it. I've never seen that before.
Rude:Y-yes. Good work on the investigation.
Reno:It sounds like this shadow saved you a pain in the butt. You might even say it helped you.
"Tifa:We might...but still, it gives me the creeps."
Quistis:Me too. It feels like someone is watching us. And not in a good way.
"Sabin:That settles it, then! Next time we see that freak, I'm not gonna stop until I catch it. We can't have you guys feeling uncomfortable."
"Quistis:Thank you. Then we can question it, and make it understand how rude it's been. Feel free to use your fists, Sabin."
"Reno:Yeah, I'll help you beat some sense into it too!"
"Tifa:Thanks, Reno! I'll give it a few love taps of my own!"
"Tifa:Are you gonna join in, Rude?"
"Rude:I, uh... Of course."
"Quistis:Well then, we should return to rest up."
"Rude:I give her the creeps...? Freak, huh?"
"Reno:Well, you are the one who's sneaking around like a creep."
"Reno:If you don't want them to think you're a weirdo, then stop acting like one!"
"Vaan:Hey, Rude, you said you needed something to repair your equipment, right? Will this work?"
Rude:Let me see.
"Rude:...Yeah, this'll do."
Rude:You have to maintain your equipment every day. The last fight did a number on it.
Vaan:You don't have to tell me. We all look after our gear like our lives depend on it.
Vaan:Sometimes I spend hours working out tiny kinks.
"Rude:Is that so? Surprising, coming from you."
Vaan:Surprising? Why?
"Edgar:Hey, what're you guys talking about?"
Vaan:Repairing our equipment. I got Rude one of these.
Ignis:That's quite a precise tool. They must be some delicate repairs.
Edgar:I'm something of a gearhead myself. Do you guys need any help?
"Rude:Thanks, but no. I only trust myself with this work."
"Edgar:Sounds intense. I'll leave you to it, then."
"Rude:While you're here, though, I can take a look at your stuff. Auron, Ignis, how about it?"
"Auron:Thanks, but there's no need. Much like their owner, my gear is straight to the point."
Ignis:I've just finished repairs myself. There's no need to go to the trouble.
Vaan:You can take a look at mine.
"Edgar:Mine too, if you don't mind. I've been too busy to give it the care it deserves."
Rude:Do you have it with you?
Vaan:Yup! Here you go.
Rude:Whoa! Don't point your weapon at me!
"Rude:I wasn't talking about repairing weapons. I was talking about glasses, sunglasses, things like that."
Edgar:That's what you needed those tools for!? Your sunglasses?
Vaan:All this time I thought you were talking about our weapons!
"Rude:Why would I do that? It's the sunglasses that make the man, not his weapons."
Vaan:Are you messing with me!? You already have two pairs of those things!
"Rude:Of course, I'm a pro. You don't go on a mission without a backup."
Rude:You have to be ready for anything. And that goes double for your sunglasses.
"Edgar:Huh, it all makes sense now. Sunglasses are your thing."
Ignis:It appears you and I have something in common.
Rude:Yeah. If you need any repairs on your gearyour real gearyou know who to ask.
Onion Knight:Whew... That was a close one.
"Desch:You think you'd be used to this kind of chaos by now, considering how it follows you everywhere."
Onion Knight:You're one to talk!
Yuna:I'm glad everyone is okay.
Lulu:We can no longer depend on the order we once knew...
Lulu:This is a place where the guiding hands of the gods have been forced away.
Wakka:You guys have any idea what's going on?
"Mog:Not me, kupo... This is all new."
Paine:Our only choice is to move forward.
Desch:Seems that way.
"Yuna:I hope they're okay. Auron, Jecht, and..."
"Desch:And Tidus, right? You're pretty easy to read."
Yuna:Of course I'm worried about Tidus. But there are others as well.
Yuna:Zidane and Rem helped me when I felt lost in this world. I'd hate to see anything happen to them.
"Yuna:They may be strong, but this place is full of danger."
Kimahri:Kimahri worries for children too.
"Wakka:They can fight, sure, but they're still just kids."
Paine:Yeah. They could get into trouble if one of the more unsavory characters were to catch them alone.
Lulu:Like Seymour.
Desch:Or the Cloud of Darkness.
Onion Knight:Shealready tried to deceiveAce and the others.
Desch:Then we should make it our primary goal to reunite with our allies.
Onion Knight:This'll come in handy for that.
Mog:Kupo! I sense a powerful presence.
Kimahri:A friend?
"Mog:That I don't know, kupo! We'll have to find out for ourselves!"
"Mog:That's him, kupo! The presence from before!"
Onion Knight:What!? You!
Onion Knight:Xande! Didn't think we'd see you here.
Xande:I had sensed a faint glimmer of light in this world.
"Xande:I am hardly surprised it was you. You, who joinedDogaandUneiin their vainglorious mutiny."
Kimahri:Kimahri senses danger!
"Wakka:Wait... You told us about this guy, didn't you?"
Desch:Yes...Master Xande.
"Desch:He brought our world to the brink of destruction. He's our enemy, to say the least."
Onion Knight:Is he still being controlled by the Cloud of Darkness?
Xande:Hah hah hah! You think I would submit to another!?
"Xande:I am here of my own will, and my own will alone. This magnificent world was too ripe a fruit to resist."
Onion Knight:What!? Why!?
Xande:A place where anything that one desires can be given form.
Xande:Here I can wish away death and grant myself eternal life.
Paine:Eternal life? I don't think that'll be as easy as you think.
"Xande:Perhaps not, but it will not be impossible. Those who you thought vanquished have been revived to stand against you once more, have they not?"
"Xande:Regardless, one matter is abundantly clear. Light will only impede my goals."
Xande:And so...
Xande:It must be snuffed out!
Onion Knight:As if the Cloud of Darkness wasn't enough of a pain in our sides.
Yuna:Don't worry. We're by your side.
Lulu:It seems the ranks of our enemies grow. We should find our allies sooner rather than later.
Kimahri:But first...we win here.
Paine:You're in for a world of hurt!
Desch:Allow me to assist.
"Onion Knight:Thanks, guys! There'll be hell to pay if we let this one run amok!"
Onion Knight:Alright! Let's take him down!
Xande:Hah hah! Struggle if you wishit shall make your deaths all the sweeter!
Xande:Ugh... You worms...
Onion Knight:You thought you could just come here and do whatever you want?
Xande:You are even more impudent than Seymour let on...
"Xande:Very well... In your last moments, gaze upon true strength!"
Kimahri:He comes!
Xande:What!? You!
Desch:Another one... They're merciless.
Cloud of Darkness:Hahaha... As much as we'd savor the sight of you crushing these fools under your heel...
Cloud of Darkness:They are not the only source of light in this world.
Cloud of Darkness:Come with us. There is less...defiant prey to be had.
Xande:I have no intention of being your slave once again.
"Xande:But it seems our goals align for now. Very well, I shall make use of you."
"Cloud of Darkness:As before, our presence here is in heed to your desire."
"Onion Knight:Hey, wait!"
Desch:Hold on! It's too dangerous!
"Cloud of Darkness:Hmmm... We tire of that petulant scowl. Here, perhaps this will bring a smile to your face."
Cloud of Darkness:Take it.
Mog:Kupo! It's Xande's dimensional coordinates!
Onion Knight:We don't need charity!
Paine:You three have some history.
Onion Knight:You could call it that. Those two almost destroyed our world.
"Onion Knight:Xande stole the power of the crystals in his pursuit of forbidden magic, snuffing out the world's light and flooding it with darkness."
"Onion Knight:We defeated him eventually, bringing a stop to his scheme and saving the world. But we lost friends along the way..."
Lulu:I'm sorry...
"Onion Knight:Onedied protecting us, andtwootherswent beyond even the bounds of mortality to guide us..."
Onion Knight:I can't let it all be in vain! Xande has to be stopped!
"Onion Knight:Ah, sorry... Got a little carried away there."
Yuna:You don't have to apologize. We all understand what you've been through.
Yuna:You don't have to bear those terrible memories alone.
Yuna:We all know how dearly you hold onto the memories of your allies. Both past and present.
"Yuna:After all, you've guided us this far. Just as you were once guided."
"Onion Knight:Thanks, Yuna."
"Wakka:You can't hold stuff like that in, man! That's what friends are for!"
Lulu:Xande mentioned Seymour. That is...unsettling.
Desch:It might be best for us to keep his dimensional coordinates.
Onion Knight:You're right. They might hold the key to stopping him.
"Onion Knight:Alright! Well, there's no need to put the brakes on this adventure. Let's find our friends!"
Xande:Hmmm... It seems the Cloud of Darkness is not so subservient as it appears.
Xande:It matters not. I shall keep a close eye on matters as they unfold.
"Xande:I have no dearth of time in this world, after all."
Desch:I just don't know...
"Desch:Xande seeks eternal life, while Seymour seeks the release of death."
Desch:How did those two meet?
"Yuna:When we met Seymour inthat tower, it didn't seem like he knew who Xande was."
"Yuna:They must have met some time after that, while we were fighting with the Cloud of Darkness."
"Edgar:Well, our ranks have grown over our time here. It makes sense that the same would happen with the bad guys."
"Edgar:We're in a new world, with new principles. We need to pay special attention to what our foes are up to."
Edgar:I don't wanna think about what would happen if someone as crazy as Kefka came along.
Bartz:I haven't seen any signs of Exdeath yet.
Bartz:I don't think he'd be able to resist announcing his arrival.
Desch:Each one of them alone has the power to bring this world to ruin.
Desch:It makes my head hurt to think about it.
"Edgar:We fought against all types in our world, but Kefka was the worst of them."
"Edgar:I can't imagine how much worse things can get than that, but I suppose this place is full of surprises."
Yuna:Warriors of darkness from other worlds have appeared before. Worlds that none of us know.
Edgar:That's right. So that means...
Bartz:We still need to find our allies. And we should be quick about it.
"Edgar:Yeah, let's keep moving forward."
"Seymour:Well, well..."
Seymour:I'm pleased to see you unharmed. I was worried you had met your match.
Xande:Spare me your tedious provocations. I don't need your concern.
Xande:I've spoken with the Cloud of Darkness. It tells me you seek the release of death.
Xande:Such a pitiful goal.
Seymour:Hmph. Speaking of tedious provocations.
"Seymour:It's clear to me that above all, you fear death."
Seymour:You despise that which is not eternal. Is there something in your past that causes you to feel this way?
Xande:Cease your prattling and leave my sight.
Seymour:If you insist. Farewell.
Xande:This place is inhabited by useless fools.
"Xande:Still, if this world can be flooded with light, then that only means..."
Xande:...It can just as easily be drowned in darkness. And eternal life will be mine.
Xande:Hahaha! And then I shall give Seymour the release he desires.
Onion Knight:Back together at last.
Sabin:I heard you guys had a rough time of it.
Celes:It seems the Cloud of Darkness wasn't your only enemy back home.
"Onion Knight:Yeah. To be honest, I'm not sure what to do with the dimensional coordinates."
"Vaan:Hey, mind telling us about this new enemy? Xande, was it?"
"Vaan:You were saying he seeks eternal life, right? What's the point of that?"
Vaan:Just to live forever? What would you live for?
Onion Knight:I think he just wants to prove that he's better than everyone else.
Sabin:Why would he want to do that?
"Onion Knight:Xande studied under the Great MagusNoah, along with two other students namedDogaandUnei."
"Onion Knight:When the Great Magus passed, he gifted Doga with great magical powers, and declared Unei would inherit the world of dreams."
"Onion Knight:Xande, however, was given the ""gift"" of a mortal life. He despised this, and went into seclusion."
"Golbez:I see. Instead of being granted a boon, he thought his teacher gave him shackles."
"Golbez:However, although our lives may seem short, it is that brevity that allows us to achieve greatness."
Golbez:But I suspect Xande failed to understand this.
Onion Knight:Yeah. Unei tried to make him see that the gift of mortality was the greatest one of all.
Onion Knight:But Xande refused to listen. Unei was despondent at his stubbornness.
Gabranth:People desire to walk a path of their own making.
Gabranth:His path was chosen for him. Perhaps that is why he could not see the value of it.
"Sabin:It must've been hard for him, thinking that the other disciples were being favored."
"Sabin:He knew them well, and that made his envy even worse. I can see how that would cause him to go down the wrong path."
Gabranth:I am surprised that you sympathize with him.
Penelo:I wonder if it was because Xande was aware of his short lifespan that he was driven to go to such extremes.
Penelo:Every second he spent worrying about what to do was another second of his life gone. Rashness drove his decisions.
"Vaan:Yeah, but it's not like he couldn't tell the difference between right and wrong."
Celes:I agree. There are some lines that must not be crossed.
Onion Knight:...I think Doga and Unei knew that too.
Onion Knight:They worried about Xande until the very end. They even asked us to look after him once they were gone.
Vaan:Hey... You okay?
Sabin:It sounds like he was in good company.
"Sabin:Even though he wouldn't listen to a word they said, they still cared about him. It takes a special kind of person to do that."
Sabin:That's worthy of respect.
Onion Knight:Yeah...you're right.
"Onion Knight:And to honor them, I have to stop Xande again in this world!"
Onion Knight:Another task to add to the list!
"Onion Knight:I hope you guys will help me out. You owe me a few favors, after all!"
Celes:Haha. You're back to your old self already.
Gabranth:Indeed. Things felt amiss without your characteristic aplomb.
???:Everyone gone...
???:Did goddess lie?
???:Little bird. Do you know where Firion is?
???:Guy understands. Thank you.
???:This way dangerous? Guy be careful.
???:But Guy want meet everyone.
???:You come with Guy? Guy welcomes company.
???:That smell... Blood...?
???:Fighting... Danger!
Ace:That should be all of them. Looks like mission complete.
Sazh:They've finally stopped coming. I'd say we had our work cut out for us.
"Firion:When I saw that flood of monsters heading toward us, I wasn't sure if we would make it."
Sazh:And here I thought this place looked peaceful. Hate to think about what's gonna happen in those woods.
Sazh:Wish we could get those poor animals outta here somehow.
"Ace:You're right, they have no idea what's coming."
Ace:I caught glimpses of the animals while we were fighting... Hopefully they were able to escape to somewhere safe.
"Firion:Too bad we can't call out to them. If the woods caught fire, where would they go?"
Firion:I would hate for them to be left without a home.
Firion:This is just like the time I ran away with Maria and Leon.
Sazh:Yeah... If only we could send a warning their way.
"Ace:Krile might be able to help. She can talk to animals, after all."
"Sazh:Yeah, you're right! Let's ask her first thing when we get back."
"Firion:Good thinking. Thanks, Ace."
Firion:(If only he were here...)
Firion:That screech...?
Ace:It's a chocobo! We have to help!
"Sazh:Hey, wait up! We're coming too!"
Prompto:More of 'em!?
???:Uwah! Go away!
Rem:Is he protecting that wounded chocobo?
Rem:You know him!?
Firion:Of course I know him! Let's go!
Rosa:I'm right behind you!
"Rem:There we go, all better."
Guy:Chocobo not hurt anymore.
"Guy:You go home? Okay, little bird. Thank you for guiding."
Rosa:Now come here. You're in even worse shape than the chocobo.
Guy:Little bird is safe. Only that matters.
"Prompto:Hey, you gotta take it easy. You did good, now let us help you."
"Firion:He's right. If you're hurting, just tell us. We have some skilled healers with us."
Firion:Hmm? What's wrong?
Guy:Are others okay?
Prompto:What'd we just say!? You don't have to worry about us.
"Firion:You took the worst of it, Guy. Why are you always so... You know what, never mind. I'm just glad you're safe."
Guy:Guy happy to see Firion.
"Firion:I'm happy to see you too, Guy. I can't wait to see the smiles on Maria's and Leon's faces!"
Guy:So goddess not lie!
"Rosa:Ah, so you have met Materia."
Firion:That means you know why we're here fighting in this strange world.
"Firion:This place is in danger, Guy. And we're here to save it."
Firion:Will you help us?
Guy:Guy keep everyone safe!
"Firion:Thank you, Guy. The road ahead of us is long and"
Guy:Do not worry. Guy protect Firion. Guy protect family.
"Firion:Haha, that's what I like to hear! We are family, and I won't let us get separated again!"
"Firion:Let's bring peace back to this world, together!"
"Rydia:Guy was speaking with the chocobo back there, wasn't he?"
Rydia:Does that mean he can communicate with them?
"Maria:Yes, but he can speak to all sorts of other animals as well."
Krile:So he's just like me! Was he born that way?
"Maria:I'm not sure. He was raised by wolves, so maybe he learned from them."
"Kimahri:He calls you family, but you are not his first."
Krile:He was able to learn their language just by spending time with them? Amazing.
Sherlotta:(Does that mean I know someone who can talk with animals too?)
Sherlotta:It's like something you only hear about in stories.
"Rydia:Closeness breeds familiarity. Even if we can't understand each other at first, time together will fix that."
Guy:Words hard for Guy.
Guy:But Guy like talking. Try my hardest.
Maria:And we're happy that you do. Talking with you is always a treat.
Kimahri:Our wishes never betray us.
Rydia:Huh? What does that mean?
Kimahri:Only those who try will become. Guy must move forward to become what he wants.
Sherlotta:We must continue our efforts for them to bear fruit. I see...
"Rydia:Oh, I get it. Guy can speak with us because he tried hard to learn our language."
Guy:Hmm... Kimahri is strange.
Guy:Kimahri is same as pack. Kimahri is same as my pack.
Sherlotta:Hmm? Now what does that mean?
Maria:Maybe Kimahri reminds Guy of his old family.
Krile:How so?
Maria:Maybe Kimahri's wisdom reminds Guy of the wisdom taught by his family of wolves.
"Maria:Plus Kimahri is the strong, silent type. Dignified, just like a wolf."
Guy:Kimahri reminds me of past.
Kimahri:Kimahri is sorry he must disappoint Guy.
Kimahri:Kimahri cannot speak with animals.
Rydia:Why would that disappoint Guy? No one expects you to be able to speak with wolves.
"Sherlotta:Yeah, you don't have to please everyone, Kimahri. Stop taking everything so seriously."
"Krile:Besides, if you ever want to talk with an animal, you have Guy and I to help you out! Right?"
Kimahri:Right. Kimahri will remember that.
Guy:I help Kimahri. Guy know many animal words.
"Porom:Where's Eiko? Hmm... This way, maybe?"
"Eiko:And then, and then!"
"Porom:Oh, it sounds like she's having fun. Is she with someone?"
"Palom:And so, I think we need to step up our prank game. Who should we get next?"
"Gau:Guy, look! Gau found shiny! Here, Guy can have! Thank you for food."
"Relm:What about me? I drew that ugly monster's picture! This is better, right?"
"Porom:Hmm, it looks like everyone's gathering around Guy."
"Eiko:Hey, Porom! Get over here!"
Porom:I see you were keeping Palom company. I hope he wasn't too much trouble.
Guy:We were playing!
Eiko:We're having such a fun conversation!
Porom:Really? That doesn't seem like the Palom I know...
Palom:What's so unbelievable?
Palom:Guy never gets mad. He just smiles no matter what pranks I play on him.
Palom:So I stopped trying to trick him and just decided to talk. He's a good guy.
"Gau:Guy good! Guy good! When Gau hungry, Guy give him food!"
Porom:Is that so?
Guy:Gau is small. He must eat often.
"Guy:Guy bring enough for everyone, and Gau gave shiny in return."
Porom:How kind of him. That's one way to make friends.
"Eiko:Yeah, Guy's the best! He listens to me talk about whatever I want!"
Eiko:Like when Zidane does something amazing. Sometimes it's good to have someone who can listen to a lady!
Guy:Guy like talking to Eiko. Guy always happy to.
"Relm:You're happy to do anything for anyone, aren't you?"
"Relm:You're always like this. It'll get you into trouble some day, so it's a good thing I'm looking after you."
"Guy:Guy thanks you, Relm."
"Relm:You don't have to be so nice all the time! But even if it gets you into trouble, I'll protect you, so..."
Porom:I see. You're a generous soul.
Porom:That's why everyone likes you and hangs out with you.
Guy:No. Not because others like Guy.
Guy:Because Guy likes others.
Porom:Huh? How strange. You're so humble.
Porom:(This guy really is as nice as everyone says...)
"Eiko:You should come hang out next time, Porom! We'll chat the day away!"
Porom:Maybe I will. It does sound like you're having a blast.
"Porom:Well then, if you'll have me, I'd love to join you next time!"
Guy:Of course! Guy can't wait!
"Prompto:They were everywhere, but I pulled through thanks to you two!"
Celes:You don't give yourself enough credit. You more than pulled your weight back there.
Guy:Prompto strong. Aim impressive.
Prompto:You think so? It makes me happy to hear it!
"Prompto:Huh? Oh, you're right!"
Celes:What's he doing in such a desolate place?
Maria:Are you here by yourself?
Leon:Do you think I'm plotting something?
Leon:I suppose it's only natural that you'd be suspicious of me.
Maria:You fool!
Maria:Why do you think like that!? I just worry about you. You're my brother!
Maria:This place was crawling with monsters before. It's dangerous to be here alone!
"Leon:Is that why you followed me here, even knowing the risk...!?"
Firion:What did you expect us to do!? We're family! We're not going to just let you endanger yourself.
"Firion:If you have something to do here, let us help you. You won't regret it."
Leon:You've got it all wrong!
Leon:It's exactly because you're family that I don't want you to
"Maria:Don't be silly! This is better than going alone, right?"
"Firion:If you're not going to ask us to come, then we'll just have to follow close behind!"
"Celes:Well, looks like there was nothing to worry about."
Prompto:That's good. It would've been awkward if they started fighting.
"Prompto:Hmm? Why do you look so happy, Guy?"
Guy:Leon was lonely. He fought for long time. Fought all alone.
Guy:But Leon returns home. Returns to his family.
Guy:Guy wanted this for long time.
Celes:...Then why don't you join them?
"Prompto:You should! You're part of his family, too!"
"Celes:That's right. And this time, nothing will keep you apart."
???:So what do you want me to do about it?
Spiritus:It is as I said: you are free to do as you please.
Spiritus:But you must fight.
Spiritus:That is why I called you.
"???:Well, isn't that nice... And if I don't, I can't get back?"
Spiritus:Correct. Now be on your way. All is for the sake of this world.
???:...Not like that means much to me.
Gilgamesh:A new face? You look lost.
"Gilgamesh:But worry not! I, the great Gilgamesh, will take you under my"
Gilgamesh:That spear! I've never seen anything like it! Show it to me!
"???:A fan of weapons, are you?"
"???:It's a magitek spear, forged just for me."
Gilgamesh:Hmm... How fascinating. I know! We must have a contest!
???:A contest?
"Gilgamesh:Didn't Spiritus tell you that you need to fight? I'll get to see you use that spear, so we can hit two birds with one stone!"
"???:Are you sure this is what he meant by ""fight""...?"
"Gilgamesh:Of course! If you accept my challenge, I'll open the way for you. What do you say?"
???:Hmm... Have it your way then!
???:I guess there's no escaping the eccentric. But at least he showed me the way out of there. Now just where am I?
???:Hm? Seems like there's a battle going on.
???:Is that...the prince?
???:They even summoned that kid. Just how selfish can the gods be?
???:But...he's not too shabby.
Noct:Take that!
???:He's gotten tougher since coming here.
"???:Well, if I can do whatever I want as long as I fight..."
Zell:Yeah! Mission complete! Let's head back to the airship.
???:Hold it. It's my turn now.
"Noct:Aranea!? You're here, too!?"
Warrior of Light:Something's not right. Be careful.
Aranea:Good eye!
Noct:What are you doing!? We're not enemies!
"Aranea:Enough talk. Show me what you got, pretty boy!"
"Noct:Gck! What's the matter with you, Aranea!? Don't you remember!?"
Machina:Maybe she's being controlled?
Noct:I don't want to fight you!
Aranea:How sweet...
Aranea:You've gotten stronger.
Warrior of Light:So you no longer wish to fight...?
Aranea:I was told by Spiritus that I could do what I wanted as long as I fight.
"Aranea:I was so happy to see you, I couldn't contain my excitement. My bad."
Noct:You've got to be kidding me...
"Leon:It seems like she isn't being controlled, nor have her memories been tampered with."
"Tifa:Is she a friend of yours, Noct?"
Aranea:You seem pretty close to them. You been here long?
Noct:I guess you could say that.
"Aranea:In that case, I think I'll stay a while. Things are bound to be more interesting with you guys around."
Noct:I don't see why not.
Tifa:Are you sure about this?
Machina:Are you really okay being summoned to an unknown world and just being told to fight?
"Aranea:Well, there's not much I can do about it now."
Aranea:Crying about it certainly won't change anything.
Aranea:So why not embrace it?
Warrior of Light:You would even fight beside us as an ally?
"Aranea:Well, that god did say I could do whatever I want."
Aranea:Which means I can fight alongside His Highness if I feel like it.
"Leon:Ha, quite the reinforcements you've brought us, Noct."
Noct:That's what I've been trying to tell you guys.
"Aranea:Trust me, you won't regret adding this girl to your ranks."
"Onion Knight:So you were from the enemy nation, Aranea? I don't get that feeling when I look at you guys."
"Aranea:Our nations were enemies, and if you're in the army, you've got no choice but to fight."
"Prompto:But she didn't always like the empire's way of doing things, so she helped us out a lot."
"Onion Knight:I see. Even though your countries were enemies, that didn't mean you had to be."
Prompto:Right. That's why we're so indebted to her.
Aranea:I did poke my nose where it didn't belong.
"Prompto:Hehe. Well, we certainly weren't complaining."
Prompto:But that's why I'm happy I got to learn my way around here before you!
"Prompto:If there's anything I can do, let me know!"
Aranea:You've really come a long way from that spineless kid you used to be.
"Onion Knight:Haha! You, spineless?"
"Prompto:Used to be! I'm stronger now! Plus, Noct is here"
Lightning:Pull back!
Galuf:What are you doing here? It's dangerous! Retreat to the airship!
Onion Knight:We'll help you fight!
Prompto:It's no good!
Ashe:Its armor is too hard. That's why we decided to retreat...
Lightning:How do we beat this thing?
Aranea:Get back! I'll handle this!
"Prompto:What are you going to do, Aranea?"
Aranea:I'm going to attack and draw its attention.
"Aranea:Once it stops moving, bring it down!"
Prompto:Got it!
"Galuf:For a moment, I wasn't sure what would happen."
"Ashe:We were able to bring it down easily thanks to you, Aranea."
Lightning:You're quite the strategist.
Aranea:I just happened to be better equipped to fight that enemy. I'm glad no one got hurt.
Aranea:What's the matter? I thought you outgrew this.
"Prompto:I thought I'd finally be the one helping you, but you're the one who saved us in the end..."
Aranea:Stop sulking. This thing goes both ways.
Aranea:Maybe next time you'll be the one saving me from an enemy I can't fight.
Prompto:You're right!
Aranea:That's better.
Aranea:You all did well. Why don't we head back and get some rest?
Galuf:I couldn't have said it better myself.
Aranea:I appreciate it. Now let's get going!
???:That presence... You're Sephiroth!
???:What are you doing here? What happens to me when you
Sephiroth:I know you.
Sephiroth:Hmph. This world allows such trivial existences.
???:Why do you look so smug? Answer my question!
"???:She'll acknowledge me. Even if you're here, she'll..."
Sephiroth:How pitiful.
"???:You act as if we aren't bound by will. Regardless, we'll see who is worthy to walk this realm."
"Zack:Hey, what're you so worried about? Everyone else can take care of themselves."
"Barret:Yeah, you gotta cover your own butt first. We don't have any clue what happened."
"Cloud:Yeah, you're right. We should figure out what's going on in this world."
???:You're mine!
Barret:What the hell!? That's Sephiroth! And...who's that?
"Cloud:Beats me. You have any idea, Zack?"
"Barret:He an enemy? A friend? I mean, he's fightin' Sephiroth..."
???:It's you! Brother!
Barret:What'd he say!?
Cloud:Brother? Me?
"???:Help me, Brother. We can bring Sephiroth down together."
"???:Don't you find it odd that he's here, this very moment? it's a sign that we must fight together."
Cloud:I'll pass. I don't have any reason to help you. Besides...
Cloud:Something about you reminds me of him.
"Barret:What the hell're you talkin' about!? If he reminds you of Sephiroth, then why're they fightin'?"
"Barret:Man, you're makin' my head hurt!"
"???:You would betray me again, Brother. Are you in league with him?"
Zack:While you're standing here talking...there goes Sephiroth.
"Cloud:Sorry, but I don't know anything you don't."
???:You do. I just have to cut it out of you.
Zack:What!? He said he doesn't know anything. This guy doesn't look too interested in listening to reason.
"Cloud:No, he doesn't. Why can't anything be easy?"
Cloud:I'll say it one more time. I have no idea who you are.
Cloud:And Sephiroth is my enemy.
???:That much is obvious. I'll allow you that.
Zack:Mind telling us your name? It might help us find your real family.
???:Family? Well...
Reno:We're done with our patrol. Nothing out of the ordinary.
"Rude:Hold up! Reno, isn't that...?"
Reno:Kadaj! What's he doing here?
Reno:It's just one piece of bad news after another with you guys.
???:Ah. You two I know.
"Reno:You're still after Jenova's head? Sorry, can't tell you anything useful about that."
Zack:Spit it out! What do you know?
"Reno:Whatever's going on, we're wrapped up in it now."
"Reno:Listen, we don't have anything to do with Jeno-...your mother. There's other things to worry about in this world."
"Rude:There's something going on behind the scenes, and we're just trying to gather any information we can. That's the truth."
Kadaj:I'm Kadaj.
"Kadaj:Bring me with you. I promise not to get in your way, Brother."
Cloud:What're you planning?
"Kadaj:You said it yourself. I tell you my name, and you help me look for my family."
"Kadaj:I want to find Mother. And if Sephiroth attacks again, I hope I can depend on you for help, Brother."
Cloud:What do those two have to do with each other?
Kadaj:Sephiroth is keeping Mother for himself. Even though I have every right to see her.
Kadaj:His existence...denies mine.
"Kadaj:I must find him, and I must destroy him."
"Cloud:If you can keep up, then fine. Anything else and you're on your own."
Kadaj:Then I'll be right behind you. Just remember that you let me follow.
Aerith:Who was that?
Zack:Aerith! Are you okay?
Aerith:I'm fine. Kadaj came in the nick of time.
Zack:Huh. Guess I should thank you.
"Aerith:Yes. Thank you, Kadaj."
"Zack:Thanks, man! I knew you were a good guy after all!"
"Zack:When you said you were looking for Jenova's head, I though"
Kadaj:Don't talk about Mother like that!
"Zack:I... Ah, sorry. I just Wait, your eyes..."
"Zack:There's no mistaking those eyes. Hey... You haven't been feeling odd lately, have you?"
Kadaj:What? What do you care?
"Zack:Like, has your body felt strange, or anything else been...off?"
Zack:You haven't felt like you're...deteriorating or something?
"Aerith:What're you talking about, Zack?"
"Zack:It's just... Sephiroth started acting strange after seeing Jenova. Stranger than usual, that is."
Zack:And it wasn't just Sephiroth. Everyone involved with Jenova just...
Kadaj:I understand. You know what it's like to see another crumble slowly before you.
Kadaj:We must be rid of Sephiroth as soon as possible. I might share his fate in time.
Zack:I'm not gonna let that happen to you! SOLDIERS gotta stick together!
Kadaj:You don't have any reason to help me. You aren't my superior officer.
"Zack:That's a good idea! Alright, welcome to the squad!"
Kadaj:Huh? I fear your decline may already be starting...
"Zack:I mean, you said Cloud was your brother, right? And I'm his superior officer, so..."
"Zack:If you ever need to get something off your chest, you can come to me!"
"Kadaj:...You idiot. If you're not going to help me, then don't follow."
"Aerith:Looks like he doesn't want to be in your squad, huh?"
"Zack:He just needs a little convincing, that's all."
Aerith:He always seems to be on edge. I worry about him.
"Zack:You act like he's a kid. He's not too much younger than us, you know."
"Aerith:In any case, how do you plan on convincing him?"
"Zack:You know, teach him the importance of having dreams and pride in yourself, and all that."
Zack:I'll teach him just like how I was taught.
"Aerith:Well, you have my support. Good luck, squad leader."
"Zack:If we stick with Cloud, then he'll show up again eventually. When he does, I plan on having a little chat with him."
Kadaj:How odd. Why did I help that woman?
Kadaj:Something about her seems...familiar. She...she reminds me of Mother somehow.
Gilgamesh:Uwagh! This may be too much for even a master swordsman to handle!
Gilgamesh:Is this the end of Gilgamesh?
???:Stand back.
Gilgamesh:Such power!
???:It's not down yet.
Terra:Are you okay?
Gilgamesh:You've come just in the nick of time!
Prompto:Wha!? Marshal Cor!?
Cor:We'll talk later. Focus on the battle!
"Prompto:Y-Yes, sir!"
"Cor:We live to fight another day, it seems."
"Prompto:Thanks, Marshal. That was a huge help."
Gilgamesh:Huh!? You two know each other!?
Cor:You two appear younger than I remember. What's going on?
Cor:There's no doubt this world is different than ours.
Papalymo:He catches on quickly.
Aranea:You seem unsurprised to see me here.
Prompto:Daemons!? Then that means...you have your memories?
Gilgamesh:You two can catch up later! It's time for introductions!
"Gilgamesh:I am Gilgamesh! The greatest swordsman who has ever lived, in this world or any other!"
"Cor:Gilgamesh, huh? That name makes me uneasy..."
"Cor:Anyways, I'm Cor Leonis."
"Cor:Prompto, Gladio, Ignis, and of course, Noctis, are old acquaintances of mine."
"Cor:Speaking of which, I would like to see the King. Is he okay?"
"Prompto:Yeah, he is! I'll take you to him."
"Cor:I'm glad to see you unharmed, Your Majesty."
Lulu:We found him fighting alongside Gilgamesh. Seems they're fast friends.
Noct:You just got here and you're already fitting in. I think you'll do fine.
Cecil:Indeed. He seems like a stout ally to have.
Cor:I take it you're all fighting toward the same goal?
Noct:Guess he already knows.
Ignis:It appears so.
Cor:I heard it all from the woman who called herself a goddess. I didn't believe her at first.
"Materia:Yes, you were brought here by the will of the crystal."
Materia:Noctis is already here. Join with himbe his strength.
Cor:Noctis? The king is here!?
Cor:He wouldn't be in a place like this. Stop screwing with me!
Materia:I am only stating the will of the crystal.
Cor:That was all she kept saying. I had to see you with my own eyes.
Noct:Typical Cor.
"Cor:Now, I don't believe everything she was saying, but seeing you does alleviate some doubts."
Ignis:A reasonable response.
Cor:You look as spry as ever.
"Cor:Moreso, in fact. You have the dignity of a king."
"Noct:Is that so? Young on the outside, old on the inside I guess."
Lulu:A common occurrence in this world.
Cecil:Yeah. I suppose that's the will of the crystal as well.
"Noct:Hah, yeah. And I think it's the will of the crystal that you help us out, Cor."
"Noct:It'll liven things up a bit, no doubt. We'll be safer, as well."
Cor:You sure you need an old soldier like me?
Noct:Old? You look like you're in your prime.
Cor:I guess I've been given another chance. A chance to serve a new king.
Cor:I was hoping for this.
Cor:Even if it's in a different world.
"Cor:Let me serve you, Your Majesty. Allow me to fight by your side."
"Noct:You got it, Cor."
"Gilgamesh:You should have seen it! Cor Leonis, sword glinting in the sunlight, cut down his enemies with ease!"
"Jack:Man, what a fighter! I wish I was there!"
"Gilgamesh:He stood courageous, the wind blowing through his hair! Not a single ounce of fear in his veins!"
Cyan:Like a hero of legend...
Gladio:Looks like you guys are having fun. What're you talking about?
Sherlotta:Oh! The man himself!
"Jack:Gilgamesh was just regaling us with the tale of your heroics, yo!"
Gilgamesh:I still dream of it! No enemy is too fierce to face with Cor Leonis by our side!
Gladio:Of course. That's why they call him The Immortal.
Jack:Whaaat!? The Immortal? Really?
"Cor:Hey, Gladio, maybe you should..."
Gladio:You don't want 'em to know?
Gilgamesh:Gilgamesh!? Another master of blades!?
"Gilgamesh:Ah, I see! That explains the strange expression on your face when I introduced myself!"
"Cyan:The shield of the king? Then that means Gladiolus was tested as well, does it not?"
"Cor:You were tested, and you succeeded. He's a fiercer warrior than I ever was."
"Gladio:Heh, thanks, Marshal..."
Sherlotta:It is heartening to see those younger than us improve.
"Cor:The old must give way to the new. None can stop the march of time, and I have nothing left to teach."
"Jack:Pshhh, yeah right! I want to learn that awesome technique you used!"
"Gladio:Yeah, your work isn't done yet, Marshal."
Gladio:Let's both strive to be better than we were the day before.
"Cyan:It truly is encouraging to see such eagerness in the young. Isn't that right, Cor Leonis?"
"Cor:Hah, I suppose..."
"Cor:Between you and Noctis, I'll never have a chance to rest."
"Cor:Well then, if you insist, I'll train you. But don't complain when the going gets tough."
Guy:Machina okay?
"Machina:No... No, it's nothing, Guy."
Guy:Machina often looks like that.
Machina:I was just thinking...
Machina:Thinking about the friends of mine who've yet to come here.
"Machina:Same here, even though they may not think of me as a friend."
"Cinque:No way, Machy! They love you just as much as we do!"
Kain:Any guesses we make here are simply that: guesses. We won't know until you meet them.
"Machina:I know that, but still..."
Kain:I see. A guilty conscience is a hard thing to dispel.
Galuf:Spoken from one who knows much of the matter.
"Galuf:There is one thing to remember, however. Regret can sometimes compel us to greater action."
Galuf:In this world we might have the chance to make up for our regrets.
Kain:You seem to speak from experience.
"Galuf:Hahaha! No, no, no. That was just something Jecht said."
Cinque:Hey! Don't keep the laughs to yourself!
Guy:Guy want to know about your friends.
Ace:Of course. There was Queen for one.
Ace:She was the smartest student in Class Zero. She would beat Trey and me on every test.
Cinque:And we can't forget Sice!
"Cinque:Hey...sort of like you, Kain!"
"Ace:But during an actual mission, they..."
???:This isn'tOrience.
???:I suppose what that woman said was true.
???:I need to find the others. Quickly.
Seifer:Don't make me say it again! Clean up that uniform!
"Nine:Oh yeah!? What're you gonna do about it, yo!?"
Selphie:They're still going at it.
Tidus:This is definitely a sight.
"Cater:Yeah, never gets boring."
"Seifer:If you won't listen to reason, I'll have to beat it into you!"
"Nine:Now you're talkin' my language, yo! Let's go!"
Tidus:Now they've gone and done it. We need to stop this.
Selphie:You're right. This doesn't look good.
"???:Stop it, you two!"
Nine:Huh? That voice...
"Nine:What the-!? Is that you, Queen!?"
Queen:I see you have no difficulty causing trouble in whatever world you're in.
"Nine:Hey, hold on! He started it!"
Seifer:What's this? A new face?
Seifer:Whatever. It's not worth it.
"Cater:Introductions are in order. This is Queen, our classmate."
"Selphie:I've heard all about you from Ace! You always beat them at tests, didn't you?"
Queen:Yes. They never did score higher than me.
"Tidus:You were the class leader, right? Jack told me."
Queen:No! I was never the leader of anything. Jack is always exaggerating.
Kurasame:Now this brings me back.
"Cater:Oh, Commander Kurasame!"
Queen:...Kurasame Susaya.
Kurasame:Another member of the class joins this world.
"Queen:Oh, I understand. You were our leader."
"Queen:However, I can't remember you. But I remember seeing your name in the graveyard..."
Kurasame:Just so. That was the will of Orience's crystal.
Queen:Yes. It was written that you were the commanding officer for Class Zero.
Kurasame:That's fine.
"Kurasame:You know just as much as you should. To you, I am nothing more than your commanding officer."
"Tidus:If you don't have any memories of him, then you can start making them in this world!"
"Selphie:That's right. At first, he was always butting heads with Ace and the others."
Selphie:But now they all look up to him. They hang on his every word!
Queen:So they're here too?
Queen:I suppose the reason I feel this desire to take classes with you lies somewhere within my memories. Or perhaps...
"Selphie:Don't think about it too hard! Everyone's here, so it'll be a blast! I'm gonna join you guys too. Isn't that right, Mr. Kurasame?"
Kurasame:If you insist.
"Kurasame:It'll be quite the lesson, indeed."
Guy:Guy have question for Queen.
Queen:Okay. What is it?
"Guy:Machina reunited with Queen, but Machina still sad."
Guy:Guy worry. Machina is kind soul.
Guy:Guy want to help.
Queen:Machina is...sad?
Maria:Guy's been very worried about Machina lately.
"Maria:It seems that Machina has been spending even more time brooding since you showed up, Queen."
Firion:We've heard about what happened in your world.
"Firion:I thought this reunion would be a happy one, but..."
Queen:I see...
"Queen:Thank you, everyone."
Queen:Thank you for worrying about us. It means a lot.
"Queen:I should probably... I mean, I really should speak with him."
Queen:I'll do it as soon as I can.
Machina:...I'm so sorry!
Machina:I've been wanting to apologize...
"Machina:I've talked with the others in Class Zero, but I haven't had a chance to speak with you yet, Queen."
Machina:I was scared and selfish. I hid my emotions like a child.
Machina:So I...
"Queen:Machina, Rem, I want you to listen to me."
Queen:It is I who should be apologizing.
Rem:Huh? Why?
Queen:Do you remember?
Queen:Machina and I were at each other's throats.
Queen:I don't believe what I said was wrong.
Queen:I should have spoken with Machina with more composure. I should have tried to understand his perspective.
Queen:Here I've been able to speak with people from many different worlds. I gained an objective understanding of Class Zero's emotions.
"Queen:That includes you, Machina. Only by getting closer to you was I able to see things I couldn't before."
"Queen:So, I'm sorry."
"Queen:And thank you. You were at our side during the final fight, right?"
Queen:It has been thanks to you that we were able to accomplish everything we have.
Machina:But I... I...
Queen:I've talked to Guy and the others. They worry about you.
"Machina:They can't keep to themselves, huh..."
Queen:They're good friends.
"Queen:So here I promise. For Machina, Rem, and all the other people I've met in this world."
Queen:I promise to give you all I have.
"Machina:Thanks, Queen."
"Materia:With this power and you, Mog, we can...we should be able to save this world."
Mog:I shall lead our heroes to the Torsions' epicenter!
Mog:Together we will eradicate the threat and bring whoever is responsible for this madness to justice!
Materia:It will not be nearly so easy as you think.
"Materia:The heroes you speak of are scattered across realms, each looking to fulfill their own destinies."
"Mog:Don't you worry, kupo! I've got it covered!"
Mog:I've already found four warriors willing to fight for our cause.
Materia:I see them now. The mighty Warrior of Light...
Materia:A young boy who harbors tremendous magical powers...
Materia:A man whose love for his family surpasses all...
Materia:And a young girl who has grown into herself during a time of war...
"Mog:And that makes four, kupo!"
Materia:Indeed. It seems you are more than equal to the task.
"Materia:Time, however, is not on your side."
"Materia:Even as we speak, the Torsions continue to spread and evolve at an unprecedented rate."
"Mog:Which is precisely why I must leave soon, kupo! Before I go, though, I have one question. What of Master Spiritus?"
Materia:What of him?
"Mog:You know he is plotting something, kupo! Should we not move to stop him?"
"Mog:Or do you not trust me enough to tell me, kupo...?"
Materia:He and I... We are as day and nighteternally divorced.
Materia:But he is none of your concern.
Mog:What if our methods of dealing with this issue were to collide with his plans?
Materia:I trust that your warriors will find a way to overcome any problems that may arise.
Materia:They will be guided by the light after all.
"Mog:...Very well, kupo."
Mog:Now I really must get going. Already another Torsion has opened!
"Materia:Go forth, and see that the world is not met with destruction."
"Mog:Leave it to me, kupo!"
Materia:These Torsions destroy even the cycle of battle.
Materia:I only hope that it is not too late.
"Materia:If the world were to fall to ruin, it would mean I have failed as protector and god..."
"Garland:With you out of the way, the light shall soon succumb to darkness! Then there will be no stopping me!"
Garland:Now begone from this world!
Warrior of Light:Where...am I?
Warrior of Light:A Goblin? Allow me to handle this.
Mog:Kupo! Then allow me to teach you how to fight!
Mog:Kupo!? More enemies!?
Vivi:L-let us help!
Warrior of Light:Thank you.
"Mog:That Goblin doesn't have much bravery. You might be able to inflict a BRV Break, kupo!"
"Mog:To think that you were able to take on such fearsome beasts and live to tell the tale... You're incredible, kupo!"
"Rem:Sir, are you all right? Earlier you seemed"
"Warrior of Light:I'm fine. Thank you... Rem, was it?"
Rem:Yes. And this is
Vivi:Vivi. I am Vivi.
Vivi:Mog found and rescued me when I was first transported to this world.
"Warrior of Light:So you, too, are warriors possessed of the light, brought here for some explicit purpose?"
"Mog:That's correct, kupo!"
"Mog:Lately, Torsions have been threatening the safety of our world. You're our last hope of finding and closing them, kupo!"
"Vivi:The monsters appeared from one of these Torsions, didn't they?"
Rem:And we're the only ones who can seal them?
Rem:I feel that's far beyond our capabilities.
"Mog:You can do it, kupo! Have a little faith."
"Mog:There's a small Torsion nearby. Let's make our way there and seal it off, kupo."
"Mog:I'll assist you in any way I can, kupo."
"Warrior of Light:Very good. We shall be counting on your support, then."
"Mog:The knock back icon is your chance to perform a chain attack, kupo!"
"Mog:Oh no! A Flan, kupo! Good thing it's weak to Vivi's Fire spell!"
"Vivi:F-Fire? Okay, I'll give it a try!"
"Mog:Good job! Keep it up, kupo!"
"Mog:It's an Iron Giant, kupo! One strike from that thing can be trouble!"
"Mog:Use Shining Shield to protect Vivi, kupo!"
"Mog:Look! We closed it, kupo!"
Vivi:Now we don't need to worry about those monsters anymore.
"Rem:No, Vivi. You forget that there's more than one Torsion."
"Mog:Indeed, kupo! They've been cropping up all across the land."
Warrior of Light:And it is our duty to ensure that each and every one of them is closed.
"Mog:You won't be alone! We'll find more people along the way who can help us, kupo!"
Warrior of Light:Is that man a friend of yours?
Vivi:Mister! We're over here!
???:Sorry 'bout that! Was busy inspecting the area.
"Mog:Did you find anything, kupo?"
Sazh:Yeah. There's a big Torsion up ahead. Bet that's where all the monsters are coming from.
"Mog:Kupopo! We only just closed one and you're telling me there's another, bigger one nearby!?"
"Mog:Good grief, kupo... Well, I suppose it's nothing we can't handle together!"
"Rem:Once we eradicate all the Torsions, will we be able to return to our respective worlds?"
"Vivi:Yes, I'm certain of it! That's why we have to do our best to help them!"
"Mog:That's the spirit, kupo! Now that Sazh is back, we can go and close the next Torsion!"
Warrior of Light:When this is all over...
Warrior of Light:I wonder if there will even be a world left for me to return to...
"???:Little do they know, should all go according to plan, soon they'll be dancing to the beat of my drum."
"???:Oh, what a spectacular show it will be!"
Mog:Red Bats are pesky creatures that use Flap to dodge your attacks!
"Mog:But Sazh's ability Aim will hit the enemy every time, kupo!"
Mog:Kupo... Skeletons unleash a frightening attack after using Brace.
"Mog:But inflicting a BRV Break will smash it into pieces, leaving it vulnerable for a few turns!"
Sazh:Nasty bats nearly had us back there. Dodge every attack you throw at 'em.
"Mog:That's why we need as many allies as possible, kupo!"
Vivi:Lookthere's someone over there!
"Mog:P-please, kupo! Lower your fists! We mean you no harm!"
???:...You don't appear to be dangerous.
"Sazh:We're not, but I wouldn't blame you if you turned and ran the other way. Just look at usa talking moogle, a knight..."
"???:You, on the other hand, seem fairly...normal. What is this place?"
"Warrior of Light:While I cannot answer that with any certainty, what I can tell you is that none of us are natives of this land."
???:You mean...this isn't my world?
"Sazh:No, it isn't. It's dangerous for a little lady like you to be wandering this place alone."
"???:I'm not alone. My friends are here, too. We got separated earlier."
"???:I've been searching for them, but I keep running into monsters."
"Mog:Kupo... Up until recently, our land was a peaceful one."
Mog:It was only after the Torsions started to appear that the beasts began terrorizing us.
"Mog:But I have hope that tranquility will soon be restored by the light, kupo!"
Warrior of Light:Perhaps she too possesses the light.
???:...I do?
"Mog:Yes! Yes, indeed, kupo!"
"Vivi:Maybe you can join us, miss?"
"???:Hm... Yes, maybe I should."
???:Perhaps then I'll finally be able to find my friends.
Tifa:I'm Tifa. I look forward to working with you.
"Mog:Welcome aboard, kupo! You look like you can take out more than a few skeletons with those fists!"
"Mog:This is fantastic, kupo! Once again our numbers have grown and soon we'll be closing Torsions faster than ever before!"
"Warrior of Light:Caution, friends. Someone is nearby."
Tifa:Wait! That's...
Tifa:Thank goodness it's you! I've been looking all over for you!
"Mog:You know him, kupo?"
"Mog:Well, that makes my job easier! Hello, Mr. Spiky-Head!"
Cloud:A moogle that can talk?
"Tifa:Well, the world we're in right now is"
Warrior of Light:Now is not the time. It seems we have company.
Cloud:Stand back. I've got this.
Tifa:Cloud! You're not alone anymore! Let us help you.
"Mog:Why won't anyone listen to me, kupo?"
Warrior of Light:You were quick to defeat those enemies. I'm impressed.
"Tifa:Cloud, what you're doing is reckless!"
"Tifa:You don't know anything about this world...so let's stick together, okay?"
"Mog:She's right, kupo! Besides, you possess the will of the light. We can save this world together."
Cloud:Not interested.
Sazh:Looks like other worlds also have their fair share of strongheaded soldiers who take on way too much alone.
"Sazh:Cloud, was it? What's your game plan?"
Cloud:There's someone I need to settle things with.
Sazh:And do you have any idea where this someone is? Sure you don't need any help?
"Sazh:This moogle's the only one who knows anything about this world. Besides, what've you gotta lose?"
Cloud:Maybe you're right.
"Cloud:All right, I'll go with you. Just don't get in my way."
Sazh:We won't. We're on your side.
"Mog:Then it's settled! Great having you aboard, kupo!"
Tifa:Looks like it's you and me again!
"Mog:The more the merrier! You can never have too many friends, kupo!"
???:Why me? Why do bad things always happen to me?
Sazh:Huh? Is that...!?
???:Wait. Is that an exit over there?
"Mog:Do you know him, kupo?"
Sazh:Do I know him? He's one of my buddies from my world!
Mog:Kupopo! I sensed a strong will of the light from him!
"Sazh:But he's still just a kid, you know? I mean, he's older than Vivi..."
"Vivi:You're really worried about him, aren't you?"
"Sazh:Yeah, I have a son of my own, so I can't just... Sorry, this isn't the time to be getting sentimental."
Warrior of Light:Getting out of here alone is not a simple task. We must find him quickly.
"Mog:Let's help him and get him to join us, kupo!"
Sazh:Hope!
Hope:Where are we? And who are they? And why are they
"Sazh:Relax, relax. They may look a little different, but they're on our side."
"Mog:Your name's Hope, kupo?"
Hope:Did that moogle just talk? This is some kind of ultra-realistic toy...right?
"Mog:I'm not a toy, kupo! More importantly, I have something I need to tell you!"
"Mog:...And that's the situation we're in right now, kupo."
"Warrior of Light:And you, Hope, also possess the will of the light. You are one of us."
Hope:The will of the light? M-me? Are you sure?
"Mog:I'm positive, kupo! Trust me."
"Sazh:At any rate, we gotta do something about this world if we ever plan on going back to our own."
"Sazh:So come with us. It's safer that way, you know?"
"Sazh:Besides, you'd be doing us a favor! We could use your skills."
"Hope:All right, I'm in."
Hope:I'll do what I can to help.
"Mog:Hello, kupo! What are you doing?"
"Mog:No. Why, kupo?"
???:This forest's aether is corrupted. I can only hope that the taint has not spread much further beyond this area.
"Mog:Corrupted aether...? Oh, because of the Torsions! That's where the dark energy is spilling from. We're here to close them!"
"Mog:Yes, they serve as an interdimensional portal to our world. That's where the dark energy and scary monsters are coming from, kupo."
???:That would explain the sinister presence I felt earlier.
"Mog:The will of the light radiates strongly from you. Will you help us, kupo?"
???:Hm... Working with a group would certainly facilitate my investigation.
"Mog:Hooray, ku!"
"???:I am afraid, however, that I must decline. There is another matter I must attend to first."
Mog:What if we can help you? Would you join us then?
"???:Perhaps. But before we discuss this any further, I ask that you draw your swords."
???:It seems we've been joined by a few uninvited guests.
"Mog:A-are they gone, kupo?"
???:I believe so. I can no longer feel their presence.
"Mog:Good! So what do you say? Will you join us, kupo?"
"???:Having witnessed your incredible strength first-hand, I would be honored to call you allies."
???:Please allow me to properly introduce myself. I am Y'shtola.
"Y'shtola:I am well versed in the art of Conjury, and believe my talents will serve you well."
"Mog:How exciting, kupo! Another friend possessed of the light has agreed to lend a hand to our cause!"
Y'shtola:I take it that having this light is essential to one's ability to close Torsions?
"Mog:That's right, kupo! ...But I don't know how it works..."
Y'shtola:Fascinating... Perhaps there is more to this world than meets the eye.
Rem:I have a bad feeling about this. The monsters in this area are acting very strangely.
"Mog:That means there's a Torsion nearby, kupo!"
Warrior of Light:Yes. I can feel it...and something else.
"Warrior of Light:Everyone, be on your guard. There is something far more malevolent than mere monsters lurking about."
Vivi:M-more malevolent than monsters!? I don't like the sound of that...
Vivi:Wait! Please don't leave me behind!
???:Ah... There you are.
???:Why must you insist on always ruining my fun?
"Mog:That was a close one, kupo! Counter with a summon!"
Cloud:Is that it?
Sazh:And more importantly did getting rid of it solve our monster problem?
Tifa:I think so. Their numbers seem to have diminished at the very least.
"Y'shtola:You must remember, however, that this is not the only Torsion that plagues this world."
"Mog:Indeed, kupo! Our job is far from over."
Mog:But if we continue working together I'm sure we'll accomplish our goal in no time!
Tifa:Then let's keep going.
"Mog:Yes, kupo! Our next destination: the lands beyond the northern sea!"
"Mog:And before you ask how we're going to get there, we'll be going by airship, kupo!"
Sazh:Airship? Excellent. That's just my style.
Cloud:Are you a pilot or something?
Hope:Only the best! How could you tell?
Cloud:I have a friend a lot like him.
Sazh:Let's go! I can't wait to see how this baby flies!
Materia:I see you were successful in closing the Torsion and averting disaster. Thank you.
"Mog:Of course, kupo! It's my duty after all!"
"Mog:And not to toot my own horn, but I've also managed to find four new warriors!"
Materia:Indeed. And each and every one of them has demonstrated enormous promise.
"Materia:I fear, however, that the darkness continues to grow stronger."
"Mog:Wh-what do you mean, kupo?"
Materia:Whoever is responsible has been attempting to bend the Torsions to their own will.
"Mog:That sounds very dangerous, kupo! We must proceed with the utmost caution then!"
"Materia:Yes. And remember, Mog, among the warriors you will encounter is one who knows the darkness."
"Materia:When all is lost, you best turn to him for guidance."
"Mog:Yes, kupo!"
Sazh:We're here!
"Vivi:That was amazing! You really are a great pilot, Mister!"
"Sazh:It's easy once you know the basics. Shame we couldn't fly in any closer, though."
"Mog:Sadly, there aren't any areas we can safely land the airship beyond this point, kupo."
"Cloud:Whatever. We can walk from here. If anything gets in our way, I'll put it down."
Tifa:And who knows? Maybe we'll make some new friends along the way.
Warrior of Light:Where exactly do we need to go?
"Mog:North, kupo! To where the ancient ruins are."
"Mog:The time-space continuum has been heavily distorted in that region, which means a Torsion is close by!"
Tifa:Ruins? I guess your world isn't that much different from ours.
"Zidane:You've been gathering an army of beasts. What do you intend to do with them, Kuja!?"
Kuja:You of all people should understand! If you've come all this way to mock me
Zidane:Mock you? I'm here to
"Vivi:Oh! That's him, everyonethe friend I was telling you about! And he's with that man..."
Kuja:Bearers of light... How inconvenient.
Warrior of Light:That manhe just opened a Torsion!
Zidane:No! I can't believe he got away!
Vivi:I-I'm sorry... It's all my fault.
"Zidane:Don't worry about it, Vivi. I""m just glad you're safe. ...That said, who are these pretty ladies?"
Tifa:I'm Tifa. I take it you're Vivi's friend?
"Vivi:Yes! His name is Zidane. He's really, really strong and reliable!"
"Zidane:Aw, Vivistop it! You're making me blush. And you might be...?"
Rem:I'm Rem. It seems we come from very different places.
"Mog:Everyone here is blessed with the lightthe power to close Torsions, kupo!"
Zidane:Torsions...? Is that what you call the portals Kuja uses to let monsters in and out?
"Vivi:Yes, and that's why this world is in big trouble."
"Mog:Not just this world, kupo! If the Torsions continue to spread, they'll eventually reach your home, too!"
Zidane:So that's what he's been up to!
"Mog:Zidane, you also have the gift of light! Will you help us, kupo?"
Zidane:I don't see why not.
"Mog:Hooray, kupo! Once again, our number's grown!"
"Zidane:That's right. If you need someone agile, I'm your guy!"
Warrior of Light:You would be the first among us capable of such feats. We would be glad to have you in our ranks.
Y'shtola:A man has stepped through the Torsion!
Sazh:Sweet mercy! I hope he's friendly.
Sazh:All these armored-up soldiers look the same to me.
???:Identify yourselves!
Sazh:Your mother not teach you any manners? You first.
Sazh:Guess you really shouldn't judge a book by its cover.
"Mog:I can sense the will of the light, kupo!"
Warrior of Light:It appears that fate has guided him to us.
Cecil:The will of the light? Fate? What does any of that mean?
Mog:The portal you just came through is a dimensional Torsion. They're what's destroying our world.
"Mog:We're on a journey to seal them, kupo."
"Mog:You share that destiny with usthe will of the light, kupo!"
"Mog:You should join us, kupo!"
Cecil:You would be better off without me.
"Y'shtola:I don't blame you for having doubt, but we need your help."
Warrior of Light:You possess cosmic potential as a warriora gift which must be used for good.
Cecil:I've walked the path of darkness for too long.
Cecil:The light you speak of has faded to but a mere shadow of the past.
"Mog:You just need to believe in yourself, kupo!"
Cecil:Forgive me...
Cecil:Is everyone all right!?
Warrior of Light:It seems we owe you a debt of gratitude.
Cecil:I could scarce stand by and simply watch as the monsters attacked you.
"Mog:Thanks for watching out for us, kupo!"
Y'shtola:Indeed. I fear to think what would have happened had you not been here.
Sazh:You made it all this way alone!? Where'd that self-doubt from earlier go?
"Cecil:I'm glad I could be of some help. Well, I wish you all the best on your journey."
"Mog:Wait, kupo!"
"Mog:Your power is an important piece to our puzzle. Our journey wouldn't be complete without you, kupo."
"Cecil:I appreciate the offer, but I've walked the path of darkness for too long."
Warrior of Light:Darkness is nothing to fear. For there is no darkness without light.
Cecil:Nothing to fear?
"Sazh:Don't know anything about all this darkness mumbo jumbo, but you helped us out of a jam. That makes you a good guy in my book."
"Warrior of Light:It is as Sazh says. Your sword may be forged of darkness, but the light resides in your heart."
Cecil:Do you truly believe I can fight alongside you?
Cloud:That's up to you. What do you want to do?
Cecil:You are right. If this Dark Sword can be used for good...
Cecil:Then I shall accompany you on your journey to save the world!
"Mog:Hooray, kupo!"
Cecil:There is no darkness without light...
Cecil:Maybe my sword will bear the light one day as well.
Sazh:The Torsion's on the other side of these ruins right?
"Mog:Yes. We need to stay vigilant, kupo! The closer we are, the stronger the monsters!"
"Rem:Be careful, everyone. There's no telling what's out there."
"Zidane:Aw, Remyou're so sweet. Just my kind of girl."
"Rem:Please, Zidane. Now's not the time for jokes."
Zidane:Who's joking?
"Sazh:Quit while you're ahead, kid."
Y'shtola:That man you were with earlierwhat is your relationship with him?
Sazh:And I guess laying waste to his own planet wasn't enough?
"Zidane:I have no idea what his motives for coming here are, but I intend to find out."
Zidane:This may sound weird but...
Zidane:I feel like I know these ruins.
Hope:Yeah... They're familiar somehow.
Cloud:Aren't the two of you from different planets?
"Sazh:That said, these ruins don't look like any we've been to, but they do feel familiar."
Zidane:Maybe Mog knows something.
"Zidane:Mog, you told us these were ancient ruins."
Zidane:That means this world must have had a civilization that once lived here.
"Mog:Actually, no, kupo!"
Cloud:What do you mean?
"Mog:You see, our world was created by the gods in the image of other planets."
"Mog:Each aspect of this place was inspired by your homes, kupo."
Mog:That's probably why you recognize certain areas.
Sazh:So the reason why we haven't met any natives of this planet...
Sazh:Is because this place is something of an artificial creation?
"Mog:Yes, kupo! And that's why it's important for us to stop this world from becoming corrupted."
"Mog:Otherwise, it'll spread to all the other worlds, kupo!"
Zidane:We have to do what we can.
???:Who goes there!?
Warrior of Light:Please lower your weapons. We have no intention to fight you.
???:Very well. Although...
???:I would have loved to test my own skill at combat against yours. Perhaps another time.
"Mog:What brings you here, kupo?"
"???:A moogle!? If you must know, I was searching the area for living creatures...and it looks like I found some."
"Sazh:He doesn't live here, if that's what you're thinking. We've only come to close the Torsions."
???:So this land is completely devoid of life? How odd...
"???:You see, I've been attempting to learn more about what has caused the sudden influx of beasts in this region."
???:The only real clue I've stumbled across in my investigations was a mysterious coil of energy.
???:...Is this perhaps the Torsion to which you refer?
"Sazh:That'd be it. Our goal is the same, then."
???:Our goals are the same? So these Torsions must be connected to the monsters!
???:Interesting. Thank you for your help!
"Mog:W-wait! ...She's gone. What a shame, kupo. She had the light, too."
Y'shtola:You appear perplexed. What's wrong?
Sazh:We met a girl who came as quickly as she left. Didn't even have time to recruit her.
"Y'shtola:If, as you say, our goals are the same, you'll get your chancewhen the crystal's light shines brightest."
???:Hyah! Never fear! I've come to save
"???:Aw, don't tell me the fun is already over."
Warrior of Light:We only just finished.
Yda:Y'shtola!? What are you doing here!?
"Y'shtola:I could ask you the same. So you're the girl everyone was talking about earlier... Speaking of which, where are the others?"
Yda:I couldn't tell you.
"Y'shtola:Gods... Well, at least you're here."
Sazh:You guys know each other?
"Yda:Of course! In fact, she's one of the very people I've been searching for!"
Yda:I was following the Torsions when I spotted you. I never expected Y'shtola to be here.
Sazh:You've been following the Torsions?
"Yda:That's right. I noticed the monsters coming from them and figured by pursuing them, I'd find my friends sooner or later."
Sazh:A woman of action. I like it!
"Mog:How goes the search, kupo?"
"Yda:Good, thanks largely to you."
Yda:I'm also thinking to investigate another area. What would you say to accompanying me?
"Y'shtola:Chance has brought us together. It would be unwise to defy it, would it not?"
"Mog:I agree, kupo! Let's go!"
Yda:Excellent! I'll meet you guys there!
"Sazh:Make that ""non-stop action."" Well, I guess we better get going before we lose sight of her."
Yda:I think that about takes care of this area.
Yda:Thank you. I couldn't have done it without your help!
"Y'shtola:What do you propose we do next, Yda?"
Yda:I must go and find the others. I'll leave things here to you.
Y'shtola:Wait! It's better if we all go together.
"Y'shtola:I understand your concern for the others, but we mustn't let hate cloud our judgement."
Yda:You're right.
"Yda:Besides, the Scions are a tough bunch! I'm sure they're fine."
"Yda:Well, then! What are you guys waiting for? Let's go!"
"Y'shtola:While a little reckless at times, Yda is an old friend and a good ally."
Y'shtola:I'm certain she will prove to be a source of great strength in the journey ahead.
Yda:Reckless? You almost make it sound like I'm a liability!
"Mog:We're very happy to have you, kupo! We need all the help we can get!"
Yda:I'm glad to hear it! You won't regret it!
Zidane:So this is a Torsion...
Warrior of Light:You seem troubled.
Zidane:Kuja... He warped into the space right in front of me with one of these.
"Cloud:He did? But he's not a monster, is he?"
"Mog:It's scary to think he can create them so easily, kupo! Torsions rip apart the planes of time and space and randomly put them back together."
"Zidane:...Shortly after, he opened another one and disappeared into it..."
Sazh:You've gotta be kidding. Don't tell me you're actually considering
Zidane:We know next to nothing about these Torsions. Maybe the only way to find out more is to enter one.
Warrior of Light:The idea has merit.
Sazh:And what if we're walking into a trap?
Y'shtola:The chance to gain some answers outweighs that potential risk.
"Zidane:I don't know about you guys, but I'm going in there."
"Mog:I don't think you should, kupo, but I won't stop you..."
Zidane:I've made up my mind. Coming?
Sazh:*Sigh* Kids these days...
Y'shtola:I take it you're planning on staying behind?
Sazh:Do I even have a choice?
Warrior of Light:So this is how the Torsion looks from the inside...
Vivi:The atmosphere is so much heavier in here... I don't like it.
Rem:Yes... It almost feels like we're on a battlefield.
"Mog:What you're feeling is darkness, kupo. We're surrounded by it in here."
Zidane:Kuja's gotta be around here somewhere!
Vivi:Look! Over there!
Kuja:It's not enough...not nearly enough.
"Kuja:To change the course of fate, one must first reshape the cogs on which the world is run."
Zidane:Kuja! What are you doing!?
"Kuja:I knew you would come, Zidane."
"Kuja:After all, you are but puppets to those foolish beings you call godsyour lives but scripts written by their hand..."
Warrior of Light:Gods? Foolish!? How dare you!
"Kuja:Ah, the Warrior of Lightthe man from which this narrative unfolds..."
"Kuja:Even you, in all your might, shall fail to stand against me."
"Kuja:Get them, my darlings!"
Vivi:Something's coming!
Warrior of Light:Those thingsthey appear to have assumed our forms.
Sazh:Or were created by Kuja to look like us.
"Vivi:Back on our world, he often created soldiers to do his bidding."
"Zidane:The thing is, even if he did make them, how did he know what all of us looked like?"
Cloud:And also why go through all that trouble?
Warrior of Light:...There is always the possibility that the specters were in no way related to Kuja.
"Mog:Whatever the case, we must be very careful, kupo! Whoever is behind this is extremely dangerous!"
Mog:We also need to find the rest of these monsters and destroy them before they cause any problems!
Zidane:Don't worry. We'll get rid of them.
Cloud:Yeah. We need to stop them before they reach our home.
"Mog:Yes, kupo! I'm counting on you!"
Manikin:G...od...
"Mog:They look like us, but I don't sense the will of the light."
"Mog:Everyone, get ready!"
Hope:Look! I bet this will take us back!
"Zidane:If there's a way in, there's gotta be a way out, huh?"
Y'shtola:But it might not lead back to the same world we came from.
Vivi:At least Kuja seems to be gone.
Warrior of Light:Shall we continue forward?
Hope:But wait. Kuja knows how to manipulate Torsions and move between them.
Hope:How do we know he didn't create this one?
Zidane:There's only one way to find out.
"Vivi:Kuja, what are you planning?"
Hope:Are you okay?
Vivi:Yes. I'm just worried. He hurt a lot of my friends back home.
"Hope:Don't worry, Vivi. It's not going to happen againbecause you won't let it."
Hope:Just remember to stand strong and keep going no matter what happens.
"Vivi:I will. Thank you, Mister!"
Y'shtola:Are the two of you coming?
"Hope:We'll be right there! Come on, Vivi!"
Vivi:Right behind you!
Zidane:It looks like we're back at the ruins. May the hunt for Kuja begin!
Zidane:Everything okay? You seemed lost in thought back there.
Vivi:I'm fine. Let's just keep going.
"Zidane:...If you say so. You've done great so far, you know."
Vivi:For that I have you and everyone else to thank. I never could have done anything on my own.
"Vivi:Even with the light, I don't think I can save the world..."
Vivi:I'm not strong like any of you.
"Zidane:Trust me, you're just as strong as any of us."
"Zidane:You have a reason to fight and so long as you keep reminding yourself of it, you'll find you have the power to save any world."
"Vivi:Thanks, Zidane. You always know what to say."
"Zidane:I've been thinking, if the reason we can close Torsions is because of the light..."
Zidane:How does Kuja do it?
Vivi:I don't know. He shouldn't have the light. He's done a lot of bad things.
"Zidane:But it's no use talking about it. For now, we just need to focus on finding him."
"Rem:There, when you die, you also cease to exist in people's memories."
Vivi:And there's no way you can transfer your life's memories to others?
Vivi:That's terrible. What's the point of even living if you're going to be forgotten?
Rem:It was done so that those left behind wouldn't have to suffer. It's the crystal's will.
"Rem:That said, we fear death just the same as any of you."
Hope:And so Kuja attempts to defy fate.
"Hope:In our world, each of us is given alife's purposea destiny, if you willbycosmic beingssimilar to those you call gods."
Vivi:Me and Zidane and Kuja are just like you...
Hope:Have you ever attempted to defy your fate?
"Vivi:Have you, Mister?"
Hope:My friends and I...we fought it once.
"Rem:...Defying fate, huh?"
Vivi:Just like Kuja. Only he's done a lot of wrong in his life.
"Rem:If Torsions distort reality, that means there's a chance we can use them to change the fate of our worlds."
Vivi:B-but what about all the monsters that come out of them?
Hope:We also still don't know the true nature of these Torsions. I think we should forget about this and put our trust in Mog for now.
"Rem:Vivi, Zidanethat man, Kuja, he's from your world right?"
"Zidane:Gaia, yeah. That's where we're from, though I can't necessarily say the same for him..."
Hope:And you have absolutely no idea what he could be after?
Vivi:I think he's...afraid of dying...
"Vivi:Kuja likely thinks that by creating Torsions and warping reality, he can defy fate."
Rem:So he's motivated by a fear of death?
Hope:And he fights to change his destiny...
Zidane:It doesn't matter what his reasons are. The fact remains that he hurts people to get what he wants. He must be stopped.
"Zidane:What he's doing, if left unchecked, will affect all our worlds."
"Zidane:Besides, it's not our sympathy he's after."
"Zidane:Tifa, you like plays, don't you? You ought to come watch me perform sometime."
"Zidane:I'm pretty talented. I even got the princess to cry once, and trust me, she's practically made of ice."
"Tifa:Zidane, do you even understand the gravity of our situation? Now's really not the time."
"Zidane:Aw, come onlighten up. We've still got a long trip ahead of us."
"Zidane:So, Rem, I hear we're the same age. Do you have anyone youyou knowlike?"
Zidane:Ah... Guess I don't stand a chance here.
Zidane:...Nothing.
"Tifa:Zidane, you're a lot funnier than I ever gave you credit for."
Zidane:Of course I'm funny. What use would I be if I couldn't keep beautiful ladies like you entertain
Sazh:Who's asking?
"Vaan:Oh, me? I'm Vaan. And that's a really cool airship!"
"Sazh:Finally, someone who understands! And it's not just for show. It's fast, safe, and comes with the best pilot you've ever met."
"Vaan:Heh-heh, I know a good airship when I see one. So it's yours, huh?"
"Mog:Since when did you become the owner!? I got us that ship, kupo!"
Vaan:Oh yeah! I almost forgot to ask.
Vaan:Where am I?
"Mog:You're just now wondering that, kupo?"
Vaan:What's the big deal? People get lost all the time when they're hunting.
"Vaan:I can't be the first. So, can you take me home in that airship of yours?"
"Mog:I'm afraid it can't take you back to your world, kupo."
Vaan:My...world? What are you talking about?
"Mog:Dimensional Torsions have been appearing, connecting this world to others, kupo."
"Sazh:We all came from another world. Including you, apparently."
Sazh:Hoo-boy! Looks like we've got company.
"Sazh:Be right back with you in a second, kid."
Vaan:What was that all about? That monster looked just like me.
Tifa:We call them Manikins. We've already run into others that look like our friends as well.
"Mog:It's true, kupo. The world's being invaded by monsters."
Mog:So we're on a journey to find new friends with the will of the light to stop them.
"Mog:And I can sense the light in you, kupo!"
Vaan:I get it. You're on a mission.
"Vaan:But wouldn't it be easier to find and stop whoever's making these, uh, Torsions?"
"Mog:We still don't really know who or what that is, kupo."
Tifa:But we do know that monsters are using the Torsions to spread destruction throughout this world.
"Mog:Which is why we've been defeating the monsters to seal the Torsions, kupo."
Vaan:Then let me come with you. I can't just look the other way when someone's in need of help.
Tifa:Wonderful! We can use all the help we can get.
"Sazh:All right, all right, enough chitchat. Hey kid, wanna peek at the engine?"
"Mog:I hope he knows how important our mission is, kupo."
"Tifa:I'm sure he'll learn. Besides, a little optimism is a good thing."
Zidane:Huh? Did you hear that?
Warrior of Light:We must be close.
"Kuja:More! ...More!!! Rip it apart, dismantle itdisfigure this world beyond recognition!"
Zidane:What do you think you're doing!?
Warrior of Light:He appears to be giving power to the Torsions.
"Mog:He can't get away with it, kupo!"
Kuja:Fools! Spare me the sermon! You know nothing!
"Kuja:You, especially, tiny rat! You blindly worship these so-called gods"
"Mog:I won't let you speak of them that way! This is where it ends, kupo!"
"Kuja:Threaten me all you want, but it will not change what's to come."
Zidane:What are you talking about!?
"Kuja:My role here is finished. I am bowing out. Come, my dragons! It is your time to take center stage!"
Mog:D-d-dragon! Kupooo!
"Mog:Watch out for the Red Dragon's ability Megaflash! If it uses Charge, do whatever it takes to stop him!"
"Mog:I don't wanna be barbeque, kupo!"
Zidane:Kuja! I've got you now!
Kuja:This light... It's riveting.
Zidane:Stop with this nonsense! Tell us what you know!
Kuja:To divulge such knowledge to someone as worthless as you is but a waste of my breath.
"Kuja:Farewell, Zidane."
"Mog:He escaped again, and we still don't have answers, but our mission remains the same, kupo!"
"Mog:Hooray! One more Torsion gone, kupo!"
Yda:So this is yourrather ourmission.
"Vaan:So this area is now safe from monsters, right?"
Warrior of Light:Aye. But that is not to say we can let our guard down. The threat we face might be far greater than we anticipated.
Zidane:It's like he's trying to use the Torsions to do something else...something more.
Hope:So the Torsions are what is corrupting this world...
"Mog:And that's why we need to close them, kupo!"
"Mog:If we don't, it'll begin spreading to your worlds!"
Warrior of Light:What can you tell us of the Torsions' origins?
"Mog:I'm not sure... Much of this world still remains a mystery to me, kupo!"
Mog:I was hoping we'd find the answer to that as we went along...
"Zidane:Well, standing around interrogating Mog isn't going to get us anywhere. We need to continue our search."
Sazh:Let's head on back to the airship!
"Materia:Kuja, what so spurs you to change the tides of destiny?"
Materia:Have you been swayed by the darkness or is there something more to this that I fail to understand...?
"Mog:Our allies continue to grow, kupo!"
Materia:I have noticed.
"Materia:You have done well, Mog. The greater our numbers the sooner this war will end."
"Mog:Yes, kupo!"
Materia:I only hope you will continue to be so forthright in your efforts.
"Mog:Is something on your mind? You seem worried, kupo."
Materia:...Kuja has been manipulating the Torsions.
Materia:I have yet to determine if his handiwork will be the very thing to damn us or save us.
"Mog:Kupopo! It doesn't matter who he is. If he's creating Torsions, then he's the enemy, kupo!"
"Mog:He must be struck down at all costs, kupo!"
"Materia:Indeed. And I shall rely on you to do just that, my friend."
Sazh:We made it!
"Mog:Just up ahead is the ancient Kingdom of Thronus, kupo!"
"Cecil:That is where the next Torsion is located, correct?"
"Mog:Yes, kupo! *Shiver* I can feel the darkness from here."
"Sazh:Sorry, wish we could've flown in a bit closer."
Cecil:There is no need for apologies. We understand that it is near impossible to land the airship on certain terrain.
Zidane:I'm not complaining! This gives me a chance to go on romantic strolls along the beach with some beautiful ladies!
"Tifa:You really think a lot of yourself, don't you?"
???:Yoink!
Tifa:Wait... Yuffie!?
"Zidane:Hey, what happened to the jewel on your glove?"
"Yuffie:Wow, I've never seen a device like this before. And what's this, an ancient dagger? Not bad. Not bad at all."
Tifa:What do you think you're doing!? Give that back!
"Yuffie:Oh, hey, Tifa! Long time no see."
"Tifa:""Long time no see""? Do you even understand the situation you're in right now!?"
"Yuffie:Don't know, don't care. Want your stuff back? Then ya gotta catch me!"
"Tifa:All right, you asked for it."
Yuffie:Uh-oh... Tifa's serious.
Yuffie:There's only one thing to do at a time like this... Run away!
Zidane:Don't tell me that thief's a friend of yours?
Tifa:I'm afraid so. I had no idea she was here though.
Zidane:The nerve of that girl! She took my favorite dagger.
"Hope:She, uh...stole my device, too. It's not something I can use in this world, but..."
"Tifa:Ugh, she's always like this! Come on, we're going after her!"
Zidane:Gotcha!
Cloud:It's over.
Yuffie:Cloud! You're here too!?
Cloud:Just give back what you stole.
Yuffie:Not in a million years! Let me go!
Y'shtola:You best surrender now.
Yuffie:Hmph. I wouldn't be so sure about that. Never underestimate a ninja.
Cloud:Guess I should've seen that coming.
"Yuffie:Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk! You can never let your guard down around me!"
"Yuffie:Oh, and check out what the cat-girl gave me."
Y'shtola:My staff!?
Yuffie:Look at all these goodies! I've never seen anythin' like 'em.
Yuffie:I bet I can sell this one for a hefty price!
"Sazh:Yeah, you'd make a small fortune selling items from other worlds."
"Zidane:But you're much too cut efor petty thievery. If you want something to steal, you can have my heart any day."
Sazh:This ain't the time for that!
"Yuffie:Heh, now's my chance! Later!"
Sazh:See what you did? Now she's gone!
"Tifa:Give it up, Yuffie. We've got you now."
Sazh:You've taken this prank too far.
Vivi:Excuse me... Could I please have my stuff back?
"Yuffie:*Sigh* All right, all right. You win."
Yuffie:My beautiful treasures...
Tifa:They're not yours!
"Mog:Kupo! I've never seen anyone run so fast! We sure could use someone like you, kupo!"
Sazh:This little thief? You gotta be kidding.
Tifa:Yuffie's actually a close friend of mine back in our world. She...just has some sticky fingers.
Sazh:If you say so.
"Yuffie:Hm, so they really need me."
"Tifa:All right, then. Shall we get going?"
"Mog:Hooray for new friends, kupo!"
"Yuffie:I mean, they're practically begging me to join them..."
"Yuffie:All right, you've got it! I'll go with you!"
"Yuffie:Hey! Didn't you hear me!? The conqueror of evil, Yuffie Kisaragi, just said she'll join you!"
"Yuffie:Oh, well. Who cares? This is gonna be great!"
Yuffie:Now I'll be just seconds away from those otherworldy treasures.
Yuffie:And soon they'll be all mine for the taking!
"???:Who do you think you are, taking that lofty tone with me!?"
Seifer:As if they have anything worthwhile to say.
"Seifer:If there's anything I despise, it's mindless sheep!"
Warrior of Light:Mindless sheep!?
"Mog:How rude, kupo!"
Cloud:Stop with whatever it is you're trying to do.
Seifer:I don't like the look of you.
Cloud:Are we going to stand here and take this?
"Mog:Please be on your way, kupo! If you continue to harass us, I'll have no choice but to report you to Mistress Materia!"
"Mog:Well, kupo?"
"Raijin:What? I wasn't listening, ya know?"
"Seifer:Quiet, Raijin. Can't you see they're trying to pick a fight with us?"
Y'shtola:Far from it. You are the one intent on starting a fight with us.
Seifer:I can't stand people like you. Talking down to others as if you know better!
Warrior of Light:Nothing we say will get through to him.
Mog:Kupopo! Then we have no choice but to open his ears to reason!
"Seifer:Heh. These weaklings aren't even worth my time. Raijin, Fujin, take care of them."
"Raijin:You better be ready, ya know!"
Seifer:What's the matter with you guys?
Seifer:Whatever. I don't need help taking out the trash.
"Cecil:Are you finally ready to talk? If so, let us begin with basic introductions."
"Raijin:There's a lot we wanna say, ya know?"
Seifer:Stop it! Stop engaging them! They're
"Raijin:SorrytheDisciplinary Committeehas spoken. My hands are tied now, ya know?"
Raijin:We'll be back!
Vivi:Why did that man want to fight us? He didn't seem to be a bad person...
Cecil:Perhaps he was feeling overwhelmed and turned to anger.
"Mog:I understand, kupo. But it doesn't excuse his actions!"
"Mog:That said, we can't get distracted. We have a Torsion to close, kupo!"
Cecil:We are well aware of the fact.
"Vivi:Um, Mr. Cecildo you think there's a chance they'll become our allies, just like you did?"
Cecil:It is not out of the question. They appeared to be new to this world.
"Cecil:If we run into them again, perhaps we can attempt to recruit them."
"Yda:Seifer, was it? He seemed to have quite a temper."
Vaan:Talk about the pot calling the kettle black.
Tifa:Vaan! No need to be rude!
"Hope:He didn't seem like a bad person...just liable to cause trouble, probably without even meaning to."
"Tifa:There's no denying he was a pain, but it felt like he was putting on an act."
"Yda:Well, I suppose there's no harm in trying to recruit him and his friends."
Cloud:It's not their skill that's the problem. It's their personalities.
"Vaan:Yeah, just because they aren't the enemy, doesn't mean they're on our side."
Vaan:I don't want him coming with us. He's too arrogant and grumpy.
"Hope:Agreed... Even if we did form an alliance, I do't know if that would mean anything to him."
"Mog:No matter who they are or what they're like, we just need to focus on our task at hand, kupo."
"Mog:But if they get in our way, we will have to fight them, kupo..."
"Mog:M-more of what, kupo!?"
???:Don't think I'm so easily fooled! I shall trounce you as thoroughly as I did the first time!
Warrior of Light:It appears he is under the impression that we are Manikins.
"Sazh:Kid, listen. I know you think you saw us, but"
???:Enough! I'll show you what Eblan ninjas are made of!
???:*Pant* Not bad! Nothing like those monsters from earlier!
Zidane:I'd hope so. We are the real thing after all.
Warrior of Light:I gather you were attacked by foes who resemble us.
???:...You can speak? Properly? I guess you really aren't them.
"Rem:We're human just like you. We're not going to hurt you, I promise."
???:What choice do I have than to trust the words of a pretty lady such as yourself?
Cecil:Did you say Eblan!?
Edge:Wait. That armor...
Cecil:Indeed. My name is Cecil.
Edge:What's a Baron knight doing here? Shouldn't you be exploring the world for the crystals?
Rem:This isn't the world you call home anymore.
"Mog:Let me take over from here, kupo!"
"Mog:...And that's what happened, kupo."
Edge:So the world's in danger and you're on a journey to save it?
"Edge:All right, then! Count me in!"
Seifer:Just shut up and follow us. I'm going to
"Zidane:Picking up girls now? Not too good at it, are ya?"
Zidane:Lesson one: Tenderness and affection go a long way. The very opposite of what you're
Seifer:I let you off the hook last time but you won't be so lucky this time!
Zidane:You let us off the hook!? That's not how I remember it!
Seifer:Shut up!
Raijin:Not again...
Seifer:Whose side are the two of you on!?
"Mog:...He really does have a temper, kupo."
"Seifer:This time, I'll make it as a knight... I have to..."
Seifer:And I'm not going to let you stand in my way!
"Mog:Then you give us no choice, kupo!"
"Raijin:Time to get serious, ya know!"
Seifer:Let's see what you wusses can do!
"Raijin:Seifer, you should've listened to us, ya know. Let's get outta here."
Warrior of Light:...And they are gonebefore we could even speak a word.
Zidane:Are you all right? Did they hurt you?
"???:No, I'm fine. I met them right before you came. As soon as I told them who I was..."
"???:They insisted I join them. I, of course, had no choice but to refuse."
"Mog:The light radiates strongly from you, kupo! What's your name?"
"Yuna:Ah, sorry. I'm Yuna."
Rem:I don't know what that is. I assume you're also a warrior of some kind from a different world?
Zidane:What exactly do summoners do where you're from?
Yuna:We are trained to kill monsters and protect the people.
"Yuna:It's a skill I'm glad to have. I was separated from my friends, and while searching for a way home, I was attacked by monsters."
Rem:And that's how you met Seifer?
"Yuna:Yes. He wouldn't let me out of his sight, telling me he couldn't leave a girl with such an unfortunate destiny on her own."
Warrior of Light:He also proclaimed he wanted to become a knight.
"Zidane:Seems to me, he needs to learn the meaning of ""no."" What an oaf."
"Mog:Well, if you're alone, why don't you come with us?"
"Mog:We know more about this place than Seifer and his friends. We can tell you all about it, kupo!"
Yuna:Are you sure it's okay for me to come with you?
Zidane:Of course! We can't leave a beautiful young lady out here to fend for herself!
"Yuna:Thank you. In that case, I look forward to learning more about this place from you."
"Raijin:I think we should've listened to what they had to say. They might've been able to help, ya know?"
Seifer:Stop talking about them! Can't you see I'm in a bad mood already!?
Seifer:That girlshe said her name was Yuna...
"Seifer:Fate, you cruel mistressto think that you'd thrust such a great burden upon such a frail creature..."
Seifer:Wait. I remember nowthose imbeciles that showed up mentioned they were going to the Lost Kingdom.
Seifer:No. We're gonna beat them there.
Seifer:We'll protect her by exterminating all the monsters in the area before they arrive.
"Raijin:Got it, Seifer! We'll follow your lead, ya know!"
Vaan:Not again.
Seifer:You're late. We've already taken care of this area.
Warrior of Light:You mean to say you have defeated all of the monsters here?
Cecil:You have our thanks. You have saved us a great deal of trouble.
"Raijin:Thanks? From you? I must be hearing things, ya know?"
"Vaan:These two are actual knights, after all."
"Seifer:What are you trying to imply, kid!?"
"Vaan:Well, you're not exactly the knightly typeat least not by my world's standards."
Vaan:Don't tell me you're upset?
"Raijin:He's upset, ya know."
Warrior of Light:There is a Torsion beyond this point that we must close. There are many more like it that must also be sealed.
"Warrior of Light:If left unattended, the corruption will continue to spread and monsters will run rampant."
Seifer:All right.
Seifer:We'll take care of this Torsioneven if it means I have to pry the privilege from you.
"Cecil:Please. For once, I ask that you lower your sword and listen to what we have to say."
Seifer:I don't have the time to listen to a clown like you.
Seifer:Fujin! Raijin!
"Vaan:You're his friends, aren't you? Why aren't you stopping him!?"
"Raijin:Like you said, we're his friendswe can't let him fight you alone, ya know?"
"Warrior of Light:If you continue to raise your weapons against us, we will be forced to take action against you."
Seifer:Why is everyone trying to make a fool out of me!?
Yuna:We're doing no such thing!
Yuna:We just want you to listen to what we have to say. We know deep down you're a good man...
Yuna:Which is why we want you to join us.
Seifer:What? You've got to be kidding me.
Seifer:Just stay out of our way. That's the only kind of alliance we need.
"Sazh:You really don't know anything about how these things work, do you?"
"Seifer:I'll give you this Torsion, but it's going to be me that saves the worldgot it?"
Seifer:So long.
"Raijin:We'll see ya around, ya know!"
"Yuffie:Hey Vaan, that's some awful nice jewelry you got there."
Yuffie:Where'd you steal it from?
"Yuffie:My countrywasn't weak by any means, but they destroyed us in thewar."
Zidane:And that's how you became a thief.
Yuffie:What!? I'm not a thief! I'm a ninja.
Yuffie:A ninja looking to take back all that Shinra stole from my homeland.
Vaan:I like your ambition.
"Vaan:Unlike you, I was whittling away my life on the streets. I wouldn't have imagined I'd end up in another world on some grand adventure."
"Yuffie:Well, I'm glad someone finally understands the noble cause I fight for!"
"Zidane:...She's really something, isn't she?"
Zidane:Must've been hard to work with someone as flighty and brash as her.
Cloud:She's just like you.
Cloud:Nothing. Let's go.
"Mog:Kupopo! We're here, everyone!"
Sazh:How does Seifer plan on closing the Torsion when he knows next to nothing about how it works?
Yda:Good question. I guess we just have to hope he doesn't do anything foolish.
Warrior of Light:They do not appear to be in the near vicinity. Perhaps they went elsewhere?
"Hope:Either way, I'm sure they're fine. They have each other. That should be enough."
"Sazh:Well, there's no use in us worrying about it."
"Mog:Agreed. Let's focus on our task for now, kupo!"
Warrior of Light:Yes. We must keep an eye out. We are close to a Torsion. No doubt there are monsters lurking nearby.
"Hope:We should be extra careful, then."
"???:You there, in theAkademeiauniform!"
King:Where're the others? I haven't been able to get in contact with anyone since I wandered into this place.
"Mog:Do you know him, kupo?"
"Rem:He's not from Akademeia, but he is our friend."
Warrior of Light:It appears you were also summoned to this world to act as its savior.
"Rem:Y-yeah, I can't believe someone as inexperienced as me was chosen either."
"King:That's not what I meant. You're ill, you know?"
"Rem:I-it's nothing. I just get a little cough sometimes, so you don't need to worry about me, okay?"
Warrior of Light:It seems we have visitors.
"Rem:Um, King? Could you do me a favor?"
Rem:Could you keep my illness a secret from everyone else?
King:Sounds like it really is serious then.
King:That's more the reason why you shouldn't be fighting.
"Rem:No, I'm fine! Really. Everyone's just so nice that I don't want to worry them."
King:What a terrible liar.
"Rem:King, I was wondering... Why don't you come with us?"
"Sazh:Yeah, come on! We could use another gunslingerand a talented one at that."
"King:I was trained to use these handguns for war, not for protection."
King:A guy like me isn't fit to fight for a noble cause like saving the world.
Sazh:That ain't a reason. Weapons are just tools that level the playing field.
Sazh:What matters is why you pull that trigger. What're your intentions? What's your purpose?
King:My purpose...
Vivi:...I was supposed to be a puppet for war back in my world.
Vivi:But my family and friends gave me purpose.
"Vivi:Instead of hurting others, I decided to protect them with my magic."
"Mog:They're right, kupo!"
Warrior of Light:Your noble intentions shall illuminate the path to righteousness.
"King:So these are the values of other worlds, huh?"
King:I can feel there's something here that wasn't in the shelter I grew up in or Akademeia. Or even in Orience.
"King:I don't know if I believe everything the moogle said just yet, but..."
King:I'm in. I'll fight for this world...and for myself.
"King:We're saving the world by wielding our guns and magic against monsters. A far cry from home, huh?"
"Rem:Yeah, while monsters exist in Orience, it wasn't them we had to fight most of the time."
"Rem:...King, there's something that's been weighing on my mind lately."
King:Let me guess. Death?
Rem:Yeah. While no one we know has died yet...
"Rem:If something were to happen to them, they wouldn't be erased from my memories, right?"
King:Probably not. I don't imagine the crystal's influence extends this far.
"Rem:...I'm just scared that should anyone die, we'll remember them."
King:I agree.
King:But that's why I strongly believe that we need to protect those important to us.
Rem:That's what we can and should do.
Rem:Sorry for bringing it up. Let's go back to the others.
King:It's nothing. We're from the same world. No one else would understand.
"Rem:But... Yeah, I guess you're right. If I fight and die here..."
Rem:At least I won't be forgotten.
Zidane:*Sniff* *Sniff* You smell that?
Vaan:Is it the sweet smell of treasure?
"Zidane:No, not that. It stinks. Doesn't anyone else smell that?"
Sazh:Smell what?
Sazh:Whoa! What is that!?
"Mog:It's coming from up ahead, kupo!"
Zidane:I hope it's not what I think it is...
"Mog:We have to keep going, no matter how smelly, kupo!"
"King:I think I know which monster you're talking about, Zidane. If it's what I think it is..."
"Y'shtola:Then we must proceed with caution, else risk being rendered defenseless."
Zidane:Phew. Let's get outta hereI need a breath of fresh air.
"Yuna:The Torsion should disappear any second now, right?"
"Mog:Yes, ku Wait, do you hear that?"
???:Where...am I?
"Mog:You nearly gave me a heart attack, kupo!"
Zidane:...Who are you?
Bartz:I'm Bartz.
Bartz:A wandering adventurer of sorts.
"Bartz:I got separated from my friends, and while I was searching for them, I was pulled into a limbo-like space. Now I'm here."
"Bartz:So who are you guys? You look to be a knight of some kind...and you, a summoner. Fellow adventurers, I take it?"
Zidane:I guess you could say that.
Zidane:Lemme explain everything from the beginning...
Bartz:Now it all makes sense!
"Bartz:I think I'll join you! Fate brought us togetherthat must mean something. Besides, I don't have anywhere else to be."
"Warrior of Light:The monsters in this area are quite powerful. The greater our numbers, the better."
"Yuna:I, um, I'm glad to have you with us."
"Mog:Now that we have a new friend to help us, let's make for the next Torsion, kupo!"
"Mog:Talk about progress! The light shines brighter than ever, and we just closed our biggest Torsion to date, kupo!"
"Materia:Mog, tell me..."
Materia:Why did you refuse Seifer's help? He is possessed of the lightjust as any of your other warriors.
"Mog:Even if I explained my reasoning, I don't think you'd understand, kupo. You are a goddess, after all. And they are humans."
Materia:I will do my very best.
"Mog:You see, humans are ruled by emotion. Even if their goal is the same, should their beliefs conflict, the result will be disastrous, kupo!"
"Materia:Seifer and your warriors, though they share the same goal, are simply too different..."
Materia:I think I grasp what you are saying.
"Mog:Yes, their intentions are good and their hearts are in the right place, kupo!"
"Mog:They just have different methods, kupo!"
"Materia:Very well. I will not claim to understand it, but will trust in your judgement."
Materia:Now returning to the matter at handI sense a great danger from the lands you are to travel to next.
"Mog:Great danger, kupo!? L-like a super strong monster?"
Materia:Yes... One that is taken by madness and more powerful than you can even imagine.
"Mog:Regardless of its strength, we will return victorious, kupo! We have the light on our side after all!"
Zidane:Brrr! It's so cold out here! I can barely feel my nose!
Bartz:Too bad we couldn't take the airship over those peaks.
"Mog:Kupo! Unfortunately, the next Torsion is located beyond the Crudelis Mountains."
Yuna:And we will have to scale it to get there.
"Yuffie:You're lucky, Mog. You've got a thick layer of fur to protect you from the elements."
"Mog:The heat, the coldit's all the same to me, kupo! What's important is that I do a good job as your guide!"
"Zidane:Come on, guys! If this little guy can do it without complaining, so can we!"
"Yuna:Stay on your toes, everyone. Remember, monsters could appear at any time."
King:That Magitek Armor... It's different from the rest.
Cloud:We'll worry about the details later.
Edge:Did she just fall out of that machine!?
Zidane:Hey! Are you okay!? Wake up!
Warrior of Light:Wait! She attacked us. I think it unwise to approach her.
Zidane:She's practically unconscious. She couldn't hurt us even if she tried.
Edge:Why was she in that machine?
Rem:Magitek armor requires someone to operate it.
"Rem:The model she was in, though, looked a bit different from those in my world."
Zidane:Looksomething just came off her head.
Rem:I sense something. Could it be magic? Magic used to addle the mind?
Mog:Kupo! So maybe she was being controlled by this band of metal?
Zidane:...Then she's not the enemy.
Edge:We should wait for her to wake up so she can tell us what happened.
"Warrior of Light:Let's take her to a safe place and treat her wounds, then."
"Mog:Good idea, kupo! There's a cave just over there!"
Mog:Kupo! I sense the light coming from someone in that direction.
Bartz:Are they one of us?
"Yuna:If they are, I hope they're okay. This area is crawling with monsters."
Zidane:Are they alone?
"Mog:Most likely, kupo. They might be lost."
Bartz:Then let's get a move on.
Zidane:Right behind ya.
"Mog:*Sigh* We should follow them before they get into trouble, kupo..."
"Vaan:So, you have any idea what this person looks like?"
"Mog:No, but I can try to conjure up an image, kupo!"
"Tifa:What is it, Vaan? Something on your mind?"
"Vaan:Yeah, I'm wondering if Nah, couldn't be."
"Mog:Kupo, kupo..."
"Mog:It's a girl! She has blonde hair...and braids. That's all I could get, kupo."
Vaan:Or could it!? I've gotta make sure she's okay.
"Zidane:Is she your girlfriend? Come on, tell us about her!"
"Vaan:We grew up together. Sorry, guys, but I can't leave her out there all by herself."
Yuna:She must really mean a lot to him.
"Tifa:Yeah, which is why we should hurry."
"Vaan:I knew it was you, Penelo! What are you doing here?"
Penelo:How can you be so calm!? I was worried sick about you!
"Zidane:Vaan was really worried about you too, you know?"
"Penelo:Huh? Oh, I... Right."
Penelo:I'm Penelo. Thanks for saving me. May I ask what you're all doing here?
"Mog:We're on a journey to seal the Torsions, kupo."
Penelo:Torsions? You mean those portals the monsters have been coming out of?
"Vaan:You're coming with us, right? Not like you can go home, anyway."
Penelo:Wait... We can't return to our world?
"Zidane:For the time being, none of us can."
"Yuna:Even if we could, those Torsions are spreading destruction to our worlds as well. We have to do something."
Penelo:But I... I don't know what to do.
Vaan:That's why you should come with us. We can worry about getting home after we take care of things here.
Penelo:Are you sure? I don't want to get in the way.
"Zidane:We'd love to have you. Right, guys?"
"Zidane:All right, let's do this! Unlike some bozo I know, I can actually protect you."
Vaan:Huh? Are you talking about me?
Zidane:*Sigh* It's just no fun when they're this dense.
"Penelo:All right, I've made up my mind. I'm coming with you!"
Vivi:That machinethe Magitek armor...
Vivi:I noticed the way it was moving was strange.
Tifa:What do you mean?
Vivi:It was almost as if it was being forced to attack against its own will.
Hope:So the girl controlling the armor was being controlled by the band.
"Hope:That means she was manipulated into attacking us, right?"
King:It's definitely possible. While I can't speak for what kind of otherworldly enchantment was put on this thing...
King:I can say it looks like it was forged by someone who possesses incredible magic.
Tifa:Who would do such a thing? And why?
Cecil:Let's try asking the girl when she comes around.
"Cecil:Until then, we wait."
Warrior of Light:How is she doing?
Yuna:Her wounds are nearly healed. She should be awake any moment now.
Rem:Should I try using my magic?
Warrior of Light:Nay. Let her rest. She has endured enough already.
Yuffie:You're being awfully kind. What's with the sudden change of heart?
Warrior of Light:What do you mean?
"Yuffie:From the way you were talking earlier, I assumed you had a personality to match those horns on your helmet."
"Yuffie:You were ready to leave her for dead, remember?"
Bartz:Before we didn't know she was acting under the influence of another.
Edge:Hah! As if a girl this cute would wish anyone harm!
"Edge:And even if she did, I would find a way to steer her off such a path!"
"Warrior of Light:Whatever happened, there is no need for us to force her awake."
Yuna:Yes. Let's just watch over her until she wakes up.
???:Wh-where am I!?
Zidane:She's up!
???:You...you saved me. But why? I attacked you.
Tifa:We could tell you weren't in your right mind. We wanted to hear what you had to say.
Sazh:You remember us? Do you remember who you are?
Terra:I'm Terra. This is not my world...is it?
"Mog:What do you remember? Please, tell us everything, kupo!"
Terra:Soon after I was brought to this place...
"Terra:I was unlucky enough to cross paths with a mage named Kefka. We fought, and"
Vaan:Why? Did the two of you know each other from before?
Terra:Yes. He and I hail from the same worlda world he seeks to destroy.
Terra:No doubt he intends to do the same here.
Tifa:And you were trying to stop him?
"Terra:But I failed. Alone, I wasn't strong enough to defeat him."
Sazh:Was it Kefka who took control of your mind?
"Terra:Yes, though my memories are a little fuzzy. I just remember fighting him with all I had..."
"Terra:If you hadn't removed this band from me, I might still be on a rampage."
Vaan:Don't worry. You're not under his control any more.
"Vaan:Besides, you did nothing wrong. It's all Kefka's fault."
"Sazh:I don't know how all this works, but does Kefka know you're free?"
Terra:Yes. He knows.
Zidane:Do you think he could take over your mind again?
"Terra:Even if he couldn't, he cannot be allowed to roam freely. There's no telling what he could do..."
"Zidane:Don't worry, Terra. You no longer have to fight alone. Right, Mog?"
"Mog:That's right, kupo! You are a warrior with the light. You have us now!"
"Mog:So what do you say? Will you come with us, kupo?"
Terra:I would love that. Thank you.
Warrior of Light:Our mission is to close all the Torsions that have appeared in this world.
Terra:...Torsions? Are those the distorted spaces that monsters appear from?
"Cloud:Not only that, they also spread corruption by warping space and time."
"Y'shtola:We have yet to learn what is causing them to manifest. Until then, all we can do is continue searching for and closing them."
Terra:I see...
Bartz:You mentioned Kefka wants to destroy the world.
"Bartz:He's not somehow responsible for the Torsions, is he?"
Terra:I couldn't tell you... All my memories since coming here are far too hazy...
Terra:I only vaguely recall battling another group of people similar to you.
"Y'shtola:Everyone here is like you, warriors brought here from another realm."
Terra:And to think I tried to hurt youthe very people looking to close Torsions and save this world.
"Cloud:Well, not everyone. Some here have also been using the Torsions to fulfill their own selfish desires."
Cloud:You couldn't have known. Don't blame yourself.
"Bartz:Cloud's right. Chin up, Terra!"
"Bartz:Come on, you guys. Help me cheer her up."
"Mog:Kupo! Terra, the past is in the past! You're our friend now and that's all that matters!"
Terra:Thank you... I promise... I...
Terra:...You're so soft.
"Bartz:Haha. Mog, you ball of fur, you!"
Warrior of Light:Good. I am glad to see you are starting to feel better.
"Mog:We're nearly to the next Torsion, kupo!"
Zidane:Who's there!?
"Terra:That voice... It's him! Everyone, on your guard!"
"???:Ah, it wore off. I thought that might be the case and came to investigate..."
"???:A good thing I did, too! You've brought me some big fishbig fish to fry!"
Cecil:So this is himthe man that took over your mind?
"Kefka:Ah, yes, that would be me! And I've come to reclaim my toy. Now if you would be so kind"
Zidane:Toy!? How dare you!
"Kefka:You're more than welcome to keep her, if you like."
"Kefka:Well, if I deem you strong enough, that is."
"Cecil:You are a depraved man, using people as though they are naught but disposable tools!"
"Kefka:Well, goody two-shoes, you can criticize me all you want after you've defeated me! Hehehe!"
Kefka:It's showtime!
Kefka:Bravo! And to think I thought you were just a bunch of losers...
Terra:Kefka! Stop this! Stop this right now!
Terra:I am so sorry for involving all of you...
Kefka:What's this? You're making friends now?
"Kefka:Such a waste. When you were under my control, you were an unstoppable machinetoppling bodies left and right."
"Mog:Toppling bodies? Don't tell me you mean warriors with the light, kupo!?"
Kefka:Warriors with the light? Is that what you call them? What an utterly ridiculous name!
King:Tell us what you know.
Kefka:There's nothing you need to know...
"Kefka:...For now, that is. Maybe I'll tell you later!"
"Mog:I don't think he's gone far, kupo. Let's take a moment to recover, then follow him!"
Terra:So maybe I've done even worse things than I thought...
Yuna:No. You've done nothing wrong.
"King:He said you ""toppled"" them. There's a good chance you haven't killed anyone."
King:We have to press forward. That's the only way we'll learn the whole truth.
"Terra:You're right. Thank you, everyone."
Tifa:Who are you?
"Yang:I am Yang, monk of Fabul!"
Cecil:Yang!? What are you doing here?
"Mog:You know each other? Why isn't he letting us pass, kupo?"
"Yang:Silence, intruders! Nobody gets past me alive!"
Warrior of Light:Something is wrong.
"Tifa:Yeah, it's almost like he's being possessed by something."
Yang:Urgh... Where am I?
"Cecil:Yang, do you recognize me?"
Yang:Cecil!? Did I attack you?
Yda:You throw quite a punch.
Yang:I know not what came over me. Please forgive my actions.
Terra:It looked like someone had taken control of you.
Yang:All I remember was that I was in a haze...
Yang:There was a voice telling me to fighttelling me to bring chaos to the world.
Yda:Can this man be trusted?
Cecil:He is a friend of mine. We have fought countless battles together back home.
Cecil:He can be trustedof that you have my word. Yang is a proud monk and a man of character.
Yang:Yet I gave in to the whispers of evil. I am ashamed of myself.
Terra:Do you have any idea who could've done such a thing?
Yang:That I do not. I hardly remember anything.
Terra:Could it have been the same person who was controlling me?
"Cecil:Perhaps it is best not to speculate the unknown for now. More importantly, what do you plan to do?"
Yang:I have nowhere to go in this foreign world.
Yang:And I do feel I must atone for my crimes against you all.
"Mog:Then come with us, kupo! We're on a journey to save the world."
Yang:Thank you. I would be honored to accept your invitation.
"Cecil:Thank you, Yang. Your assistance is always appreciated."
Yuffie:There you are! You're not getting away this time!
"Kefka:Hehehe! Back for some more fun, I take it!"
"Terra:What are you planning, Kefka!?"
Kefka:I haven't decided yet.
Hope:He's not taking us seriously...
"Warrior of Light:He has made it clear he intends to do anything but the right thing. Regardless of what he plans, he is our enemy."
"Kefka:Sounds to me like you're raring for a fight. Well, you're in luck. I've prepared one of your favorite things!"
"Kefka:Ta-da! Have at it, my friends!"
Yuffie:Wh-what's happening!?
Hope:Some people here have the ability to make Torsions.
Kefka:See you on the other side!
Terra:We need to follow him!
Warrior of Light:Let us make haste!
Yuffie:Just looking at it is making me dizzy...
"Mog:Come on, Yuffie! We have to hurry, kupo!"
"Yuffie:I know! I'm going, I'm going!"
"Mog:Kupo... Kefka, just how much do you know?"
"Edge:I now see why monks are held in such high regard. Word of your strength has spread far and wide, even reaching my homeland."
Edge:To think that the only weapons you need are your fistsI must admit I'm slightly jealous.
Yang:I am the one that should be jealous. You are a ninja of great skillflawlessly adapting your technique to any given situation.
"Edge:Truth be told, I owe most of my talent to the secret ninjutsu passed down through the noble Geraldine line."
Yang:Noble line? So you are royalty!? And yet you would willingly risk your life on the battlefield!?
"Terra:I know a king who fights as well. In fact, his younger brother uses his fists, just like you Yang."
Vivi:One of my friends from back home who fought alongside us was a princess.
"Edge:A princess that can fight? Now, that is a lady I'd be interested in meeting."
"Bartz:Some of my friends that fought with us were also nobilitya princess and a king, to be precise."
"Terra:If this world falls to ruin, our worlds will too..."
Terra:And our friends will be in trouble.
Edge:I'm sure your friends will be fine. They are far stronger than you think.
"Edge:And don't forgetthere's a chance they might be here, too."
Yang:Indeed. Stranger things have happened.
Terra:You're right. I'll trust that they'll be all right and that I'll be able to see them again soon.
"Bartz:Well, my friends can handle anything that comes their way. There's nothing for me to worry about."
Terra:Earlier you mentioned there are others besides Kefka capable of creating Torsions.
"Zidane:Yeah. Though, we only know one other guy who can do it."
"Vaan:Like us, he comes from a different world. How is it that they can control them and we can't?"
"Mog:I'm not sure, kupo..."
"Bartz:If we defeat all those who can create them, will the Torsions disappear?"
Y'shtola:I doubt it will be so easy.
"Y'shtola:According to Mog, our numbers are limited. Only those with the light are capable of sealing Torsions."
"Mog:It's true! It's true, kupo!"
"Vaan:Yeah, but..."
"Zidane:If only they can open Torsions and only we can close them, that must mean their powers are somehow related to ours."
"Mog:Though your powers are the same, the way it reveals itself strongly depends on the wielder, kupo!"
"Mog:We need to gather more friends like you, capable of closing Torsions, kupo!"
"Bartz:If we don't, those exploiting Torsions to fulfill their own selfish desires will destroy the world."
"Mog:That's right, kupo! And their actions will not only endanger this world, but yours as well!"
Terra:And that is why we must fight to stop them.
Zidane:This may sound crazy but...do you think we could coax them to our side?
"Mog:It's not totally impossible, kupo! It's up to you to convince them!"
Y'shtola:Sounds like a challenge to me.
Terra:It's definitely not going to be easy...
Vivi:This place is really scary.
Rem:You mean inside the Torsion?
Vivi:Yeah... Just walking is making me really tired.
Y'shtola:I agree. It is draining our aether more quickly than any battles we have been in thus far.
Vivi:You feel it too?
"Yuna:Yes, a little."
Y'shtola:Torsions are planes between worlds. Or so that is what we were told.
"Y'shtola:It seems to me, however, there is much more to this place."
"Rem:Even if that's the case, it doesn't change our objective. We need to keep fighting the monsters that appear."
"Vivi:Even though it's scary, we need to defeat as many of them as we can!"
"Mog:Is everyone okay, kupo?"
"Mog:I found an exit over there. Let's get out of here and go find Kefka, kupo!"
"Yuna:Good idea. Come on, everyone."
"Mog:I sense a strong light from that boy, kupo!"
Cloud:Relax. We're not the enemy.
???:Humans...and a moogle?
???:Doesn't look like you're friends of those monsters at the very least.
"Mog:Those clothesyou must bear the title of Onion Knight, kupo!"
Onion Knight:How do you know?
"Mog:I'm a messenger for the goddess Materia, so I know a few things about other worlds too, kupo."
"Mog:Have you come across any Torsions, kupo?"
"Onion Knight:You mean those distortions of space and time? Then yes, I guess I have."
"Onion Knight:I've witnessed them close after defeating certain monsters. By the way, what are you all doing here?"
Warrior of Light:We are on a journey to vanquish the monsters and seal the Torsions.
Onion Knight:What about that moogle? Doesn't look like he can fight to me.
Cloud:Guess you can say he's our guide.
Terra:We wouldn't be able to get around this world without him. He's even letting us use his ship.
"Warrior of Light:If you do not possess a map or means of transport, then let us travel together."
"Onion Knight:A logical proposal, but I still have some things to take care of."
Onion Knight:Let me get back to you on that offer.
"Mog:*Sigh* He left, kupo."
Onion Knight:What happened to the monsters that were here?
Bartz:Just took care of the last of them. What? Were you worried about us?
Onion Knight:You could say that. I wouldn't be able to forgive myself if I failed to protect someone in need.
"Sazh:You're not a bad guy after all, little man."
Onion Knight:Are you making fun of me?
"Sazh:Let's just say the kids from my world don't know the meaning of ""cautious."""
"Hope:Yeah, most people your age don't have a care in the world. Their lives are peaceful."
"Onion Knight:A peaceful world, huh?"
Hope:On the surface at least.
Onion Knight:But what are you doing here fighting monsters if you came from a world like that?
Hope:The Torsions will eventually spread destruction to our world as well. That's why we fight.
"Bartz:What about you? You don't even know what's going on, so why are you fighting?"
Onion Knight:Because I want to know.
Onion Knight:I want to know my purpose here and the truth behind what's happening in this world.
"Mog:We can teach you a thing or two about that, kupo!"
Onion Knight:Looks that way.
"Onion Knight:But first, we need to take care of these guests."
"Yuffie:See? We wiped the floor with those monsters, so clearly we're not one of them."
"Yuffie:C'mon, come with us."
"Onion Knight:Yeah, I probably wouldn't be able to handle this all on my own..."
"Vivi:If we work together, I'm sure you'll be able to find what you're looking for."
"Mog:Exactly! Besides, we really need someone with a strong will of the light like you, kupo."
"Onion Knight:The light's needed to close the Torsions, is it?"
Onion Knight:Let's say I don't completely believe you yet. Can I still tag along?
Zidane:It's not like we're all fighting for justice.
Zidane:Each of us has someone we want to protect or something we want to do. We're doing this for ourselves.
Onion Knight:A journey motivated by self-interest...
Yuffie:Yep! So just don't think about it and follow your instincts!
"Onion Knight:All right, I'll go with you."
Onion Knight:I feel like there's so much I can learn from being with you all.
"Bartz:You know, you really overthink things for a kid."
Onion Knight:And you really don't think things through enough for an adult.
Bartz:You arrogant little
"Mog:Hooray! Let's make this journey a fun one, kupo!"
"Onion Knight:Terra, how did you become friends with everyone here?"
Terra:My mind was taken over by Kefka...and I attacked them...
Onion Knight:So you decided to make it up to them by joining them?
Terra:Why are you asking me this?
Onion Knight:Because I'm not so sure I completely trust Mog yet...
Onion Knight:I'd like to observe things for just a bit longer and draw my own conclusions as to what's worth fighting for.
Onion Knight:I was just wondering where you stood.
"Terra:While I will admit there is a lot we have yet to understand, there is one thing I do know."
Terra:Kefka hurt a lot of people back home. He is demented and cannot be left to his own devices.
Terra:I'm going to do everything within my power to stop him.
Onion Knight:Good. I'm just glad to hear it's a decision you made for yourself.
Onion Knight:I was worried you simply took Mog's word at face value and were following him blindly.
Onion Knight:I apologize.
Terra:It's fine. Let's do what we can to protect what's important to us.
"Kefka:Ah, so the warriors with the light have returned..."
"Kefka:Oh, what carnage there will be!"
"Terra:You're not getting away this time, Kefka!"
"Warrior of Light:You'll tell us all you know, even if we have to force it out of you!"
Kefka:No need to be so serious.
Mog:Kupopo! Th-that big shiny thing...!
Yda:What? Do you know what it is?
"Mog:Yes, kupo! Be careful, everyone! When it becomes fully charged, it'll unleash an incredibly powerful attack!"
"Kefka:Hehehe! As your friend said, you best give this fight your all..."
Kefka:Else you'll be toastquite literally!
Kefka:Uwee-hee-hee! What a delightful little toy!
Kefka:Now let me hear those utterly delicious screams of yours.
"Mog:Brace yourselves, kupo! He's no ordinary foe!"
"Kefka:What a pesky moogle, you are. You'll just have to perish with the rest of them!"
Onion Knight:The Torsion... It's gone...
Kefka:Well done! You are all very capable fighters!
Terra:Why are you so happy? I thought you wanted to use the Torsions to spread destruction.
Kefka:I do! And I want you to fight them with the last of your strength!
"Mog:I don't understand, kupo! What exactly is your goal!?"
Kefka:Hehehe. Isn't that obvious? I just want to have a little fun!
Kefka:I'll see you around!
Onion Knight:Hold on! Recklessly chasing him is only going to get us into more trouble!
"Onion Knight:Besides, we'd never catch him! He can control Torsions at will!"
Terra:But we can't just stand here! He'll do to others what he did to metake over their minds and use them to sow destruction!
Yang:We must prevent that from ever coming to pass.
"Yang:We have the power to do that much, do we not?"
Warrior of Light:The enemy has a far greater understanding of what is happening than we do.
Onion Knight:Which is precisely why we shouldn't be blindly chasing them.
Onion Knight:So where should we go next?
"Mog:Let's make our way to the Palace of Malitia! There is a large Torsion there, kupo!"
"Onion Knight:If that's the case, we're likely to meet enemies similar to Kefka there."
"Terra:Yeah, and we might finally get some answers."
Onion Knight:...And the pieces of this puzzle will fall into place soon enough.
Materia:Kefka... What exactly are your intentions?
"Mog:Apologies for my tardiness, kupo!"
"Materia:Tell me, Mog, do you not find Kefka's actions puzzling?"
"Materia:He attempts to fan the flames of war by provoking your warriors, yet never does he unleash the full extent of his powers upon them."
Materia:Whatever could he be up to?
"Mog:Truth be told, I know little more of his plans than you, kupo!"
Materia:More troubling still is he seems to know who or what is behind these Torsions...
"Mog:Yes, but we have no means of questioning him. We don't even know where he is, kupo!"
Mog:...Maybe if you were to use your powers...
Materia:I will see what I can do.
"Mog:Once you know where he is, we will go and subdue him, kupo!"
Materia:I only ask that you be careful.
"Mog:We always are, kupo!"
"Materia:Spiritus, you fool..."
Materia:Do not tell me this is your doing.
"Materia:Should you have crossed the line between mortal and god, you know very well I will be forced to take action against you."
Zidane:Hm? Why are we here? I don't see any palace.
"Mog:We had to stop because the Torsions in this area prevent the airship's engine from running properly, kupo!"
"Mog:The number of places we can fly through safely are slowly dwindling, kupo!"
Penelo:I had no idea...
Terra:It's crazy to think just how deeply the Torsions affect everything around us.
"Bartz:Look on the bright side, guys! We can walk around and enjoy the scenic route for once!"
"Bartz:After all, flying gets old pretty quickly..."
"Zidane:Bahaha! Bartz, don't tell me you don't like flying because you're afraid of heights!"
"Yuffie:I, for one, wouldn't mind the walk! Me and vehicles... Well, we don't really agree."
"Zidane:You should've said so earlier, Yuffie! Come on everyone, let's start walking!"
Bartz:Hey! Why do you listen to her and not me?
"Sazh:The monsters just keep gettin' stronger, don't they?"
Vivi:Uh-huh. I don't think I would have been able to make it this far alone.
"Onion Knight:When you started out, it was just the four of you?"
"Mog:Yes, kupo! I'm so happy our numbers have grown this much!"
"Onion Knight:Mog, you're their guide, right? Have you been targeting Torsions based on the group's strength?"
"Mog:That's right, kupo!"
"Mog:I can sense both the strength and size of a Torsion and the locations of warriors with the light, kupo!"
Cloud:So you've been choosing where we go based on how many we are and how strong the enemy is?
"Vivi:If that's true, Mog, we owe all of our success to you!"
"Mog:Kupopo! It's my duty to make sure this mission is a success, after all!"
"Onion Knight:Everything your moogle says sounds rehearsed, doesn't it?"
"Cloud:Yeah, so? I couldn't care less about any of that."
Cloud:I'm here for my own reasons.
Onion Knight:You're rightI should do the same. I need to focus on my own objectives. Not Mog's.
Tifa:Look!
"Mog:Excuse me, mister? Did you just seal that Torsion, kupo?"
Firion:Call me Firion. And you are?
"Mog:I'm Mog. We're on a mission to return peace to the world, kupo!"
"Yda:That is to say, we share the same goal as you."
"Firion:Oh, so you're the ones I keep hearing about."
Bartz:You've heard about us?
Firion:Only that there were others that share my mission.
"Tifa:So, why did you put a flower where the Torsion was?"
Firion:It serves as a message for my comrades.
Bartz:So there are others doing the same?
"Firion:Something like that. Well, I must be going."
"Mog:Wait, kupo! Let's"
Yda:It sounded like he already has others he's working with. Let's leave him be for now.
"Mog:We could've really used him on our side, kupo."
Firion:We meet again. Were you the ones who defeated the monsters around here?
"Terra:Yes, the planet will die if we don't get rid of them."
"Firion:I see. Well, I wish you the best."
Cecil:Wait. Could you tell us about your allies?
Cecil:If they're just like youa group looking to save this worldperhaps we could help each other.
Firion:My allies? How should I put it?
"Firion:I've been calling them the rebel forces, since they remind me of a resistance organization back home."
Terra:A resistance organization? Like to fight an empire? But there aren't any in this world.
Firion:Their enemy isn't the empire. It's just what I call them out of convenience. I believe some call them...the Returners.
Terra:The Returners!?
Cecil:Do you recognize the name?
Terra:My friends back home went by that name.
Firion:Then perhaps you're all from the same world. Are you alone?
Terra:All I have now are my friends here from other worlds.
"Firion:As much as I want to help, I must see to my duty by sealing the Torsion around here."
"Mog:Okay! We can think about what to do after that, kupo."
Firion:Very well. Let's continue this later.
"Firion:That should do it. Now where should I begin? Though I should warn you, I really don't know much about them."
Terra:Anything will do. Just please tell me whatever you know about the Returners and the rebel forces.
Firion:The rebel forces are an organization traveling the lands to close the Torsions.
"Firion:From what I hear, the leader used to be a king or queen or something back in their world."
Onion Knight:Wait... You've never met them before?
Firion:I heard they don't like drawing attention to themselves. It's too dangerous.
"Firion:So they send messengers from other worlds to contact me. I call them my ""allies,"" but there's no sense of camaraderie."
Firion:Some are volunteer soldiers like me while others are mercenaries.
"Onion Knight:So they're able to keep things secret by having strangers relay information for them, huh?"
"Mog:Can we meet them, kupo?"
Mog:The only ones who can seal the Torsions are those with the will of the light like you.
"Mog:So I'd love for them to become our friends, kupo!"
"Onion Knight:You mentioned that your objective was to clear out the monsters in the area, right?"
Onion Knight:What's next?
Firion:That depends. Do you know where the Torsions are located?
"Mog:Of course, kupo! We even have an airship."
Firion:I see. Then would you mind if I come along?
Firion:I would like to reunite the lady with her friends from back home as well.
Terra:Call me Terra. And thank you.
"Firion:No, I apologize I couldn't be of much help to you."
Firion:Let us be off now.
"Mog:Watch your step, kupo! We'll soon be entering a very mountainous area!"
"Yang:It was in a place very similar to this that we first met, was it not, Cecil?"
Cecil:Indeed. It brings back many memories.
Warrior of Light:This world was created in the image of our own worlds. Perhaps that is why it feels so familiar to you.
"Mog:Yes, kupo! Maybe this region was even molded after that place the two of you met!"
"Yuna:Where I'm from, summoners are required to go on a pilgrimage to the given lands. To get there, we must ascend a large mountain."
"Yuna:And, just like in my world, maybe the lands beyond these peaks will hold the key to this world's salvation."
Yang:You are an incredibly earnest young lady. You must be a very well-respected individual in your homeland.
Yuna:There is still much I have to learn.
"Yuna:My father, however, was an incredible man, and it is to carry on his legacy that I persevere."
Yuna:But saving this world comes first.
"Mog:I'm glad to hear it, kupo!"
"Penelo:We've come a long way, haven't we?"
"Vaan:Yeah. Back in Ivalice, I couldn't have imagined any of this, even if I tried."
"Penelo:Vaan, do you ever get worried? We've been roped into doing things we don't understand in a world we know nothing about."
Vaan:What? Are you worried?
"Penelo:A little. I mean, a lot has happened..."
Vaan:You've always been a bit of a worrywart.
"Vaan:Honestly speaking, I'm a little nervous, but I think I'm more excited than anything!"
Penelo:Ugh! You've always been far too brazen!
"Rem:Come on, you two! We're leaving so"
"Rem:Oh, sorry! I didn't mean to interrupt..."
Vaan:Hm? Interrupt what?
"Penelo:It's fine, Rem! Thanks for letting us know."
"Rem:If you don't mind my asking, have you two known each other for long?"
"Penelo:Yeah, we've been friends since childhood."
"Penelo:He's always had a reckless streak, so I constantly worry about him."
Vaan:Why do you make it sound like I'm some daredevil kid!?
"Penelo:I'm simply stating the truth! Besides, you and I are kids, which is why..."
Penelo:We need to be careful. I don't want to see you get hurt.
Rem:I can tell you care a lot about each other.
"Rem:It's nice to have someone close by who worries about you, isn't it?"
"Penelo:Do you have anyone like that, Rem?"
Penelo:I see... I hope he's okay.
Rem:Me too. Now let's get back to the others.
"???:Ah, if it isn't Lady Yuna."
Yuna:Maester Seymour!
Yuna:I admit I am equally surprised to see you here.
Seymour:That we should be reunited in this mannerit is no doubt Yevon's will.
"Zidane:Yuna, who's this guy? He your friend?"
Yuna:This is Maester Seymour Guado.
Seymour:Might I inquire as to who you all are? You also hail from other worlds?
"Yuna:Y-yes, that's right..."
Yuna:We have been working together to rid this world of the Torsions from which the monsters are appearing.
Seymour:Ridding this world of Torsions... I see...
"Zidane:If you're Yuna's friend, you're more than welcome to join us. You look pretty strong."
"Seymour:While I thank you for the offer, I'm afraid I must decline."
Seymour:I have an investigation I need to conduct here.
"Seymour:I must be going now. Godspeed, my friends."
Zidane:Don't take it too hard. I'm sure you'll see each other again soon.
Warrior of Light:That man... He was very difficult to read. I could not tell if he is with the light or the darkness.
"Y'shtola:While he is possessed of incredible magic, it appears to be tinged with a certain malevolence."
Onion Knight:We need to keep this from Yuna.
Onion Knight:Worrying her won't help anyone.
Warrior of Light:Indeed. Let us put this in the back of our minds for now and simply continue toward our ultimate goal.
Yuna:Look! There's someone there.
"???:A knight, a guy with an afro, a moogle... You guys having a costume party?"
"Mog:This isn't a costume! I'm a real moogle, kupo!"
???:Whoa! You can talk!?
"Yuna:Excuse me, but may I ask what you're doing here?"
"Laguna:So, like, I'm trekking, y'know? And Oh yeah, my name's Laguna. Anyway, I'm traveling the world like usual..."
"Laguna:And the next thing you know, I find myself here, completely lost, getting attacked by monsters. Can you believe my luck?"
"Sazh:Uh, you seem pretty cheerful for a guy down on his luck."
"Mog:No matter how unlucky he may be, I sense a strong will of the light coming from him, kupo!"
Laguna:A strong what?
Warrior of Light:Only those who bear the light possess the power to seal the Torsions.
Yuna:We're on a journey to close them to save our worlds. Will you come with us?
Laguna:I'll tell ya what...
Laguna:I didn't understand a word of that!
"Laguna:But hey, I appreciate the offer. I'll give it some thought."
"Laguna:Well, see you guys around. Oh, and watch out for the monsters, okay?"
Sazh:He's gotta be messin' with us.
"Laguna:Hey, looks like I'm still in time for the costume party!"
Mog:Kupo! I'm glad you're still here!
Cecil:Have you considered our proposal?
"Laguna:Yeah, about that... I'm still a little iffy on the details."
"Laguna:What exactly are these ""Torsions""? And why are you going around closing them?"
Cloud:They're being used as gateways for monsters to invade this world.
Cloud:The Torsions are even transforming the world itself. That's why.
"Laguna:So basically, you're all heroes trying to save the world?"
"Laguna:And you want my help, eh?"
Laguna:All right! Now we're talkin'!
"Mog:So you'll come with us, kupo?"
"Laguna:I was worried you guys were picking fights with monsters for fun, but it looks like you actually have a legitimate reason. I'm in!"
Cloud:Didn't expect you to be this much of a thinker.
"Penelo:Everyone, look! Monsters are coming this way!"
Cecil:Might we request your assistance?
"Laguna:Yeah, no problem. Looks like this is my hero debut, eh?"
Laguna:I'll take care of these guys so you don't get flanked!
Cloud:You sure you've got this?
Laguna:Trust me. I've been on the battlefield more times than I'd like to remember!
Laguna:We'll regroup after battle!
Mog:Kupo! We did it!
"Laguna:Hey, glad you guys are okay. Looks like you didn't have too much trouble either."
Y'shtola:You seem to be a man of remarkable skill.
Hope:You mentioned earlier you've fought on the battlefield before. Does that mean you're a soldier?
"Laguna:Former soldier. Some stuff went down, and now I just travel from place to place."
"Laguna:By the way, I've been wondering. I feel like somebody's controlling the monsters from behind the scenes. You guys know anything?"
"Y'shtola:Nay. We know naught more than you. Else, we would not be here."
"Laguna:Yep, should've seen that coming. You got me there. Looks like this is gonna be tougher than I thought."
"Laguna:At any rate, let's just focus on putting an end to the extortion!"
"Mog:You mean ""Torsion""... That wasn't even close, kupo..."
"Laguna:Huh? Whatever. Extortions, Torsions, same thing!"
"Laguna:Anyway, it's great to be part of the team! If you ever need me, I'll be here."
Manikin:U... Urgh...
Rem:I don't think I'll ever get used to those things...
"Vivi:I wonder if they're living beings, like all the other monsters we've defeated."
Edge:I doubt it. They're lifeless puppetsI'm sure of it. That's why they're so creepy.
Vivi:S-some puppets have souls... I'm one of them. At least I was in my world.
Yuna:Puppets with souls... That reminds me...
"Yuna:Where I'm from, it is possible to be temporarily reunited with those who have passed on."
Edge:You can speak with the dead!?
Tifa:How does it work? Do you have to call upon their spirit or something?
"Yuna:Upon death, they are sent to the Farplanea place the living can also visit."
"Yuna:Some claim it is simply an illusion, but there, you can speak with the spirits of the dead."
Tifa:This place sounds both sad and amazing at the same time.
Yuna:Maester Seymour...
"Seymour:The dimensions between worlds were distorted, and I was brought here."
Seymour:But why? Why am Ia man bereft of lifehere?
Seymour:Who goes there!?
Seymour:What are you doing here!? What is it you seek?
Shadow:Who knows? It all depends on the client.
Seymour:You are possessed by the reaper... Your voice is so cold it could be made of ice.
"Shadow:Who are you to judge me? You don't appear dead at first glance, yet you can't exist in the same way that I do."
Seymour:You're wrong. The only difference between you and I is the fundamental principles our respective worlds operate on.
Seymour:You mentioned you take clients. How about you tell me what you know in exchange for some coin?
Shadow:What I know for a bit of pocket money? Very well.
"Shadow:For this amount, I can tell you this..."
Seymour:No! I need details!
Seymour:Argh! He's gone...
???:Graaagh! Where in the world am I!?
"Vivi:Zidane, that voice. Is that?"
"Zidane:Yeah, no doubt about it."
"Vivi:We were right! Steiner, I'm so happy to see you again!"
Steiner:M-Master Vivi!? And if it isn't the monkey Zidane as well!
"Steiner:I am very fortunate to have run into you here! I somehow got lost in this forest, and I cannot find my way out!"
"Steiner:...Forgive me for asking, but who might this be?"
"Zidane:You mean Mog? We ran into a little trouble, and well, long story short, we're traveling together now."
"Mog:Nice to meet you, kupo."
"Steiner:What do you mean ""ran into a little trouble""? Don't tell me you're up to no good again, you scoundrel!"
"Zidane:You never change, do you, Rusty?"
Steiner:Enough of your nonsense. We have more important things to discuss right now!
"Steiner:Kind traveler, could you by any chance enlighten me on how to get out of this forest?"
"Mog:Of course, kupo! First, go straight down this path until"
"Steiner:Straight, you say? Thank you, kind stranger!"
"Mog:I wasn't even halfway done explaining, kupo..."
Vivi:Steiner's not here either. Where could he have gone?
"Zidane:Ugh, that rusty hunk of metal sure nows how to be a pain. Going off on his own like that."
"Warrior of Light:Ventured alone, these woods may prove to be dangerous even for a knight of his caliber."
"Mog:I really hope he's okay, kupo."
Steiner:Aaargh! How dare you! Have you no manners!?
Vivi:Did you hear that!?
"Zidane:Yeah, that's him all right! Let's do this!"
"Mog:Move out, kupo!"
Steiner:Th-thank you. You have my gratitude.
Zidane:You're lucky we found you in time.
Vivi:I'm so glad you're all right!
Steiner:It seems you are rather used to fighting powerful monsters such as those. But why?
Cecil:Our mission is to seal the dimensional Torsions which serve as their gateway to this world.
"Mog:And we can't afford to mess this up, so we've gotta get even stronger, kupo!"
"Cecil:It is a battle to protect not only this world, but those we care about as well."
Steiner:To use your sword to protect those close to you...
Steiner:That is the spirit of chivalry itself! Your words have brought a tear to my eye.
"Steiner:Although I am but a humble knight, I wish to fight by your side to return peace to the land!"
Vivi:Is it okay if he comes with us?
"Mog:Of course! The light in his heart is almost blinding. He's just the kind of friend we need, kupo!"
Steiner:You have my sword.
"Steiner:As a knight of Alexandria, I vow to protect this world!"
"Mog:Yay! Welcome aboard, kupo!"
Hope:We've been having to battle more and more manikins lately.
King:While the influx of monsters can be explained by the Torsions pulling more beasts from different worlds...
King:That doesn't explain where all these manikins are coming from or why they look like us.
"Onion Knight:According to Mog, this world is the gods' creation."
"Mog:That's right, kupo! And it is the gods that asked me to gather you guys to combat the threat we currently face!"
"Vaan:You said that they built this place using our own worlds as reference, right?"
Onion Knight:If this place was inspired by where we're from...
Onion Knight:Then maybe these manikins were inspired by us.
Vaan:You're implying they've been made by the gods!?
"Mog:You're not exactly wrong, kupo..."
King:What do you mean!?
"Mog:This world was created by more than one god, kupo."
Mog:Mistress Materiathe god I serveis doing her very best to close the Torsions and keep this world safe.
Onion Knight:And this other god is not?
"Mog:I don't know the details, but even if I did, it's not a subject I can discuss lightly, kupo!"
"Mog:That said, I will tell you what little I do know, kupo."
"Vaan:Hey, Mog, can we talk about this god you mentionedthe one you aren't helping?"
Hope:The god who uses people as puppets... Just the thought gives me shivers.
"Mog:While Mistress Materia values free will greatly, kupo..."
Mog:There are other gods who aren't nearly as nice.
Y'shtola:Tell us more.
Terra:I want to know why we were brought here to fight.
"Mog:As you already know, Mistress Materia has gathered youwarriors with the lightto help close the Torsions, kupo."
"Mog:She needs the swords of the righteous to protect this world, kupo."
Vaan:And this other god doesn't feel the same way?
"Mog:His name is Master Spiritus, kupo."
"Mog:He doesn't care who or what he uses, so long as he gets his way."
Y'shtola:Not unlike Kuja or Kefka.
"Mog:If he wanted to, he could even bend the two of them to his own will, kupo!"
"Terra:That's horrible! If he takes control of Kefka, this place will end up like my world..."
Mog:I don't want any of you to become pawns to Master Spiritus.
Hope:Neither do I... I've had enough of that.
Vaan:Yeah! I don't need some external force deciding my fate for me!
"Mog:We're not going to let it happen, kupo!"
???:Terra. There you are.
Sazh:You know him? Are the two of you from the same world or something?
"Terra:Yeah. We're friends. In fact, we used to fight together."
Shadow:Friends? My allegiance belongs only to those willing to match my price.
Yuffie:Willing to match your price? I like the sound of that! Haha! This guy's just like me!
"Edge:Good lord, Yuffiedon't insult him."
"Yuffie:What's that supposed to mean!? I'm a ninja, too, you know!"
"Terra:So Shadow, what brings you here?"
Shadow:I have been contracted by someone who bore witness to you attacking people under Kefka's influence.
Shadow:I was sent to remove the spell put on you and make sure that you were unharmed...
"Sazh:Only your job's already done, thanks to us."
Shadow:Exactly. Now I must report back to my client. I shall take my leave here.
Terra:Wait! Why don't you join us?
Shadow:Only if it is my client's wish that I do.
"Yuffie:Man, this guy's sooo cool! One day I'm going to be as cool as him!"
"Shadow:...For the sake of the alliance we once shared, before I go I'll tell you this."
"Shadow:Just beyond here, I ran into a man with blue hair and long robes..."
Shadow:Robes similar to what that girl there is wearing.
Yuna:Maester Seymour...
Shadow:He was also possessed by the reaper.
Edge:What does that mean!?
Shadow:I wouldn't know how. It's just a hunch. Nothing more.
Shadow:To obey the gods or to defy them... Which is the road to happiness?
"Seymour:Lady Yuna, we meet again."
Yuna:Maester Seymour!
"Seymour:Ah... So he sought you out, did he?"
Seymour:Then you are now aware of the true reason why we are here.
Zidane:No. He barely told us anything.
Zidane:Do you know something we don't!?
"Seymour:You follow this moogle, risking your lives for a god you know nothing about and don't give a second thought as to why you do it."
Seymour:What a pathetic bunch you are.
Warrior of Light:What are you talking about?
Seymour:Have a look for yourselvesmaybe then you will finally understand the truth.
Yuna:So it's true!?
"Onion Knight:Yuna, is this man somehow connected to you being able to meet the dead?"
"Yuna:Yes, but..."
"Seymour:That I, a dead man, should be brought to this world against my will and used as a pawn in their schemes..."
Seymour:I resent them. I resent these selfish beings you call gods.
Seymour:To think that you would fight for themyou're all fools!
"Zidane:You're assuming a lot there, buddy! We're not just fighting for the gods!"
Warrior of Light:We fight because that is what we wish to do. We are pawns to no one.
"Seymour:Does your foolishness have no end, you pitiful creatures? It seems I have no choiceit falls to me to save you."
Seymour:Don't you worrydeath should be enough to liberate you!
"Mog:Watch out, kupo!"
"Yuna:Maester Seymour, please stop this!"
Seymour:You are a tough lottenaciously clinging to this meaningless existence you call life.
Vivi:Our lives have so much more meaning than you will ever know!
"Seymour:You give me no choice but to use this. Welcome it, my friends, and die without regret!"
Cecil:Manikins! We cannot allow them to flank us!
Shadow:Don't worry. I've got your back.
"Yuna:Shadow, is what you told Maester Seymour true?"
Shadow:Think about it. All of us were transported here by the gods' willnot of our own volition.
"Shadow:Though, whether or not you view that as a bad thing depends on who you are."
Cecil:What about you? The individual you're contracted toare they somehow in contact with the gods?
"Shadow:I cannot tell you that. I will say, however, that they have nothing to do with your moogle friend there."
Mog:Kupo! So there's another group of warriors out there banding together?
Seymour:Now do you finally see? The only way for you to be saved is to accept the salvation I extend to you.
Shadow:To defeat him and persevere or give up and die here... Which will it be?
Vivi:I will never give up! I will never ever give up on something as precious as life!
Yuna:It is as Vivi says. We will not give up. We must do whatever it takes to save this world.
"Yuna:And even though you are very dear to me, if you try and stand in our way, I will be forced to put you down!"
Seymour:Very well. Give it your best shot!
"Terra:We've managed to weaken him, but I don't know how we're supposed to kill the dead..."
"Yuna:In our world, we have a ritual known as ""the sending."" We use it to send the dead to the Farplane. I shall perform it right now."
Seymour:You...will be sending me...?
Firion:He escaped!
"Shadow:If I had to guess, I'd say he was saved. Seems the gods still have use for him."
Shadow:How ironic.
"Terra:Shadow, why did you help us?"
Terra:You said yourself your contractor's not in any way affiliated with Mog.
Shadow:But I also never said my client was unsympathetic to your moogle's cause.
"Yuna:Then, will you agree to come with us and tell us what you know?"
Yuna:We need to learn as much as we can about this world and what it is we must do here...
Firion:I would also ask that you come with us. I'm afraid it is very difficult for me to explain things alone.
Mog:Kupo?
"Shadow:Very well, but first I must report back to my client."
"Firion:Excellent! Now that that's settled, Mog, why don't you lead us to where we need to go next?"
"Mog:Okay, kupo!"
"Shadow:You're our guide, huh? Where will you be taking us?"
"Mog:To peace, kupo!"
"Mog:Sorry to keep you waiting, kupo!"
Spiritus:About time.
"Mog:Were you the one who saved Seymour back there, kupo?"
Spiritus:He still has some use.
"Spiritus:Besides, I couldn't let him fall into the hands of Materia's warriors."
"Mog:Wise decision, my lord!"
"Mog:Pretty words aren't going to save the world from destruction, kupo."
Mog:You should do whatever you can to succeed!
"Spiritus:Don't think you're fooling me, moogle. I still don't trust you."
Spiritus:You may not agree with my methods but know that I'm only doing what's necessary to fulfill my duty as a god.
"Mog:I know, kupo."
Spiritus:You will encounter many others as you continue your journey.
Spiritus:Use these opportunities to your advantage.
"Mog:I will, kupo!"
"Spiritus:Materia, you fool."
Spiritus:This world belongs to me now.
"Mog:I'm sorry for taking so long, kupo!"
Materia:I was waiting for you. What have you learned?
"Mog:There are still many warriors somewhere out there fighting! We also made some new friends, kupo."
"Materia:And they, too, bear the light."
"Mog:Yes, Shadow and Firion are really strong, kupo."
Mog:But right when we had Seymour cornered...
Materia:Spiritus saved him. So he intends to continue gathering wicked men to use for his own ends?
"Mog:There's no denying that Seymour and Kefka are powerful, kupo."
"Materia:However, when you think about what they did back in their own world..."
Materia:The situation is dire.
Materia:If only we could somehow seal their sinister desires and have them join our forces.
"Mog:Then you should use my powers, kupo!"
"Mog:With your divine assistance, I can summon any willing warrior from their world."
Materia:Are you saying you can persuade them to join us?
"Mog:Yes! Just leave it to me, kupo!"
Materia:Very well. I shall grant you the power you seek.
Materia:I will trust you to guide my warriors to the right path.
"Mog:You can count on me, kupo!"
"Mog:The next Torsion is here in the Domina Wastelands, kupo!"
Laguna:Can it get any hotter? I'm soaked.
Laguna:You must be boiling in that armor.
Warrior of Light:I'm fine.
"Bartz:Yeah, I feel like I've been here before, too."
Mog:That's because the goddess Materia created this world based on all of yours.
"Mog:So it's no wonder it feels familiar, kupo!"
"Vaan:Anyway, we can't use the airship because of the Torsion, right? Wonderful."
Warrior of Light:Darkness is devouring this world.
Warrior of Light:We must hurry and seal the Torsions before it is too late.
"Bartz:How do you suggest we do that? Remember, we can only close one at a time..."
"Mog:Slow and steady, kupo. We have to be careful."
"Laguna:Hey, I just wanted to say I'm really glad you're here."
Laguna:Wouldn't know what to do if I took a wrong turn and ran into one of the bad guys.
"Warrior of Light:Indeed. Now come, we must seal the Torsion."
Yuna:That was Wakka's manikin. He was myguardianback inSpiraour world.
Yuffie:What's a guardian?
"Yuna:As you know, I'm asummoneron apilgrimageto afabled landto save my planet."
"Yuna:We summoners must overcome many trials during our journey, so we travel with guardians to protect us."
"Cloud:Bodyguards, huh? I've had some experience in the field, but it's probably nothing compared to this Wakka guy."
Steiner:Sworn to serve and protect Miss Yunahe is a knight in all but name!
Yuna:I wouldn't go that far.
"Sazh:Just can't imagine what you're going through. When I was your age, stuff like that was the last thing on my mind."
"Yuffie:Yeah, seriously. If someone asked me to save the world, I'd tell them to shove it."
Sazh:I'm sure you don't need to worry about anyone ever asking you for help.
"Mog:This Wakka person has the light, kupo! Come on, let's go look for him!"
???:Ugh... Just my luck.
???:Never thought I'd die in the middle of the desert like this.
Wakka:Ow...
"Yuna:Are you okay!? Hold on, I'll heal you."
"Wakka:Whew, thanks! Glad I ran into ya!"
"Mog:So you're Wakka? Nice to meet you, kupo!"
Wakka:Whoa! D-did that toy just talk!?
"Mog:How rude, kupo! I'm quite real, I assure you!"
Wakka:S-seriously? Guess I'm just not used to seeing real moogles.
Warrior of Light:So this is the guardian you spoke of?
Cecil:I'm glad you're okay.
"Steiner:Master Wakka! I, too, am a knight. Please let me shake your hand!"
"Wakka:Okay, I'm lost. Who are all these strangely-dressed people?"
"Yuna:Wakka, there's something you need to know..."
"Wakka:So I was sucked into another dimension, ya?"
"Warrior of Light:I know it may be difficult to understand, but this is the reality of our situation."
"Wakka:All right, I've made up my mind. I'm comin' with you guys!"
Mog:Kupo! I'm so glad you'll be joining us!
"Wakka:Hey, what would a summoner be without her guardian, ya?"
"Wakka:Yuna, you've got nothing to worry about now that I'm here."
"Yuna:I'm here for you too, Wakka."
Zidane:Huh?
Firion:What is it? Did you find shade!?
"Zidane:Yeah, and that's not all. I think I just saw Aaand they're gone."
Tifa:Was someone there?
"King:Whoever it was, they disappeared."
Tifa:You think someone was spying on us?
"Zidane:Nah, I got the sense that it was a cutie checkin' me out."
Zidane:I hope she's single.
"Mog:A-anyway, let's move into the shade."
"Mog:I need to cool off, kupo."
King:Good idea. We should rest while we have the chance.
"Firion:We can try to figure out who was watching us, too."
Tifa:Maybe we could even get them to join us if they're still around.
"Mog:Yeah! After all, we always have room for new friends."
"Mog:Into the forest we go, kupo!"
"???:Welcome and greetings to you alleven to you, flying furball."
Cecil:Who's there?
"Mog:I-I can't believe it, kupo!"
"Mog:Her light is so powerful! I-it's almost menacing, kupo!"
"Shantotto:Let's hope that's a compliment, lest you come to woefor you stand before the elite, the black mage Shantotto."
Terra:Is she really one of us?
"Shadow:Yeah, a menacing light, you say? Sounds contradictory."
"Shantotto:I am but a humble professor of the magical arts. Soon, my utterly good nature shall dwell in your hearts."
"Mog:Would you be willing to use that magic to save the world, kupo?"
Mog:We're trying to
Shantotto:To eliminate the distortions. That is your quest.
Shantotto:And you want my help to search for the rest?
"Terra:We can't force you to come with us, but we could really use your assistance."
"Shantotto:Oh, and I am sorry, but I follow a strict set of rules."
Shantotto:One of which is to never associate with blundering fools.
"Cecil:Well, let us know if you ever change your mind."
Shadow:Come find us if you ever wish to learn the truth of this world. You won't regret it.
Shantotto:I thank you for the guarantee.
Shantotto:But I fear there is more to that moogle than the eye can see.
Hope:Um... Is she following us?
Edge:Looks like it.
Y'shtola:Or perhaps she is attempting to learn more about us?
Shantotto:Ohohoho! I had a hunch that you were a fascinating bunch.
Edge:Join us and then you can watch us to your heart's content.
Shantotto:How humorousyour advice.
Shantotto:But my magicit comes with a price.
"Shantotto:What I do cannot be bought with flattery or applause, but must stem from a noble cause."
Hope:A noble cause?
"Mog:Then look no further, kupo!"
Mog:The Torsions are unraveling the fabric of space-time as we know it. We have to do something before it destroys their worlds.
Shantotto:I want to believe you. That's very virtuous and nice.
Shantotto:But do the words of one moogle truly suffice?
Y'shtola:It is not because we believe his word that we fight. We fight to defend that which we believe in.
"Edge:Besides, we can't just let the monsters run rampant."
Shantotto:It seems you aren't the moogle's puppetsyour apprehension is wise. It may even save you from an early demise.
Hope:So would you be willing to come with us?
Shantotto:Allow me to speak with clarity so that those with meager minds may understand.
"Shantotto:Before I make a decision, I must further study you and the laws of this world firsthand."
Shantotto:It is always a pleasure watching you fight. You show great courage in what seems a helpless plight.
Cloud:Make up your mind already.
"Rem:We'd love to have you come with us, but understand if your goals differ from ours."
"Yuna:Yes, you're more than welcome to join us."
"Shantotto:At the very least, my boredom will be ceased."
"Mog:Does that mean you'll be our friend, kupo?"
Shantotto:There is no need to guessfor my answer is yes.
Shantotto:You're the perfect specimens for
Mog:Kupo?
"Mog:The Torsion's not that way, kupo."
Shantotto:The call of chaos.
"Shantotto:Do not take this the wrong way. You are not being critiqued. However, I must be offmy interest is piqued."
Cloud:You'd think we'd learn by now.
"Mog:Well...it looks like we'll just have to move on without her, kupo."
???:Kweh! Kweh!
Yang:Hm? Is that what I think it is?
"Yuffie:Whoa, it's a chocobo. Is he yours, Bartz?"
"Bartz:I was kind of hoping he was, but unfortunately not."
Chocobo:Kweh kweh.
"Bartz:Hm? What's that, boy?"
Bartz:Really? That's wonderful!
Terra:You can talk to chocobos?
Bartz:I like to think so.
Yuffie:So you can't...
"Mog:Don't worry, kupo! I can speak fluent chocobo!"
Chocobo:Kweh kweh.
"Mog:Kupo, kupo... I see."
"Mog:He's saying he saw an old man in the area. It could be one of your friends, kupo!"
"Yang:An elderly gentleman, you say?"
Bartz:Galuf's an old man. Maybe it's him!
Yuffie:What's with everyone dragging old people with them on their journey? They need their rest!
"Mog:Thanks for the information, kupo! Watch out for monsters, okay?"
"Bartz:Yeah, and if you ever run into a chocobo called Boko, you let me know!"
Chocobo:Kweh! Kweh!
"Bartz:An old man, huh? I wonder who he could be?"
Bartz:That was a manikin of Galuf! I'm sure of it!
Yuffie:Looks like the old man that chocobo saw is your friend then.
"Bartz:Yeah, I hope so. He's a great guy. You can really count on him."
"Bartz:His memory's not the sharpest sometimes, though."
"Mog:I bet he also bears the light, kupo! We should go look for him!"
"Edge:He may be strong, but I don't feel comfortable leaving a senile old man alone out here."
"Bartz:Then it's settled! Just you wait, Galuf. We're coming to get you!"
Rem:Look! Someone's there!
Bartz:That's himGaluf!
Shadow:It appears we are too late.
Sazh:What!? He's just sleepin' in the middle of the path!
Galuf:*Yawn* What a pleasant dream.
Galuf:Hm? Do you need something?
Galuf:Huh? Who are you?
Galuf:And...who am I?
"Bartz:Galuf, don't tell me you've got amnesia."
"Galuf:How have you been, Bartz? It's been a while!"
Bartz:That's not funny! You had me seriously worried!
Galuf:SorryI just couldn't help myself.
Sazh:Is he really okay?
Rem:I doubt it.
"Galuf:By the way, where are we?"
Bartz:Let me start from the beginning...
Galuf:I see... So we're not in our world any longer. That explains a lot.
Shadow:You don't seem surprised.
Galuf:Let's just say I'm used to traveling to different worlds!
"Galuf:So, where is everyone?"
Bartz:I'm still looking for them. I'm sure they're somewhere out there though.
"Mog:You have more friends, kupo? Then let's go look for them!"
Galuf:Sounds good to me!
Shantotto:Ohohoho!
"Shantotto:For a moment, I almost felt dense, but now it all makes sense!"
Kuja:All those who have been summoned possess this power.
Kuja:And yet there are fools who still have not realized this.
Shantotto:Those who can close the portals can open them as well.
Shantotto:What a fascinating world for me to dwell!
Kuja:What will you do?
Kuja:They're nearly here.
Kuja:Did you find the answers you were searching for?
"Shantotto:There are still a few theories that must be applied, but I cannot do so unless I go inside."
Kuja:Do you truly believe you'll be able to make it back?
Shantotto:Stand back and behold. The mind of a genius cannot be controlled.
Kuja:A brave soul.
Zidane:Kuja! What did you do to her!?
"Mog:Did you trap her in the Torsion, kupo!?"
Kuja:She went inside of her own accord. All I did was lend a hand.
Zidane:You really think I'm going to fall for that!?
Kuja:Spare me the theatrics.
Kuja:You always knew it would come to this.
"Zidane:Answer me, Kuja!"
Kuja:There's no reason to get upset. Why don't you just ask her for yourself?
"Mog:We can worry about Shantotto after defeating him, kupo!"
Kuja:You foolthat you should risk your life for someone you just met...
"Kuja:You are far too trusting, Zidane."
Zidane:Not gonna run? I thought you could open Torsions.
"Mog:Kuja's too weak right now, kupo!"
Mog:This is our chance to
"Zidane:Kuja, why are you messin' with the Torsions?"
Zidane:Do you know something we don't?
Kuja:I'm not telling you a thing.
Shantotto:It seems I'm late.
"Shantotto:But as an apology, I have obtained a lot of data on the gate."
Cloud:She was able to open the Torsion on her own. Is she not possessed of the light?
"Mog:J-just who is she, kupo?"
"Shantotto:Kuja, was it? Are you giving up already, you bum?"
Shantotto:The best part is yet to come.
Kuja:I know.
"Kuja:I'd rather not be indebted to you, so I shall tell you this before I go."
Kuja:The one who possesses the call of chaos is nearby.
"Kuja:He's quite the spectaclea man with long silver hair, wielding a long, curved blade."
Cloud:What did you just say!?
"Zidane:Hey, get back here!"
"Mog:He got away, kupo."
Zidane:Whose side are you on?
Shantotto:We shared a mutual interest in the past.
Shantotto:But I think I have found a group much more fascinating at last.
Zidane:What do you think? Should we let her come with us?
"Mog:She does bear the light, kupo. Besides, there isn't much we can do if she decides to follow us."
"Shantotto:Ohohoho! Never fear, the illustrious Shantotto is here!"
Zidane:I already know we're gonna regret this.
Cloud:He's here... I have to find him.
Firion:What's that?
Cloud:There's only one person who could have done this.
Cloud:He's close.
"Mog:Wait! It's too dangerous to go alone, kupo!"
Sazh:Why don't they ever listen?
Shantotto:The way this monster was killed makes it very clear.
Shantotto:The one who bears the call of chaos was just here.
Firion:This is bad. He must be strong if Kuja has his eye on him.
"Sazh:Yeah, it sounds like this is the guy Cloud's been lookin' for."
"Shantotto:The only thing on his mind is a confrontation with his rival, but what he should be worried about is his own survival."
"Wakka:Hey, was there somethin' you wanted to talk about?"
Yuna:I just wanted to tell you that Maester Seymour is here.
Wakka:B-but why!? How!?
Warrior of Light:He claims he is already dead.
"Sazh:You know that we've been summoned here by the gods, right?"
"Yuna:Well, Maester Seymour says they're using us as their pawns. Even he, in death, cannot escape their machinations."
Yuna:He pities us and wants to release us from our shacklesby taking our lives.
"Wakka:Sounds pretty ridiculous. Honestly, I'm kinda relieved that's all it is."
"Wakka:WithoutSin, you won't have to perform theFinal Summoning, right? That means you won't have to!"
"Wakka:Sorry, I got a little carried away there. I guess moaning about it isn't going to solve anything."
"Wakka:Anyway, it doesn't matter where we are or who we're fighting."
"Wakka:I'm your guardian, and I'm here to protect you. That'll never change."
Warrior of Light:You are a man of honor. I admire that.
"Sazh:Yeah, you're my kind of guy!"
"Yuna:Thank you, Wakka."
"Wakka:Cut it out, guys! You're embarrassing me."
"Cloud:It ends here, Sephiroth."
"Sephiroth:A puppet in this world as well, I see."
Cloud:Shut up!
Cloud:I came here by my own free willto end this.
"Sephiroth:If it's despair you want, it's despair you'll get."
"Mog:This is bad, kupo!"
"Warrior of Light:He cannot win this alone. We must help him. Everyone, to arms."
Vivi:All right!
Warrior of Light:Calm yourself. This is not a battle that can be fought alone.
Cloud:You're wrong!
"Sephiroth:Come, I will lead you to despair."
"Mog:Here it comes, kupo! Get ready!"
Sephiroth:Pathetic.
Sephiroth:You're weakfar too weak to alter the course of fate.
"Mog:How did he get so powerful, kupo?"
Cloud:We have to stop him!
Shantotto:How exciting! I would love to join in on all this fighting!
"Yuffie:Great, just when you thought things couldn't get any worse!"
Sephiroth:My power only continues to grow.
Sephiroth:But it's still not enough.
"Shantotto:I must analyze that power, so stop right there, or I'll be forced to pull out all that beautiful hair!"
Warrior of Light:Is she friend or foe?
Warrior of Light:What is her aim?
Yuffie:Who cares? Just ignore her.
"Cloud:Because we want the same thing. Come on, we're going after her."
Yuffie:*Sigh* Fine.
Yang:Is there a meeting I missed?
Galuf:Just a few old men having a discussion.
Laguna:Adult stuff!
Sazh:Pretty sure a real adult wouldn't say that.
"Steiner:From time to time, we just need to talk alone, so we gathered here for a heart-to-heart."
"Galuf:Yang, was it? What's weighing on your mind?"
Laguna:Nice stealth brag. Can't say I'm not jealous though!
"Sazh:You really seem like you're in love. Man, I'd kill to be in your shoes."
"Yang:She is kind, brave, a wonderful cookshe even hits me with the frying pan when I need the motivation."
Steiner:She sounds quite pleasant.
Shadow:Did I say anything?
Galuf:You were mumbling something about yourpartnerand somedaughterof yours.
Shadow:I've been tired lately. That's all.
"Laguna:Yeah, I know what you mean. Faeries have been visiting me lately. I think they're in my head."
Galuf:Just listening to you talking about it makes me feel drained.
"Sazh:What about you, Steiner? Anything on your mind?"
Steiner:Me? Hm...
Steiner:I have been thinking a lot lately.
Steiner:Is living for others a selfish act?
"Galuf:Ah, the joys of being young."
"Sazh:What about you, old man?"
"Galuf:That's funny. I can't remember. Wait, where am I?"
"Shantotto:How could I lose sight of such a tall, strange-looking man?"
"Shantotto:He must have caught sight of me, crossed dimensions, and ran."
Penelo:There you are! Thank goodness you're all right.
Onion Knight:I'm pretty sure she can take care of herself.
"Onion Knight:Anyway, Doctor Shantotto, did you find what you were looking for?"
"Shantotto:Not yet, but I won't fret."
"Onion Knight:Well, will you at least tell us now how you opened that Torsion?"
Shantotto:It is a simple theory.
Shantotto:That which Mog calls the light is
"Mog:Hold that thought, kupo!"
Penelo:What is that!?
"Mog:It's guarding the Torsion! We have to defeat it, kupo!"
"Shantotto:Sure, let us save the discussion for laterfor the problem standing before us is greater."
Mog:I-it's huge!
"Mog:That giant worm must be guarding the Torsion! We have to defeat it, kupo!"
Shantotto:Fascinating. Around a large gate always lies a monster in wait.
"Mog:And it is by defeating them that we can close the Torsions, kupo!"
"Shantotto:Understood. However, there is still one thing I must investigate. Moments ago, it was as if my powers began to dissipate."
Y'shtola:That is a common occurrence during battles within the Torsions.
Onion Knight:Any ideas why this happens?
"Shantotto:I wish I could say, but a valid theory requires evidence, okay?"
Mog:Kupo?
Shantotto:I must continue to observe those who can detect the distortionfor they will lead me to intellectual prosperity and good fortune.
Onion Knight:What about your hypothesis about the light?
Shantotto:Those who can close the gates can also open them with force.
"Shantotto:Theoretically speaking, of course."
Warrior of Light:Do you mean the light we bear is a threat to the world?
"Shantotto:If your intentions are pure, then the world's well-being is secure."
Y'shtola:I see.
Y'shtola:Then that would mean that our foes were using the light for their own self-interests.
Onion Knight:Did you know about this?
"Mog:I didn't want to say anything until I was completely sure, kupo."
"Mog:Plus, I wanted to first make sure everybody's intentions were good."
"Onion Knight:Make sure our intentions were good, huh?"
"Warrior of Light:Shantotto, come with us. Your knowledge is vital to our successand to me as well."
Warrior of Light:I would like to discover who I really ammy purpose.
"Shantotto:Consider yourselves luckyfor if that is what you desire, then sure, just this once I am for hire."
"Mog:Then we'd love to recruit you, kupo! Light comes in all colors, after all!"
Materia:It seems you have made a new friend.
"Mog:It wasn't easy, kupo! I'm just glad we could work things out."
Mog:Did you summon her?
Materia:That is correct.
"Materia:While she may find pleasure in destruction, she displays remarkable sangfroid and intellect."
"Mog:Professor Shantotto is researching the will of the light, kupo."
Materia:The force we call the light is a part of the natural law in this world.
"Materia:It dictates the planet's fate, regardless of the bearer's temperament or morality behind their past actions."
Materia:That is why I ask that you lead them onto the path of the righteous. Can you do that?
"Mog:Of course, kupo!"
Materia:We cannot allow those who desire chaos such as Kefka and Sephiroth to have their way.
"Mog:But the Torsions are getting even bigger, kupo. Maybe persuading them to join us wouldn't be such a bad idea?"
Materia:Persuade them to join us?
"Mog:Of course, I don't expect for everyone to get along at first. After all, we've had our share of differences, kupo."
"Mog:But if I have your blessing, I'll see what I can do, kupo!"
Materia:If we could unite the warriors of this world before Spiritus...
"Mog:Then we could prevent him from taking control of this world, kupo!"
Materia:It is my duty as a goddess to restore stability to the planet.
"Materia:Mog, will you be able to persuade them to change their ways?"
"Mog:I'll start with the easy ones, kupo."
Mog:I actually sense the presence of an individual you summoned.
"Mog:But he seems to have teamed up with one of Spiritus's warriors, kupo."
Materia:So he used to be an ally of one of my warriors?
"Mog:Exactly! That means he'll be a lot easier to convince than someone Spiritus summoned, kupo!"
Materia:Having him join us would provide valuable information on persuading those on the other side as well.
"Materia:Very well. I am counting on you, Mog."
"Materia:Now go, usher those who bear the light onto the rightful path."
"Mog:My pleasure, kupo!"
"Warrior of Light:So ill will might also be considered ""light"" in this world..."
Terra:Have we really been doing the right thing?
"Shantotto:Before you begin your ruing, how about you tell me just what you've been doing?"
Warrior of Light:Closing Torsions and defeating the beasts that guard them.
"Warrior of Light:At times, the likes of Kuja as well..."
Terra:Any confrontation would end in battle. We thought them a threat...
Shantotto:And all on Mog's word your mind was set?
Terra:No! We've made our decisions ourselves.
Terra:We're doing what we can to protect the things that are important to us...
"Shantotto:If that's the case, then what's amiss? Operate according to your own sense of justice."
Shantotto:I fight for mine and it suits me just fine.
Shadow:...We're not alone.
"Kefka:My, oh, my! Aren't we all so big and strong now? I've been waiting for this day."
Shantotto:...Such vulgar sorcery.
Kefka:Whaaat? And here I thought you were on our team.
"Shantotto:Really? Thanks, but that's news to me."
Shantotto:I'm just happy we're clear someone of my position cannot consort with a circus magician.
"Kefka:Fine. Whatev. But since we're all here, how about a little show of force?"
"Mog:You again!? Leave us alone, kupo!"
"Kefka:Uwee, hee, hee! What a wonderful surprise. Come on, let's have a little fun."
"Kefka:Not bad, not bad... Leveling up nicely, I see..."
"Kefka:For power-hungry munchkins such as youse, I have a very special sur...!"
Kefka:Interested parties are asked to gird their loins and proceed to the manor up ahead.
"Mog:Imber Manor just so happens to house a pretty big Torsion, too, kupo."
"Mog:The going might be tough, but... shall we get going, kupo?"
Terra:We can't leave Kefka to his own devices. That man...is carnage itself.
Shantotto:I'm curious to see what this surprise might be.
"Mog:Then it's settled. Onward, kupo!"
"???:Back for more, you monsters!? Hope you're ready for a beatdown!"
Sazh:You know this kid?
???:...They can talk? They ain't as glassy as the others either.
Tifa:I think he thinks we're manikins.
"Laguna:Ahh, so that's what this is all about."
"Laguna:Hey, kid, take it easy. We're the good guys!"
???:L-Laguna!? Is that really you!?
Laguna:Huh? Have we met somewhere?
???:You bet we have! Tons of times! When I'm dreaming!
"???:Wait... Does that mean this is a dream, too?"
"Laguna:What are you babbling on about? You've lost me, and when I'm lost, I am lost."
Tifa:I've never seen Laguna this flustered before.
Cloud:Looks like he's finally met his match.
"Sazh:So, kid, you gonna tell us who you are?"
Zell:Zell's the name. I'm aSeeDstationed atBalamb Garden.
Laguna:Balamb? So does that mean you came from the same world as me?
Zell:Huh? Same world? Are you talking about the real world or the dream world?
"Mog:Calm down, kupo! I'll explain everything, so listen up."
"Mog:...And that's how you got here, kupo!"
"Zell:A different world? Dimensional distortion? I mean, I'm pretty well informed about things, but I've never heard anything like this before."
"Tifa:That's the story. So, will you come with us?"
"Zell:Heh, I'm flattered, but I'll pass. I can make it home on my own with one hand tied behind my back."
"Tifa:Don't be too modest, now..."
Zell:I'm not being modest! How can I call myself SeeD if I can't take care of myself!
Cloud:Knock yourself out.
"Zell:Well, you guys take care. Maybe we'll meet again someday. Later!"
"Laguna:So, uh... How'd he know me?"
Cloud:Don't ask me. I'm sure you'll figure it out.
"Kefka:Hale losers, well schlepped. Waltz in like you own the place, why don't ya?"
???:...If it isn't Cloud.
Cloud:Vincent!? What are you doing here?
Terra:A friend?
Vincent:I've chosen a different path in this world.
"Mog:Could he also be under Kefka's control, kupo?"
Vincent:I act of my own accord.
Vincent:I have sins to atone for...
Kefka:Hee hee hee. Ain't it the truth.
Cloud:What sins?
Cloud:You think he can help atone for anything? All he'll do is pile one sin on top of another.
Vincent:There's more here than meets the eye.
"Kefka:Moving on, there's a big, fat Torsion hiding somewhere in here."
Kefka:Clean it up and you'll be in for a fabulous reward from yours truly.
Cloud:Argh... What's going on?
"Mog:A-at any rate, there's no mistaking that there's a Torsion here, kupo."
"Mog:If we keep moving, maybe we'll see your friend again, too, kupo!"
Cloud:...I suppose that's our only option.
???:Light... Darkness...
"???:The balance of all has foundered... So...we have come to return all to the Void, have we?"
Terra:And you are?
Terra:Did you say Edgar!? He's the resistance leader!?
???:You didn't tell her?
Shadow:I only told her what she needed to know.
"Terra:Wow, thanks..."
Warrior of Light:Who is this Edgar you speak of?
"Mog:Anyway, I'm guessing you're also looking for the Torsions, kupo?"
???:So you're the moogle I keep hearing about.
???:Let me get a better look at ya.
"Mog:Wh-what's going on, kupooo!?"
"Bartz:Whoa! Mog, you can fly backwards? I'm impressed!"
"Mog:I-it's not me! Something's pulling me back, kupo!"
"???:Hmmm. Looks like any ordinary moogle to mea bit shifty, maybe."
"Mog:H-how rude! I'm not shifty, kupo!"
???:...Ah well.
"???:Anyway, Edgar asked me to help you guys out."
"???:There's still some stuff I need to look into, so I'll catch up with you all when I'm done."
"Mog:Just when you think you've seen it all. I thought I was a goner, kupo."
Cloud:Mansions and Vincent... Go figure.
Vaan:Home sweet home?
"Cloud:As if. The place was packed with monsters. I'd have a hard time calling it ""sweet"" anything."
"Steiner:A most unpleasant abode, in truth..."
"Terra:The gods fashioned this world after all of ours, right?"
Steiner:That would explain any uncanny similarities.
"Vaan:In that case, the gods have awfully bad taste."
Vaan:They shoulda copied someplace a little nicer.
Cloud:...No argument from me.
Vaan:I bet your pal acts that way 'cause he hangs out in such depressing places.
"Cloud:If I had to guess, likely he's got a reason for being here..."
Cloud:...But standing around won't tell us anything. Let's go.
"Vivi:Tifa, that Vincent guy is one of your friends, right?"
"Tifa:He is, but..."
Tifa:He's got a tendency to clam up and brood over things on his own...
Hope:We should help him.
Galuf:He spoke of sins. Have you any idea about what he meant?
Tifa:...I don't know for sure. But...
Tifa:If what happens in this world has some effect on what's happened in ours...
Vivi:He might try to use the Torsions to change fate...like Kuja.
Galuf:Power is to be used for the greater good.
Hope:The same goes for our light. Misusing it could destroy the world.
Hope:So... If we let him continue on this path...
"Mog:Right, kupo."
"Mog:Vincent's light is strong, but it's veered off course, kupo."
"Mog:It's like it's wavering between light and dark... A real precarious position, kupo."
"Tifa:We need more information. If we keep moving, we'll find him...I hope."
"???:Hey, party people. Getting along well?"
Mog:Kupo!? Oh no...
"???:I've wrapped up my business. Far be it from me to cast aspersions, but what a cruddy mansion."
"???:Anyway, count me in your party, too. Nothing beats good company, right?"
"Terra:Mog's terrified of you, you know?"
"???:Whoops, sorry about earlier. Promise it won't happen again."
Terra:How did you even do that? It looked like you were pulling Mog with some sort of invisible hand.
Bartz:...What's that? How do you bear crystals?
???:Take a look here. On my face.
Bartz:Whoa! You've got a crystal stuck in your cheek!
"???:A bearer gets to use the powers of the crystal he's stuck withergo, crystal bearer."
???:I can manipulate gravity to move anything I want. Juggling moogles is a piece of cake.
Bartz:That's amazing. I can't believe the crystals in your world have that kind of power.
???:Oh yeah. Forgot to introduce myself.
Layle:Layle. Nice to meet you.
"Mog:You really promise you won't pick on me anymore, kupo?"
Layle:Relax. I've got better things to do.
"Layle:Anyway, let's go and get this crap over with."
"Zidane:Look, this way leads underground!"
"Bartz:Where there's a hidden passage, there's treasure, huh?"
"Mog:I'm sensing tremendous power from down there, kupo!"
"Yuffie:The mansion basement... Man, talk about creepy!"
"Yuffie:Damp, dark...and definitely haunted..."
Zidane:Scared? We can hold hands if you
"Yuffie:Hate to break it to ya, but where there's treasure, there's Yuffie!"
Yuffie:Ladies first!
Zidane:Good grief... What a ball of energy. Wish I could be that carefree.
Bartz:...Can't say I can tell the difference.
"Mog:...Best to keep it simple, kupo."
Mog:Kupo! Don't leave me here!
Vincent:You gathered I'd be here and came after me.
Cloud:We aren't looking for a fight. Why are you with Kefka?
Cloud:He's thrown away his humanity and become a slave to chaos. I wouldn't expect you to partner with scum like that.
"Vincent:Heh... Thrown away his humanity, has he?"
Vincent:I guess this body of mine makes us one and the same then.
Cloud:You know that's not what I meant!
Cloud:What's going on? You're usually more level-headed than this...
Vincent:...You met Sphiroth.
Warrior of Light:Why would you know that? I don't recall you being there.
Vincent:I've chosen my associates... based on the knowledge you seem to lack.
"Vincent:Depending on how it's used, the same power could change the fate of the planet..."
Cloud:You seriously believe that?
Firion:You can't! The light isn't as simple as that.
"Y'shtola:...Indeed, we may be lacking in knowledge."
Y'shtola:Yet somehow I have little interest in aiding a man hellbent on destruction.
Vincent:...I'm not looking for anyone's understanding.
Cloud:Hold on!
"Warrior of Light:If we mean to learn the truth, perhaps we can extract it from him."
Firion:First let's help him get in the mood to talk!
Vincent:I must atone for my sins. Let me be.
"Yuffie:You can be a real pain, you know that? Are you sure you didn't imagine all these sins?"
"Yuffie:Listen, we're bringing you back to our side! Everyone, gimme a hand with him!"
Vincent:Ngh... Even here I'm useless...?
"Cloud:Vincent, get a grip! We can still"
Kefka:Zip! A widdle warp for my starry-eyed sock puppet. Ain't I swell?
Rem:Translocation magic... He's back in the manor!
"Mog:Let's go after him and finish talking, kupo!"
Cloud:(There's no way Vincent hasn't got that snake's number...)
Cloud:(He must be letting Kefka think he's pulling the strings in order to use him...)
"Cloud:If we hear him out, maybe we can figure out what's really going on here..."
Zell:Argh...
"Seifer:That all you got? Once a chicken-wuss, always a chicken-wuss, I guess."
"Zell:Shut up! I ain't no chicken-wuss, you"
"Mog:Seifer! Stop, kupo!"
"Seifer:Hmph. You again, moogle? I told you to stay out of my way."
Laguna:Whoa! Nice gunblade!
"Seifer:Who do you think you are, talking to me like that?"
Seifer:Wait. I've seen him from somewhere before.
Laguna:Ack! Don't tell me you also met me in your dreams.
"Raijin:Oh yeah! That's the guy who played the gunblade knight in that old movie, ya know?"
Laguna:Old? That movie just came out.
Seifer:You...you're my hero! I started using a gunblade because of you! I can't believe I ran into you here!
"Raijin:Yeah, he looks the same as he did back then, ya know? Gotta hand it to movie stars, ya know?"
"Laguna:Back then? Unaged? Uh-oh, I'm gettin' lost again..."
"Mog:Dimensional distortion transcends time and space, kupo."
Seifer:You made me the man I am today! Who better to test my strength against than my childhood hero!
"Zell:Seifer, d-don't..."
"Seifer:Take a nap, chicken-wuss."
Seifer:Let's do this. Fujin! Raijin!
"Mog:W-watch out, kupo!"
Warrior of Light:Are you hurt?
Zell:Ugh! That punk made a fool of me!
"Laguna:Eh, what are ya gonna do? He's a tough guy."
"Zell:What, so you're saying I should just give up and admit defeat!?"
Warrior of Light:Coming to terms with defeat grants an opportunity to reflect upon and improve oneself. Consider this a lesson.
"Laguna:Yeah, shed the ego and put on your training gloves. Gotta prepare for the rematch!"
"Zell:Shed my ego, huh? You're right. Thanks, Laguna."
Laguna:Heh-heh! I do what I can.
"Zell:All right, I've made up my mind. I'm comin' with you guys."
"Mog:Really, kupo!?"
"Zell:Yeah, man! Training is back in session! And who better to train with than you all?"
"Zell:Next time I see Seifer, he's gonna wish he never messed with me."
Warrior of Light:We're glad to have you.
"Mog:I can feel your light getting even brighter, kupo!"
Zell:Left! Right! Hah!
"Zell:Whew...! Alright, only eight more sets!"
Zidane:Look at that Zell go. Gotta admire his pep.
"Vaan:Hey, Zell! Why don't you take a break already?"
Zell:Not yet! How am I gonna kick Seifer's butt if I skimp on my workout!?
Zell:I'm SeeD! That bum can't diss me and get away with it!
"Vaan:Speaking of, I've been wondering... What's ""seed""?"
Zell:Military cadets who train at the Garden and pass a really tough exam get to become members of an elite unit: SeeD.
"Vaan:No kidding. You must be more impressive than you look, huh?"
Zell:What's that supposed to mean!?
"Zidane:Is Seifer SeeD, too?"
"Zell:Naw, he's forever a cadet. He's got the ability, sure, but you saw his attitude."
"Vaan:He does seem to have a bit of a self-centered, stubborn streak..."
Zell:And that's why I can't let him kick me around!
"Zell:I'm gonna get stronger, pound some sense into that stupid head of his, and put him on the straight and narrow!"
"Zidane:Ah, the passion of youth. Must be fun."
Vaan:Zell! Let's train together! I know exactly how you feel!
Zell:Deal! We'll race to the sunset!
Zidane:What sun? It's pouring.
"Zell:Let's go! Raaargh! I'll show you, Seifer!"
"Vaan:Raaargh! First-rate sky pirate, here I come!"
Zidane:Ah well. No point in raining on their parade...
"Zidane:Hold up! I'm coming, too!"
Layle:This place gets spookier the more you look at it. Let's finish up and get out of here.
"Shadow:The monsters are getting stronger, too. We shouldn't stay any longer than we need to."
Terra:Mog said he's choosing our destinations based on our strength.
"Layle:You don't say. In other words, then, everything we face should be an even match."
Shadow:I doubt it's as convenient as that.
Layle:Monsters obviously have the upper hand in this world. Things are gonna get harder before they get easier.
Layle:...A note from Edgar. Taking that moogle at its every word'll come back to bite you.
"Shadow:There's another deity beside the ""goddess"" who called us here... Do I have that right?"
Terra:The god who aims to protect the world he created by any means necessary...Spiritus.
"Terra:Undoubtedly, he's the one commanding Kefka and Kuja..."
Layle:Also according to your moogle?
"Layle:If that were the case, you'd think trouncing that god'd be the first order of business."
"Shadow:A battle against divinity, eh?"
"Mog:What are you three up to over here, kupo?"
Layle:Just shooting the breeze.
"Mog:We should get moving soon. If you don't pick it up, you'll get left behind, kupo."
Terra:...It's true we don't know how much we can believe of what Mog tells us...
Terra:But I trust him.
Layle:Shadow? What about you?
"Shadow:I do what I'm paid for, and nothing more."
Layle:...Sure you do.
"Kefka:Ruh-roh! The big, bad good guys have come to stop your diabolical schemes. I trust...you know what must be done."
Vincent:Hmph. Save your half-witted jesting for someone who cares. I only fight for myself.
"Kefka:Oh, what arrogance! I love it. Now, show them that monstrous power of yours!"
Kefka:Hee hee hee! Slick moves you had there.
Vincent:I wasn't fighting for your sake... I just...want...
Vincent:...wanted to light some spark of hope... in this contorted world...
Kefka:Like I give two licks!
Kefka:Struggle and strife... The rising urge to break stuff with each and every fight...
Kefka:Can't you just feel it?
Shantotto:Push around lackeys to sate urges by proxy? Never have I heard a thing so unappealing.
Shantotto:Better to take what you want by your own sheer moxie! Do it yourself for that full-bellied feeling.
"Cloud:...Vincent, stop taking this all on by yourself."
"Kefka:What's this what's this? You knock him about, then want to kiss and make up?"
"Kefka:If you accuse li'l ol' me of being self-serving, isn't he juuust as guilty?"
"Cloud:...He hasn't slaughtered countless innocents, to say the least."
Terra:He's nothing like you... Stop tormenting him!
Kefka:Hmph. Cheeky know-nothings.
"Kefka:Fine, then. Make me!"
"Kefka:Aww, what a lousy monster. You're worthless. Worthlesser than worthless."
Kefka:You're garbageall of you! So now I'm going to have to Punish you! With a capital P.
"Kefka:Ulp, that's enough for now..."
Kefka:...Oh-ho? Here's another rude guest...
???:Hahaha... That's what you call destruction?
"Onion Knight:That's...! Kefka's in league with that, too!?"
Kefka:I do not recollect making palsy-walsy with Ms. Cloud of That's-What-You-Call Darkness.
Kefka:...The world is mine for the breaking.
"Mog:Kupo! We don't stand a chance if they team up against us, kupo!"
"Mog:Let's beat a hasty retreat, kupo!"
Cecil:There's no way in which to flee!
Onion Knight:What's your game?
Vincent:That's your only option for escape. ...I know you can find your way out of there.
Cecil:Come with us; I'm sure we can come to an understanding!
Vincent:...I've yet to atone from my sins.
Cecil:Wait! It's too dangerous...!
"Cloud of Darkness:Run where you may, resistance is futile..."
Vincent:I've...made my choice...
Warrior of Light:Cloud of...Darkness was it? What can you tell us about that entity?
Onion Knight:It's from my world. ...I can't believe it's here.
Yuna:It was impossible to tell if it was friend or foe.
Onion Knight:The Cloud of Darkness is...neither human nor monster.
Onion Knight:It appears when the balance between light and dark is out of whack.
King:Appears and then what? It was going on about destruction or something or other.
"Onion Knight:When light and darkness are no longer in balance, the Cloud of Darkness will destroy the world... But we're not talking about any old destruction."
Onion Knight:It's like a force of nature that comes to reset the world...so it can be reborn from nothingness.
"Yuna:If such a thing has appeared here, does that mean this world is in such peril?"
Warrior of Light:The balance between light and darkness... Assuming we're the light...
"Warrior of Light:Even should we flood the world with light, is it still destined for ruin...?"
Onion Knight:...I don't know. All I know is that we're clueless.
Onion Knight:...It's safe to say this world is anything but balanced.
Onion Knight:But...we don't even know what a balanced world is supposed to look like.
Mog:That's why you should just trust me...
"???:I am Ultima... Forged in antiquity, all powerful..."
Terra:Who said that!?
"???:I am power, unliving... Feeble mortals, begone!!"
Terra:Look out!
"Mog:I can't believe my eyes, kupo. Here too? But why? Could it be...?"
Mog:Or maybe the destruction is spreading even faster than I imagined...
"Layle:Whoa, now for something completely different... We can't let that thing out of the Torsion!"
"Zell:You can say that again! Come on, let's do this!"
Terra:Ultima Weapon... Did it also appear because of the Torsions?
Cloud:Think there's some rule to how the Torsions pick their muscle?
"Onion Knight:One after another, they've all had some connection to us..."
Onion Knight:...Can't be a coincidence.
"Mog:Kupo! More importantly, an exit, kupo!"
Kefka:Seee? I told you we'd get here. My magic's nothing to sniff at.
Cloud of Darkness:...Insolent man.
Cloud:They followed us... What happened to Vincent!
Kefka:That puppet outlived his usefulness.
Cloud:A puppet...? Why you!
Cloud of Darkness:We will fight here... That will lead to the Void...
Cloud of Darkness:Let us bring about the cycle of ruin and rebirth...
Onion Knight:Doesn't look like we can avoid this fight.
Cloud of Darkness:Warriors of light? Hmph.
Cloud of Darkness:It will take more than light to defeat us.
Terra:We won't know until we try!
Cloud of Darkness:Yes... Try to defy reason!
Kefka:And don't forget about yours truly.
Cloud:Don't think for a minute we did!
"Cloud of Darkness:What a powerless, dim light... Allow us to inter you in darkness."
Kefka:Where do all these yahoos get off doing as they please? They're just gonna die. At least I get to do the killing!
Zell:Looks like every world has its share of freaks!
"Layle:Took the words right out of my mouth. It ends here! Get ready to fight, no holds barred!"
Yuffie:Ahhh! It's Vincent!
"Zell:Oh man, is he alright?"
Bartz:He's still breathing!
Vincent:Where...? You...you're all safe!
"Yuffie:""You're all safe"" my foot!"
Yuffie:You're not allowed to act all cool after you get the snot kicked outta you!
Layle:Harsh friend. She always like this?
Cloud:Yuffie's concern for others can get a bit dramatic.
"Yuffie:Gimme a break! You were worried the whole time, too!"
"Mog:Neither the Cloud of Darkness nor Kefka are down for the count, kupo."
"Mog:There're only more and more difficult battles waiting for us from here on out, kupo..."
Zell:We'll knock 'em down as many times as they get back up!
Zell:...Though it'd be nice to at least get one clean victory 'fore I start running my mouth...
Vincent:So my rescue attempt sent you from bad to worse...
Bartz:Nobody's blaming you.
Layle:But you still want to make it up to us.
Vincent:...I need to redeem myself.
Cloud:Then come with us and tell us what you know.
Cloud:(...Including whatever it is that moogle is up to.)
Vincent:...Understood. I'll take responsibility for everything.
"Mog:We've got another warrior with the light, kupo!"
Vincent:Heh... We'll see soon enough what you mean by that...
Vincent:If that light truly is for helping others or not...
"Mog:Come on! Let's take the airship to the next Torsion, kupo!"
Yuffie:Ughhh... Not the airship again...
Layle:Not a fan of airships? I can give you a lift with my powers.
Yuffie:Heck no! You wanna see me extra sick!?
"Bartz:I finally figured out how to cope! If you don't look outside, you can't tell how high you're up!"
"Vincent:...Blessed with a colorful bunch as usual, eh?"
Cloud:...You're one to talk.
"Mog:I'm back, kupo."
Spiritus:You have quite the band of warriors now.
Spiritus:Or should I call them pawns?
"Mog:They are no such thing, kupo!"
"Mog:Vincent was one of Cloud's allies back in their world, so it's only natural he allied with the goddess Materia."
Spiritus:Hmph. Then I will just send in another pawn to take care of things.
Spiritus:That's exactly why I sent the Cloud of Darkness.
Mog:That was your doing?
"Mog:She was really powerful, kupo."
Spiritus:Stability in this world cannot exist without a balance between light and darkness.
Spiritus:Materia's nave puppets will not be able to save the planet.
"Mog:So they're not bothering you, kupo?"
Spiritus:To the contrarythey are doing exactly what I want them to.
"Spiritus:Besides, closing the Torsions is merely a temporary solution."
Spiritus:Nothing will change if they do not find out what is causing them.
"Mog:What if the cause of their existence could be found inside of the warriors themselves, kupo?"
"Spiritus:Ridiculous. Although, that would be rather ironic, wouldn't it?"
Spiritus:The crystal created this place that the warriors might find respite from battle.
Spiritus:Yet even now they continue to fight. Pathetic.
"Spiritus:But never mind that for now. In the near future, you will encounter someone who despises the gods..."
Spiritus:An antagonistic warrior summoned by Materia who chooses no side.
Spiritus:She may even prove to be hostile toward a moogle like you.
"Spiritus:In fact, she's fighting with one of my own as we speak."
Spiritus:Will she be a threat to this world? Or the key to uncovering its truths?
"Mog:You can count on me to lead her in the right direction, kupo!"
Spiritus:Then prove it.
"Mog:K-kupo! Yes, sir!"
"Garland:You defy me, despite knowing you are nothing more than a tool of the goddess?"
Garland:It doesn't matter whose side we're on. There is no future for warriors like us here.
Garland:Or are you merely enjoying the carnage of this world? Perhaps you and I are not so different.
???:I didn't ask what you thought.
Garland:It seems there is only one way to settle this.
???:Hmph. Was that supposed to hit me?
Garland:You dare to oppose your fate?
???:Fighting for no reason's just slow suicide.
"Mog:There's a Torsion here too, kupo!"
Warrior of Light:Even the scorching lava feels familiar to me. Are these memories of my past?
"Bartz:There are places like this where you're from, too?"
Warrior of Light:...I don't know.
Warrior of Light:I remember little of my past ever since I arrived in these lands.
"Bartz:Now that you mention it, my head did feel kinda funny while I was going through the Torsion."
"Mog:The distortion affects everyone differently, kupo. For some people it's their memories, and for others it's their abilities."
"Warrior of Light:Regardless, lingering on the past serves us no purpose here. Come, we have no time to waste."
"Onion Knight:Vincent, you mentioned you were working with Kefka because there was something you wanted to know, right?"
Shantotto:Would that certain something happen to be learning how to create a Torsion to flee?
Vincent:I was unsuccessful. I won't be able to provide you with any valuable information.
Squall:(That's for us to decide.)
Terra:We wouldn't have been able to escape if it weren't for you.
Shantotto:Listen to the girl; this is no time to brood. Now tell us what you know while I'm still in a good mood.
"Squall:What is this, an inquisition?"
Shantotto:I suppose you'd prefer to be in his position?
Layle:He was just talking to himself like always.
Squall:...You were saying.
Vincent:The moogle said we need to save this world.
Vincent:But...for who?
Onion Knight:The only people we've met here are warriors from other worlds.
Shantotto:And forget not in the least the manikins and beasts.
Vincent:Exactly. I've seen nothing worth fighting for in this inane world.
"Terra:But according to Mog, the destruction will eventually spread to our worlds."
Squall:There's no way for us to confirm that.
Layle:Which is why our client has a hard time trusting Mog.
"Onion Knight:Client, huh? ...Mog claimed he's a messenger of some goddess, didn't he?"
"Shantotto:A goddess, is it? Then let's pay her a visit."
Layle:You think we can meet her that easy?
"Shantotto:That moogle on occasion sneaks off someplace. We should follow him, of course."
"Shantotto:And if that doesn't work, then there's always force..."
"Layle:I can get on board with that. The more we know, the better."
Squall:(You sure take your work seriously.)
"Layle:Flattery will get you nowhere. Anyway, you're cool with that, right Squall?"
"Squall:Guess talking to this so-called ""goddess"" would be our best bet."
Terra:But would we even be able to comprehend the divine plan of a god?
"Onion Knight:There's no harm in asking. Let's finish up sealing the Torsion here first, though."
"Bartz:Man, how much longer is this gonna take?"
"Mog:Don't be a quitter, kupo! Come on, we're almost there!"
"Bartz:Yeah, easy for a flying moogle to say."
"Bartz:Let's go, Shadow. No time for breaks."
Shadow:Is this what I think it is?
Vivi:Find something?
Bartz:Something's been engraved here. ...Perhaps with a katana.
Cloud:A katana... Sephiroth?
Terra:A katana? Doma...?
Terra:Wait! Do you think it's him!?
Cloud:You know who did this?
Terra:It must have been our friend Cyan. He's a samurai from the Kingdom of Doma.
Vivi:A samur-what?
Shadow:Samurai. Noble warriors and faithful retainers to their master. Think of it as a sort of knight.
"Vivi:Oh, like Mr. Steiner!"
Terra:Look... There's an arrow etched into the ground next to the emblem.
Shadow:It seems to be pointing that way.
"Mog:A clue, kupo! Looks like that settles it. New friend, here we come!"
"Terra:Cyan, are you all right!?"
Cyan:Worry not about me. Art thou hurt?
Zidane:We're fine.
Yuffie:We were doing great until you attacked us though! What's your problem!
"Shadow:Let me guess: you attempted to use the Magitek Armor to fight the monsters here, but lost control of it."
"Terra:You know how bad you are with machines, Cyan. You need to be more careful, okay?"
Cyan:I am ashamed of my behavior. I beg thee for forgiveness.
"Mog:No sweat! It's all in the past, kupo!"
"Cyan:Incidentally, Terra, what is thy relationship with these warriors?"
Terra:They're our new friends we met in this world. Shadow and I are on a journey with them to seal the Torsions.
Cyan:This world? Torsions...?
Cyan:Hm? Hmmm?
Zidane:Looks like the old man needs someone to fill him in.
Cyan:I was summoned to another world? And that detestable Kefka is here as well?
Cyan:It seems I shall have my revenge sooner than I thought thanks to this curious twist of fate.
Yuffie:Revenge? What'd he do to you?
Zidane:He's even sicker than I thought.
"Cyan:Yet I shall not turn mine eyes away from the truth. I shall live on, following my path until the bitter end."
Cyan:For that is the way of the samurai.
"Wakka:Gotta stick to your beliefs no matter what happens, eh? Now there's a man I can respect!"
Zidane:I feel like we just recruited another Steiner...
Cyan:I cannot allow Kefka's acts of savagery to go on any longer! I shall accompany ye on thy quest.
"Mog:Sounds good to me, kupo! We really appreciate you helping us out."
Cyan:Thou art like family to me. I shall protect ye with my life.
"Garland:Bwahaha! Yes, how exhilarating!"
Warrior of Light:I have to stop him!
???:You won't be laughing for long.
Hope:Is that Light!?
Vanille:You're right! And it looks like she's in trouble!
Warrior of Light:Allow me to raise my sword to assist.
Lightning:Huh... So that's the moogle.
"Lightning:Go, the Torsion is just up ahead."
Vanille:We're not going without you!
"Lightning:The mission comes first! Now, go! I'll create a path for you and hold him off!"
"Mog:M-more monsters are going to come crawling out of the Torsion if we don't hurry, kupo!"
Warrior of Light:But Garland is too dangerous for one to handle alone!
Hope:...!
Vanille:We just have to trust her.
"Vanille:I don't know what happened between you and Garland, but you don't need to worry about Lightning."
Warrior of Light:...Very well. I cannot doubt the words of my allies.
Vanille:It'll all work out. I promise.
Hope:Let's go. We're the only ones who can do this.
Lightning:What?
"Hope:I trust you. So, please..."
"Lightning:I know. Now, keep your eyes front and go!"
"Mog:We've gotta defeat that monster to close the Torsion, kupo!"
Hope:Where's Light!?
Zidane:They're both gone.
Hope:This can't be...
King:Let's not jump to conclusions. She might still be around here somewhere.
"King:Besides, I thought you trusted her."
Hope:You're right. I don't know what got into me.
"Zidane:So who's this Garland guy, anyway?"
"Zidane:I mean, he's obviously bad news, but do you know him or something?"
Warrior of Light:I suppose you could say he is an old enemy of mine.
Zell:Then do you know why he's here?
Warrior of Light:That...I cannot remember.
"Zell:Aw, c'mon!"
"Zidane:Oh yeah, you said you lost your memory, right?"
Warrior of Light:There is one thing I can recall.
"Warrior of Light:Garland said he would live on forever here, and then...he cut me down."
"King:I'm no doctor, but...I'm pretty sure you're alive."
Zell:Aaah! All this thinking is making my head hurt!
"Zell:I've gotta do something! The stress is gonna kill me. Yo, Mog! Where's the next Torsion?"
"Mog:It's right over there, kupo! Follow me!"
"Terra:So, how are you feeling? Used to this world yet?"
"Cyan:Yes, and I owe it all to my new allies."
"Cyan:While our fields of battle may differ, we share an unfaltering bond. Allow me to express my gratitude."
"Layle:Ahh, right, you guys came from the same world."
"Layle:So does that mean you know our client, too?"
Cyan:Client? I am afraid I do not know what you mean.
Terra:Layle and Shadow are members of an insurgent group that was formed in this world.
Shadow:I like to call us the Returners.
Cyan:The Returners!?
Layle:Our client's a royal flirt who likes tinkering with machines.
Cyan:A royal flirt...who tinkers with machines...
Layle:Bingo. Good guess.
"Terra:They are close friends, after all."
Shadow:The Returners act under Edgar's orders here as well.
Cyan:Then what are we waiting for? Let us recruit him and the Returners to our cause.
Layle:Easier said than done.
Cyan:Wh-wherefore would that be?
Shadow:The Returners aren't Mog's allies.
"Layle:We're not enemies, though. This world is shrouded in mystery, you know?"
Layle:The Returners want to learn more about it before making a move. Edgar's a lot more careful than he looks.
Cyan:I see... If there were only some way we could join forces...
Layle:It all depends on that moogle.
"Mog:The next Torsion's at the top of Capta Est Tower, kupo."
Yuna:It looks like we have a lot of walking to do.
"Setzer:So we can't use the airship, huh?"
Vaan:Is that because of the Torsion?
Galuf:I don't know about that... I've got a bad feeling about this.
"Setzer:Come on, don't say stuff like that, old man. What do I have to look forward to now?"
Galuf:What do you ever look forward to other than flying?
"Onion Knight:If it's not flying, it's always gambling with you, isn't it?"
"Onion Knight:Anyway, I can feel the Torsion from here...and it's powerful."
Onion Knight:Are you sure we're ready?
"Mog:I...hope so, kupo."
"Vaan:What do you mean ""you hope so""? Are we ready or not?"
Galuf:It means that not even Mog can fathom the power of what we are about to face.
Setzer:I usually like to be a little more prepared when I'm gambling with my life.
"Yuna:It's going to be a difficult journey, but I know we can do it if we stick together."
"Warrior of Light:Garland, why did you spare me?"
"Onion Knight:Listen, there's no use mulling over something you can't remember."
Setzer:He's right. Don't obsess over past matches. It'll only hold you back.
Warrior of Light:What if I end up holding you back though?
Setzer:Nonsense. Don't think like that.
"Vaan:Besides, this isn't your battle alone. We're in this together, you know?"
Galuf:Exactly. You're not alone. You need to rely on us more.
"Warrior of Light:Thank you. You're right. I must focus on the present, not the past."
"Squall:(I was able to meet up with Zell and Laguna, so I'm sure the others are here, too. I have to find them.)"
Squall:(Seifer and his gang are here as well. Can't say I'm thrilled about that.)
"Raijin:Whoa! Seifer, look!"
"Raijin:It's Squall! It's really him, ya know!?"
Seifer:...You were here and you couldn't even take the time to say hello?
Seifer:Just what I needed. Another chicken-wuss without any manners.
Squall:(Maybe people would like you more if you pulled that stick out of your rear.)
Squall:(Why do you always have to be like this? Even now...)
Squall:I don't have time for this.
Seifer:Wait! I'm not done talking to Argh!
Fujin:INJURED! REST.
Seifer:Hmph. Bet you're all laughing at me now.
Yuna:Nobody's laughing at you...
Rem:Got something on your mind?
Squall:I was just thinking about when we ran into Seifer and his lackeys.
"Rem:Actually, I've been meaning to ask you about that, but I couldn't find the right moment."
"Rem:You all...know each other, don't you?"
Vaan:Seifer almost made it sound like you were friends.
"Squall:(Blank stares, huh? Should have seen that coming. Let me rephrase that.)"
Squall:We're from the same facility.
"Rem:You and Seifer use the same weapon, too."
Vaan:The scar on his face is similar to yours as well.
Squall:It's...a long story.
"Hope:Well, we have time if you don't mind telling us."
"Squall:(Are they genuinely curious about me? No, they're probably nervous because they don't know what's going on.)"
Vaan:You on bad terms?
"Squall:Well, I wouldn't say we were friends. I got this scar fighting him."
Squall:Us using the same weapon is pure coincidence though. Gunblades are pretty rare where I come from.
"Squall:Basically, we're from the same place, but we don't get along. There, happy now?"
"Rem:If you're from the same facility, then I wonder if you could get them to join us?"
Squall:You saw him. You really think he'd help us?
Hope:Yeah... You're right.
Rem:He didn't seem like a bad person though. He just seemed a little stubborn.
"Squall:He wasn't always like this, and deep down he's not a bad person, but we don't really need them."
"Vaan:Well, after seeing what he did to your face, I say we just forget about him."
Squall:(But I was the one that left that scar on Seifer's face. I'm no better than he is.)
"Squall:(Nothing really has changed, has it? Even people from other worlds don't know how to deal with you, Seifer.)"
"Zell:Man, do we really gotta go all the way up there to get to the Torsion? I'm exhausted just thinkin' about it."
"Zell:But in a way, it's kind of exciting, isn't it?"
Squall:(How can Zell be enjoying himself at a time like this? Does he not realize what's happening to this world?)
"Squall:(Well, he did look pretty clueless when we were reunited.)"
"Zell:So you were with Mog too, huh? Thank goodness you're here."
"Zell:Oh, and I don't mean that as a diss to any of you guys!"
Zidane:Don't worry about it. We all know how comforting it is to see someone from back home.
Squall:I'm glad you're okay.
"Squall:(Zell, Seifer, and even Laguna are here. What does this so-called goddess want with us?)"
"Laguna:Hold up. If you two are friends, does that mean you're from the same world as me?"
Laguna:I don't remember Balamb ever having a school in it...
Squall:(The Laguna here is a little different from the one I know though. Maybe it's because of the Torsions?)
Squall:(I probably shouldn't say anything until I have a better idea of what's going on.)
"Zell:Not only are you two from the same world, but you've met before, too! I mean, it was in a dream, but yeah."
Laguna:Not this again. Am I really that famous?
Squall:It was only a dream. Forget he mentioned it.
"Zell:Squall, that's cold! You two used to be so..."
"Squall:(Zell, could you shut up and think before you talk for once?)"
"Laguna:Wait, wait, wait! Do you guys know me from that movie!? Is that what this is all about!? When did it become such a big hit!?"
"Bartz:Wow, look at you, Mr. Popular."
Squall:Can you give it a rest?
Squall:(Great. Now they're all looking at me.)
Squall:Sorry. I was just thinking to myself.
"Laguna:No, I get it. You're young! You're at a very impressionable time in your life."
Squall:(I've never met someone so clueless.)
"Laguna:Can't blame you for being nervous around your hero, but you can be yourself around me."
"Zell:Yeah, I guess we shouldn't be putting so much thought into those dreams, anyway."
"Squall:Please, just let me focus on figuring out what's going on here."
"Zidane:Hey, you okay?"
Squall:It's nothing any of you need to worry about. I was just thinking about this world.
"Bartz:If that's the case, then why don't you tell us what's on your mind? Two heads are better than one, right?"
Zidane:Exactly. Sometimes talking about it can make you feel better.
"Zidane:We're your friends. You can come to us, okay?"
"Squall:(Friends, huh? I guess we are.)"
Squall:I'll consider it.
Warrior of Light:(I am certain I was defeated by Garland then.)
"Warrior of Light:(And unlike my allies, I have almost no recollection of ever meeting Mog.)"
"Warrior of Light:(However, telling them this would only engender apprehension.)"
"Mog:He doesn't look so good, kupo. Could you guys go check on him?"
Vivi:Are you okay? Does your stomach hurt?
"Warrior of Light:Ah, do not be alarmed. I will return shortly."
"Firion:If something is troubling you, then so be it. However, you don't have to face these tribulations alone."
Firion:I understand that you feel you have a responsibility to stand strongto lead and protect us.
Firion:But we are more than a team. We're friends.
Squall:(Friends? I guess you could call us that.)
"Zell:Hm? Yo, Squall. What's up?"
Warrior of Light:It is because we are allies that I do not wish to lose your trust.
Vivi:Are you afraid you'll make us worry?
Vivi:Because you shouldn't. Having people worry about you just means they care.
"Firion:While we may have met by chance, everything else was of our own free will. Am I wrong?"
Firion:We need you to believe in us just like we believe in you.
"Warrior of Light:The next time I confront Garland, I intend on uncovering the truth about my lost memories."
Warrior of Light:But I will need your assistance for when that time comes.
Firion:That's what friends are for.
Mog:Kupo? Who are you? I sense the light within you...
"???:The light? What an odd thing to say. But, yes, I do consider myself one of the good guys."
"Yda:That voiceis that you, Papalymo!?"
"Papalymo:Yda! Oh, and Y'shtola is with you as well! I wondered where you went."
Shantotto:Dare I assume you know this monocled gent?
"Yda:Yes, he's my friend."
Papalymo:When did I ever say I was your friend!?
"Shantotto:Ohoho. Another guinea pig? How swell! ...I mean, am I correct to assume you have a knack for black magic as well?"
"Papalymo:Aye, I suppose you could say that. Perhaps not quite the aptitude that you have, though."
"Yda:Papalymo's a true master of thaumaturgy! If only he weren't so serious all the time... So, were you surveying the area of simply lost?"
"Papalymo:Me? Lost? Is that a jibe, my dear Yda? I was merely searching for you all."
"Yda:Come now, there's no shame in getting lost."
Papalymo:What are you insinuating!
"Mog:Please, stop fighting, kupo! We need to get along if we're going to be working together."
"Papalymo:""We,"" you say? I am truly sorry, but I'm afraid I have no intention of going with you."
Papalymo:All I wished to do was verify that Yda and Y'shtola were safe. Now if you would excuse me.
Yda:This again? I don't see why he couldn't just admit he was lost.
Sazh:Just gonna let him go like that?
Y'shtola:You needn't worry. This always happens.
Sazh:I don't think we can afford to bicker right now...
"Yda:Wait, is that the exit?"
"Mog:Looking at the map, we just need to take this passage outside. Then, we loop back inside the tower once more after that, kupo."
Rem:Just when I thought we were almost there...
Onion Knight:Don't you love it when you get your hopes up only for them to be crushed moments later?
Bartz:Hang on. We've been climbing this tower for a while now.
Bartz:Which means if we go outside...and look down...
"Yang:Ah, afraid of heights, are we?"
Yang:We monks often meditate before training on high mountains.
Bartz:Does that actually help!?
"Yang:It gives us the fear we need to survive. For when you fall off a cliff, it won't matter how much you've trained your body."
"Yda:I'm afraid that won't be of any use to you, then."
"Rem:We'll be fine as long as we're careful...right, everyone?"
"Onion Knight:Look how much room we have to walk. As long as nothing catastrophic happens, we should be fine."
"Mog:We're almost back inside the tower, kupo!"
Warrior of Light:I can feel it... He's here.
"Garland:With each battle fought, the chaos continues to grow."
Lightning:I've got you now.
Garland:Bwahaha! Back for more? I see you have the same love for combat as I.
"Lightning:Enough with the games. You were using me back there, weren't you?"
Lightning:The distortion at the volcanoit got bigger the more we fought.
"Garland:I'm impressed. But if you figured out that much, why did you come after me?"
Lightning:To defeat you and cleave a path for the others.
Garland:A futile gesture.
Garland:But I admire your eagerness to die.
Papalymo:Ugh. Yda knows physical labor isn't my forte.
"Yda:Papalymo, are you okay!?"
Papalymo:What took you so long!
"Yda:I know. I'm sorry. I'm really glad you're all right, though."
"Papalymo:Of course I'm all right. Now, don't just stand there. We have business to take care of."
Yda:Right behind you!
"Rem:Wow, they make a really good team."
"Y'shtola:They do, don't they?"
Penelo:But how did you know they would make up so quickly?
Y'shtola:I was not exaggerating when I said this always happens.
"Papalymo:So, could I ask you all to lend us a hand as well? It seems we've been surrounded by monsters."
Vaan:Don't think you could've said that a little sooner?
Papalymo:There's no rush. They shan't strike just yet.
Rem:How can you be so sure?
"Papalymo:Because I used my magicks to detain them. ...Regrettably soon to wear off, however."
"Vaan:So we still have some time, huh?"
"Papalymo:Precisely. Now, take the lead. I'll cover you."
Penelo:I wasn't expecting you to be this fired up for battle.
"Papalymo:I take no pleasure in combat, but I also do not take threats lightly. Now, come."
Yda:Let's do this!
Y'shtola:It appears fighting is inevitable.
"Vaan:Heh, I'm sure glad the Scions of the Seventh Dawn are on our side."
"Yda:I'm sorry for teasing you earlier, Papalymo."
Papalymo:Never mind it. Hardly the first time this has happened.
"Yda:But this is your fault too, you know? You should have just"
"Papalymo:Yes, yes, Yda. I know."
"Papalymo:Regardless, I should be thanking you for coming to my rescue."
"Rem:Wow, one minute they're fighting and now they're best friends again?"
Papalymo:Do not be ridiculous. We weren't fighting. Fighting is something you can only do with your equals.
"Yda:What are you trying to say!? Just because I'm younger than you, you think"
"Rem:You two really get along, don't you?"
Papalymo:I wouldn't necessarily say that.
"Papalymo:Rather, we trust each other. Yda is a dear partner to me."
Rem:I can see that.
"Y'shtola:Papalymo, I daresay this tower would be arduous to investigate alone."
"Sazh:She's right. I mean, I admit things aren't easy for us, but I think we could really help each other out."
"Papalymo:Very well. After all, we share a common goal. I confess the persistent monsters concern me as well."
"Papalymo:Besides, who would keep Yda in line if not me?"
Papalymo:I shall just have to join you.
"Yda:Oh, if you think I'm bad, wait until you meet the others!"
Papalymo:So you admit you're the problem!
Rem:I feel like I can watch them all day and never stop smiling.
"Mog:A new friend always makes me smile, too! Soon enough, we're going to be unstoppable, kupo!"
Papalymo:Agreed. But it is not solely unique to this area. The world is filled with aether like this.
Papalymo:Do you think it could have something to do with the Torsions?
"Yda:Come to think of it, don't the Torsions connect this world with our own?"
Y'shtola:I suspect the aether from the outside worlds flows continuously into this one.
"Y'shtola:With no outlet, however, the aether dispersed accumulates here."
Papalymo:...Thus preventing new life from being created on our planets.
"Yda:Ahhh, no wonder it's so unpleasant here."
Y'shtola:Aether is the lifeblood of the planetthe source of all living things.
"Y'shtola:If it continues to accumulate, then before long this world shall cease to exist."
"Papalymo:And it gets worse, I'm afraid. What happens once the aether on our planet ends up depleted?"
"Y'shtola:Our home will no longer be able to produce life, reducing it to a desolate wasteland..."
Yda:We have to do something!
Papalymo:The only thing we can do right now is shut the Torsions.
"Y'shtola:It appears so. Come, we must hurry."
Hope:Light!
Lightning:Hope? I'm sorry... I couldn't defeat him.
Garland:You were foolish to ever believe you could.
Garland:...For I cannot die. I shall live on in this world for an eternity.
Warrior of Light:I remember those words.
Cloud:Do you seriously believe him?
"Cloud:He's claiming he's immortal, you know?"
Garland:Draw your sword and find out for yourself if you don't believe me.
"Garland:However, know you shall die and forever become one with the chaos!"
"Garland:Hmph... Bearers of the feeble light, you cannot stop the carnage from spreading."
"Garland:You fared better than I thought you would, but you are no match for me."
Cecil:It's not over yet!
Mog:K-kupo! The Torsion's going critical!
"Shantotto:The Torsion has reached a critical state, you say? Fascinating! This must be my lucky day."
"Warrior of Light:Garland, what have you done!?"
Garland:Nothing. This is how this world operates.
Cecil:Get ready!
"Mog:Th-this is gonna be a tough one, kupo! But it's now or never!"
Cecil:We did it...
Cyan:L-look up! A fleet of airships is heading this way!
Cecil:They're firing on us! This tower could collapse at any moment!
Lightning:...! Was it all for nothing?
"Sazh:I wouldn't lose hope just yet, Lightning!"
"Mog:Hurray! It's our ship, kupo!"
"Papalymo:Let us bid this tower farewell, shall we?"
"Onion Knight:Lightning, was it? Hope's friend?"
Onion Knight:You're coming with us. Not like the others in the ship would have it any other way.
"Onion Knight:That's okay with you, right?"
Mog:You know it! Lightning also possesses the
Cecil:We must hurry to our ship! That's our only chance to escape!
Mog:You don't have to tell me twice! Kupooo!
"Onion Knight:Lightning, you seem to know a lot more about this world than we do."
Lightning:Not as much as your moogle.
Onion Knight:That's fine. We could still really use your help.
"Onion Knight:We're planning on meeting the ""goddess"" he serves."
Lightning:All right...I'm in.
Materia:The squadron that attacked them must have been sent by Spiritus.
"Materia:But why would Spiritus, a god himself, try to spread chaos throughout this world?"
Materia:That is not what bothers me most though.
Materia:Some of my warriors are growing suspicious of Mog.
"Materia:But as a goddess, I cannot strip them of their spirit of inquiryfor that is what makes them human."
Materia:The warrior in charge of Spiritus's squadron seems to have a good heart.
Materia:Perhaps their encounter can lead this world to salvation.
Spiritus:The time is near.
Spiritus:The rebel army has started to take action as well.
"Spiritus:Come forth, those who are not bound by the trivial laws held by Materia or that moogle."
Spiritus:Bring to this world the chaos you so desire.
Spiritus:All that is left is to wait for it to be freed from its shackles.
"Spiritus:Then, I shall rebuild this shattered world and establish equilibrium."
Lightning:...! Was it all for nothing?
"Sazh:I wouldn't lose hope just yet, Lightning!"
"Mog:Hurray! It's our ship, kupo!"
"Papalymo:Let us bid this tower farewell, shall we?"
"Onion Knight:Lightning, was it? Hope's friend?"
Onion Knight:You're coming with us. Not like the others in the ship would have it any other way.
"Onion Knight:That's okay with you, right?"
Mog:You know it! Lightning also possesses the
Cecil:We must hurry to our ship! That's our only chance to escape!
Mog:You don't have to tell me twice! Kupooo!
Warrior of Light:Is everyone safely aboard?
"Mog:We're all here, kupo! Our new friends, too!"
"Lightning:So you're the moogle the Returners spoke of, going around closing Torsions."
Firion:Returners...? You know of the resistance?
Lightning:I met their leader soon after arriving in this world. He gave me the gist of what's going on...
Lightning:But the folks I know are with you. I'm not part of any resistance.
"Mog:You're one of us now, kupo!"
Lightning:I'm not one of yours either. I fight on my own terms.
"Sazh:Hey, guys? I got some bad news! We're stuck..."
Sazh:These airships've got us surrounded!
Cecil:That fleet is from my world... TheRed WingsofBaron...
"Edge:Whoa, whoa, whoa! I thought you're in charge of the Red Wings!"
Cecil:I was...driven out from my country.
Cecil:The Red Wings current commander is Golbez...a ruthless scoundrel.
Firion:Airborne fiends coming at us!
Warrior of Light:We will be going down ship and all if we do not break through the enemy formation...!
"Lightning:You... Cecil, was it? You were their former commander? Can you point out the flagship?"
Cecil:Naturally. Of course... We need only take out the command ship!
"Firion:Alright, we know what we need to do. Cecil, give Sazh our course!"
Cecil:Roger. We'll head for the center of the fleet as we deal with these monsters!
Kuja:I hope you realize knocking them out of the sky won't be the end of that lot.
"Kuja:Have a look, Golbez. They're headed straight for this airship."
Golbez:...Kuja. Met you a knight called Cecil traveling with the moogle and his band?
"Kuja:Ah, yes, the fellow employing the powers of darkness. An acquaintance of yours?"
Golbez:Darkness...? I see... So the Torsions do bend time as they call us here.
"Kuja:More than an acquaintance, hm?"
Kuja:...I've left one of my toys in their way. It should buy you some time.
"Kuja:If you need to put your feelings in order, I suggest you do it sooner than later."
Cecil:I've given Sazh our course. Let us prepare for aerial combat.
"Lightning:You sound none too happy. I guess those were your ships, after all."
Cecil:No... I'd rather them scuttled than in the clutches of evil.
Steiner:It is not only exile that drives your unrelenting sense of guilt...
Steiner:...To have to bear witness to your former honor used for villainy...
Warrior of Light:Might not someone from a world other than your own be in control of those airships?
"Cecil:There are only so many capable of commanding them. Others may be with him, but..."
Cecil:I'm certain Golbez is aboard the flagship.
Warrior of Light:Have you any insight as to his motives in this world?
Cecil:I...do not. All I know is that he...sows chaos merely in pursuit of power.
"Lightning:At the very least, it doesn't seem he wants to be our friend."
"Steiner:While it must be hard for you, let us together see that justice is served!"
Cecil:Thank you. I know I can fight with you at my side.
Zidane:A Black Waltz!? That's one of Kuja's goons!
"Vivi:He can use magic like me...! Be careful, everyone!"
Vivi:That was one of the Black Waltzes... They work for Kuja back home...
Eiko:I thought the airships' boss was Cecil's baddie! What's Kuja doing here!?
"Mog:The enemy must be working together, too, kupo..."
Cecil:Golbez...working with Kuja?
Vincent:He's using the Torsions to try and alter his destiny...
Vivi:That's right. ...Do you know him?
Vincent:...I have met him. When I was with Kefka...
"Cecil:If they are working together, what could they possibly be after...?"
"Cecil:Kuja wants to twist fate, and Kefka wants to destroy the world... But what about Golbez?"
Vincent:...Go find out for yourself.
"Eiko:Ouch! If you don't know, say so! You're just...making me worried, too..."
Yuffie:Would you guys listen to this!? Bartz is being a total jerk!
Yuffie:He's making fun of me for getting airsick!
Yuffie:Even though that wuss can't fight in high places without wetting himself! ...Urp.
"Bartz:I just don't like heights! Don't put me in the same group as you! Cecil, help me out here!"
Cecil:Eh? I thought you've both fought admirab
Bartz:Ack! Don't make me look up!
Vivi:Umm... I guess we can leave them be.
Vincent:...They're fine.
Cecil:I have friends now who are cheerful no matter the situation.
Cecil:Perhaps I will be rid of this uncertainty once I confront Golbez...!
"Kuja:The enemy is boarding. How do you plan to engage them, Commander?"
"Kefka:Heh heh heh. The only way is the personal way, of course."
Kuja:I wouldn't expect the commander to lend an ear to your buffoonery.
Kefka:That dark knight has nooo idea who you are or what he's walking into.
"Kefka:Clueless...like, totally unaware about that blood you share!"
Kuja:...Don't tell me that's why you're so interested in Cecil.
Kefka:It is! Today's main dish is a battle between brothers! Just how much does the younger hate the elder?
Kuja:So that's the sort of plot you enjoy? You truly are tasteless.
"Kuja:You needn't listen to this clown. You have your own plan, I trust."
Golbez:I do... And I will carry it out even if the light illuminating my brother's path is dimmer than moonlight.
Kefka:Hee hee hee... How touching. I think I might cry.
"Kefka:Two lights coming together, and the world crumbles beneath them!"
Kuja:...Are you going to play his game? Golbez... You can yet...
Golbez:What is necessary now is battle. Of that I am sure.
Kuja:Very well. I can respect that.
"Kuja:...But in that case, why don't you leave it to me?"
Kuja:You've yet to meet in this world. All the more reason to not take part in the clown's trashy melodrama.
"Golbez:Kuja, you..."
"Kuja:Please, allow me to let you watch the knight's reaction from the mezzanine."
Kuja:At last the dark knight enters the stage.
Kuja:Heh. Past me awaits your dear Golbez.
"Kuja:Just how will the curtain fall on you two, I wonder."
Cecil:Golbez!
"Golbez:...Even as a dark knight, the light is with you in this world..."
Kuja:Heh... The light within the dark... Perhaps you have the same potential as me.
Cecil:What are you talking about!? What is it you're after...?
Mog:Kupo! Uh-oh!
Kuja:And now the clown's melodrama is no more. Your fraternal problems...will be resolved.
"Sazh:Hey, you guys better get in here! Our engine's shot!"
"Golbez:Cecil! I expect light the next time we meet... Until then, your will is your own!"
Cecil:What's this all of a sudden? Why would I listen to your
Lightning:Cecil! Forget about it!
Layle:Let me handle this! Come on now!
"Mog:Hurry to safety, kupo!"
Sazh:Mog! I'm putting us down on that floating continent!
"Mog:Roger, kupo! Everyone get ready for a rough landing, kupo!"
???:Now then... Might the sleeping beauty be awake already?
Cecil:Unh... Who're you...?
Lightning:A line like that...has to be Edgar.
Edgar:The moogle and his merry band. At last we meet.
Warrior of Light:Then you are the leader of Layle and Firion's Returners...
Layle:Were you tending to us? Nice way to steal the show.
Edgar:It's all of your information that brought me here. Thanks for your hard work.
Cecil:What about the airship? Is it a wreck?
"Edgar:Not to worry. Despite appearances, I have a knack for the mechanical."
"Mog:You were fixing the goddess's airship, kupo?"
"Edgar:The Goddess Materia, eh? So I have her imagination to thank for that being a serviceable product."
"Edgar:At any rate, it'll be a bit longer until it's up and running."
Edgar:How about closing up the local Torsion in the meantime?
"Lightning:While I don't like being told what to do, I don't have a reason to decline."
Cecil:Indeed... It seems there are monsters around.
"Warrior of Light:Edgar, once we have secured the area, I'd like to hear what you have to say."
"Edgar:Naturally. Warriors of and with the light, I trust you will return safely."
"Terra:Say, Shadow and you guys have been fighting at Edgar's direction, right?"
Shadow:The world matters not. I go where I'm paid to.
"Firion:I don't know about ""direction."" I was told to protect what needed protecting how I saw fit."
"Squall:...More or less the same here. I'd receive a commission, but the particulars were left up to me."
"Mog:How many are in the organization, kupo?"
Firion:No idea. Edgar never spoke of it.
Firion:But he seems to have been in contact with others beside us.
Balthier:A cautious fellow. Must be a thing among royalty.
"Balthier:Gods and moogles, otherworldly villains, and a maverick king... Who's up to the most no good?"
Terra:Edgar...is a friend.
"Terra:He's following the will of the light... Isn't that right, Mog?"
"Mog:You bet it is, kupo! If he's a friend of yours, he's a friend of ours, kupo!"
Balthier:A convenient way to wrap up the conversation if I've ever heard one.
"Mog:I wish you'd trust me a little more, kupo..."
"Onion Knight:...They looked creepy, but they weren't regular monsters, huh?"
"Lightning:...""Creepy"" as they are, they were once human."
Shantotto:Oh? You don't say. Was it by their own misdeeds they ended up that way?
Lightning:The opposite.
"Hope:In our world, there are...godlike beingsthat arbitrarily assign humans aFocus."
Hope:If you can't complete your Focus...even through no fault of your own...you become a Cie'th...
Onion Knight:Those gods sound awfully self-serving...not that our position is all that different right now.
"Lightning:Yeah. And because of that airship scuffle, my confrontation with this latest goddess has to wait."
"Shantotto:Since we've encountered that know-it-all king, you may get your wish sooner than later."
"Shantotto:With the added pawnser, knowledge at our disposal, I simply can't think of anything greater."
Zell:Here you guys are! We're moving out!
Papalymo:May I inquire as to your topic of discussion?
Onion Knight:We were talking about monsters. Just idle chatter.
"Shantotto:Yes, the creatures of far-flung realms was our subject matter."
"Zell:Huh, that sounds pretty fun! The two of you sure've got a lot of smarts packed into those tiny bodies."
"Shantotto:A smart aleck, eh? That's quite enough. Unless for some reason you want to play rough."
"Zell:N-no smart alecks here! J-just a happy, peaceful party ready to shake a leg!"
Penelo:Was that...gunfire just now?
Zidane:I wouldn't sweat it. Probably just Laguna goofing off.
Laguna:Now hold on a minute there! Even I know better than to do something dangerous like that!
"Cyan:Wast it thou, Sir Vincent?"
Vincent:...I'm not in the habit of drawing my weapon without an enemy around.
"Zidane:Hey, you think someone...might be shooting at us?"
Penelo:H-how are you so calm about it? Let's get out of here!
"Mog:But to where, kupo? We're in the middle of a field!"
"Laguna:Rule fifty-five! Every soldier knows, if you're targeted out in the open, face the enemy and charge!"
"Penelo:What!? You're joking, right!?"
"Cyan:Nay, with no place to flee, it is a plan befitting our situation."
"Vincent:Face the enemy, eh?"
Laguna:Somebody's gonna regret pointing a gun at yours truly!
Penelo:Ah! Guys!
"Mog:Wait for us, kupo!"
"???:...Hold on, now. Where have I seen that one before...?"
Zell:Stop! Cease! Hold your fire!
???:If it ain't Zell. What a surprise. I thought you looked familiar.
Zell:We should be the surprised ones...
Squall:Couldn't you tell it was us?
"Irvine:Ahh, sorry about that. I thought you were more of those rowdy, shiny fellas."
"Zell:Hah? You aren't calling me rowdy, are you?"
"Irvine:Not you. These shiny, kinda rocky guys were attacking me, so I got a little anxious is all."
"Steiner:Shiny, you say? Manikins, I wonder."
Squall:(He can't distinguish between his allies and a bunch of fakes...? Ugh.)
"Irvine:So, who's your company? 'Preciate if you could fill me in on the lay of the land, too."
"Zell:Sounds like a job for Know-It-All-Zell. Alright, Irvine, listen good..."
"Irvine:Huh, you don't say. Stumbling into a different world sure is something."
Firion:He's awfully cavalier about all this. I hope he doesn't slow us down...
"Mog:But he's full of the light, kupo! You'll come with us, won't you, kupo?"
Irvine:Sure. These Torsions sound like a walk in the park.
Irvine:Leave the sharpshooting to me. I'm counting on you for backup.
Squall:(...Same as ever.)
Zell:You're the same as ever!
"Firion:If you're Squall and Zell's comrade, you're welcome just the same, but...backup?"
Zell:Try to overlook his arrogance. That's just the way he is.
Irvine:Don't let it bother you and we'll get along just fine.
"Irvine:Now, if your fancy pantses'll excuse me."
Zell:Irvine! I'm begging ya! Try to catch a drift!
Steiner:...Hrm. It would seem the light chooses all kinds...
"Irvine:That's an older model of a Galbadian military-issue machine gun, isn't it? Slick."
"Laguna:Heh, don't you know it? I ain't sharing, though!"
Irvine:And you pack duel pistols? That takes skill.
King:...Two guns let me fire twice as many rounds. Simple math.
Irvine:No kidding. Can't argue with you there.
"Irvine:Your firearm is mighty cool, too. Let me give it a try sometime, won't you?"
"Vincent:...A nave aspiration... ...as you run from isolation, is it?"
Yang:Oh? What sort of gathering have we here?
Irvine:Just a little get together for gun nuts.
Zell:Happy as a lark... You sure now's the time for that?
"Irvine:We've got some big battles coming up, don't we? What's the harm in letting our hair down for a bit?"
"Irvine:Relax, I'll be ready when the time comes. You know what I can do."
"Zell:Yeah, I know exactly. You choke under pressure."
"Irvine:Aw, you don't have to bring that up."
Yang:Choke under pressure?
"Zell:He's got the chops, but when it's go time, he gets the jitters."
"Laguna:I know how you feel, man! I've got stage fright like you wouldn't believe!"
Zell:Why do you sound proud of it...?
Yang:That is a problem. All the moreso for a true warrior with the actual ability...
"Yang:Steel nerves require a steel body in which to rest! Come, we start our training immediately!"
"Zell:Oh, sweet! Count me in!"
"Laguna:Uh-oh, I don't like where this is headed, Irvine."
Irvine:I guess every world has its hot-blooded fellas.
King:......They sure talk a lot.
Vincent:Heh...... It's not a bad thing.
"Mog:Those buildings over there are our destination, kupo!"
"Cloud:Elements from our own worlds are incorporated into this one...or that's the story, at least."
"Firion:Wow, so you're from a city like that?"
"Firion:Back home, I had always planned to see the world...but I never imagined anything like this."
"Lightning:For me, it's like most of you climbed straight out of some fairy tale."
"Y'shtola:Hm, fantasies take all shapes, wouldn't you say?"
Warrior of Light:With the capability to construct cities like that...can there still be conflict among men?
Lightning:There are those who would conquer and exploit others wherever you go.
"Firion:Conquer, huh...?"
Y'shtola:...Did that touch a nerve?
Firion:Everyone seems to have some enemy like Garland or Sephiroth who's followed them here...
"Firion:I was just thinking mine'll inevitably show up, too."
Warrior of Light:What sort of opponent is this?
Firion:A man possessed by avarice who'll stop at nothing to conquer everything he can.
Cloud:Sounds like a winner.
"Firion:Yeah. If he does turn up here, we can't take him lightly."
"Mog:Talk like that and you'll jinx us, kupo! Let's keep a cautious move on, kupo."
"Mog:Kupo! This is gonna be a tough one, kupo!"
"Mog:It's blocking the way to those buildings where the Torsion is, kupo!"
"Zidane:I guess you'd call that a gate keeper... Watch out, you guys!"
Firion:There's a Torsion here...
???:Hmph. Can a group of worms ever amount to anything?
"The Emperor:Even here you bare your fangs at me, Firion."
The Emperor:But...what say the rest of you?
Tidus:What do you want?
The Emperor:Pledge your allegiance and I will allow you to serve as my underlings.
The Emperor:There are more than enough of you on your side. Why not apply your skills in my employ?
Warrior of Light:What would you hope to accomplish with us as your pawns?
The Emperor:We stand at the intersection connecting all worlds to each other...
The Emperor:I shall make this realm the fortress that opens the roads for my rule.
Penelo:Opens the roads? You don't mean the roads home...!?
Tidus:Somehow a deal with a high-and-mighty bozo doesn't sound like a very good deal.
Firion:It's not! Pay him no heed! This despot used fiends to bring the world under his control!
"Terra:If we don't do something, our worlds will share the same fate!"
The Emperor:Once every world belongs to me...imagine the benefits you stand to reap.
Terra:That does not sway me! Nor will I accept your rule!
"The Emperor:Foolish... But all together, you are not a monolith."
Warrior of Light:You mean to imply there are those among us who would heed your words?
The Emperor:Heh heh... I will be waiting at the Torsion.
"The Emperor:Do come see me, as you doubt your comrades' integrity along the way."
"Mog:Gone, kupo! ...It seems he went to the Torsion, kupo."
Firion:The coward fled!
Tidus:Relax. None of us are traitors.
"Mog:Probably... There are so many of us now, so we can't be sure, kupo..."
"Terra:Mog, why would you say that? You're the one who brought us together..."
"Firion:I trust everyone. Even if someone was thinking of switching sides, we can convince him otherwise!"
Warrior of Light:...Encouraging words. Let us take them to heart as we continue on.
"Papalymo:Lightning, why the long face? Is something on your mind?"
Lightning:...Nothing you need to worry about.
"Shantotto:Like it or not, our fates are intertwined. You could feign some civility when he's trying to be kind."
"Mog:Kupo!? Someone just screamed, kupo!"
Lightning:That voice! It can't be...!
Mog:Kupo! That girl's in trouble!
Serah:Sis!?
"Papalymo:""Sis""? Is that lass your kin?"
"Shantotto:Now that you mention it, the resemblance isn't thin."
"Lightning:Sit tight, Serah! I've got this!"
Papalymo:Here they come! On your guards!
Lightning:Are you alright?
Serah:...Those clothes... You're...the old you...
Wakka:Lightning's little sister? ...They're so different.
"Edge:Yeah, she's so sweet and innocent looking."
Lightning:Serah... Where did you learn to use that weapon?
"Serah:Um, I think... I'm probably from a different time than the me you know."
"Mog:Kupo! Not just a different time, kupo!"
Serah:What do you mean?
"Wakka:It's the Torsions' fault there's monsters everywhere. Worse'n monsters in grips, too."
Lightning:Don't worry. I'll make sure you're safe.
"Edge:Whoa, not just Lightning, you know? You can count on all of us!"
"Serah:Um, I'm glad and all, but I can fight, too..."
"Mog:Kupo! In that case, let's get a move on, kupo!"
Lightning:Put your weapons away. I'll keep you safe.
Serah:You're treating me like a kid!
Serah:Although...it does bring back memories. ...Back when I couldn't do anything.
"Vaan:Lightning, what's the matter? Are you tired?"
"Galuf:It's no wonder, trying to cover Serah in every battle."
Serah:That's why I said I can fight for myself! Would you listen to me?
"Lightning:No! I don't care how much you've grown. As long as I'm around, you don't need to fight!"
Galuf:......Such obstinate siblings.
"Galuf:Lightning, what reason do you have to stop your sister when she says she'll fight?"
Galuf:And don't tell me it's because of her age. We have geezers and babes alike on the lines here.
"Lightning:Serah's a civilian, not a warrior. Of course I can't let her go to battle."
"Yda:Not a warrior, huh...?"
"Yda:You know, I've thought about it before, but how do you separate the warriors from otherwise?"
"Vaan:That's stumped me, too. Me and Penelo're both just orphans who started using weapons as we traveled."
Galuf:Whether one has or hasn't the title or the training is merely superficial.
"Galuf:If one has the will and the spirit, then anyone can be a warrior. That's my philosophy."
Lightning:...What's your point?
Galuf:My point is your sister has those qualities.
"Serah:As long as you have this ""light,"" you can fight in this world, right?"
"Galuf:Mog, do you sense the light in Serah?"
"Mog:You bet, kupo! Dazzling light is positively pouring out of her, kupo!"
"Lightning:Stay out of this, moogle. Serah doesn't need to suffer any more than she already"
Serah:I can do it.
"Serah:Just like you've protected me, I can protect you, too."
"Serah:I've journeyed with that in mind. Not because anyone ordered me to, either."
Lightning:...You're always like this. You never listen to what I say...
"Vaan:Don't get so bent outta shape. If anyone gets into trouble, everyone'll help out like we've done this whole time so far."
"Serah:Thank you, Vaan. See, Sis?"
Lightning:...Do whatever you want.
Galuf:Ho ho ho! It's settled! And thus does a new warrior with the light join our ranks!
"The Emperor:To appear before me, I take it you have made up your minds."
Warrior of Light:There are none among us who would follow you. We have known that from the start.
The Emperor:Oh? ...Then let me ask you this.
The Emperor:Where is the purpose in repeatedly fighting meaningless battles as compelled by a pitiless god?
Cecil:You call all we have done so far meaningless?
"The Emperor:Claims to protect your homeworlds are, et cetera, et cetera... Worms' drivel in the end."
The Emperor:Shall I provide you with the evidence?
Galuf:And you're claiming you can give meaning to our battles?
"The Emperor:Precisely. Under my reign, you could personally witness your worlds being devoured."
Galuf:That's more like it.
"Galuf:When all is said and done, we have a duty to protect our worlds from tyrants like you."
"Cecil:Torsions aside, we cannot allow the evil before us to go unaddressed!"
Firion:Even in this world I've gathered allies. Friends who won't bow to your rule.
Firion:Your schemes end here!
The Emperor:Fools... Regret your decision as you fall!
The Emperor:Those who do not accept my rule are all worms... Begone!
The Emperor:I...? Defeated...? Unbelievable...
"The Emperor:...Is I suppose what you would like me to say, hm?"
"Firion:Everyone, keep at it! Don't let your guard down!"
The Emperor:I have had enough of you for now.
"Onion Knight:I don't know about you, but I don't think I could stand serving under a coward like him."
"Shantotto:I think I agree with you, my dear. Crass displays of might bore me to tears."
"Shadow:...For now, I'm on this side...and that makes you the enemy."
Firion:Everyone...thank you.
"The Emperor:Scramble as you try to flee, worms!"
Firion:Let's go!
"The Emperor:Take care of them for me, giant from another world!"
Serah:We closed the Torsion!
"Mog:I guess it belonged to that big guy, kupo."
Irvine:Huh. So this is what you all are about.
Edgar:Everyone alright? Give me a moment to bring her down.
Warrior of Light:Edgar... I have heard a lot about you. The king leading an independent team of warriors...
"Edgar:And you, one of the first-chosen ""warriors with the light,"" so to speak. Glad to finally meet you."
"Warrior of Light:Tell me, if you knew of our campaign, why did you not join us?"
"Lightning:Like me, he has little faith in those gods."
"Edgar:Lightning, you look lovely today. It's as though rose petals came fluttering in..."
"Lightning:...I've had little faith in him with that attitude, too."
Edgar:Color me shocked!
Edgar:...I jest. Let me tell you about the Returners...while that moogle isn't around.
"Edgar:I believe you've heard their names, but this world was created by two gods:"
Warrior of Light:The Goddess Materia... And the God Spiritus...
Edgar:Yes. Apparently these two are at odds with each other...
Edgar:Why was the world made? Why are the dimensions distorted? We have no answers to these basic issues.
Edgar:That's why I thought it necessary to have a group attached to neither of the gods.
Warrior of Light:Attached to neither... You were searching for the reason for these battles?
Warrior of Light:You sent several warriors to our side. That was also part of your investigation?
"Edgar:That was a little bit of my direction, a little bit of their own cognizance."
Edgar:Free will is what makes us human after all.
Lightning:So what made the king of info cast his own crown into the ring all of a sudden?
"Edgar:According to Layle, you've got a date with divinity."
Edgar:That's a party I'd like to crash. There's a thing or two I want to confirm.
Warrior of Light:Very well. I see no reason to deny your request. Although I do not know how Mog will react.
Lightning:He's already acknowledged Edgar has the light. I doubt he'd go back on that.
Edgar:There you have it. I look forward to working with you.
Warrior of Light:Let us together uncover the truth of this world...!
"Lightning:...Serah, are you sure you're alright?"
Serah:I said I'm fine. You saw what I could do with a bow.
"Sazh:Heheh, those're the kinda guts you'd expect outta Lightning's little sister."
Hope:You really are strong. What happened in the future...?
"Serah:I can't tell you, because that's what I've been fighting to protect."
Lightning:...You're different from the Serah I know. It's a little...hard to deal with.
"Serah:Haha... C'mon, I can't be a kid forever."
Lightning:Even I know that!
"Sazh:(Hey, Hope, did you see that? Lightning just got shut down.)"
Hope:(Wow... I think we found her one weak spot.)
Lightning:You two have something to say?
"Sazh:We were just admiring how good your sister's turned out. Right, Hope?"
"Hope:Huh? Uh, yeah! Right!"
"Serah:It's weird, though... I was hoping to introduce you to him."
Sazh:Get out! Your weapon's a moogle? What the heck is going on in the future!?
Hope:I had never seen a moogle before other than stuffed animals.
Serah:Right? That's why I wanted to give him a proper introduction...
"Serah:Just like Mog here, he's been a strong ally on my journey and taught me so much."
"Lightning:Maybe he was sealed away, so he can't let any secrets slip..."
Hope:Sealed by who? Our enemies? Or...
Lightning:I don't trust Mog. That's the kind of trick I'd expect him to pull.
"Sazh:Now, now. It could just be the rules're different here."
Sazh:Hypothesizing won't do ya any good.
Serah:That's right. Let's just concentrate on this world's struggle.
Serah:(I get to travel with the old Lightning and everyone else... I want to enjoy this while I can...)
Materia:Warriors... Why do you stand before me?
Edgar:You needn't look so serious. Who wouldn't want to catch a glimpse of a ravishing goddess?
"Ramza:Edgar, I do not believe we came here to make japes."
Edgar:...At ease. This is called proper etiquette.
Lightning:We've come to ask you some questions.
Lightning:What is this world? Why did you summon us?
Materia:This is a land of fantasy... A manufactured world.
Materia:It was meant to be a place of respite for warriors amidst their endless struggles. However...
Edgar:...The Torsions appeared and it became a place of something other than respite.
"Mog:That's why I'm helping the goddess by guiding you, kupo."
Materia:I am accountable here. I bear the responsibilities of a god...
"Materia:To protect this world, I need your strength."
"Edgar:And Mog's, too, it seems."
"Materia:Moogles are able to locate the Torsions. For that reason, I dispatched Mog."
"Lightning:How about we change the question. ...What is it that other god, Spiritus, is up to?"
"Lightning:Far from asking for aid, I get the impression everyone he summons is hellbent on destroying the world."
Materia:Spiritus's only recourse is power... He believes he can solve any problem with force.
Materia:The result of that line of thought are those warriors who so run counter to your beliefs.
Ramza:Did you not create this world together? Is cooperation out of the question?
Materia:Spiritus's methods will not save this world... I must protect...my world.
Lightning:Possessive much?
"Ramza:During our battles, we have noticed a feeling that our strength is being drained from us."
Ramza:Know you the cause of this?
"Materia:Alas, no... It may be the Torsions, or it may be something else. I cannot say."
"Edgar:Perhaps by the next time we meet, you might look into that for us. Then we'd be more eager to fight for you."
Lightning:Yeah. Someone who doesn't work herself doesn't really motivate me.
Materia:...Very well. Now go.
Materia:I also...will do what a god must.
"Faris:Same as ever, but...nary a soul in sight, eh?"
"Edgar:Amidst crumbling ruins we may be, but same as ever, your beauty is beyond compare."
"Faris:Ugh, foul. Shove off before I do it for you."
Setzer:You might as well ignore him. That's just the way he is.
Faris:Then direct it at Eiko. I'm sure she'd appreciate it.
"Edgar:...Eiko? How, uh...old were you again?"
Eiko:Already a fine lady of six!
Edgar:I'm afraid that's a bit too young...
Eiko:That's not fair! I told you to stop treating me like a kid!
Hope:...I guess he knows when to draw the line.
Setzer:Even kings have their boundaries.
"Setzer:But listen, kid. Don't you grow up like him. There's nothing but trouble in store for you."
Edgar:Excuse me? I've grown up just fine. Don't go putting strange ideas into impressionable young minds.
"Mog:Are we ready, kupo?"
"Mog:I've pinpointed the Torsion, so let's go, kupo!"
"Hope:Edgar, is it okay to keep going along with Mog like this?"
"Edgar:Not only is it okay, it's in our best interest."
"Edgar:Materia tried to hide it, but it's apparent she doesn't know much about Mog either."
Hope:Which means it's up to us to find out what he's up to?
"Setzer:At the very least, he's not lying when he says we can't use the airship."
"Setzer:I checked the engines and the instrumentation, and confirmed we can't approach the Torsion. As to why..."
Faris:What did Sazh and Balthier say?
"Setzer:I consulted with Cecil, too. Our worlds are different, but we all came to the same conclusion."
"Hope:Up till now, near the larger Torsions, we always run into someone new from another world..."
"Hope:I wonder if there'll be someone at this one, too."
Edgar:Let's hope for someone friendly.
Eiko:What're we waiting for? Mog's gonna leave us.
"Faris:Aye, let's get a move on. For now, we should keep pressing forward."
Edgar:Indeed. We can continue our conversation on the road.
"Raijin:Ah! We meet again, ya know!"
Squall:Seifer and the disciplinary committee... You're still around?
Fujin:STRANDED. QUANDARY.
"Seifer:You losers came to close the Torsion, didn't you?"
???:So these are the children guided by a moogle...?
Squall:The sorceress...Ultimecia!?
"Seifer:...And who let slip that name to you? Ahh, that moogle, I bet."
Squall:You don't remember!? What happened back in our world...? What you did...?
"Seifer:I fulfilled my dream, all on my own. I became the sorceress's knight!"
Ramza:Knight? Sorceress? ...What is this about?
"Raijin:In our world, these people called sorceresses have special powers, ya know?"
"Raijin:And Ultimecia is an outstanding sorceress! She granted Seifer some of that power, ya know?"
"Seifer:Relax, Fujin. These losers are too dumb to figure out what's going on anyway."
"Seifer:They have no idea what's happening in this world, or who that moogle is!"
Ramza:Are they our enemies or our allies?
"Squall:...Things are all screwed up. At the very least, we can't let Ultimecia get away."
"Ultimecia:...The Torsion beyond here belongs to me. If you would press on, do your best to overcome the obstacles before you."
Seifer:The sorceress doesn't need to dirty her hands with small fry like you.
"Squall:Seifer! Fujin, Raijin! Don't follow her! ...You've got to listen to me!"
"Mog:I think a fight's inevitable, kupo!"
"Ramza:If we are attacked, we'll do what we must. Someone please explain to me the circumstances afterward."
Seifer:No one'll be able to explain anything when I'm through with you!
Seifer:I've fulfilled my dream! I don't have to take anyone's crap!
"Ultimecia:...It is still not enough, yes?"
Mog:Kupo!? Wh-what do you mean!?
Ultimecia:When emotions are reft...faith betrayed... When anger and hate prevail...
Ultimecia:Man seeks greater power... And strife intensifies...
Fujin:SEIFER!
"Raijin:It's draggin' us in, ya know!"
Prishe:Hey! Wake up!
Squall:We're...still alive...
Yuna:Yes...everyone in our group is well. But...more importantly...
Prishe:Mog's gone. Not that he isn't usually a slippery sucker.
"Irvine:We all came tumbling down together, but no sign of Seifer and his pals, either."
"Warrior of Light:There seems to be a passageway at least. Before we explore that path, though..."
"Prishe:We thought you two could fill us in on this ""sorceress."""
Squall:...How much did you tell them?
Irvine:About as far as what you'd find in a garden's textbooks.
Warrior of Light:Rulers possessed of extreme power. Good and evil ones have existed throughout history. Protected by knights.
Irvine:...I wasn't sure how much you'd remember.
"Squall:If you know of Ultimecia, then our memories can't be too far apart."
"Irvine:No telling when we might've forgotten something, though."
Irvine:Psst... (It doesn't seem like Zell or Laguna remember anything.)
"Squall:I see... So we're at the mercy of faulty memories here, too..."
"Yuna:Even though you came from the same world, the memories you're missing aren't the same...?"
Prishe:First! Walk! Then while you're walking...talk!
Prishe:We're gonna starve to death if we keep standing around here!
"Squall:...Right. Maybe we'll find someone while we're walking, too."
"Irvine:Mog, Seifer, or Ultimecia..."
Irvine:...Which one's worse?
Laguna:This Ultimecia isn't the sorceress I know. Does it have something to do with the Torsions?
Lightning:You'd said even comrades from the same world could have varying gaps in their memories and knowledge.
"Squall:...Pure conjecture, but more or less."
"Squall:Your sister isn't the same as you remember, right?"
Serah:Yeah... I'm pretty sure I know about a lot more things that've happened than Lightning.
Cecil:Apparently I've lost something as well... This darkness...seems not to be my true self.
"Zell:Y'know...if you say ""sorceress,"" a different name pops up for me, too."
"Squall:(...About the same as Seifer, I wonder.)"
Squall:How much do you remember?
"Zell:Shoot... That's about it. I feel like a lot more went down, but it's all a jumble..."
Laguna:Now I get it... I'm completely lost!
Squall:Ultimecia is dangerous. That's all you need to remember.
"Zell:""That's all...""? Don't be a heartless jerk!"
Zell:Tell me what I forgot! I already told you what I remember!
Cecil:I know the unease you feel. But...surely these memories must be things you need to recall on your own.
Lightning:That your way of telling me to accept my cluelessness about why Serahan ordinary citizenis armed for combat?
Serah:...There are some things you're not supposed to know.
"Serah:If time and space are warped, I'll have to straighten it out..."
"Zell:...Hrrrm, fine. I'll try to remember myself."
"Laguna:I guess I'll do the same. The name might be different, but a bad sorceress never gave me any good memories."
Squall:(Zell is one thing...but what happens if Laguna remembers?)
"Squall:(Would he age on the spot to match what was missing? Would everyone else, for that matter?)"
"Squall:...No point in dwelling on it, I guess."
"Raijin:This is hopeless, ya know... I've got nowhere to go, ya know?"
Squall:They abandoned you?
"Raijin:We just got separated, ya know!"
"Zell:And no one came to look for you? Lost, all on your own..."
"Raijin:The members of the disciplinary committee are self-reliant, ya know! I'll find my way out of here, ya know?"
"Cecil:From when we met before, too...I feel you are easier to talk with. Can you tell us about Seifer and the sorceress?"
"Raijin:No can do, ya know?"
"Raijin:...If I ain't with him, Seifer might be all on his own, ya know?"
Yang:Your friendship is moving...but you must not let it mislead you.
"Raijin:I ain't being mislead, ya know! If I defeat you guys, maybe it'll make Seifer's work a little easier, ya know?"
Squall:You want a fight?
Zell:Of course it would end up this way... I never did get along with the disciplinary committee!
"Raijin:Aw, crud! I'm outmatched, ya know!"
Squall:...We've got this.
"Raijin:Y-you saved me, ya know?"
Squall:Sorry to bother you.
Tifa:Don't be a bully. He obviously needs our help.
"Raijin:Man... Seifer's been acting weird ever since he met the sorceress, ya know?"
"Raijin:I mean, he's always had a temper, but it's worse now, ya know?"
Squall:(Even without remembering what went down back home...he's still concerned for his friend.)
"Squall:The three of you don't seem to remember, but things'll get way worse if you leave them as they are."
"Raijin:Seriously? And he was so happy to become a knight, ya know?"
Firion:Could his happiness then not be his own...but a product of brainwashing?
"Squall:It was when it happened in our world, so I wouldn't rule it out here."
"Raijin:I gotta do something, ya know! This is no time for getting lost, ya know!"
"Raijin:If you know the way out of here, let me join ya, ya know?"
Tifa:Are you sure? I doubt Seifer would let that slide.
"Raijin:I'll talk to him when we find him, ya know?"
"Firion:Then let's go. If it's something we can talk out, that will be the best course of action."
Squall:(Seifer's gonna be pissed.)
"Squall:That willingness to butt heads...is what makes you friends, huh?"
"Raijin:I owe ya one, ya know!"
"Mog:Kupo... Looks like I got separated, kupo."
"Mog:Should I try to go back to the airship, kupo? Or maybe call everyone to me with their dimensional coordinates...?"
Seifer:Oh...it's just you.
"Mog:I could say the same; where're your lackeys, kupo?"
Seifer:The sorceress wants answers. Answers you've got.
Seifer:This is a perfect opportunity to get them.
"Mog:Kupo!? I don't support violence, kupo!"
"Seifer:If you don't want me to slice that fuzzy body up bit by bit from the top down, you'd better start talking."
"Mog:There's nothing to tell, kupo! I'm just Mog, kupo..."
Seifer:Shut up. Just answer my questions.
Seifer:What are you really after by gathering warriors from other worlds?
"Mog:Nothing, honest! Same as always, kupo! We're just closing Torsions to save the world, kupo..."
Seifer:The sorceress said she might be willing to help depending on your answer.
Mog:Does that mean you and Ultimecia...you're Spiritus's warriors?
Seifer:Spiritus...that's one of the gods Ultimecia said made this world. You working for him?
"Mog:...He's on bad terms with Materia, the goddess who summoned the warriors in my party, so I had to keep quiet, kupo."
"Mog:He believes it's those with power who'll save this world, kupo!"
"Seifer:Those with power... And I'm one of those, right?"
"Mog:You bet, kupo! You're a hero!"
"Mog:Take me to Ultimecia; then I'll explain everything, kupo!"
Seifer:...Hmph. Done.
"Mog:Now that that's settled, let's hurry, kupo! The exit should be that-a-way, kupo!"
Terra:It looks like there's a way out up ahead.
"Warrior of Light:We have yet to reconnect with Mog, though..."
Edgar:You needn't worry about that.
Edgar:He summons us out of the airship and conveniently detects Torsions on an everyday basis. You think he'd be lost?
Cloud:...Not likely. He's probably off somewhere else up to no good.
"Terra:...I guess no one has any faith left in Mog, do they?"
"Edgar:All we know is that he hasn't been honest with us. ...Don't look so glum, now."
"Squall:Having a ""will of light"" has nothing to do with powers of good..."
"Edgar:Precisely. The power we exercise in this world is ""willpower"" and nothing more."
"Cloud:Your enemy Kefka and mine, Sephiroth, have that exact same power..."
"Warrior of Light:Additionally, when our powers of will are in opposition with those adversaries, some part of it vanishes."
"Edgar:Vanishes to where, not even the gods know. As to whether Mog knows, though..."
Squall:...Sounds as though you're looking into the matter.
"Edgar:Yes, I'd like to think it's going well, but...you could say it's ""in god's hands."""
Terra:Did the sorceress... Did Ultimecia destroy your world like Kefka did ours?
"Squall:""Destroy""...isn't exactly the right word for it..."
"Squall:I'm pretty sure she can't accomplish what she wants if she's not in our world, though."
Warrior of Light:...Which is to say we know not what she may be after here.
Squall:(We defeated her once... Is she...out for revenge...?)
Squall:(No...she wouldn't stoop to something so petty...would she?)
Ultimecia:I am alive here...
Ultimecia:I will not let you forget it...
Cloud:...Looks like you're short a knight.
Squall:That doesn't make things better.
Ultimecia:Now then... Let us alert those sleeping in their cradles of the time to awaken.
Ultimecia:Show me that same power you displayed when fighting my knight.
Ultimecia:Well... A fine display... And yet...something is lacking...
Ultimecia:Yes... The one who would connect us is absent.
"Squall:(""Connect""? That's not an ability in this world, is it?)"
Ultimecia:However...the time draws near... The time...of awakening...
Ultimecia:Until we meet again...on the day of fate.
Squall:Those words... I don't want to hear that from you!
Faris:Come off it! You needn't pursue the matter.
Onion Knight:...That's it!
"Onion Knight:Vincent! We can open Torsions, too, right?"
Vincent:...We'll give chase.
Balthier:You think it's as simple as opening a Torsion on her doorstep?
"Vincent:Perhaps, if someone sufficiently associated does it..."
Squall:Tell me how. ...I'll open it.
Onion Knight:You did it... ...Looks like we can enter.
Squall:Let's hurry.
"Balthier:Awfully agitated, aren't we?"
Squall:She isn't someone you can afford to be dispassionate about. ...I'm sure you've got your own opponent like that.
"Onion Knight:Let's go, guys."
King:I distinctly recall Mog saying Kefka and Seymour were summoned by a god called Spiritus.
"Lightning:To hear Materia tell it, you won't see any cooperation between those gods."
"Shantotto:Honestly, what obstinate clods."
"Squall:(Did Spiritus summon Ultimecia, too? And for that matter...what about Seifer?)"
"Tidus:Whoa, has someone got a grumpy face or what?"
Vaan:Something on your mind?
Squall:...Spiritus and those others from my world.
Squall:Ultimecia is a sorceress possessed by hate.
"Squall:She keeps up a cool demeanor, but there's no telling what she'll try to pull or when."
King:...She must've done something awful heinous to get you this worked up.
Squall:She did. Which is why I can't understand why Spiritus would summon someone like that.
Lightning:We only know about Spiritus from second-hand accounts.
Lightning:Who knows what his true intentions are?
Tidus:So Mog and Materia both could be lying? I can't tell who to trust anymore.
Squall:Can you trust Seymour?
Tidus:Not a chance!
King:Then you've got no reason to trust the god who summoned him.
Vaan:What if everything Mog's told us is a lie and he's on Spiritus's side!
Shantotto:Or he's opposed to both the gods and we're just along for the ride.
Lightning:There's no bottom to this rabbit hole once we start.
Squall:Let's focus on tracking down Ultimecia for now.
Mog:Kupo!
"Mog:What a save, kupo! You really are strong!"
"Seifer:I did it to fulfill the sorceress's wishes, not save your sorry butt."
"Mog:Spoken like a true knight, kupo!"
Seifer:...Hmph. So? Which way's the exit?
"Mog:That way, kupo."
"Mog:Once we get out of these caverns, Ultimecia is undoubtedly waiting to greet you, kupo!"
"Seifer:...You're able to tell where other people are, aren't you?"
"Mog:Just a little...kupo. If someone is deliberately hiding their will, I won't be able to find them, kupo."
Seifer:Fujin and Raijin... Where are my people?
"Mog:Kupo kupo... It seems like they're in here, but the layout is too complicated to tell precisely, kupo."
"Mog:Are you worried about them, kupo?"
Seifer:Hardly. They know what I want them to do without me having to give every single order.
Seifer:So I'm better off dragging your sorry butt to the sorceress ASAP.
"Mog:Kupo! Roger that, kupo!"
Zell:Is this about whee we started?
Squall:...No sign of Ultimecia.
"Bartz:Squall's Torsion didn't do the trick, huh?"
"Zidane:It's good to know we can use 'em, but...I guess we haven't quite got the hang of 'em yet."
Laguna:Don't let it get you down. Things aren't all bad!
"Squall:(You can't be that calm when it comes to a sorceress either, can you...?)"
Squall:(...Or is that supposed to be your way of expressing sympathy?)
Vaan:Someone's shut up in his thoughts again.
Bartz:You won't find what you're looking for just by thinking about it.
Zidane:Might as well start off by heading someplace more open. Like over there.
Squall:Right... No point in standing around.
"Zell:Hey, Laguna... You know..."
Laguna:Hm? What's up?
Zell:Aren't you nervous?
"Zell:We came here from the same world, but our memories are completely different from the others."
Zell:I feel like...I've been left behind.
Laguna:Hmmm... That is a tough one. Real delicate problem you've got there.
"Zell:I'm positive I was friends with Squall and Irvine, but it's a complete blank when it comes to Ultimecia."
"Laguna:Me, too. I don't know a thing about that sorceress, and none of you guys ring a bell, but you still feel kinda familiar."
"Laguna:But it's not like I ever felt scared or worried or thought, ""Don't leave me behind!"""
"Laguna:So treasure that. The older you get, the fainter your memories'll become."
"Laguna:Then when you look back, you'll think, ""Boy, am I glad I faced my problems head on!"""
"Zell:Head on, huh? Figure I'll get my memories back that way?"
"Laguna:Keep thinking like that, and you'll feel even gladder while you do it!"
Vaan:What're you chatting about? The others already went ahead.
Zell:My bad! We'll be right there!
"Raijin:Wow! A real knight and a real wizard, ya know!"
Steiner:What's this? Are Master Vivi and I that peculiar?
"Vivi:There are lots of different kinds of worlds, huh?"
Yuffie:I have a hunch your world is probably a lot like mine.
"Yuffie:I'm a ninja, too, but I've only seen ones in a ridiculous getup like Edge's in picture books."
Edge:Hey! You got some nerve saying that in front of a manly specimen of a prince like me!
"Yuffie:Ha ha! You're as square as they come! You wanna see a stylish ninja, you're lookin' at her!"
"Raijin:I've only ever read about ninja in books, ya know? I'm so lucky to meet you guys, ya know?"
Yuffie:What about your partner? Doesn't she use shuriken?
"Raijin:She can't ""ninja-vanish!"" or anything like Edge does, ya know? I thought that only happened in fairy tales, ya know?"
"Bartz:You really like books, huh?"
"Raijin:I borrow 'em from the library, ya know! Except I forget to return them while I'm hanging out with Seifer, ya know?"
"Yuffie:Hey, I don't suppose you picked up that way you talk from books, too, huh?"
"Raijin:I was already talking like this by the time I noticed it, ya know?"
"Edge:Fujin's got a funny way of expressing herself, too... A looker like her, it's a shame she doesn't talk more."
"Raijin:She can't stand chatter, ya know? Plus, you try anything she doesn't like, she'll give you a good boot, ya know?"
Bartz:She'll kick you? I thought she uses ranged attacks!
"Raijin:It friggin' hurts, too, so you better watch yourself, ya know!"
Steiner:Now I understand. The disciplinary committee is responsible for upholding youthful morals...
Steiner:Truly commendable!
"Raijin:It's hard work, ya know? We have to crack down on little kids like Vivi even, ya know?"
"Yuffie:I think it suits you. Though you come after me, I'd just run away."
"Steiner:Indeed! From your dress to your speech, your very character says you'd let no injustice escape your grasp!"
"Raijin:Talking about it makes me miss the good ol' days, ya know?"
"Raijin:...I hope the three of us can go back to the way things were, ya know."
"Mog:Our escape is a success, kupo!"
Seifer:Don't even think of running.
"Mog:Of course not, kupo! So, where's your sorceress?"
Seifer:...I was only ordered to drag the info out of you.
Seifer:You're the one who said she'd be waiting to greet me.
"Mog:Kupo! ""Undoubtedly,"" I said, kupo!"
"Mog:I thought if you're really a knight par excellence, she'll heap praise on you for catching me, kupo!"
Seifer:You trying to start something?
"Mog:Kupo kupo! Not at all, kupo!"
"Mog:What if she's fighting with my warriors, kupo?"
Seifer:If she's tied up with Squall...
Seifer:I have to go protect her!
"Mog:If it's warriors you want, I can lead you to them, kupo! Come on!"
"Irvine:Hey, now. Isn't that...?"
Zidane:It's the better third of Seifer's gang!
"Raijin:...Something about the way you say that don't sit right, ya know?"
Squall:Looks like you got separated.
Fujin:RAIJIN? WHY?
"Raijin:It's just like you thought; Ultimecia is big trouble, ya know!"
"Zidane:So we're all going to go convince Seifer to give it up. If you want to come, I'd be happy to escort you along the way."
Fujin:...CONFUSED. NEED TIME.
Cyan:Sir Zidane!
"Zidane:Yeah, I know. Everyone ready to protect the lady?"
Squall:Would you call Fujin a lady?
"Irvine:Let's just worry about the monsters first, 'kay?"
Squall:...Fujin. We can tell you're worried about Seifer.
Fujin:DISTRUST. BEWITCHED.
Zidane:Your concerns are spot on. Seifer's gonna go on a rampage if we don't help him...
"Zidane:Right, Squall?"
Squall:(He never talks that nicely to guys.)
"Raijin:You and I gotta do something, and soon, ya know? He ain't gonna listen to Squall, ya know."
Layle:Then we're all on the same page.
"Layle:Doubtless you'd be better off traveling with us than fighting off monsters on your own, too."
"Raijin:I'm beggin' ya, too; I can't just leave ya out here, ya know!"
"Raijin:He might say that, but so what, ya know! Actually, I know he'll say it, ya know!"
"Raijin:But... We just gotta do this, ya know?"
Fujin:...You're right... He's an...important part of our posse...
Zidane:Oh? I didn't think she could talk normally...
"Squall:...Once in a blue moon, it seems."
"Layle:Perfect, so you're in? You'll provide better ammunition talking to him than any of us."
Fujin:MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL. IN.
Zidane:What the? She's back to normal.
Squall:That's her default setting for anyone but her friends. ...She's not a bad person deep down.
"Zidane:I can tell! She's a babe, too!"
???:...Who have we here?
"Balthier:Oh, please...you can't be serious."
Vaan:Vayne!? From the empire!?
Cloud:Someone from your world?
Ramza:That would mean your Ivalice.
Penelo:He was...but...
"Balthier:From the looks of it, he's lost in a strange world, and having a hard time of it to boot."
"Vayne:,,,I have been generally apprised of my circumstances. Oddly enough, from one claiming to be ""emperor."""
Vayne:Summoned by a god...to do battle for the sake of this world.
"Vayne:As though his outrageous tale weren't enough, he would that I submit to his authority. Naturally, I refused."
Cloud:What's your objective?
Vayne:I am of House Solidor. I wish only to protect my lineage and my country.
"Vayne:Thrust into this unknown world, I have yet to discover even what I must do to preserve myself."
"Ramza:Vaan, would you say there's room to reason with him?"
Vaan:Don't believe a word he says. You don't know how many people died in the wars he's started.
"Penelo:...He's our foe, but...fighting him here won't do anything to bring back the dead..."
Vayne:In no way do I expect this to assuage your ill will. However...
"Vayne:As I stand now, I am in need of your knowledge. The little I have heard so far was patently colored."
"Ramza:...What do you think? He is turned about... Were we to share the road a bit, we could exchange information."
"Vaan:Ramza, you don't know this guy!"
Balthier:Nor do you. Solve your problems in your world.
Vaan:You're fine with this!?
Balthier:That depends on his attitude. Well?
"Vayne:I will bear no arms, and stay my hand in your battles. How does that suit you?"
Cloud:Fair enough.
"Balthier:Truce, then. We'll take what you can tell us, too."
"Vaan:Give me a break... Is that supposed to be ""acting mature""?"
Penelo:...I'm frightened.
Firion:He used monsters to conquer neighboring lands. He's an emperor consumed with avarice.
Firion:No people should be subjugated. He built an army to obey his every whim...and used it to rule the world.
"Edgar:Somewhat hard to forgive, wouldn't you say? You strike me as a different sort, though..."
Vaan:...He occupied my home. The empire makes nothing but war.
Vayne:The censure of an opponent's citizenry leaves no room for retort.
"Vayne:But in the interest of one's homeland, there come times when conflict is inevitable. Such is the position of a sovereign."
Edgar:I can never lose sight of the innocents sacrificed to the ravages of war by my decision.
Ramza:Is royal birthright all one needs to take the lives of others in one's hands...?
Vayne:The emperor of Archadia is appointed by her people.
Vayne:Blood does not decide all.
"Edgar:That, too, must make for a difficult right of succession. After all, you need the people's support."
Vayne:What way with words I do possess is thanks to that.
Firion:A far better system than the Emperor's brute force.
Vaan:What gives...? How can he be so well behaved?
Ramza:That is how he is able to capture public sentiment.
"Vaan:Listening to him talk, it makes me sound like i'm just a wrong-headed kid. I can't tell what's what anymore."
"Ramza:You needn't struggle to keep up. Simply, when an unreasonable claim is made, call it out as such."
Ramza:I know not what your Ivalice is like.
"Ramza:But in mine, I have watched all too often those with power fomenting wars that consume the powerless."
Vaan:You only watched?
Ramza:I am of fortunate birth. But I could not abide a world with such divisions in fortune. Thus...did I fight...
Vaan:...I see.
"Edgar:You aren't your cheerful self, Vaan."
Edgar:...Don't worry. I trust that man far less than you may think.
Vaan:You sure sounded awfully friendly.
Edgar:Call it a grownup's political savvy. The other side didn't let slip his true feelings either.
"Edgar:Leave it to me to find them out, though. For now, try to bear it."
"Vaan:Thanks, Edgar... Alright, I'll keep my head in our battles."
"Vanille:Y'know, Fujin. You don't have to keep to yourself all the time. You can talk to us about anything."
Faris:Are you worried about your mates?
Rem:Or if Seifer thinks you betrayed him?
"Penelo:I think you're doing the right thing. If he's being fooled, I'm sure he'll..."
Y'shtola:Anyone would be if everyone starts talking to her all at once.
"Penelo:Ah... I'm sorry, we got carried away..."
Fujin:NO... UNPRACTICED.
Vanille:Don't you like talking to people?
Fujin:COMMITTEE. LONE GIRL.
Rem:What? You mean you're always with Seifer and Raijin!?
Y'shtola:That requires a special patience.
Rem:...I guess I can understand that. Sometimes it's better to be with a few friends than a big group.
Penelo:In that case...I hope Seifer comes to his senses soon.
"Faris:Until then, you have us."
"Y'shtola:It may bewilder you at first, but it would be nice if you would talk to us, even bit by bit."
Fujin:WILL TRY.
Ultimecia:You've finally arrived... To this deceitful garden...
Squall:Who's the deceitful one here?
Fujin:SEIFER. WHERE?
"Ultimecia:The sorceress's knight fulfills the sorceress's wishes. He is her shield, and preserves her life."
Seifer:What the hell is this? Why is the disciplinary committee threatening the sorceress?
"Raijin:We got reasons, ya know!"
Seifer:I don't want to hear excuses!
Vaan:You're the one who asked... What a pain in the butt.
"Warrior of Light:Is battle our only option? With Seifer, too, now?"
Squall:We can't let Ultimecia exist here. She's no better than your Garland.
"Seifer:Cut the slander and bring it on! All of you! Traitors, too!"
Squall:You can tell his stance on the matter.
"Raijin:You're gonna get it if ya go easy on him, ya know? Get ready, ya know!"
Ultimecia:That sadness...anger...hatred...loneliness...
Ultimecia:All shall be assimilated and flow into the dimensional algorithm...
"Ultimecia:Do battle, children of destiny. I, too, shall join you."
"Raijin:Seifer! We shouldn't fight, ya know!"
Seifer:Shut it. I... This is all I have left!
Ultimecia:Hm hm hm... Indulge your rage... And fight.
Ultimecia:Is this knight...spent? Useless man.
Ultimecia:I am through with you. I will see you children again...in theDimensions' Labyrinth.
Seifer:Wait! Please! I...I caught the moogle like you asked!
"Mog:Kupo? What are you talking about, kupo?"
"Mog:I could finally meet back up with everyone, kupo! You're a life saver! Thanks for helping me out, kupo!"
Seifer:What's happening...? Aren't I...the sorceress's chosen knight...?
Seifer:Don't you come near me! I can't stand traitors!
Squall:...You don't even have faith in your friends?
"Vaan:And you don't remember what happened back in your world, right? ...This is getting kinda sad."
Vayne:Who created these circumstances?
"Raijin:He's got Mog hostage, ya know!"
Vaan:You said you'd stay your hand!
Vayne:Are you blind to your own situation? This moogle uses gods' names to manipulate men as though they were game pieces.
Squall:Are we supposed to cut him down on your say so?
"Vayne:I have just found my objective. First, to break free from the fetters of these ""gods."""
"Mog:Help me, kupo! I-I'll tell you anything you want, kupo!"
Seifer:He's hiding more than you realize...
"Seifer:Let him go... I need to pay him back, too..."
Squall:...Hand over Mog.
Vayne:It seems we are at an impasse.
Vayne:So strike at me. Evince the power to claim your path!
Vaan:You asked for it!
Vayne:It is the right of the powerful to hold the reins of the future!
Ramza:Balderdash! That is simply a sophist's excuse for might makes right!
Vaan:Don't waste your breath on him! We're past the point of talking!
Vayne:Hnh... Not yet...
Vayne:It is not over yet!
Warrior of Light:Mog is...driving the Torsion...out of control...!?
Vayne:...I see. So that is where it all is.
Ramza:Something is leaving the Torsion!
Squall:What...is that?
"Ramza:I know not. I know not, but it is coming for us!"
"Warrior of Light:Everyone, do not let down your guard! We must first defeat this thing before us!"
"Warrior of Light:Is this the Torsion's master, or...? It matters not; we have no choice but to battle!"
"Warrior of Light:We defeated what would have appeared to be the master of that Torsion, yet it persists."
"Onion Knight:It's getting bigger, Mog at its center... It's gonna swallow us up if it doesn't blow us away."
Squall:...Seifer! This isn't the time for a nap!
Yuna:He'll be sucked into the Torsion!
Squall:Get up! Seifer!!
Seifer:...Don't tell me what to do!
Warrior of Light:He has avoided being drawn in.
Seifer:Ugh... It's just you. Where's the moogle?
"Onion Knight:He made that Torsion over there. A big one, too."
"Onion Knight:By all appearances, we've got ourselves wrapped up in a whole new problem."
Seifer:Don't you drag me into your mess. I was chosen by Spiritus as one with power.
Squall:That's what the moogle told you.
Warrior of Light:What on earth... Which god does he serve?
???:He serves neither.
"Materia:...The moogle straddled both of our allegiances, working in secret to gather all kinds of power..."
"Materia:Furthermore, the moogle's physical form is no longer here."
Materia:What could he have been trying to accomplish?
???:All answers lie beyond that Torsion... In the Dimensions' Labyrinth.
Warrior of Light:Who goes there!
"???:I, the god of this world."
"Materia:You are wrong, Spiritus... This is not your world."
Seifer:Spiritus? You're...who chose me...?
Spiritus:...The moogle controlled Materia's combatants to wound my warriors...
"Spiritus:But was that at the moogle's discretion...or yours, Materia!"
Materia:...Those who possess wills of good chose to stop those with wills of evil. It is meaningless if evil destroys the world!
Spiritus:Hmph! What good or evil inherent in a will shifts with the circumstances. All that is necessary is pure power!
Warrior of Light:Foolishness! You would profess that simple power can save the world?
"Onion Knight:Spiritus, do you have any idea what kind of troops you've been summoning?"
Spiritus:Rubbish... Whatever your feeble lights spout amounts to less than drivel.
Spiritus:My warrior Seifer. You have no time to grovel in self-pity.
Spiritus:Investigate the Dimensions' Labyrinth and put an end to the source of these troubles.
"Seifer:This time I'm a god's knight, eh?"
Yuna:Stop! It's reckless to go alone!
Spiritus:Collaboration cannot save the world. Do not interfere with my warriors!
Spiritus:Materia... Think not for a moment that your powers can help this world. It is my power that will change it.
"Spiritus:Seifer, that power is yours to use."
"Squall:It's not a ""collaboration""... We need each other, so we're in this together."
"Seifer:...Ha. When did you become such a goody-goody? I don't need a god's holier-than-thou speech, nor should you."
"Seifer:But after being led around by the nose, I won't be satisfied until I get at least one good punch in."
"Seifer:I'm using this power for me. And I'm using you losers, too. Don't get in my way..."
"Onion Knight:Same as ever... If we're headed the same way, you might as well just join us..."
"Materia:Regardless of the moogle's circumstances, whom you choose to join you is up to you."
Materia:But there is no meaning in the power of those trapped in darkness... The light will clear the darkest hearts.
"Materia:Go, warriors. You will find all truths before you."
"Warrior of Light:""All truths""... Beyond this Torsion..."
Materia:...The warriors of light are at last to depart for the Dimensions' Labyrinth.
Materia:What could that moogle spirit have been planning?
"Materia:For that matter, was this the moogle's will...or perhaps...some other malevolent being...?"
"Materia:...At any rate, it appears new warriors have already stumbled into the labyrinth."
Materia:The most I can do is trust my warriors and leave the matter in their hands.
Materia:By all means...may the light bless every warrior...
"Setzer:...So this is the Dimensions' Labyrinth, the depths of space and time."
Yuffie:Hrmmm... It's kinda totally different from inside the other Torsions.
Yuffie:Like I feel dizzier than usual... Or sick even... Urp.
Warrior of Light:Evidence of just how much the place will wear on us. We must keep our composure.
Terra:Mog is somewhere deep inside this labyrinth...
Terra:He's waiting for us. I can feel it...
Balthier:I'll be heading his way whether he wants me to or not.
Balthier:I have more than a few questions for the chap. You might say I've had it up to here.
Yuffie:Ditto. Let's hurry and hook up with him so I can get rid of this stress.
Setzer:The nuance is somehow different when you say it...
"Warrior of Light:At any rate, let us continue on. To Mog, and the truth."
Warrior of Light:Our light shall cut a path through the darkness before us.
"Raijin:Whoo-ee! Get a load of this place! It's like some fantasy land straight out of a picture book, ya know!"
"Seifer:Keep your shorts on, Raijin. This isn't a field trip."
"Raijin:I-I know that. I'm just tryingt o lighten the mood, ya know?"
"Seifer:Who do you think I am? I'm a god's knight, chosen by Spiritus himself."
"Seifer:That moogle, the root of all our problems, is squirreled away somewhere in here..."
"Seifer:Keep it together, you losers! And don't get in my way!"
"Zell:...Just like he's part of the team, eh?"
Onion Knight:And after all that protesting about not wanting to hang around with us.
Seifer:Don't get me wrong. I'm not about to cozy up with any of you.
Seifer:Did you forget? I said I'm only using you losers.
"Seifer:The knight's escort, so to speak. Do your job and be grateful about it."
Squall:(You're just afraid of being alone...)
"Zell:That's just you afraid of being alone, right?"
"Seifer:I think you're confusing me with yourself, chicken-wuss."
Seifer:Need me to make it clear to you how easily we can get by with one escort less?
"Zell:Oh, ready to settle this, huh!?"
"Onion Knight:I'd say you're more squire than knight if you need an escort, but that's just me."
"Raijin:Seifer, give it a rest! This ain't the time for squabbling, ya know!"
"Seifer:...Hmph. Let's go! Fujin, Raijin!"
"Seifer:You, too. You can at least be cannon fodder."
Zell:Arrrgh! Will that punk never get off his high horse!?
Onion Knight:It's better than having to keep fighting him.
Squall:Try not to provoke him so much. It just makes him difficult.
Zell:When did I provoke him?
Squall:(You're that oblivious?)
"???:Well, well, trying to follow in my footsteps, are you?"
Yuna:Sir Jecht!
"Jecht:You eating right, boy? Ain't fighting to your full potential, I'll bet."
Tidus:...Why're you here?
Jecht:Ain't that the million gil question.
"Jecht:Seems I was summoned by some god, but I'm kinda fuzzy on the particulars."
"Ace:Tidus, this is your father?"
Bartz:No kidding? What a lucky break.
"Yang:Heartening indeed. Father of Lord Tidus, let us be on our way."
Yuna:Sir Jecht... Won't you lend us your aid?
"Yuna:The world is different, but the danger"
"Jecht:Sorry, Yuna. No can do."
Yuna:B-but why?
Jecht:I told you. I was summoned here by a god. Spiritus.
Ace:Our enemy then?
"Yang:Do not let affiliations stand in the way. If you have the will, then"
Jecht:That's not the issue. It's that I can't trust a scrawny guardian to watch my back.
Tidus:Hey! Just what're you thinking to pull? It's dangerous here!
Jecht:Exactly! And that's why you should scram!
Jecht:Got it?
Bartz:Huh? What's going on?
Yuna:He plans to do...something...
"Wakka:But man, I never expected Sir Jecht to pop up..."
Tidus:I don't know why he had to come here. It's just more problems for us.
Penelo:You aren't...happy to see your father?
"Tidus:Oh, sorry..."
"Penelo:No, don't worry. I didn't mean it that way... But I guess you're worried about him fighting."
"Tidus:Nah, not really...I guess."
Wakka:Yeah! He's a total veteran!
"Cyan:Thy relationship, however, seems rather strained, Sir Tidus."
Tidus:He went missing when I was a kid.
Tidus:But even back then his attitude sucked. Always looking down on people and laughing at them...
Cyan:...Hmmm. I suspect thou might be mistaken.
"Sazh:Yeah, same here. When he was giving you a hard time back there, he was just lookin' out for his kid."
Cyan:I am also a parent... To think if I were to reunite with my son in a place such as this...
"Tidus:Even still, I can't understand what he's thinking..."
Sazh:...Yeah. I guess you might not until it's your turn to be a dad.
"Cyan:But understand this: it is natural for a father to love his family, love his children. Looking into Sir Jecht's eyes, that is the sort of man I saw."
"Tidus:Oh, yeah...? He could try saying something like that..."
"Yuna:Sir Jecht is kindhearted, so I know he worries about you."
"Wakka:He told you to beat it...but you ain't plannin' to, yeah?"
Tidus:Yeah. I'm going after him.
Tidus:And I'm going to find out what he's thinking.
???:Aha! Found you!
"???:You're the warriors of light the goddess spoke of, if I'm not mistaken."
"Sazh:Wh-whoa there! What's this about, and who might you be, missy?"
"???:Whoops, I haven't introduced myself."
Lilisette:Lilisette of the great Troupe Mayakov stands before you! It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance!
"Shantotto:Of the Troupe Mayakov, you claim? Now there's a rather nostalgic name."
Hope:You know it?
Shantotto:A troupe of dancers from some decades gone. Their popularity was second to none.
Sazh:Popular decades ago? That mean you're puttin' on a revival?
"Lilisette:Ahh...that's, um...b-because of the Torsion!"
Lilisette:Right! The goddess said they distort space and time!
Ramza:It would appear further explanation from us is unnecessary.
"Lilisette:Completely. Let me fight alongside you, for the sake of the future!"
Hope:I think some monsters've sniffed us out.
"Sazh:Hold that thought, Lilisette! We've got more pressing fish to fry!"
Lilisette:Perfect! That's what I'm here for!
Tidus:Argh... He never changes...
Lilisette:What's eating him?
Fujin:FAMILY REUNION.
Lilisette:Come again?
"Raijin:We ran into Tidus's pops, ya know? We tried to get him to join us, but he turned us down."
Fujin:INVECTIVE. QUARRELSOME.
"Lilisette:I see. Even though they could reunite, it ended in an argument."
Lilisette:Tidus! I hear you're in the middle of a fight with your father!
Tidus:It's not a fight. Things are just a little tense is all.
Lilisette:Boys can be that way.
Lilisette:Why not give it another shot? Things might go better the next time.
Tidus:What's the point? He's too pigheaded.
"Raijin:You'll never get anywhere if you just end it at pigheaded, ya know? You gotta try to understand the other side, ya know?"
"Lilisette:He must have something on his mind, too. Do you have any idea what it might be?"
Tidus:Probably something no good that he thinks is a great idea.
Lilisette:...I guess you know your father well.
Lilisette:Your future isn't set in stone yet.
"Lilisette:You look like you've got it together, so I'm sure things will turn out alright."
Onion Knight:...I wonder if it's something no good. I can only comment on what I've seen...
"Onion Knight:And it didn't look like they could see eye to eye, but what I saw was a parent trying to protect his child."
Onion Knight:There probably aren't any parents out there who don't think about their children...
"Tidus:Alright... Next time we'll talk, even if I have to pin him down."
Lilisette:That's the spirit!
Galuf:...Something's not right.
Sabin:What's wrong?
Galuf:There's an evil will hanging in the air. One that seeks to eliminate everything.
Galuf:...And I have a strong feeling I know who it is.
"???:Mwa-hahaha...! Quite perceptive of you, Galuf!"
Galuf:I knew it... I'd prepared myself for when you'd show up.
Sabin:An acquaintance?
Galuf:The dark warlock Exdeath. Our archenemy.
"Sabin:Meaning he's our enemy, too."
"Bartz:Don't tell me Spiritus sent you after Mog, too!"
Exdeath:Mwa-hahaha... Do not worry. I will not stand in your way.
Galuf:We won't make the same mistake again.
Exdeath:...There is some time yet before the power manifests itself.
"Exdeath:When it does, allow me to expunge every trace of you."
"Edge:Whoa, whoa, I don't like the sound of this Void."
Eiko:He's really ticking me off! Can I kill him?
Galuf:Yes. We mustn't let that power fall into his hands!
Bartz:Yeah! Let's end this here and now!
Bartz:Argh! Where'd he go!?
Exdeath:Mwa-hahaha...! Mwaaa-hahahaha!
Eiko:Oooh! What a coward! Come out and fight!
Galuf:No good... What a troubling development this is...
Shantotto:...Hold your horses.
Shantotto:Do you not notice these unsettling forces?
Yda:...Something is a bit tingly.
Vanille:Could it be a barrier...?
"Shantotto:Right you are, my dear."
Shantotto:Ahead of us barriers of power and magic lie.
Ramza:How do we make our way through them?
Shantotto:Don't bother with magic inside a barrier of power. It's a waste to try.
"Vivi:Then I guess that means physical attacks won't do much in a barrier of magic, huh?"
Bartz:And I'll bet they explode if we don't clear them simultaneously...
"Shantotto:Ooh, you know how to entertain a lady."
Ramza:You've encountered a similar gimmick.
"Tifa:In that case, we'd better put our heads together to figure out who to send in to fight."
Vanille:Right! This is a chance to let everyone's specialties shine!
Vanille:You can leave the barriers of magic to us!
Yda:Keen! Then we'll rough up the barriers of power!
"Vivi:Miss Yda, you're so cool!"
Yda:Haha! You can count on me!
"Squall:This is a barrier of power, right? We'll handle this."
Zell:Yeah! Give me something to pound!
Shantotto:Oh ho ho ho! You'd better not let us down!
Sazh:We're inside a barrier of magic! Physical attacks won't cut it in here!
Eiko:Leave it to us! We'll clean up in no time!
"Jecht:You caught up, did ya?"
Yuna:Sir Jecht!
Jecht:I'm not trying to give you a hard time. Turn around and just leave this to me.
Wakka:Preciate your concern.
"Wakka:But there's no turning back for us now, yeah?"
"Hope:We have things we want to know, so we keep moving forward. We won't be leaving."
"Jecht:Geez, you kids are stubborn... Birds of a feather, huh?"
Tidus:Which of us is the stubborn one?
Tidus:What do you plan to do by yourself?
"Cloud:You look like a capable warrior, but even you must be having a rough go of it by now."
"Hope:You're Tidus's dad. We're worried about you, too."
Jecht:Well how about that? You made yourself some real good friends here.
Hope:Don't try to change the subject!
Tidus:They're more than just friends. I trust them with my life.
"Tidus:And they trust me, too. You don't need to worry about me."
"Jecht:Heh, ain't that special. Alright, do what you want. I'll be going now."
Yuna:Ah! W-wait!
Tidus:It's fine. We'll see him again.
Jecht:...Whew. Now to do things my way.
Wakka:Sir Jecht!
"Jecht:What? Just you? Woulda preferred it was Yuna, to be honest."
Wakka:Please! Come with us!
"Jecht:Sorry, kid. I can't join your party. Not with him in it."
Wakka:F-fine... How about this then?
"Wakka:I wanna become stronger! Please, coach me!"
Jecht:You don't need my coaching. You're a perfectly respectable guardian.
"Wakka:...Sir. Sir Jecht, sir... Are you or are you not Tidus's dad?"
"Wakka:Mine died before I had a chance to remember him... I envy Tidus, to tell the truth."
Wakka:So why won't you be there for him? What's the issue for you two?
"Jecht:Issue, huh...? Is that it?"
Jecht:That I'm a selfish bastard ain't good enough for you?
Jecht:Do me a favor. Tell him I'll see him around.
"Wakka:I can believe you mean that, right!"
"Shantotto:Oh ho ho ho! Some barriers, no?"
Steiner:We did it! And now we can fight as a single unit again!
Zidane:But... What was the point of Exdeath putting us through that?
Galuf:He wouldn't do it for no reason. I'm sure he had something in mind.
Faris:The deep take me if we were aiding his schemes without our realizing it.
Steiner:Grr... How evil!
"Galuf:Ho ho! Hit the nail on the head, you did."
Galuf:Evil spirits concentrated in a single tree and given formthat's Exdeath.
Shantotto:What a fascinating origin. It takes all kinds to make the world go round.
Shantotto:I would love to hear a primary account. ...How does that sound?
Zidane:That was a close one!
Shantotto:Oh ho ho ho! I hope your thanks have just begun!
Steiner:Humbly do I acknowledge how very much I am in your debt...!
"Zidane:Not now, Steiner! Draw your weapon!"
Exdeath:Mwa-haha... I had thought crossing those barriers would have made you stronger...
Exdeath:Pathetic vermin.
Galuf:...Think what you want.
Galuf:I don't care how much you belittle us or stand in our way.
Galuf:Just know that I will defeat you!
Galuf:I'll preserve a future for everyone here! Even if it consumes the very last of my energies...that is my role!
Bartz:Galuf! You got it wrong... Don't try to take it all on yourself.
"Faris:Aye... ""We'll"" preserve the future!"
"Zidane:Amen. That future is yours, too, Galuf."
Shantotto:Precisely. You won't see this one leaving to younger generations all the fun.
Exdeath:Hah... Yes... Let your powers surge...
Exdeath:It hastens the coming of the power of the Void...
"Bartz:I'm gonna protect everyone's futures, too. And I won't leave a single world out. Everyone's going home in one piece!"
"Faris:Hear, hear! Time to finish this!"
"Galuf:Such comrades are my pride and joy... Ready yourself, Exdeath! Here we come!"
Exdeath:Fools... Mwa-haha! Hell awaits you!
Y'shtola:...It would seem we have prevailed.
"Y'shtola:Nevertheless, the might of this Exdeath is fearsome..."
Exdeath:What navet. Is victory over a mere puppet really that sweet?
Tidus:But it wasn't all shiny like the other manikins!
Exdeath:Mwa-haha! Do not mistake my works for those shoddy simulacra.
Exdeath:There is no comparing what the Torsions can make and my superior sorcery!
Layle:This isn't looking good for us.
Exdeath:Prostrate yourselves before my power and spend the rest of eternity wandering the Dimensions' Labyrinth!
Tidus:Oh yeah? Make us!
Layle:I think that's his plan. What's ours?
"Bartz:We don't need a plan... We just need to stop him! If we don't, all our worlds are"
Exdeath:What!?
Jecht:What're you standing around gawking for! Regroup already!
Exdeath:Fool... You mean to betray Spiritus?
"Jecht:Hah! That god's business is his own, and mine is mine! I do what I want!"
Bartz:Nice timing! Now's our chance to beat him!
Jecht:You kids get a move on!
Tidus:What!? You gotta be kidding me!
Bartz:Yeah! If we don't stop him now
Jecht:That's. What. I'm. Doing! Now get your rears in gear!
Y'shtola:...Very well.
"Y'shtola:The more power we let slip into Exdeath's hands, the greater danger your world is in."
Layle:You want to keep upping the ante?
Tidus:Stuff it! I'm staying!
Exdeath:Another fool rushes to his death!
Tidus:I'm not a weak little kid anymore! Let me help!
Jecht:You never listen...
Jecht:Hey! You back there! Can you take care of this brat for me!
"Layle:Talk about parenting with two left feet... Ugh, yeah, I got him!"
Tidus:Wh-whoa! Layle! Put me down!
"Tidus:You... You suck, Dad!"
Tidus:Why...why did he rescue us?
Tidus:I could've held my own...
Serah:Don't you think he didn't want you to have to?
Tidus:...As if now's the time for that.
Balthier:Exactly. Now's not the time. We need to keep moving so his sacrifice doesn't go to waste.
Shadow:Don't kill him yet.
Balthier:Just a figure of speech.
"Irvine:This isn't the time for second thoughts, you know. We're already on this road, so let's hoof it."
"Vivi:Mr. Jecht is really strong, right?"
Tidus:...Yeah. He can take a licking.
Vivi:Then don't worry. He's counting on us.
Vivi:I wanna show him what we can do.
"Serah:There's probably a way to help him without being right there next to him, too."
Tidus:...You think? ...I guess you're right.
"Tidus:Yeah, let's do this. Thanks, guys."
Balthier:A child never stops being a child to its parent.
Chelinka:There isn't a world where you and I aren't together.
Steiner:Oh! What's this!?
"Steiner:I have found two lost children! Everyone, assemble!"
Vaan:What's up? Found something interesting?
"Sabin:Hold on, what are kids doing lost in a place like this?"
"Chelinka:Thank goodness, we aren't the only ones here."
"Yuri:You must be from one of the many worlds, too."
Penelo:Many worlds? What's that?
"Vaan:If he means a different world, then he's not wrong."
"Chelinka:How do you do? I'm Chelinka, and this is my younger twin brother, Yuri."
Sabin:You're awful calm given the circumstances.
Penelo:Did the goddess already tell you what's going on?
Yuri:Goddess? Is there one in this world?
Yuri:We haven't met anyone. We just noticed that we ended up in this world.
Chelinka:We know this isn't the only world; that there are as many worlds as there are memories...
Yuri:So I guess we aren't all that surprised.
"Steiner:...So, what you mean to say is...?"
Sabin:Gah-ha-ha-ha! Beats me!
"Yuri:Well, we're gonna look for the road back home."
Chelinka:You guys be careful. The monsters around here are tough.
Vaan:Huh? Wait a sec!
Penelo:They want us to watch out for monsters? I hope they'll be alright...
Vivi:Gosh... Do you think those twins we met earlier are okay?
"Layle:They said they were looking for the ""road back home."""
Layle:It'd be a lucky break for us if there is one.
"Ace:Do you want to go help them? If so, we should hurry. They couldn't have gotten far on"
Vivi:Wow! That was amazing!
Yuri:Huh? Are you the group we met...?
"Layle:Wait, wait, wait. That attack just now... Did you use crystal power to do that?"
"Vivi:You can tell, Mr. Layle?"
"Layle:You could say I know a thing or two about crystals. And give the ""mister"" a rest, would ya?"
Yuri:Well... Chelinka draws out the power of the crystals...
Chelinka:And Yuri guides the flow of the power to perform his attacks.
Ace:Really... So the two of you are able to act as one to fight back?
Yuri:That's how we've gotten by till now at least.
Layle:...So how's it going? Find anything that looks like a road home?
Chelinka:Not yet...
Ace:We didn't think so.
Layle:We've all been stuck here a while with no clue as to how to get back.
Ace:But there may be a clue within this labyrinth.
"Layle:C'mon, Yuri, Chelinka. Throw it in with us, hey? For some reason, it doesn't feel like we're completely strangers either."
Yuri:...They don't seem like bad people. Why don't we?
Chelinka:I'm with you.
Vivi:Hooray! We made new friends!
"Yuri:Whoa, Chelinka? Did you hear that? We're friends already!"
"Chelinka:Haha, yup."
"Chelinka:I can't fight in battle, but I hope you'll have me just the same. Go on, Yuri, your turn..."
Vivi:There's a bunch of us over there still. C'mon!
Yuri:Ch-Chelinka! This is great! There's a whole bunch of them! You think they'll all be our friends?
"Chelinka:Ohhh, Yuri, settle down already! You've always been like this!"
"Layle:Ah, well. I thought they were oddly insightful, but kids'll be kids."
King:Hm?
Tidus:Dad!!
Tidus:What's wrong!? What happened to Exdeath!?
"Jecht:Heh, that bozo was no big deal... Except..."
Jecht:I ain't feelin' so good suddenly... Inside my head's...all mixed up...
Ace:Could it be memory loss from being in this labyrinth?
Jecht:After battlin' Exdeath...there's somethin' inside me...that ain't me...
Tidus:Not you...? You don't mean...?
"King:Hey, what's going on?"
Yuna:No... I...didn't know...
King:Is he possessed or something?
Tidus:...He must've remembered.
Ace:Did the fight with Exdeath trigger it?
Tidus:Probably. And now it's out of control.
Yuna:No... This can't be happening...
Tidus:...Dad's in pain.
Tidus:This is what he hates the most.
Tidus:You won't tell me what you're thinking...
Tidus:But I think I know.
"Tidus:You came here because you don't want to cause problems for everyone else, right?"
Tidus:...You're depending on me.
Tidus:Argh! You've already suffered enough...
"Tidus:Why do you have to suffer here, too...?"
Tidus:Enough with gods and saving the world! You come first!
Tidus:I'll stop you. Just hang on!
"Wakka:No, wait! We can't fight Sir Jecht!"
Jecht:Urrrgh... Do it... I can't...hold myself back!
Tidus:Wakka! Yuna!
Tidus:Help me save my dad!
"Tidus:Get ready, Dad! We're gonna hit you with all we got! We're gonna help you!"
Jecht:Sorry... I can't control this...!
Tidus:It'll be over quick! Let's do this!
Yuna:Sir Jecht!
Cecil:...Worry not. He'll be fine.
Laguna:Thank goodness. It was feeling touch and go there.
Tidus:Now to just wait for him to come to...
Tidus:Huh!? Yuna!?
Tidus:Wh-wh-what's the matter!?
Yuna:I'm so relieved... You're...still here...
Tidus:Ahh... You remember that.
"Tidus:Sorry to make you worry. But hey, look. I'm fine, see?"
"Tidus:I'm here to guard you on this journey, so...trust me."
Jecht:Hey! Enough with the touchy feely!
Jecht:Tsk... Trying to embarrass me in front of somebody else's little girl?
Tidus:You're back to yourself!
Jecht:Heh. No big deal.
Squall:What was that all about?
Jecht:Sorry you had to see that. Just some bad memories poking their heads out.
Jecht:Was trying to keep away from you all...but I got led around by the nose.
Cecil:You are no longer under Exdeath's yoke.
Squall:I suppose you can keep your memories under control now. Even bad ones.
"Yuna:I remembered, too..."
Jecht:That so... Sorry to put you through all that again.
Cecil:That battle was fierce enough to warp the space in here... Perhaps that is why your memories returned.
"Squall:But only if your ties are close enough, it seems."
Cecil:Indeed. I am yet without mine...
"Laguna:Now, now, don't let it get you so down."
"Laguna:We've found a strong clue to solving our problems! But first, let's solve the bigger problem behead of us!"
"Squall:(""Before us""? ""Ahead of us""?)"
"Jecht:Anyway, guess I'll take the forward position."
Tidus:You haven't made a full recovery yet.
"Jecht:Stuff it! I've got seniority on you, so fall in line!"
"Squall:(He just can't ask him to watch his back, can he?)"
"Laguna:Aw, Squall, that's so considerate of you to go behead of me!"
"Yuna:I'll... I'll protect you, too..."
Yuna:So please...
"Cyan:How wonderful it is that Sir Jecht has joined us. I am happy for thee, Sir Tidus."
Tidus:At least one of us is.
"Sazh:That look of relief on your face tells a different story, kid."
Lilisette:See? What did I tell you? Your father did have something in mind.
"Tidus:Yeah, yeah."
"Cyan:For all his stern language, his desire to raise a strong child may have backfired on him..."
Sazh:When deep down he just can't get enough of his bundle of joy.
"Tidus:I keep telling you, it's his attitude that sucks."
Hope:I thought the same thing.
Hope:And neither of us knew how to deal with the other. I wonder if your father doesn't have the same trouble.
"Sazh:You said he's a star athlete, right? That can't leave him with a lot of free time..."
Cyan:All the time in the world is never enough to spend with thy family...
Sazh:Now's your chance to make up for lost time.
"Hope:Ah, but lately you've always got some retort to throw back at him!"
Tidus:Of course I do! We're on equal footing now! I don't have to take his crap forever!
"Lilisette:Right, then! Time to bring down the house!"
Tidus:You betcha!
Sazh:That's a scary kind of fired up!
Yuri:This world is different from the others we've seen.
Yuri:Can we...really get back home?
"Chelinka:""There is nothing you can't do if your will is strong enough."""
"Chelinka:If we want it, we can make it happen. So don't give up."
Vivi:What is it?
Terra:Watching you reminds me of the children back home.
Vivi:Your children?
"Terra:No, orphaned children."
Yuri:With no parents... The same as us back then...
"Terra:In the midst of their sorrow, all I could do was be by their side."
Terra:But I could keep going thanks to them.
Terra:And the same goes for you.
Eiko:Aaack! Don't come near me!
"Laguna:Mwe-hehe! There's no escape, Eiko! It's the Cuchi-cuchi treatment for you!"
Chelinka:...What are you doing?
Laguna:Uh? Terror! It's Cuchi-cuchi tag!
Eiko:It's sooo scary! Why don't you join?
"Yuri:U-um... What do you think, Chelinka?"
"Laguna:What, you're not gonna play with me?"
"Laguna:Okay! The next target is Yuri! Charge, full speed ahead!"
Yuri:Waugh! W-wait! Stooop!
Chelinka:Yuri looks like he's having fun.
"Terra:Hehe, everyone is so full of energy."
Vivi:I wonder if she thinks Mr. Laguna is one of us kids...
Sazh:Whoever named this the Dimensions' Labyrinth knew what they were talking about. There's no end to this place.
Vivi:We've come a long ways.
Rem:We have... But I feel Mog is nearby. Only a little more to go.
Vivi:You know...I was thinking.
Vivi:I'd never be able to get this far without everyone's help.
"Warrior of Light:I feel the same, Vivi."
Warrior of Light:I am grateful to have met each of you.
Rem:...It was just the four of us at the beginning.
"Sazh:Haha, now that you mention it, it was, huh."
Sazh:Who'da thunk our party'd grow this big?
"Mog:Kupo! We need to work together to find others to help us, kupo!"
"Mog:Heroes with wills of light! Where are you, kupo? Come out, come out wherever you are!"
"Mog:I can sense a will of light at the other end of this coast, kupo!"
"Mog:Kupo? Is that a new friend over there, kupo?"
"Mog:Kupo! You're not who I was looking for, kupooo!"
"Mog:Kupo... It's not easy being a messenger of the goddess, kupo..."
"Mog:But I'm not about to give up either, kupo! We've got worlds to save, kupo!"
Sazh:...Brings back memories.
"Sazh:He was an uncomplicated fella, that one."
Vivi:Yeah. He would always cheer us up when the going got tough.
Rem:And he was always so earnest about his mission.
Rem:No one was happier than him to find someone new to join us.
"Sazh:Probably nothing to gain by saying it at this point, but..."
Sazh:Is Mog...really a bad guy?
Vivi:...I want to see him one more time.
Vivi:I can't tell if he's a good moogle or a bad moogle...
Vivi:But...I still want to see him. Do you think that's weird?
"Rem:Not at all, Vivi. I feel the same way."
Warrior of Light:Mog is one of us.
"Sazh:...Shady or not, there's no denying that."
Warrior of Light:Let us be on our way.
Warrior of Light:I want to believe in the light of his will.
Jecht:Sure taken a turn for the horrific here... Givin' me chills.
Galuf:Although...I wouldn't have expected it to open up like this the deeper we go.
Cloud:Better than getting lost.
Galuf:Exdeath! Shouldn't you know better than to show your face again!
"Exdeath:Mwa-haha! Wherever you go, there I'll be!"
Jecht:Hah! Didn't take you for the lonely type!
Exdeath:Hmph. I assumed you would have destroyed yourself after recovering your memories.
Jecht:Why you...!
Galuf:The way you'd dare to take advantage of a man's soul... You can't be allowed to roam free!
Cloud:Agreed. Memories...aren't for someone else to mess with.
"Exdeath:Mwa-hahaha! Yes, that's the spirit!"
Exdeath:But let us see if you can keep your composure when confronted with this...
Exdeath:Come! Warriors possessed of darkness!
"Jecht:What the!? Well, ain't this a crowd!"
Galuf:It's come to this...
"Cloud:Not a surprising lineup, though."
Exdeath:...You will find them in no way inferior to the real thing.
Exdeath:May the warriors of darkness escort you to hell!
Jecht:Things're gettin' interesting! Let's do this!
Galuf:We'll mop them up before we realize they're in the way.
Cloud:Let's break through in one go. My money's on Mog being just ahead!
Firion:That's all of them...
Yuffie:I'm sooo pooped. Don't make me take another step.
"Lilisette:Come on now! There's no time to dillydally! Can you just sit there while your world's in peril, Yuffie!?"
"Yuffie:Ugh... Yeah, yeah, I know..."
Firion:Mog!?
Yuffie:Whaaa?! This is sudden!
Serah:Wait! ...Something's not right.
Vincent:...An illusion?
"Mog:Kupokupo! I really owe it to you all! Thanks so much, kupo!"
Lilisette:Thanks? For what?
Mog:Thanks for all the spectacular battles you've fought here and there!
"Mog:I've been able to gather lots and lots of energy, kupo!"
"Mog:But but but! I need more energy, kupo! This isn't enough!"
"Yuffie:Hold on one stinking minute there! What the heck are you gonna do with all this energy, huh!?"
"Mog:Kupopo? If you want to know, you'll have to come inside, kupo!"
"Mog:In here is the ultimate tier of the Dimensions' Labyrinth, kupo! It's your right to set foot inside, kupo!"
"Mog:Don't keep my pom-pom waiting, kupo!"
"Serah:Mog, wait!"
"Yuffie:A Torsion leading to the ultimate tier... Um, ""It's a trap""?"
Lilisette:But there's no other way before us.
Firion:...We were prepared for this from the beginning.
"Firion:Let's go, everyone!"
"Yuffie:Wowzers, not even a moment's hesitation! Everybody's sure got guts..."
"Serah:To tell the truth, I'm a little nervous."
Serah:But my faith in everyone else is bigger than my nerves.
"Yuffie:...Yeah. I get the feeling that with everyone here, things'll turn out alright."
Yuffie:Plus I don't wanna hang around here by myself.
"Seifer:This ""ultimate tier"" is pretty repulsive looking if you ask me."
Yuri:Are all those squirming things tentacles?
"Y'shtola:...It would appear that way, as though we are inside some giant creature."
Zidane:Hey! Mog! Where are ya!?
"Zell:Aw, c'mon, man. What if all that shouting attracts a bunch of monsters?"
Yuri:W-waugh! Is this the goddess? Gosh...
Zell:Hm? I don't think it's the real her. A hologram?
Y'shtola:I believe she has a message for us.
"Materia:That spirit, the moogle, is in here."
Materia:You must address the situation in all haste. If you do not...
Materia:The moogle's form may become the vessel for a sinister presence.
Zidane:A sinister presence? Is that what's been behind Mog?
Materia:Yes. I sense an omen of calamity.
Zell:Calamity...? Is something coming?
Materia:You must stop it before it does.
Materia:Not just for this world. For every world.
"Materia:You are all my light. Please, by all means, defend every world."
"Yuri:Every world...? I guess that's right, huh. They are all connected."
Seifer:I'm gonna pop that moogle a good one.
Y'shtola:Surely our opponent is connected to these tentacles.
"Zidane:Once we find Mog, we'll get the full story."
Layle:So. A sinister presence that'll bring calamity to every world.
Balthier:I always thought that moogle was up to no good.
"Edgar:All these battles we've been put through to close the Torsions, too..."
"Edgar:Gathering energy to present to this calamity... Assuming Mog isn't the calamity himself, that is."
"Onion Knight:Just as we suspected, we were being used all along."
Sabin:No use crying over spilled milk. Though I would like to ask Mog a few questions myself...
"Lightning:But what we need to do now is clear. Defeat Mog...no ifs, ands, or buts."
"Balthier:""Defeat"" is easier said than done."
Balthier:Unless it really is just a moogle we're fighting...
Layle:He's been a slippery one so far. He probably has more than a few more tricks up his sleeve.
"Onion Knight:Come to think of it, remember what Y'shtola said?"
Onion Knight:That the labyrinth's ultimate tier is like the inside of some creature?
"Edgar:Hmm? And not unlike a moving fortress, eh? This is something I think I'd like to figure out how to pilot."
Sabin:Nice thinking! I call shotgun!
"Edgar:Settle down, Sabin. Once again, easier said than done. I can't imagine a giant creature is eager to let us manipulate it."
"Balthier:While I hate to interrupt your fun, might we focus on this calamity first?"
"Edgar:Aha, my apologies."
"Edgar:I hadn't intended to give myself over to frivolity. Only, I wonder if everyone isn't a bit too caught up by the word ""calamity""..."
Lightning:He's right. We shouldn't let the word tie us down. We just need to beat whatever enemy appears before us.
"Layle:No ifs, ands, or buts, right? Let's get this over with."
Balthier:Time to save the world... Just the right burden for the leading man.
Terra:This is...Mog's presence...
"Eiko:I feel it, too! We're close!"
Vivi:I bet he's waiting for us!
"Edge:Wh-whoa, whoa, slow down. Why does everyone sound so happy about it!?"
"Edge:Mog's our enemy now... He might kill us, you know."
"Eiko:Oh? But it's not for sure, right?"
Eiko:Maybe he's just been tricked by some nasty big baddie!
Ace:It is a possibility...
Terra:Mog is in danger right now.
"Terra:And if so, I want to save him."
"Irvine:You really like Mog, don't you?"
Terra:Like... It's not just that.
Terra:I want to repay him.
Terra:For giving me the chance to meet so many people from different worlds...
Terra:For the bonds we built while closing the Torsions...
Terra:All of it is thanks to Mog guiding us...
Eiko:Terra's right.
Eiko:Without Mog...we might've never met... And being alone...is so lonely...
"Edge:Yeah, you got me there."
"Irvine:Yeah. I'm glad I got to meet all these cute girls, too."
"Irvine:And if anyone was being used, maybe it just happened to be Mog, you know?"
Ace:It might have very well been any one of us summoned here who ended up that way.
Terra:Mog is as special to me as all of you.
"Edge:Alrighty, then let's go save him."
Edge:Could be he hasn't attacked us yet 'cause he is just waiting for our help.
Eiko:Then let's hurry it up! To Mog's rescue!
Warrior of Light:Mog!
"Lightning:We came, like you wanted."
Laguna:Hold it... Is he out cold?
Eiko:Mog! We'll save you!
Warrior of Light:Are you alright!?
Laguna:I didn't think they'd rush in like that...
Lightning:Look! Mog is!
Mog:You have...done well to come this far... I...commend you...
Eiko:That's not the usual Mog...
"Laguna:Oh, man... Something funny is going on..."
"Warrior of Light:Mog, what is it you are after? What do you mean to do with this world!?"
Mog:It is... It is not enough...
Terra:What's not enough...?
Mog:Offer more... More conflict... More power...
Lightning:You want to take more of our strength till the very end is it?
Mog:Power... Manifest...all you can...
Eiko:Mog!!
Laguna:Yikes! What the heck is that!?
Terra:...It's not Mog. This blackened feeling isn't Mog's will!
Lightning:So the real mastermind finally makes its appearance...!
"Warrior of Light:...Can you see us, Mog? The warriors you have guided are all gathered here."
Warrior of Light:We fight with the wills of light you discovered. Now your light must prevail.
Warrior of Light:To arms! The light is with us!
Y'shtola:Could it be Mog was parasitized by this...this fiend...!?
Warrior of Light:We shall lay low the instigator of our ills and rescue Mog!
Sazh:Sonuva! So that's the real you!
Vivi:Give us back Mog! Give us back our friend!
"Mog:I'm sorry you all had to go through this, kupo."
Warrior of Light:You are still with us...! Persevere! We shall extricate you!
Mog:Thanks...kupo... But I think...this is the end...kupo...
Mog:The...last...of...my...strength...kupo... Take...it...and...defeat...this...evil...kupo...
Rem:We won't let it end like this! We will get you back!
Warrior of Light:Our will is the light! Now is the time to shine!
Warrior of Light:It is finished...
"Materia:...Go, Mog. Awaken the warriors."
"Mog:Kupo! Leave it to me, kupo!"
"Mog:Kuuupopo! Everyone, open your eyes, kupo!"
Vivi:Thank goodness you're safe!
Sazh:Looks like you shook that bug you had.
"Materia:Yes, there is nothing more to fear."
Materia:The blackened will that fed on the spirit moogle has been eliminated entirely.
"Mog:Everyone, I'm really sorry, kupo!"
"Mog:It's all my fault that the world was in danger, kupo..."
Warrior of Light:And yet we prevailed.
"Rem:If it's really you, then you're one of us."
"Mog:Ku...kupooo! I owe you for saving me! I'll never forget this as long as I live, kupo!"
"Rem:No, Mog. We owed you."
Rem:It was the light you gathered that defeated the blackened will.
Vivi:You're back to yourself because you brought us all together!
Warrior of Light:We felt your will resisting the blackened will in that battle. You fought alongside us.
"Sazh:By the way, Materia."
Sazh:Are we able to go home?
"Materia:...Since you defeated the blackened will, the threat infesting this world is no longer."
"Mog:Wait, kupo..."
Materia:What is it?
"Mog:While I was possessed by the blackened will, all kinds of unpleasant consciouses were flowing into me, kupo..."
Rem:What do you mean...?
"Mog:I really don't know precisely, but these consciouses came through the blackened will and into me...kupo..."
Materia:I believe it means the blackened will was not the only sinister presence.
"Sazh:Aww, c'mon. So what's gonna happen with multiple sinister presences?"
"Warrior of Light:Needless to say, a new danger threatens not only this world, but all of ours."
"Mog:Kupo... I want to pay you back for all the trouble I caused, kupo."
"Mog:I want to protect all your worlds, kupo. I won't be a problem this time. I mean it, kupo!"
"Mog:So pleasejust a little bit is fineplease stay and continue the journey with me, kupo!!"
Warrior of Light:...So begins a new journey.
Vivi:I thought I wanted to hurry back home...
Vivi:But I think I want to keep adventuring with everyone and see new things and stay together longer.
Vivi:Am I being selfish...?
Rem:Everyone might have their own goals and missions to fulfill in the homeworlds...
Rem:But I feel the same way as you... I've realized so many things after meeting everyone in this world.
Cloud:We've come this far. Let's see it to the end.
"Mog:Is something bothering you, kupo?"
"Warrior of Light:Even after eliminating the blackened will and saving the world, my memories have not returned."
Warrior of Light:I wonder if I can keep up the fight when I still do not even know what was important to me.
Cloud:...Keep up the journey.
Rem:You might find something on the way!
"Mog:Trust in me, O savior of me, kupo! Together we'll help you find your memories, kupo!"
"Mog:This time...I'll protect you to the very end, kupo!"
"Mog:And don't forget, you saved this world, kupo! There's nothing you can't do, kupo!"
Rem:But we haven't saved it completely yet... About that...
"Sazh:Yeah... And not just our worlds, but everyone's are in trouble."
Warrior of Light:...I hope you all will continue to fight by my side.
"Warrior of Light:Whatever difficulties may await, with you, I can face anything. That is what I believe."
Warrior of Light:Let us carry on. To a new world. To where that light reaches.
Onion Knight:Well...Mog is back to himself and we beat the blackened will. Are we not done here?
"Y'shtola:Save for that, this was supposed to be a place of respite or us."
Warrior of Light:...My memories have not returned. I believe the effects of the Torsions have yet to be resolved.
Materia:...You are correct.
"Materia:Though you beat the will feeding on the moogle, the distorsions in this world remain."
Vaan:Didn't you make this world? Can't you fix it?
Materia:I am trying. However...something is amiss.
"Materia:Something may have happened to the foundation of this world, the crystal core."
"Mog:Someone still has it out for this world, kupo."
Onion Knight:Can I believe that?
"Mog:My spirit powers still let me sense wills and summon friends, kupo."
"Mog:...Whether you believe me or not is up to you and the gods, kupo."
"Materia:Warriors... To repair this world, won't you lend me your strength?"
Materia:I would have you make for the crystal core and ascertain if anything is there.
Y'shtola:Why us?
Materia:...I cannot leave my position for long. It is difficult to maintain this world.
"Vaan:So to make an airship analogy...if this is the bridge we're in, then the crystal core is the engine?"
Onion Knight:So it seems. Shall we give it a look?
"Y'shtola:At any rate, we are yet unable to return home as things stand."
"Warrior of Light:Yes... I cannot remember my home, and I do not think I am alone in this predicament."
"Vaan:Alright then, to the airship! Mog, can you get it ready for us?"
"Mog:Does that mean you believe me, kupo!?"
"Vaan:What choice do we have? We came here with you, and we're leaving with you."
Y'shtola:No hard feelings in that corner.
Onion Knight:...I don't think he ever gave it much thought to begin with.
Warrior of Light:It is better than worrying here about it. We still know nothing about what we face.
"Onion Knight:If that's what our leader says, I'm not about to argue."
"Y'shtola:Memories or no, everyone relies on you."
"Y'shtola:No matter the circumstances, you are always the first to fly our banner of light."
Warrior of Light:Without a past...can I be a shining light for anyone?
"Materia:Go, warrior. The crystal awaits you."
Spiritus:The moogle is no longer necessary. Forge your own paths.
The Emperor:Hmph. As though I need you to tell me that.
Sephiroth:...The center of everything. If I am there...
Golbez:Spiritus. I cannot guarantee I will act as you expect me to...
Golbez:...There is something important to me. Does this present a problem for you?
Spiritus:None. My warriors are those who can achieve what they will.
Vayne:...I will not be a puppet of the gods. Yet...I lack knowledge.
Spiritus:What Materia's warriors released is in the vicinity of the crystal core.
"Spiritus:If you wish to see it with your own eyes, that is where you shall go."
Balthier:Well...we blew the engine again.
"Mog:This should be where to find the crystal core, kupo."
"Mog:But it's surrounded by buildings from another world, kupo!"
Firion:This place reminds me of the distorted realms we've traveled to get here.
"Mog:Oh, no! If that's true, we're in danger, kupo!"
"Mog:Someone else must be after the crystal core and making these paths...these distortions, kupo!"
"Cloud:You mean Torsions, huh? The rifts we can also make by our own willpower."
Firion:Could it be one of Spiritus's lackeys?
"Mog:It might even be worse! In any case, we need to head to the crystal, kupo!"
"Balthier:If it's not one problem in this world, it's another..."
"Firion:Wait, over there!"
"Vayne:You do not take the gods' words for truth, do you?"
???:I'm just a fortune-telling machine. That's a mite harder question than I can answer.
Vayne:So you say. However...
"Cloud:It's Cait Sith! He's here, too!"
Balthier:Don't tell me you count stuffed animals among your associates.
Cloud:...He's one of us.
Balthier:Really? Looks awfully chummy with Vayne there.
Firion:Maybe he's another ally sent to us by Materia.
"Balthier:Well, ""guide,"" what's the verdict?"
"Mog:I can only tell if someone has the will, kupo..."
Cloud:So you don't know either.
"Mog:It was my job before to find warriors with wills of light, kupo."
"Mog:But as you know by now, the line between good and evil or light and darkness is a moving target, kupo."
Vayne:...Then we are in agreement.
Cait Sith:Alrighty. I'll hold up things on my end.
Firion:Let's follow them.
"Mog:But which one, kupo?"
Cloud:Cait Sith.
Balthier:Wise choice. The other doesn't seem very open to persuasion.
Cait Sith:Not this. Nor that.
Cait Sith:Vayne said I'd find it around here.
Cait Sith:He didn't seem like the kind of person who'd lie about something like this.
Cait Sith:Oh? This might be the ticket.
Cait Sith:Wh-wh-what IS that!?
Cait Sith:Oops! Might've bit off a wee more'n I can chew!
"Snow:Hey, did you guys hear that?"
Tifa:It sounded like Cait Sith! Up ahead!
Steiner:There was some mechanical noise as well! Your friend may be in danger!
Mog:Kupokupo! I think they're already fighting!
Snow:A friend of yours and Cloud's is a friend of mine. Let's go!
Layle:Time for the heroes to do our thing!
Cait Sith:Cloud! It's been ages!
Cait Sith:And you got here just in time. I thought it was the rubbish heap for me this time.
Cloud:...You okay?
"Cait Sith:Fit as a fiddle thanks to you! Been a wee lost in this here factory, though."
Lilisette:Cait Sith...huh. And you're the one on top? Not the big doll?
"Cait Sith:You've got the right of it, lassie! It's a pleasure to meet you!"
Cait Sith:The name's Cait Sith. I'm a fortune-telling machine.
Edgar:You're an entertainment apparatus? Fascinating. I'd like to see how you tick.
Cloud:Cait Sith's not...a typical machine.
"Galuf:I've never seenor heardanyone quite like you before. There must be many, many worlds out there."
Warrior of Light:So it seems.
"Cait Sith:Hey, you!! What're you lookin' so down for!?"
"Warrior of Light:Who, me?"
"Cait Sith:How about it? If you have something on your mind, I can clear it up for ya!"
Cait Sith:A bright future? A happy future? I can predict anything!
"Lilisette:The future, huh? I wonder if that's a Cait Sith's business in every world."
Galuf:Predictions don't always come true anyway. Why don't you go ahead and ask something?
"Edgar:True or not, I just want to see how this works."
Warrior of Light:Something I'd like to know...
Warrior of Light:Will there ever come a time when this world and our friends are truly at peace?
Galuf:You're asking for us? I thought you were concerned about the memories you've lost.
"Warrior of Light:Yes, but I know that the person I was before I lost my memories would have asked the same question."
"Cloud:Well, there you have it."
"Cait Sith:Okay, here goes!"
"Warrior of Light:...""Ordinary luck. It will be an active fortune. Give into the goodwill of others for a surprising spring""?"
Edgar:...That's not an answer.
Cait Sith:That's strange. I'll try again!
"Warrior of Light:""Be careful of forgetfulness. Your lucky item is something shiny""?"
Lilisette:Huh. So you really are just a fortune-telling machine.
"Cait Sith:Wait, one more! Just one more!"
Cait Sith:...What you pursue will come true. But you will lose something dear.
"Warrior of Light:What do you mean by ""something dear""?"
Edgar:I wouldn't worry yourself. This is hardly scientific.
Cloud:...Well? I suppose you aren't satisfied with those fortunes.
Cait Sith:Of course not! I have to prove I'm no fraud! I'm coming with you.
"Cloud:You don't mind, do you?"
Galuf:Not at all. I think Krile will be overjoyed!
Cait Sith:The pleasure's mine!
"Edge:Hey, I hear you're a fortune-teller. What's my fortune got in store?"
"Cait Sith:Leave it to Cait Sith! Right or wrong, I'm still the same ol' me!"
Cait Sith:Love has not been kind...until now. Your soulmate is right around the corner.
Edge:R-really!? My soulmate!? This is awesome!
"Rem:Hehe, part of the gang already."
Zidane:There was anactressin mytroupewho spoke a lot like him.
"Zidane:She was fun and cheerful, and she also made everyone laugh."
Rem:But Mog and Cait Sith are so happy and friendly and human. It's nice.
"Hope:You journeyed together, right?"
Hope:Cloud says Cait Sith isn't just any old machine.
"Hope:What does that mean? He looks like a toy, but is he...alive?"
Vincent:Not exactly. But you're not wrong either.
Vincent:His workings are a lot more intricate than it may appear. ...As is his situation.
Hope:But we can trust him...right?
Vincent:Are you worried he was talking to an enemy?
Hope:I thought Vaan and the others might be concerned.
"Zidane:It's not easy to forget what happened back in our worlds, you know."
Hope:I don't want us to be suspicious of any of our own...
Vincent:Cait Sith...has a keen eye.
"Zidane:Vayne's an enemy, but he spotted right away that Mog was possessed."
Vincent:Cait Sith's skilled at sneaking into enemy territory and finding out information.
Hope:Is that why he was talking to Vayne?
Vincent:I can't answer that. Just trust him.
Vincent:The man knows the difference between right and wrong.
Hope:Don't you mean...cat?
Yuffie:I thought this was supposed to be a world where we could rest!
Yuffie:I'm exhausted! We're fighting monsters all the time!
"Mog:There the warriors fight endlessly, kupo."
"Faris:Us, too? I don't remember any such thing."
"Mog:...Anyway, because that world exists, this world is a place where they can rest, kupo."
Balthier:And now their world of respite is being overrun by strife. ...The gods sure are lucky to have us.
"Vivi:If we protect this world, do you think we'll get a chance to rest?"
Faris:I don't have time to rest. There's so much I need to do back home.
Balthier:You and me both.
"Yuffie:Yeah! Me, too!"
"Vivi:However busy you get in your own world, you won't forget about us, right?"
Faris:Hm? Of course. I'd hate to forget you.
"Lightning:As long as our memories are still unstable, I can't make any promises."
Balthier:...Be nice to the child.
"Balthier:Until we do manage to find our way home, I promise I won't forget you."
Vivi:Thank you...
Vivi:I don't remember much...but I do remember wanting to go on more adventures...
Vivi:So I'm happy I'm getting to do that right now with all of you.
Faris:My friends here are as important to me as the ones back home.
Lightning:It doesn't matter what the gods' plans are. I'll fight to protect the people I care about right here.
"Yuffie:Me too! Me too! I want to find more trea I mean, I want to fight to save the world, too!"
"Balthier:We all have our reasons, whatever they may be."
"Penelo:I don't want to be rude, but we know you've been talking to Vayne. We saw you."
"Cait Sith:Oh, why dinnae you say hello? I dinnae know you were friends of his."
"Krile:Not exactly. You see, Penelo..."
Penelo:Vayne is fromour world. He's responsible for starting a war that destroyed myhome.
Lightning:You approached him without knowing who he was?
"Cait Sith:He said he was summoned here by a god different from who summoned me, so we kept talking."
Ramza:You talked to this god before coming here?
"Cait Sith:Aye, the goddess Materia summoned me."
"Cait Sith:Out of the blue, I'm in this world and she's telling me to join Cloud and the others."
"Cait Sith:It happened so suddenly, with the lady saying she's a goddess and all, I didn't know what was going on."
Lightning:That makes the two of us. So that's why you were gathering information.
"Krile:Even so, Vayne of all people..."
"Ramza:This is merely my impression, but Vayne strikes me as reasonable if he has no stake in the matter."
"Penelo:You...might be right. He's only interested in his lineage and our world, Ivalice."
"Cait Sith:He seemed to have no love lost for the god that sent him here, Spiritus."
"Cait Sith:He was also going on about, ""History is woven by man,"" and some such."
Lightning:Did he tell you anything useful? Anything that might help us?
Cait Sith:What he told me was pretty much what I've heard from all of you.
"Cait Sith:He did say that unlike Materia, Spiritus is standing by and watching his warriors destroy this world."
Ramza:How queer. He created this world with Materia. Why would he let it be destroyed?
Lightning:There must be a reason he's letting the likes of the Emperor and Kefka run wild.
Krile:What happened after that?
Cait Sith:We parted ways. There wasn't much else to talk about.
"Cait Sith:Besides, my friends are here. And now you're my friends too."
Penelo:You don't need to exchange more information with him?
Cait Sith:I don't like dictators. And I don't trust politicians.
"Krile:Well, that's good... I believe you."
Penelo:I'm sorry if it sounded like we doubted you...
Cait Sith:Don't worry about it! I'll let you know if I remember anything else!
Mog:Kupo! That monster... It's not like any other we've faced yet!
"Mog:Earth attacks barely harm it, kupo! It's this first time we've seen this resistance!"
"Mog:Be careful, kupo!"
"Sazh:So first there were these interdimensional Torsions, but now our objective is this crystal core..."
Cecil:Briefing him on our journey so far?
Sazh:Just what I needed! People who can tell the story better than I can!
Cait Sith:It all sounds so complicated.
"Cait Sith:Cloud, how 'bout it? Can you do your thing?"
Cecil:...Your thing?
Cloud:...He wants me to wrap up what's happened so far.
Shantotto:Is that something you can do? Perhaps you can show us a thing or two.
"Cecil:In that case, I would appreciate it too."
"Sazh:Hit us with it, kid!"
"Cloud:Alright, I'll give it a shot..."
Cloud:This world we're in isn't our respective worlds; it's a fantasy created by Materia and Spiritus.
"Cloud:Until recently, dimensional Torsions infested this world, opening rifts everywhere."
Cloud:The source of the Torsions was the Blackened Will.
"Mog:It possessed and used me to feed on everyone's powers, kupo."
"Shantotto:Then it manifested into a beast, most powerful after its feast."
"Cecil:We believe this Blackened Will had made its base here, and was trying to devour our home worlds."
Sazh:But we showed him! We took him down for good!
"Sazh:Unfortunately, according to Materia, there's still something sinister lurking out there..."
Cloud:Something that wants to destroy this world. We have no idea who or what it is.
"Mog:Right now our goal is the crystal core, kupo. It's the foundation of this world."
Cloud:The fact that there are monsters and other strange things happening around the core...
"Mog:Is proof that someone with their sights on the core is opening rifts around it, kupo!"
Shantotto:That's a power we share: through dimensions can we tear.
Cait Sith:What!? That's incredible!
"Cecil:As long as you have the strength of will, you can create a passage in this world to get elsewhere."
"Sazh:Can't seem to use it to go back home or to other worlds, though."
"Mog:The power tends to be stronger in Spiritus's warriors, kupo. I hope they're not up to anything..."
"Cait Sith:I see, I see..."
"Cait Sith:So first, we need to get to the core to see who or what is trying to get their hands on it."
"Mog:Right, kupo! I'll guide you there. Follow me!"
Cait Sith:Thank you kindly!
Cait Sith:Bzzt......zzt...... Thank you kindly!
Vayne:...The crystal core. So there is where I will find my answer.
Garland:You are intimate with a warrior of Materia?
Vayne:We are exchanging information. I would you choose your words more carefully.
"Cait Sith:Hmm, two gods and an entity that's consuming dimensions. What have I gotten myself into?"
"Vayne:You do not take the gods' words for truth, do you?"
Cait Sith:I'm just a fortune-telling machine. That's a mite harder question than I can answer.
"Vayne:So you say. However, you have a will of your own, do you not?"
Cait Sith:...What about you? Are you doing what the gods tell you?
Vayne:History is woven by man. In all worlds.
"Cait Sith:Nice sentiment, but there don't seem to be any other people in this world."
"Vayne:Precisely. Here, there is neither nation nor society. Only those chosen by the gods' whim."
Vayne:It is most perverted. A man is human because of the societies he builds.
"Cait Sith:However much a hero you may be in your world, what good is it without having someone to protect?"
Vayne:I have a duty to my nation and my House Solidor.
Vayne:I have no intention of accommodating the gods and their foolish games.
"Cait Sith:I can relate... There's a pile of work waiting for me back home, too."
"Cait Sith:But if Cloud and the gang are fighting for something here, I can't just leave them on their own."
Vayne:I see... You will then join Materia's warriors.
"Cait Sith:Yes, they're my friends. Although..."
"Vayne:For their sake, you desire the information I hold. Am I correct?"
Cait Sith:Leave it to a politician to sense an opportunity for collusion. This'll make things go much faster.
"Cait Sith:Naturally, one hand needs to wash the other. I'll cooperate with you."
"Cait Sith:I found some transmission devices, though one's missing a part. Do you know how to use these?"
Vayne:Hm. So such technology exists here as well.
"Vayne:If you discovered them here, perhaps the missing part can be found in the surrounding rubble."
Cait Sith:Then you take the one that works. I'll hold onto the one that needs fixing.
Vayne:Very well. Then we are in agreement.
Cait Sith:Alrighty. I'll hold up things on my end.
Vayne:Warriors are summoned here from worlds over. The perfect feeding ground for that which devours energy.
Vayne:This world's existence is a threat to mine own.
Garland:You plan to destroy the crystal and with it this world.
Vayne:I even have a guide to lead me. Far wiser than challenging gods with unmeasured powers.
"Garland:Your tongue may be silken, but your fist chooses war. You are as much a slave to bloodshed as I."
Vayne:I dirty my hands to fulfill my duties.
Vayne:Do not conflate me with a bloodthirsty warrior like yourself.
Garland:There is strength to be gained in being true to oneself.
Vayne:A weak excuse.
"Garland:I will watch as you fight for your ""duties."""
"Papalymo:We defeated the Blackened Will, but our memories are still hazy."
"Laguna:It's weird, right? I still feel like I'm forgetting something pretty important. Exactly the same as before."
Squall:(You look exactly the same as before too.)
"Terra:Mog, is there anything you can tell us?"
"Mog:Anyone with the strength of will can create a Torsion here, kupo. Not just the Blackened Will."
"Mog:These unique rifts bend time and space and sometimes create manikins, kupo."
Layle:So Torsions don't exist solely because of the Blackened Will.
"Thancred:We all have the power to create them, Spiritus's warriors included."
Terra:But we've hardly used that power.
Layle:Who's to say? What if we did and just forgot?
Papalymo:Or...our enemies could be using their powers as we speak.
"Mog:There's a possibility they stole our memories and experiences to weaken us, kupo."
"Mog:Or...we unconsciously got rid of our memories and went back in time in order to face a terrible foe, kupo."
Squall:(...Sounds plausible.)
"Laguna:Whatever happened, we don't remember any of it."
"Mog:That's right. And even I don't know what happened to your memories, kupo."
"Thancred:If we all chose to forget, I'm okay with not remembering."
"Layle:Yeah, I suppose you're right."
Terra:But there are some of us who are worried. We need to do something.
Papalymo:You'll simply need to trust the choice made by your past self.
Laguna:I can't remember at all if it was something done to us or something we did to ourselves!
"Layle:Yeah... In the meantime, let's tell everyone the happier version of what could've happened."
Jecht:Did ya hear? There's a chance we forced ourselves to go back in time some odd years when we came to this world.
"Galuf:Hmm, I still feel as old as ever... Why didn't I get any younger?"
"Jecht:It's just one of the theories. 'Sides, weren't you that age when you met Bartz and the others?"
Galuf:I must have chosen experience over youth. I wonder what those who chose youth were thinking.
Ace:People need to forget the past to move forward. Maybe that's exactly what we did to go on.
Jecht:Pretty stoic for a kid.
"Serah:Then was it my decision to come here as the Serah who can fight, instead of the one too scared to do anything?"
Jecht:Of course! Anyone who wants to save family would've done the same.
"Galuf:You know what the future holds in store for Lightning and Hope, and yet you haven't told them."
"Serah:Yeah... I want to, but I don't think they should know."
Ace:Is that because they might change the future? Or destroy other possibilities?
"Serah:There's that, but mostly because if it's something they chose, they need to get there on their own."
"Serah:I know it's unsettling to see a completely different me, but still..."
Ace:It might be an enemy trick done to us for all we know. There's no point thinking about it.
"Warrior of Light:Did we choose this for ourselves, or was it chosen for us?"
Cecil:I remember you said you don't recall anything other than fighting Garland.
"Warrior of Light:When I lost, I sense I lost much more than just the battle."
Warrior of Light:I may have also lost precious memories.
Cecil:I need to get it back. And it's something I need to do myself.
"Warrior of Light:If we used our willpower to lose our memories and experiences, or even if we had them stolen..."
Warrior of Light:We should be able to get them back with that same willpower.
Cecil:I wonder... Will I be able to get back this light that I lost by protecting this world?
"Warrior of Light:Let us believe as we go forth. We may lack our memories, but we still have our allies and our ability to fight."
Cecil:You're right.
"Vayne:So, the center of the world lies just ahead."
Vaan:You were waiting to ambush us!
Garland:You knew it would come to this.
Vayne:Indeed. I never expected the road to open without some dirt on my hands.
Cait Sith:I dinnae like the sound of that. Just what are you planning to do?
Vayne:You came to protect the crystal core and the world. I have no such desire.
Vaan:Why does he know about the core!? What did you tell him!?
"Cloud:Calm down. Cait Sith gave us information on him, too."
Vayne:That arrangement also ends here.
Cait Sith:You got that right!
"Cloud:Cait Sith, tell us later about everything you learned from this guy."
Warrior of Light:Will you continue to fight with us?
Cait Sith:Certainly! I dinnae particularly care for reckless measures like destroying worlds.
"Vayne:""Reckless""? I would say ""reasonable."""
Vaan:It doesn't matter. Why do you want to destroy this world anyway!?
Vayne:Think rationally if you wish to save Ivalice.
Warrior of Light:What will happen to us and the gods if this world is destroyed?
Vayne:That is none of my concern.
Garland:This man does not care if the warriors who walk this earth are annihilated along with the world's destruction.
"Cloud:That's your idea of ""reasonable""? Putting a price on the lives of others?"
"Warrior of Light:You'll save nothing that way! These warriors have people waiting for them to come home, too!"
Garland:Hmph. At last the sword is drawn.
Cloud:Let's say I don't like your way of doing things either.
Warrior of Light:There may...must be a way to protect both those here and the peoples in worlds we came from.
"Warrior of Light:I refuse to give up, no matter how small the spark of hope may be!"
"Garland:So that's how your light shines, I see."
"Garland:At last, a warrior worthy of my blade. Vayne, we fight together."
Vayne:If we must. ...To arms!
Vaan:We won't let you get away with this!
Garland:Come! Show me the light you harbor!
"Vayne:If I am in error, then you had best set me straight."
Vaan:You bet we will! We all feel the same!
"Warrior of Light:Verily, we shall not bend!"
"Mog:The core is here, kupo, in the Crystal Chamber."
Warrior of Light:The crystal core... The foundation of the world...
"Onion Knight:I don't know why, but this place feels familiar."
Edgar:Is there something similar in your world?
"Bartz:There was in mine. Well, kind of."
Bartz:I get the same warm feeling in here like the place back home.
"Lightning:I don't have fond memories of crystal, but..."
"Lightning:As you say, this place feels familiar. ...It's strange."
Onion Knight:The core is the center of this worlda world created based on all of our homes.
Tidus:Is that why it feels like we've been here before?
Warrior of Light:Do not let your guard down. I feel a presence. Once with untempered will.
Tidus:Then come on! We'll find 'em and show 'em what we got!
Edgar:Right. Then we might be able to save our own worlds.
"Onion Knight:...I know we haven't done anything yet, but seeing the light here gives me hope."
Warrior of Light:Come! Let's fight together.
"Tidus:""The light is with us!"""
Exdeath:Mwa ha ha... Devourer... Open the Rift that all may return to theVoid.
"Kefka:Hiding something so delicious from us! Oooh, what naughty gods."
"Cloud of Darkness:Where the balance is disrupted, that is where we exist."
Spiritus:You think you are any different?
Vayne:I answer to no god. I am ruled by no one.
Spiritus:Then show me as you go against the order of this world.
"Vayne:Spiritus, why do you stand by as they destroy your creation?"
"Vayne:If you had a duty to protect your world, you would not have summoned those with minds of destruction."
"Spiritus:This is not ""my world."""
"Spiritus:Mine is another world, one of unending strife. That is what maintains my realm."
Spiritus:This world was to be a place of respite for those warriors. Or so it was made to appear...
"Spiritus:If those warriors wish to continue their battles here, so be it."
Vayne:Another world? Made to appear?
Spiritus:A parallel world in which warriors fight endlessly of their own volition. This world is merely its counterbalance.
Vayne:I have a home to return to! As does the urchin and all the others! Who do you think you are!?
Spiritus:What are you going to do?
Vayne:I will destroy this world.
Vayne:And then I will destroy everything. I will take back my life with my own hands.
Spiritus:Hmph... You cry for justice and in the end follow the order of this world.
"Spiritus:Fight, my warrior. And feed my world!"
"Mog:Look! There's something by the core, kupo!"
Firion:It's...latched onto the crystal? It's absorbing its light!
Vaan:So all we need to do is peel it off!
Cecil:Vaan! Who else is here!?
Kefka:He he he! The planesgorger is enjoying his meal.
Firion:Planesgorger!? Explain yourelf!
Ultimecia:This one is but an infant... Planesgorgers devour everything...
"Ultimecia:They devour light and power, and once full, they await to hatch."
"Mog:An infant, kupo...!? How did that make its way in here!?"
Ultimecia:The new larvae gathered using the power of the Blackened Will as a guide...
Exdeath:The planesgorgers wish to grow and devour the world! And give birth to nothingness!
"Mog:Kupo... This is all my fault, kupo..."
"Vaan:Don't say that! Let's just focus on defeating that thing, 'kay?"
Kefka:Boooring! This crystal is on a one-way trip to roughed up one side and back down the other!
"Kefka:Oh, in case you didn't know, the Blackened Will was also an itty-bitty teeny-weeny part of a planesgorger♪"
Exdeath:It used the moogle to consume the energy it needed to mature.
Exdeath:There must have been a problem with the host. That it would hatch in that form was unexpected.
"Mog:A planesgorger was in me, kupo...?"
"Exdeath:But thanks to you, moogle, its larvae made its way to this world. I applaud you."
Exdeath:It is only a matter of time until this world becomes as the Void!
Firion:Shut up! We're not going to let that happen!
Vaan:You think we're gonna stand around while that thing gets bigger and eats our worlds? Not a chance!
Vayne:We can resolve this from our respective worlds.
Vaan:Who asked you?
"Vayne:I have no desire to be a tool for these gods. Once the crystal is destroyed, we will be free."
Cecil:Hold! The crystal won't last much longer!
Firion:We can make a break for it!
Vaan:Stay outta our way!
"Mog:It's cracking, kupo...!!"
Cecil:No... What'll happen to this world now?
Kefka:I'd be more worried about what's going to happen to me if I were you-hoo.
"Mog:Th-the planesgorger's coming this way, kupo!"
Firion:Don't take your eyes off the beast! We need to fight it!
"Mog:It may be little, but it's a planesgorger, kupo!"
"Mog:It's gotten tremendous power from the crystal, kupo!"
"Mog:It can use the crystal's power to absorb some elemental attacks, kupo! Watch out!"
"Firion:Even so, we've got to fight!"
"Cecil:Indeed, we mustn't allow it to devour this world!"
Yuri:We defeated it...but what about the crystal core?
Y'shtola:...It shattered.
Warrior of Light:What is this light? ...It's brilliant...and full of...
Warrior of Light:...The things I've lost.
Chelinka:Your memories? Have they returned?
"Warrior of Light:No, but I sense...something."
Squall:Now? Really?
Warrior of Light:Has the world's destruction begun!?
Y'shtola:The world's foundation is ruined... ...Is this where it ends for us?
Materia:No. It is not the end of everything.
Materia:...There is still time.
Yuri:It stopped! Did you do this?
Materia:No. The core of darkness has sensed a shift in balance.
Y'shtola:...This is news. There is more than one core?
Materia:The pillar of this world is created from a crystal of light and a crystal of darkness.
Materia:You have been traveling through the planes of that of light.
"Onion Knight:Where there's light, there's darkness... Does that mean the darkness has become stronger?"
Materia:Only temporarily. The crystal core of darkness is sustaining the world for now.
"Materia:But without both cores, the world will inevitably collapse."
"Chelinka:Um, is there anything we can do? I know this crystal has shattered..."
Materia:There is hope.
Materia:That shining power you picked up...
Warrior of Light:The part of the crystal I absorbed?
Materia:You can all do the same.
Materia:And when countless warriors have acquired that brilliance...
Materia:The crystal core of light may be revived.
Y'shtola:None of the pieces here are as brilliant. The others must have been cast outside this realm.
Squall:The planes ruled by the dark crystal core. Our next goal.
"Materia:It will be an arduous journey. However, the light will give you new power."
Squall:What about the warriors of Spiritus? They seemed to want the world destroyed.
Materia:They must now seek the dark crystal core head for its world. They may even have already gained pieces of light.
Onion Knight:Way to stack the odds.
"Squall:We have no choice. You have a rival to worry about, too, right?"
"Onion Knight:Right. ...When the balance between light and darkness crumbles, that's when it appears."
"Materia:Spirit moogle, can you guide these warriors?"
"Mog:Of course! I'll do my best, kupo!"
"Mog:I'd like to borrow your power to get there, kupo."
"Materia:Very well. Now go, my warriors. ...Protect this land."
"Warrior of Light:The light is with us. Let us come together for our friends, for our homes!"
Kuja:Heading off to another battle?
Kuja:You're so predictable. Always searching for conflict and war.
Garland:And you? What keeps you going?
"Garland:This world was created not for war, but for respite. Absurd."
Garland:There is no meaning to a life devoid of struggle.
Kuja:So that's why you're sowing the seeds of battle?
"Kuja:You stole his memories, didn't you?"
Garland:Hmph. They are too pure for this world.
Warrior of Light:I have allies from other worlds who fought with me by order of the gods.
Warrior of Light:They can finally rest their weary bodies. I refuse to allow you to take that from them!
Garland:Weakling. You know nothing of this world's order.
Garland:Every world has its reason.
Garland:You cling to the light without knowing why. You are no warrior!
Garland:A brief moment of respite awaits you and your amnesiac allies through death!
Warrior of Light:No! I will protect them!
Warrior of Light:Nnh...!
"Garland:Death will come for you time and time again, while I survive in eternity..."
Garland:Let the will of light disappear!
"Kuja:But he found another way. He fought alongside his allies, and at times found ways to defeat us..."
"Kuja:I presume that brings you joy, yes?"
Kuja:As the planesgorger's existence means neverending strife.
"Garland:If you have such time to observe others, it's time you observed your own avarice."
Garland:Have you thought of why they let us live? Or how we choose to live?
Garland:Or shall the great Garland educate you?
???:...There is no worthy history here.
???:What do you think of this world?
???:A world in which the eats and faults of the dead disappear into chaos.
???:I was...once.
"???:""Was""? Once you're a l'Cie, there's no going back."
"???:It bears the same name, but differs in your world and mine."
"???:Seven, is it? You possess a heightened soul."
Seven:How do you know my name? Who are you? Where are we?
"Caius:I am Caius Ballad, protector of history."
"Caius:But in this world without history, I am but a warrior."
"Seven:That goddess, Materia, told me my friends were here."
Seven:Have you seen them? They have uniforms like mine.
"Seven:Apparently they're working with people from other worlds, like you."
Caius:You must begin your journey.
"Caius:Seek the knight they call Lightning, and you will find your friends."
Caius:...We will meet again at the appointed time.
"Seven:Wait, but"
Caius:The goddess's knight remembers nothing of her duty.
Caius:...Forgive me.
Rem:*cough cough*
Garnet:Are you alright?
"Rem:Yes, thank you. The darkness must not agree with me...or something. Haha..."
"Rem:(I'd been feeling so well lately, too...)"
Garnet:Whoa! What was that!?
"Mog:The sky is falling, kupo!"
Ashe:What about the ship? Can it fly?
Sazh:No luck! Nothing's responding!
"Setzer:There's a crack in the tail! We need to put her down, Sazh!"
"Sazh:I'm trying! I can't see a damn thing, much less find a place to land!"
Cecil:This does not bode well.
Cecil:What was that!?
Layle:We're under attack! That one left us with a serious breach on our hands!
Garnet:No! Is everyone alright?
"Layle:No one's hurt, but I don't know how long this ship'll hold..."
"Mog:Kupo! Everyone gather around me, and fast, kupo!"
Setzer:What's that?
"Mog:The armor won't last much longer, kupo! We need to escape!"
Ashe:How? Are there escape pods?
"Cecil:Even if there were, there wouldn't be enough... Unless some of us..."
"Mog:Come on, Sazh! I'll save you all kupo!"
"Sazh:...The helm's busted, which means landing's out of the question. Now what do we do?"
"Mog:Close your eyes, kupo! Hurry!"
Layle:Heh... Some escape plan you got there.
"Mog:I won't let anything bad happen to you...or your light, kupo."
"Mog:These coordinates...should do it, kupo... Please take care...of..."
Cecil:We are...on firm ground?
Ashe:There he is! He must've been thrown from the wreckage.
"Garnet:Oh, no! Is he breathing!?"
"Setzer:He's not responding, but he's still warm."
Sazh:The little guy must've teleported us to safety.
"Layle:Looks like he's unconscious... Anyone's guess when he'll come to, though."
Garnet:Did you try healing magic? Is there nothing we can do?
"Setzer:He's a guardian spirit. We tried, but nothing worked."
Ashe:Which means we are on our own to find our way...
Layle:Coming here was what we set out to do. Let's hide him someplace safe and think of what to do next.
Cecil:So this is the World of Darkness...?
"Warrior of Light:With Mog asleep, we have no choice but to forge our own path."
"Squall:Seems that way. What are we collecting now? ""Brilliance""?"
"Edge:Oh, yeah, didn't you say you remembered something when you picked up that piece?"
Ace:You said it contained things you'd lost.
"Warrior of Light:Yes, fragments. Memories of my journey...and my friends."
"Edge:Think we'll get them back, too? I can't shake this feeling I'm forgetting something important."
Edge:Like I already knew Cecil and everyone else from the same world before we ended up here.
Squall:The others from my world are concerned about the gaps in their memories too.
"Warrior of Light:There is power in the light. Memories, experiences, will..."
"Warrior of Light:The moment you hold it, something inside you will change. ...That is all I can say."
Ace:There was a lot I'd forgotten even when I was still in Orience.
Ace:I never imagined being unable to remember could cause such concern in your worlds...
"???:Ace!? Ace, is that you!?"
Edge:Oh ho! Who's this pretty lady?
Squall:One of Ace's classmates from the look of it.
Seven:And you must be the otherworlders. I've heard about you.
Ace:You met the goddess?
"Seven:Yes, and someone else, too. He opened a path of some sort that brought me here."
"Edge:Well, that was nice of him!"
Seven:...I don't know much about him. I was just anxious to find my friends.
"Warrior of Light:Rest assured, everyone here is on your side."
Seven:Your armor... Are you...a knight?
Squall:Why do you ask?
Seven:I was told to find a knight named Lightning.
"Edge:Lightning a knight? She's got a sword, but knight ain't the first word I'd use to describe her."
"Ace:She's with us, but I believe she's former military."
Warrior of Light:A knight of the goddess...
???:As memories intersect...so does destiny.
Squall:An enemy!
"Ace:Seven, we'll talk later. Can you support us?"
Seven:As if you had to ask!
"Yang:I braced for the worst, but...I had no idea Mog had such power."
"Zell:The ship went down, but we all got out without a scrape!"
Faris:Looks like he's really shaken off whatever had him before.
Aerith:We'll have to thank him when he wakes up.
Lion:The attack... Was it magic?
"Firion:No. From the deck, I saw what looked like a giant sword."
Zell:'A sword? In the sky?
"Firion:It obliterated the propulsion system, which is what caused this entire mess."
Faris:What a shame... She was a fine boat.
Lion:I'm sure we'll find ourselves face-to-face with this mysterious foe at some point.
Aerith:The World of Darkness seems a lot scarier than where we were before. The monsters may be stronger than what we're used to.
"Zell:Aw, man..."
Firion:You knew what you were getting yourself into.
"Zell:Yeah, yeah!"
Yang:We need to be strong in this time of distress. For Mog.
"Faris:Let's keep going. When Mog wakes up, he'll see he's got nothing to worry about."
Zidane:Is he a manikin!?
Auron:Something's different. ...He's not hostile.
Seifer:Well? You friend or foe? Out with it!
???:Warriors with wills...of light.
Warrior of Light:He sounds...just like me. Who are you?
Dark Manikin (Warrior of Light):We are dark manikins born from the crystal core of darkness to protect this realm.
"Shantotto:You don't say? So unlike the light, the crystal of dark actually prepared for a fight."
Auron:Light and darkness: two sides of the same coin.
Zidane:You're protectors of this world? Why do you look like us?
"Dark Manikin (Warrior of Light):...Upon sensing a threat, the crystal created replicas of the protectors of light."
Dark Manikin (Warrior of Light):We are mirror images that possess powers similar to yours.
"Seifer:If you're here, what did we need to come for?"
Seifer:Fix your problems yourselves.
Warrior of Light:He...and I are different. I sense no...light in his will.
Dark Manikin (Warrior of Light):I am but a mere image. An empty vessel with no heart.
Seifer:Hmph. Then what good are you?
"Auron:You came here for a reason, didn't you?"
"Shantotto:Speak up, dear. I don't want to stand around here all year."
Dark Manikin (Warrior of Light):Though we are empty...we may be of help.
Auron:Empty... I'm not one to deny your existence...
"Warrior of Light:Warrior of the World of Darkness, do you wish to fight?"
"Dark Manikin (Warrior of Light):Yes. Warrior of the World of Light, test your blade against mine!"
Dark Manikin (Warrior of Light):Warriors of the World of Light. You could not find it...
Dark Manikin (Warrior of Light):The light shining in the darkness. I beg you defeat me...and find your own light!
"Warrior of Light:Is that how it is...? Very well. In order to surpass myself, I will strike you down..."
"Dark Manikin (Warrior of Light):...Well done, warriors of the realm of light."
"Onion Knight:You tested us, didn't you?"
"Dark Manikin (Warrior of Light):We may lack power, but there are many more of us than there are you."
Dark Manikin (Warrior of Light):There is much to gain from each and every battle with us.
"Bartz:That's kinda exciting, meeting someone who looks and sounds just like me."
Terra:I find it a little frightening. I don't want to have to fight someone who's just like one of us.
Dark Manikin (Warrior of Light):...The battles are not merely to test your strength.
Dark Manikin (Warrior of Light):There are those of us who possess the brilliance you seek.
Y'shtola:The light we seek will instead come to us? A fine story.
"Cait Sith:So we fight you dark manikins, and you fork over brilliance. Easy peasy."
Onion Knight:Will they give it up that easily?
Dark Manikin (Warrior of Light):It may depend on the individual.
"Dark Manikin (Warrior of Light):As we are empty vessels devoid of hearts, we are prone to succumb to the will of darkness."
Y'shtola:And so there are those who would use you as puppets.
Terra:How awful!
"Onion Knight:Right away, a few names come to mind..."
Cait Sith:We'll make sure to be on our guard whenever we come across one of you.
Dark Manikin (Warrior of Light):Warriors of the World of Light. You are our hope.
"Dark Manikin (Warrior of Light):Without the light's crystal core, the world is being sustained by the dark crystal alone."
Dark Manikin (Warrior of Light):...It is only a matter of time.
Onion Knight:The balance has already collapsed. ...We need to hurry.
Terra:But is it enough for us to simply press forward?
"Dark Manikin (Warrior of Light):We are scattered all across this realm, fighting, waiting for you."
"Bartz:Alrighty, time to go where the wind takes us!"
Dark Manikin (Warrior of Light):Go. Fight what is ahead.
Bartz:Leave it to me. Roaming's what I do best!
"Onion Knight:It's not a perfect plan, but at least we have a goal."
Terra:Thank you for teaching us what you know.
Dark Manikin (Warrior of Light):The dark must work with the light.
Garland:Here we have a creator of chaos.
Garland:Was it not you who destroyed their airship?
Caius:Chaos is not what I desire.
Caius:You show no surprise being faced with an otherworldly being. You've been here long.
"Garland:I hail from another world. There, I have battled the same foes in an endless war."
"Garland:However, this world of respite has assembled many warriors new to me."
"Garland:What is your purpose here? As a fellow agent of chaos, I will lend you my wisdom."
"Caius:In the world I come from, I was...a guardian of history."
"Caius:This realm is now being ravaged by world-eating wyrms, is it not?"
Garland:Indeed. Planesgorgers...the larvae of Shinryu are chewing holes throughout this world.
Caius:Which is what connects this world with ours...
Caius:...The situation soon before us is the upheaval of order itself.
Garland:Your precious history will surely be rewritten.
"Garland:But the goddess Materia gathers warriors of light to face this ""situation."""
Caius:I won't become the slave of any goddess.
Caius:I have no good memories associated with that moniker.
Garland:Then what will you do? Your history has already begun to crumble.
Caius:Changing the future will change the past...
"Caius:If history will inevitably be rewritten, I shall rid the past of tragedy."
Garland:You think yourself a savior?
Caius:Think what you want.
Caius:There is power in the order of other worlds. The power to change a tragic past.
Garland:You wish to change even the order of worlds...
Garland:...To go back in time and create the history you desire.
"Caius:Were you not once a knight with someone you mustforgive me, someone you wished to protect?"
Garland:Here I am a warrior of ceaseless battle. But if you intend to pry further...
Caius:I care not about your past. I have others to deal with.
"Garland:They are searching for brilliance. Follow its light, and there you shall find your enemy."
Caius:I will heed your words.
Caius:Knight of the Goddess...it's time to end this eternal battle of ours.
Caius:...Finally.
"Lightning:Serah, you know this man?"
Serah:You don't know him yet...but I do. And I need to protect you all from him!
"Caius:So it's true. You don't remember. However, I did send a messenger."
"Seven:Sorry, there was so much going on. I didn't have time to tell them."
"Yda:You know him, too?"
"Seven:When I arrived in this world, he told me to seek Lightning."
"Seven:But she wasn't the knight he said she'd be, so I kept quiet."
Lightning:A knight? Is that some sort of joke?
Serah:No... You just don't remember.
"Tidus:Is this our mixed-up memories again? Only Serah can remember stuff from the future, was it?"
"Caius:In my world, you could say I am the nemesis of these sisters."
Yda:Then that makes you a villain!
Caius:...Hm. I found a purpose in this world.
Caius:Lightning... I desire to make amends to you.
Serah:What are you up to?
"Caius:Seven...and Ace. You said you were from ""Orience."""
Ace:How do you know my name? Who are you?
Caius:I did a little research.
Caius:I learned that the crystals in your world grant you powers.
Seven:The crystal's blessing... Then you know it makes us forget the dead.
Caius:I have done terrible things due to my obsession over the ones I've lost.
"Caius:My duty was to protect history. Instead, I distorted it."
Tidus:So what did you do to Lightning?
Caius:But look at us now.
Caius:The power to forget the dead is most rational.
Caius:If we introduce the laws of Orience to our world through these tears...
"Caius:History will be rewritten. My errors, the battles you've suffered, the many tragedies will be avoided and forgotten."
Ace:Connecting different worlds would make everything we've done here pointless.
"Lightning:Thanks, but no thanks."
"Caius:Are you certain? You may have forgotten, but our battle ends in tragedy."
Caius:Forgetting the dead will leave a happier history.
Yda:Now I'm sure you're a villain! And I'm a mite livid!
Tidus:I was just thinking the same thing! C'mon!
Tidus:There's something wrong with you if you think you're better off forgetting about those who've died!
"Caius:Come, I will help you remember how fierce your battle with me was!"
"Caius:All will vanish... Given that, the oblivescence of memory is an act of purification from the dead to the living..."
Caius:Would you deny this?
Yuna:Please do not speak for those who would disappear! It is too tragic.
Caius:I believe we shall never see eye to eye... So by force shall I cause you to heed my atonement!
"Caius:Heh... Even without your memories, you've proven you're still a goddess's knight."
Lightning:And now you're running away?
Caius:The larvae of Shinryu are consuming this world. Seek them out to find the truth...and your memories.
"Caius:Do not forget... I've lived close to an eternity, and I've escaped death time and time again."
Caius:I have thrown the world into chaos because I cared for the dead. It's better that I forget.
Jecht:Ugh! Punk's just shooting his mouth off!
"Lightning:I don't remember him, but I do remember this...this feeling."
Serah:I wonder if he means it. That it's better to forget.
Serah:But you don't know because you're who you were before you became a knight.
"Lightning:Serah, why didn't you tell me about him!? What is he!?"
Jecht:Give it a rest. I thought we agreed we gotta remember stuff ourselves for it to mean anything.
Rem:We forget...so we can move on...
Rem:Even if it's sad to be forgotten...it's the right thing to do...
Snow:Cheer up!
"Snow:You know we're not gonna figure anything out standin' here talking about it, right?"
Snow:We're gonna keep going until we find our light!
"Lightning:Yeah, thanks, cheerleader. I suppose you remember him, too."
"Snow:Nope, not one bit."
Rem:But you fought him anyway.
Snow:He's Serah's enemy. That's reason enough for me.
"Jecht:Ha! I like you, kid."
"Serah:Lightning, Rem. Let's keep going, okay?"
"Serah:If Caius is up to something, I...need to stop him."
"Snow:Yeah, let's do it! And don't worry, Serah. I'll protect everyone if I have to."
Serah:I didn't think we'd have so much trouble finding this brilliance.
"Papalymo:Serah, can you tell us more about this Caius fellow?"
Galuf:I'd also like to know more too about this man who wants to change history.
"Papalymo:So to make amends to Lightning, he wants to change history to avoid involving her in his war?"
"Serah:I don't know what he's up to, really. He's always been hard to read."
Galuf:It sounds selfish to me.
"Galuf:It's a poor idea, using the ways of another world to solve the problems of your own."
Yuna:I can't imagine being happier by not remembering those who've passed...
Yuna:...It doesn't make any sense.
"Aerith:You have a kind heart, Yuna."
"Galuf:Death is sad and permanent, but when someone close to you dies, it changes who you are."
Yuna:It's their memories that give me the strength to fight.
Ace:Can this be?
"Ace:I thought we were all the same, and that we just happened to be from different worlds."
Ace:I didn't realize the ways of Orience were so contrary to others.
"Ace:I thought we were in this together, but I can't even understand what they're going through."
Warrior of Light:Are you feeling alone?
Ace:You wouldn't understand.
Warrior of Light:I never told you my story. How could I? I myself had forgotten it.
Ace:Are you like us?
Warrior of Light:Not exactly. But I'm not unlike you.
Warrior of Light:My journey was unknown to others.
King:Some sort of secret mission?
Warrior of Light:No. I traveled to the past and destroyed the root of all evil.
Warrior of Light:The people of my time don't know that evil ever even existed.
Ace:And you were okay with that?
Warrior of Light:My battles were not for praise or reward. Is it not the same for you?
Ace:Was there meaning to the battles we fought back in Orience?
"Warrior of Light:You left behind something for those who remain, and for history that may continue."
"Warrior of Light:Even if people may forget your existence, the light in your heart will never expire."
Ace:The light...in my heart.
Chelinka:Caius is trying to change history...by changing the order of the worlds.
Yuri:Right. I bet he's lying about wanting to make things right.
"Chelinka:He said that the ways of Orience would bring happiness, but that's just how it works in your world, yes?"
Ace:I don't know. Our lives were all about fighting and war.
"Yuri:So even if Caius is able to pull it off, the same thing will probably happen in his world, too."
"Chelinka:Even if you change history, some things can't change, and there's a cost to it..."
Yuri:We've witnessed that...
Yuri:Each world has its own rules for a reason.
"Yuri:So you, Lightning, and even us, we have to follow the respective rules of our worlds."
"Chelinka:We can't use our powers here like we could in our world, but we've chosen to use them to protect everyone."
Warrior of Light:We're here because we all possess the same light.
Warrior of Light:We've been allies since the beginning and we will continue to be.
Ace:Thank you.
"Warrior of Light:If any of you loses your light, each and every one of us will take its place."
"Garland:Hmph. Say what you will, but the cycle of war continues."
Garland:I have come to test the power of your light!
Warrior of Light:I will strike you down as many times as it takes. ...Are you with me?
Ace:I am. I have faith in what you've told me.
"King:Let's believe we have the light inside of us, too."
"Garland:So, you crossed swords with the warriors of darkness... Let us see how much light you reclaimed!"
"Warrior of Light:I am not the only warrior embracing light. With our light together, we will end this cycle of conflict!"
"Serah:Caius is set on using the laws of Orience, and he's going to do whatever it takes."
Serah:He's going to use his position to try to change history to what he thinks it should be.
Squall:(...She seems to know a thing or two about it.)
Shantotto:Is it true a unique power is possessed by you two?
Yuri:Only back in our world.
Chelinka:And it's not as if we can do whatever we'd like.
Chelinka:We're presented with possibilities.
Yuri:And we choose one from many.
Serah:So you can't go to worlds that aren't possible?
Yuri:That's right. I don't even know if they exist in the first place.
Chelinka:And we don't want to see the possibilities we wouldn't want anyway.
Lilisette:Is rewriting history...a bad thing?
Squall:...You're asking the wrong person.
Squall:But I'm not the one to decide if it's right or wrong.
"Lilisette:What do you say, Professor?"
"Shantotto:That is like asking, ""What is just?"""
"Shantotto:Right or wrong, using your power to obtain what you desire is a must."
"Serah:Whatever the case, I need to stop Caius before he can drag other worlds into this."
Lilisette:You're right. I know dragging other worlds into his plan is a bad thing.
Yuri:Ace and the others from Orience are concerned about their values differing from everyone else's.
Chelinka:I don't blame him. Anyone would be if they were told about the differing laws of other worlds. Let's do what we can to put their minds at ease.
Serah:You two can be really mature sometimes.
Serah:Even more than me sometimes.
Yuri:That's not true. Chelinka here is afraid of gho
Chelinka:Yuri! Stop it! That was a long time ago.
Lilisette:Different values indeed.
Rem:Dark manikins!
Lightning:Is that supposed to be me?
Dark Manikin (Lightning):Is it?
Hope:They seem strange. More...subdued than those before.
Dark Manikin (Serah):Maybe. We've allied with Caius.
"Lightning:Hah... You look like Serah, but obviously you're nothing like her."
"Dark Manikin (Hope):But we may be happier, Light."
Lightning:Don't call me that.
"Dark Manikin (Serah):Come on, Sis."
Lightning:I don't need to listen to this. Let's go.
"Rem:Wait, even if Caius did get to them, they might have the brilliance we need."
"Dark Manikin (Lightning):Lightning from the World of Light, you must ally with Caius."
"Dark Manikin (Lightning):You don't know because you don't remember. The strife ""I"" had to endure..."
Dark Manikin (Serah):Caius plans to rewrite everything. Even the mistakes of my past.
"Dark Manikin (Serah):I can have a happy, simple life, just like you wanted for me."
Lightning:Don't act like you know us! You're nothing but empty vessels.
Hope:Stop it!
Hope:You have no right to talk about her!
Dark Manikin (Hope):Isn't there a part of you that wonders what it would be like if things had been different?
"Dark Manikin (Hope):I know you still remember her face, what happened to her. Doesn't it hurt?"
Dark Manikin (Hope):That can change. You can make the pain go away.
"Hope:I've prayed for the past to change. I have lots of regrets. It hurts, like you said."
Hope:But even so...
Hope:I never once wanted to forget!
"Hope:Years ago, I met Light and all my other friends. It was a hard time in my life, but the memories are precious."
Dark Manikin (Hope):You wouldn't be in pain if you hadn't met them.
Hope:It doesn't matter how bad the situation is. There's always hope in things to come.
"Hope:There's no value in what never happened! Everyone holds hope for the future, that's what keeps us going!"
Hope:So stop trying to disparage me and my feelings!
Rem:Hope...in things to come...
"Hope:Let's do it, Light! Let's show them that their empty words are meaningless!"
"Dark Manikin (Hope):Why do you choose the hard road? You gave your friends no small amount of grief that time, didn't you?"
"Dark Manikin (Serah):Yeah, Hope. You want to forget all the trouble you caused, right? Well, me too."
Hope:No! We were fighting...fighting against our fate!
Hope:I'm going to accept my past and fight. For the future. For everything from now on... For everyone!
Hope:Is this...the brilliance?
Hope:My memories...of times I'd lost...
Serah:Hope! Do you remember?
Hope:I think so. I know who the Serah standing in front of me is.
Lightning:There was nothing in mine.
"Serah:Wait, so that means Hope, you have your memories as an adult."
"Hope:Yeah, I may look like this, but I'm older than you remember."
Serah:I wonder if it's because of Caius.
"Hope:No, I'm beginning to remember what happened when I came to this world."
"Hope:When I was drifting between dimensions, I chose this appearance."
Lightning:Why wouldn't you choose your older self? Wouldn't he be stronger?
"Serah:Hope has always been strong, even when he was a kid."
"Hope:I chose this because this is what I looked like when I was with you, Light."
"Hope:When I grew up, you were far away. So far, there was no chance of ever seeing you again."
Lightning:...My battle with Caius?
"Serah:Well, I guess there's no hiding it anymore."
"Hope:Are you sure, Serah?"
"Serah:You became the Knight of Etro, and you were caught in an eternal battle with Caius."
"Hope:Serah, I, and all the others, we tried to protect history from Caius because that was what you wanted."
"Serah:When you remember everything, you'll also remember how much pain it caused you."
Lightning:I'd rather know. And I'll face whatever future awaits.
Hope:I knew you'd say that.
"Dark Manikin (Snow):Even in a different world, you're still the same ol' Light."
Serah:There's more of them!?
"Dark Manikin (Sazh):Aww, you really think so little of me!? I don't trust that Caius one bit."
"Dark Manikin (Vanille):But we're just reflections, so it's hard to tell what's right from wrong."
"Dark Manikin (Sazh):That's right. We have good memories and bad ones, but we don't have the hearts to feel anything."
Dark Manikin (Snow):That's why you need to fight us and find out for us!
Lightning:You don't have to ask twice.
"Sazh:I don't know how I feel about fighting a non-manikin me... Even if you say you're empty inside, you're still alive, yeah?"
Dark Manikin (Sazh):Yeah... We're alive. But listen...we got nothing in us...and that makes us real impressionable to all sorts of different ways of thinking.
Dark Manikin (Sazh):That's why we're gonna trust us from the World of Light.
"Vanille:Sounds that Sazh also has a pretty good head on his shoulders. This'll work out. Let's trust us, too."
"Dark Manikin (Snow):Nice... Alright, then! Here's to hoping this little light of mine is gonna help you guys out some..."
Snow:Yeah! Let's do this!
"Sazh:Whoa! The memories really just come flooding back, don't they?"
Vanille:What a strange feeling. It's like...I'm not me anymore.
"Cloud:You forgot that you forgot, didn't you?"
Warrior of Light:I know how strange it must feel.
Snow:But now I know. I can never take his side.
Snow:I never wanted to forget. I'm glad I remembered.
"Vanille:It hurts, and there are a lot of sad memories, but I don't want to erase any of it."
"Sazh:Man, now I remember what that Caius did!"
"Sazh:I don't know how he thinks he's going to pull this off, the whole changing the past thing."
Vaan:He said he wanted to make things right with Lightning.
Vanille:I don't believe that at all. He's just doing what he wants to do.
Snow:He's put us through enough as it is. I'm never taking his side.
Warrior of Light:We need to find him before it's too late. He's headed for the planesgorgers.
Vaan:Look at that!
Cloud:Did the dark manikins leave behind a sign to show us the way?
Warrior of Light:They must have not been touched by darkness.
Snow:Then let's get this show on the road!
Cyan:Thou art more advanced in years than it would appear.
Hope:Yes. I don't believe I'm quite your age...but maybe around Edgar's.
Edgar:Perhaps that's why you seem so mature.
"Tidus:Uh-oh, I should be more polite when I talk to you now, huh?"
"Hope:No, please, don't do that."
"Vivi:Hmm, so that means..."
Vivi:...You're really old.
Hope:I...I don't think I'm THAT old.
Edgar:Grownups are all ancient in a child's eyes.
"Hope:Oof...that one hurt, though..."
"Tidus:Buck up! Hey, you're still a kid on the outside!"
Cyan:And it's also good to be young at heart.
Hope:I guess...
Hope:This feels strange.
Vincent:You'll get used to it.
Hope:You too?
Vincent:I did back in my world. I've lived a lot longer than you'd think.
Hope:I had no idea.
Vincent:It's not a story worth sharing.
Vincent:You said you cherished the time you spent with Lightning.
Hope:I do. I couldn't as an adult.
"Vincent:You want to protect that memory, don't you?"
Hope:Of course.
Vincent:Then do just that.
Vincent:Holding onto regrets is nothing but a waste of time.
Lightning:Caius!
Caius:Have you come to join me? Have you learned the truth and wish to change the past?
Lightning:I fought because I chose to. I don't want your pity.
Caius:This wyrm will feed and become an adult. Then I will be able to change the ways of our world.
"Caius:Rem, was it? You shoulder a terrible burden, bound to the order of your world."
"Caius:If the orders of our worlds are altered, won't you be freed from your fate?"
Caius:Your fate of being forgotten as your body slowly
Rem:Stop it!
"Caius:If you join me, you and your world can change."
Rem:......There is a part of me that would like to go with you.
Rem:But I need to accept my fate.
Rem:I need to face it and fight.
Rem:Everyone I've met here has had to do the same.
Rem:So I will too!
Ace:The ways of our world are our problem.
Seven:And other worlds can't be changed with our ways.
"Serah:You say you want to make things right, but you're just hurting my sister even more!"
Serah:Using the fact that she's lost her memories to throw her off...
Serah:That's going to end now! I won't let you hurt her anymore!
Caius:So that is the future you choose?
Rem:That's right. We choose how to live our lives. We choose our own path.
"Ace:I won't let anyone get in the way of that, and I'm not going to change my beliefs because of yours!"
"Seven:You wanted an answer, you got one."
"Lightning:You heard them, Caius."
Lightning:Our eternal battle ends here!
"Caius:Very well, Knight of the Goddess."
"Caius:Accept it, Knight of the Goddess. Shinryu is the key to breaking the gods' curse."
"Caius:That world itself will be atonement. The gods will be unable to touch that world, and you, too, will truly be free."
"Lightning:What are you babbling about? I've got things I want to protect, and I don't have time for your unilateral view on the matter."
"Caius:Heh... Warrior Goddess, let us now this once celebrate!"
Caius:It's gone. I have no reason to stay in this world.
Lightning:Stop it!
"Caius:Distorting order, putting lives to rest."
Caius:Isolating the world of the living into nothing.
Caius:You don't remember what chaos brought to our world.
Caius:Could these Torsions be used to rewrite this world's order?
Caius:Then I may truly be able to atone for my sins.
"Seven:Don't listen to him, Lightning."
Lightning:I won't let you do that!
Caius:Very well. Then let this monster drag you into the chaos.
"Caius:You will drown, and our eternal battle will finally come to an end!"
Hope:She's not alone! I'm here too!
Hope:I don't want our world's future or past to be erased!
Hope:The person I am now...I know I can protect you and the future!
Lightning:Then let's fight.
Caius:Being unable to let go of the past means you don't understand what the future holds.
Caius:You poor souls. You continue to fight as puppets of the gods.
Caius:Be prepared to face devastation!
Tidus:Ugh! I am so sick of people going on about the dead this and the dead that! Give it a rest already!
Caius:Enough... Playtime is over!
Seven:Don't let your guard down!
Rem:Do you know what we're up against?
Seven:Yeah... I had my own run-in before I hooked up with you guys...
Seven:It's got a pretty tough resistance to physical attacks. Better to focus on magic... Be ready for anything.
Caius:I refuse to disappear. I have yet to fulfill my duty.
"Seven:He just can't get enough, can he?"
Serah:Your light!
"Lightning:So that's what he meant, ""knight of the goddess."""
Hope:You remember!
"Lightning:I do. My battle against Caius, Serah's journey, and you, Hope, all grown up."
Lightning:I'm sorry...for everything.
"Hope:It's okay! I'm just glad to be with you right here, right now."
Serah:That's right! Everyone's here. It's kinda strange when you think about it.
Lightning:There are still a lot of us who don't remember.
Seven:Do we keep going until we happen to come across more? That might take a while.
"Cecil:Without a ship, it's going to make for a difficult journey."
Serah:Mog! You're awake!
"Mog:Yesiree, kupo! You didn't think that was the end of me, did you?"
"Mog:So!? Where's that nasty planesgorger, kupo?"
Seven:...We took care of the one that was here. You sure are an antsy moogle...
Cecil:We were talking about how we were to travel.
"Mog:I know just the thing, kupo!"
Lightning:What is it?
"Mog:A new ship was being prepared while I was asleep, kupo!"
Hope:An airship? Are you sure it's not a trap?
"Mog:It's real, kupo! I even pinched my bobble to make sure!"
"Mog:But the inside of the ship isn't in the best condition, kupo."
Lightning:Empty on the inside. A fitting vessel for this place.
"Mog:But it's big enough for everyone, kupo!"
Cecil:But who...?
Seven:The goddess Materia?
"Serah:Do you know, Mog?"
"Mog:Nope, but you should come and see for yourselves, kupo!"
"Kuja:It was you, wasn't it?"
Kuja:What is your obsession with them?
Golbez:Light and darkness. One can't exist without the other.
Golbez:Those who have lost their light may find the most hallowed light in this dark realm.
Kuja:You're hoping they'll stop hating you.
Golbez:This is not about me.
"Golbez:However, if he retrieves his light, he will also retrieve the bonds he shares with his allies."
Kuja:And the sorrow.
Golbez:That must be overcome. There is no joy or misery without memories.
Golbez:Cecil... You must find yourself.
Materia:You have come to ask about the airship?
"Bartz:We're glad to have a new one, but did you prepare it for us?"
"Celes:Based on the others' inspection, it resembles, but is distinct from our ship in the World of Light."
"Yuna:For a divine gift, there's something odd about its construction..."
"Materia:Unlike your previous airship, I did not prepare this one."
Materia:It was born of a strong will...
Squall:Willpower... Did one of us make it?
Celes:But we were all engaged in battle away from Mog.
"Mog:I was still unconscious, so I wouldn't know if anyone else came by, kupo..."
Materia:It is someone who is close to you... ...One who harbors light in the depths of darkness.
Yuna:You're ever reticent.
Materia:I have not concluded his light is to be trusted...
"Squall:Whatever. Can we fly in that thing, or is it just an illusion?"
"Materia:In this world, a strong will is the power to create."
Materia:I leave the decision to board it in your hands.
"Bartz:Well, let's give it a try. The rest is up to where the wind blows."
Squall:(Willpower is the power to create...?)
Squall:(...There's more in this world than just what the gods created?)
Squall:(...Could someone then create a location from memory?)
"Bartz:Let's go, Squall! Everyone's waiting at the airship!"
"Vaan:You know, Sazh, being a new airship and all, you don't have to be the only one to pilot it."
"Sazh:...Ah, sure thing. Just sit tight till I find a place to put us down."
"Balthier:I don't think so, Vaan. It's still too soon for you."
Balthier:But changing pilots is a good idea. I'll lose my touch if I don't stretch my wings from time to time.
Setzer:Can we expect smooth sailing from a brigand? Better I take the wheel.
Balthier:To the gentry my foot... What if an enemy catches us during your genteel pleasure cruise?
"Faris:An ""air"" ship, eh...? It does have its charm..."
"Sazh:Yeah, yeah, keep your shirts on! You all can fight it out after we land!"
Faris:What about you? I reckon you've more than a passing interest in flying.
Cecil:I...will pass.
Cecil:I was once proud to lead an air brigade...but...
Cecil:I have no right to enjoy the skies. Not after the harm I brought to the innocent.
"Faris:Same as ever. It wouldn't hurt to have a wee more faith in yourself, hear?"
"Sazh:Sorry to interrupt here, but..."
Balthier:Blast... Not more trouble...
Sazh:Your pilot has mysteriously lost control...
"Onion Knight:I'm glad we landed safely, but now the airship won't budge."
Cater:Sazh and the others seem to think the ship was programmed with this course.
Lilisette:Is something the matter?
Cecil:This mountain... It is familiar to me.
Cater:But we've never been here before. Dj vu?
Palom:That's all? You don't remember anything else?
Palom:Then follow me!
Cecil:Palom! Where are you?
Palom:Over here! I can help you remember!
Lilisette:It's a giant mirror!
Onion Knight:There's also a faint sense of a crystal.
Cecil:I sense nostalgia...and warmth.
Cecil:Is this where my memories lie?
Cater:Are you sure we're in the right place?
Palom:Of course. I could never forget.
"Cecil:They are within reach, but...something is still missing."
"Onion Knight:If something seems missing, it's just like anyplace else we've visited so far."
Onion Knight:It's going to take more than hints like this to jump-start Cecil's memory.
Palom:Ugh! Why do you have to be so difficult!?
Cecil:There may be a clue in the mirror.
Lilisette:Look! There's someone there.
???:You aren't ready to face the truth?
"???:You are weak, hiding behind your dark armor."
Cecil:Are you...me...?
"Onion Knight:Cecil, wait!"
Lilisette:He's inside the mirror! How are we supposed o get him out of there?
"Seven:They aren't fighting, though. What should we do?"
Warrior of Light:They appear to be talking. Let us watch over them for now.
Cecil?:Do you have the courage to learn the truth?
Cecil:You're a sacred knighta paladin.
Cecil:Did I wish for that?
"Cecil?:Yes, but even with this light..."
Cecil?:Many a fault was committed.
Cecil?:Which is why I chose to seal these memories before coming to this world.
Cecil?:All because...
Cecil:...I am weak.
Cecil?:Regaining your memories will cause you pain and suffering.
Cecil?:The sacrifices I made as a paladin do not compare to what you know as a dark knight.
"Cecil?:We used our hatred as strength, but the truth rendered it useless."
Cecil?:Do you still wish to become a paladin? To leave behind your ignorant bliss?
Cecil:I wish...to move on.
"Cecil:My past may be filled with tragedy, but it's something I mus tface."
Kain:We will face it together.
Kain:We all have a past and our own burdens to bear.
Lilisette:He's right! We're all here for you.
Seven:You can count on us.
Warrior of Light:We have come to trust you and your powers.
"Warrior of Light:If your enemy draws his sword, we will fight by your side as proof of the bonds we share."
"Cecil:Thank you, everyone..."
"Cecil:I will take back the light, and I will use both light and darkness as strength!"
"Cecil?:Then so be it... Shatter me, hollow as I may be, with your allies at your side!"
Cecil (Paladin):I am a reflection of your memories...
Cecil (Paladin):But this time is different... Shatter me to gain your light.
Cecil (Dark Knight):...Very well. I will pour everything I have into defeating you.
Cecil (Paladin):Surely then...will I claim victory over myself.
Cecil:This brilliance... Are these...my memories?
Zidane:Is that the real you?
Cecil:I remembered. The dark knight became a paladin.
"Cecil:I remember everything, which is why I must have taken on this appearance."
Zidane:You don't look too happy about it. Isn't this what you wanted?
Cecil:I was driven out of my home. I obtained this holy power to put the past behind me.
"Cecil:But on my journey to this world, I subconsciously gave up those memories."
"Cecil:...Perhaps I wished to go back to a time when I had the king's trust, when I fought alongside my friends."
"Cecil:Though I gained the power of the paladin, I lost much more in return."
Cecil:A part of me has always regretted my actions.
Palom:...Don't say that.
"Garnet:What is it, Palom?"
Palom:I've been waiting so long for you to remember.
Palom:Don't you know what would've happened to our world without you?
Garnet:Why are you crying?
"Palom:I'm not! And if I was, they'd be tears of pity!"
Cecil:Do you remember everything?
Palom:Of course!
Palom:Why would you so easily try to forget the memories you had with all of us?
Palom:Did you already forget about the things and people you wanted to protect!?
Palom:...I thought we finally got you back.
Palom:But all you have are regrets! It's like you don't even remember the good you've done...
Cecil:Forgive me.
Palom:Why! Tell me why grown-ups have to be such pains in the butt...
Zidane:Take it easy.
"Zidane:I don't know what you guys went through, but every life has meaning."
"Garnet:Yes, we all have a purpose."
Cecil:I...I am weak.
Cecil:I despised my own brother in a war that destroyed the lives of many. I wanted to shy away from that reality.
Firion:Your own brother... That must have been tough...
"Bartz:Come on, guys. Let's give him a break."
Bartz:Who cares if he's a dark knight or a paladin? Cecil is Cecil.
Bartz:You don't need to figure out all the answers right away.
Cecil:...Bartz. I am sorry... I...
Bartz:No need for that.
"Bartz:Now, come on! We've got stuff to do!"
Bartz:Hanging in there?
Cecil:Yes... My memories caught me off guard... It is something I was able to hide better back in my world.
Cecil:How do you manage to stay so positive and self-assured?
Cecil:Have you yourself had to overcome a past tragedy?
Bartz:It was his dying wish that I go out and travel the world.
Bartz:It didn't even occur to me that I'd end up being part of such a grand adventure.
"Galuf:When we first met, you were already ready to move on."
"Bartz:That's right. If it wasn't for Boko, I might never have gone back to help you."
"Galuf:Considering your lineage, perhaps it was fate."
Galuf:I'm sorry for putting you through so much.
Bartz:Don't say that. I'm happy I did what I did.
Bartz:I would've regretted it otherwise.
Cecil:The regret of not taking action...
Y'shtola:Do you regret following your beliefs?
"Y'shtola:That is kindness, not weakness."
Bartz:That's right! The Cecil we know is strong and kind.
Bartz:I have no doubt in my mind that that's the Cecil everyone from your world also believes in.
Dark Manikin (Yang):...Very good.
"Bartz:Again? And this time, it's Yang and Edge."
Dark Manikin (Edge):And we have our memories. Do you want to know what Cecil has done?
Y'shtola:What do you mean?
Dark Manikin (Yang):The war became far more violent after he gained the power of the paladin.
Dark Manikin (Yang):We lost homes and friends. Some even sacrificed their own lives to protect him.
Dark Manikin (Yang):This man's weakness destroyed many lives.
"Dark Manikin (Edge):Hey, Cecil. Don't you think things might be better off if everything became nothing?"
Dark Manikin (Edge):Maybe that's how you can protect everyone.
"Cecil:Yang, Edge. Is that how you really feel?"
Bartz:Of course not!
Bartz:How can you even ask that?
Bartz:You really think that's how they feel?
Bartz:You need to trust them. The real Yang and Edge!
"Y'shtola:With your beliefs and your kindness, you should be able to trust your friends, should you not?"
Cecil:I do trust them.
"Cecil:My allies, my friends!"
"Galuf:Good, good. If you can't believe in yourself, believe in your friends."
"Galuf:...But ""nothing""? That's an unpleasant idea you've brought up."
"Dark Manikin (Edge):If you can't accept it, how 'bout we make you!"
"Edge:I get how Lightning and Hope feel, some yutz with my face talking for me."
Edge:It really ticks me off!
"Yang:Indeed, let us not abide this. Memories or not, Lord Cecil is our ally!"
Dark Manikin (Yang):Hm... Will you say the same after recalling tragedy?
Edge:Bring it on! No memories're gonna keep us down!
Yang:How can this be? How could I have forgotten...?
Edge:I...I can't believe this. I'm nothing but a failure.
"Layle:Aw, that's not like you. What happened to the arrogant prince we know and love?"
Edge:It was all my fault! And I'd forgotten everything.
Edge:How can I be my usual self after being faced with something like this?
Yang:I had also sealed away my shameful past.
Layle:You guys are really bumming me out.
Cloud:I don't get it. Were you only fighting for others?
Cloud:You're all responsibility and no wishes of your own?
Kain:Don't be too hard on them. That's what comes with their positions.
"Edge:Kain, you knew my name. Does that mean you never lost your memories?"
Kain:I knew a little more than you did.
Yang:I apologize for ever doubting you...
Yang:You fought bravely alongside Lord Cecil.
Kain:I chose this.
"Kain:In this world, we can be true allies under no one else's control."
"Edge:Wait, do you mean Golbez is in his right mind!?"
Cloud:That's the man in black commanding the airship fleet?
Kain:He's Cecil's elder brother.
Yda:Brothers at war with each other? It's too cruel...!
Yang:Lord Cecil was extremely distressed to discover the fact.
Kain:I encountered Golbez before joining you all.
"Kain:He was in his right mind then, though I know not how he fares now. I'm here of my own will."
Cloud:You're really hung up on personal motivation.
"Layle:Edge, you don't worry too much about it either."
Layle:Your memories are back. Don't you remember what you wanted to do? Who you wanted to protect?
Layle:There's gotta be something! Unless you didn't get everything back...?
Edge:I did! And of course I do!
Layle:Then you know what you need to do.
Kain:Regaining all your memories at once is quite a burden. Take your time.
Cecil:My friends are shaken by the return of their memories.
Cecil:I must be strong for everyone.
Warrior of Light:You cannot take on everything alone.
Warrior of Light:Let us help.
Cecil:The light within you shines ever brightly.
Cecil:The holy power I regained does not compare.
Warrior of Light:Light and darkness are not necessarily opposing elements.
Warrior of Light:Nor is one right and one wrong.
Onion Knight:They're essentially two sides of the same coin.
"Prishe:Besides, the darkness that burdens people isn't always so bad."
"Prishe:People are weak, but isn't that why they're also kind?"
Cecil:...Being weak makes you kind?
"Seven:The definition of good and bad is ambiguous, and I don't know what's truly good."
Seven:But I'm sure there are people you touched with your kindness.
"Seifer:I don't know how much of a bad guy you are, but you chose to do what you did."
"Seifer:And being withdrawn and overthinking the past is just as good as not thinking at all, chicken-wuss."
"Seven:You always have to be you, huh?"
"Onion Knight:I wouldn't use those exact words, but he's right."
Onion Knight:Blaming yourself for the past isn't going to get you anywhere.
"Warrior of Light:Being a warrior of both light and darkness, there must be something only you can do."
"Warrior of Light:And when you discover what that is, we will all fight by your side."
Cecil:Something I can do. Something I must do.
Cecil:Right. I must move on.
Cecil:You have opened my eyes. Thank you.
Golbez:I see you've regained the holy power.
Golbez:With the guidance of these hands coated with darkness.
Ramza:Your guidance?
Ramza:You were behind this? You lead Cecil there and allowed him to regain his memories!?
Cecil:Is that true?
Golbez:I merely showed you the way. The rest was due to your own will and the bonds you share with your allies.
Zidane:Weren't you worried?
Cecil:I sense no evil from you. You are in control of yourself.
Golbez:I was concerned as you'd lost your power. I'd been waiting for you to regain it.
Vaan:You don't seem like such a bad guy. Why did you act like you don't like us?
Golbez:...My sins shall never be forgotten or forgiven.
Golbez:Cecil! You must use that power to defeat me!
Cecil:Why!? There is no reason for us to fight in this world!
Golbez:Can you forgive me? For letting nations burn and killing countless innocent souls?
Cecil:That... I...
Vaan:I thought he's not brainwashed! Why do you have to fight?
Zidane:...It's not that simple.
Ramza:Even family can stray far enough to become strangers or enemies.
"Vaan:You're both alive, you're both here, so just talk it over!"
"Ramza:I understand how you feel, but this is a choice Cecil has to make."
Cecil:I...am not ready...
"Golbez:If you lack the courage, I will strike first!"
"Cecil:Everyone, please... With me!"
"Golbez:Cecil, you and I are as incompatible as light and darkness!"
Cecil:You're wrong!
Cecil:I have learned from my friends... Light and dark are two sides of the same coin...
Golbez:Then prove it with that sword!
Golbez:You lack the courage to finish it.
Vivi:Why are you fighting? You're family.
Golbez:Indeed we share the same blood. But I have caused much pain and suffering.
Golbez:Evil took over me and reached the dark corners of my heart.
"Golbez:Even if I were to return to my world, there is no place for me there."
Terra:So you wish for him to take your life?
Cait Sith:Not everything has to be so complicated.
"Cait Sith:I understand your situation, but you need to look at what you're doing to those around you."
Cait Sith:You're causing them trouble with your selfish logic. I don't like that at all.
Golbez:I don't expect nor need you to understand.
Vivi:And he's gone...
Terra:We can't just leave him be. He's a danger to himself.
"Cecil:I know, but...I doubted what was right."
"Cecil:When I think of all that has happened, I do not quite know how I feel yet."
Vivi:He must've done some really bad things.
Cait Sith:But disappearing in this strange world seems irresponsible.
Cait Sith:There must be a way for him to take responsibility in his own world.
Cecil:He did. He tried.
"Cecil:When he became free of the evil, he was determined to destroy it."
Terra:It won't do him any good to disappear here.
"Cait Sith:That wouldn't sit well with you either, would it?"
Cait Sith:Do you know where he went?
"Mog:No, kupo."
"Mog:But with Cecil's strength of will, he may be able to lead us to him, kupo!"
"Terra:We can open Torsions, too... You need to try, Cecil!"
Cecil:I will.
Cecil:I don't wish to lose my brother. Not here.
"Golbez:Dark warlock, Exdeath. What are you doing here?"
Exdeath:Connecting time and space.
Golbez:What do you mean?
"Exdeath:These are no ordinary passages. As I recall, you were able to summon your fleet."
Exdeath:You also prepared an airship to guide your brother.
Exdeath:How very human of you. Hardly tinged with evil.
Golbez:I've heard enough. Step aside.
Exdeath:Mwahaha... There is no need to hurry.
Exdeath:These powers allow me to do such as this.
Golbez:You used the Torsions to bend space and time.
Golbez:Others with such powers may well use them to trap my brother.
"Exdeath:Golbez, you desire to vanish from this world for your sins."
Exdeath:Then heed my words.
Golbez:You mistake me for a desperate fool.
Golbez:I wish to make things right to bring order to my world while I can.
Exdeath:Mwahaha... 'Tis the same thing.
"Exdeath:You are the vessel for evil. Without you, it will be no more."
Golbez:So what will you do? Do you wish to kill me?
Golbez:Spiritus would not be happy if his warriors waged war against one another.
Exdeath:This forest once imprisoned me.
"Exdeath:Now I will imprison you, and banish this place to where not even the gods can reach you!"
Golbez:And I will be alone and unable to do any harm.
Yuffie:Why is Cecil being such a bummer? He got his memories back.
Irvine:I don't know. One would think he remembered the good as well as the bad.
Kain:He's always been burdened with a strong sense of responsibility.
Kain:He was raised by theKing of Baronand appointed captain of theRed Wingsat a young age.
Layle:But not all royalty is like that. There are some commonplace kings who fancy themselves ladykillers.
Edgar:To not make advances would otherwise be rude to the lady.
Yuffie:Speaking of bummers!
"Edge:What is it, Yuffie? I don't have time"
"Yuffie:You don't have time for what? To be your arrogant, loudmouth self?"
Edge:Watch it! You don't know what I'm going
Edge:Hey! Give that back!
Yuffie:You're not gonna catch me feeling sorry for yourself!
Irvine:She always knows how to have fun.
Edgar:Am I really commonplace?
Kain:No. You emanate royalty.
Layle:I don't do well around people too serious or formal anyway. You're just right in my book.
Edge:Come back here!
Yuffie:In your dreams!
Layle:That's not to say I'm a fan of loud and rambunctious either.
Irvine:Why don't you give 'em a little knock back?
Edgar:I wouldn't do that if I were you. I'd be worried about payback.
Kain:Ha. I couldn't ask for better comrades.
Kain:They just need time. They'll be back to their old selves sooner than later.
Cecil:It worked!
Edgar:It did indeed! The bond of family is strong.
Golbez:You've finally come to end this.
Cecil:No! I...don't know anything yet.
"Sabin:Why don't you start by calling him ""brother""?"
Ramza:This is their affair. We should let them decide what should be done.
Zidane:They've been apart for so long. They're going to need time to get close.
Sabin:Why are things so complicated in other worlds?
"Edgar:There's a reason behind everything. For now, let's focus on the problem at hand."
"Golbez:Cecil, I don't want your pity."
Golbez:Perhaps I will take their lives. Then your hatred should be enough to do what you should've done before!
Edgar:It looks like we have a fight on our hands.
Ramza:Why do you make no effort to listen to us!?
Cecil:I'm left with no choice.
Golbez:Fight for the sake of your friends!
Cecil:Why do you continue this villainous act? There is no more need to fight!
Golbez:You are the only one who thinks that way.
Golbez:My sins...cannot be forgiven so easily!
Exdeath:Mwahaha! Here you are.
Exdeath:How convenient.
Edge:What's wrong with him? Why isn't he doing anything?
Cecil:He...he can't! You must try to fight it!
Exdeath:There is no need.
Exdeath:He is about to fall into an eternal slumber. He will return to the Void.
"Exdeath:Left only with his sins and his darkness, he will disappear to a place out of reach by all."
Exdeath:Does he not deserve this punishment for his actions?
Bartz:You're the only one who thinks the Void is something great!
"Bartz:All alone, devoid of feelings... You can't justify sending anyone to a place like that!"
Cecil:You need to live to atone for your sins.
Cecil:Unhand my brother at once!
Exdeath:Mwa-haha... I am the villain? For sealing away evil?
Exdeath:I shall give this one what he desires.
Cecil:None shall let you do as you please!
Exdeath:Is this not what he desires...and deserves?
Galuf:We will fight you as many times as you want. And we will always win!
Exdeath:Mwahaha! You will regret those words!
Cecil:You're awake!
"Golbez:Cecil? ...I was bound by Exdeath, was I not?"
Golbez:Take your allies and leave. This is a false place he created.
"Bartz:Wait, the mist is clearing."
Bartz:So this is what it looks like.
Golbez:His influence over this place is gone.
Cecil:You worried for our safety.
Golbez:I didn't expect to be alive this long.
Galuf:Young man.
Golbez:I suppose in your eyes I am young.
"Galuf:We're from different worlds, and I don't know what you did."
Galuf:But if you wish to atone...
Galuf:The answer doesn't lie in death.
Galuf:Surrendering to the Void helps no one.
"Galuf:If you truly wish to repent, you must live until your time comes."
Golbez:Hmph. I shall contemplate the words of my elders.
Bartz:Why don't you come with us? There's a lot you probably want to talk about.
Golbez:There is still something I need to do.
Golbez:And you need time to collect your thoughts.
"Cecil:Wait, I"
Bartz:He didn't hear you. Should we go after him?
"Cecil:No, we both need more time."
Bartz:I guess we'll let the wind take us where it takes us.
Cecil:Perhaps Mog may know where we are.
"Galuf:Everyone must be surprised, seeing their surroundings suddenly change."
"Spiritus:Golbez. I let you make your own choice, and you chose death."
Spiritus:I cannot turn a blind eye to those who wish to break free from strife.
Spiritus:You must all fight amongst yourselves. There is no meaning in rest.
"Spiritus:However, if this world becomes uncontrollable, the other world will also cease to exist."
Spiritus:Perhaps it is time I intervene.
"Spiritus:...No, not yet. Their motives are bringing them together."
"Spiritus:Unlike Materia, I will not enslave my warriors with objectives."
Materia:There is light within one of Spiritus's warriors.
"Materia:But one should not trust so easily. Memories, at times, can be rattling."
Materia:I am the only one who can protect this world.
Materia:I will not let anyone destroy this fantasy.
"Mog:This area is unstable, kupo. There may be a planesgorger!"
Faris:These ruins probably house some tough monsters as well.
"Mog:Keep your wits about you, kupo!"
Krile:Is it true that the forest we were in was a creation of Exdeath?
"Mog:I didn't know anyone could create such illusions, kupo."
"Mog:He must've chosen a space that was made unstable by the planesgorger, kupo!"
Krile:That forest was scary. I didn't want to fight there.
Papalymo:They can easily recreate locations that belong in our memories.
Faris:So we'll have to deal with it again?
Papalymo:They won't affect you if you stay true to your beliefs.
"Edge:My beliefs, huh."
"Edge:When I got my memories back, everyone asked me what I wanted, what my goal was."
Cecil:And your answer?
"Edge:I didn't have one then. Everything came rushing back, and all I could focus on was what I'd lost."
Edge:But there are people I want to protect in my world and in this one.
Edge:And this time I'm gonna protect them! That's what I want.
"Cecil:I think I know, too, what I desire."
"Cecil:The sacrifices, my brother's sins. Neither will easily be forgiven."
"Cecil:But I must learn about my family, about him."
"Faris:The idea of a sibling isn't so bad after all, huh?"
"Faris:Despite the past, you want to know about him, don't you?"
Cecil:Of course. I'd been an orphan all this time.
Cecil:My father's love taught me what it was like to have family.
"Cecil:After I discovered the truth about Golbez, we were torn apart. I know nothing of him as a brother."
Faris:You two are more alike than you know. You'll get along fine.
Cecil:We are?
Krile:You two think a lot alike! Haven't you noticed?
Papalymo:You were both blaming yourselves for everything that happened in the past.
Cecil:I... You're right.
Edge:Don't worry about us. Do what feels right.
Edge:Your biggest enemy was your brother. That's life for you.
Cecil:Thank you. I will talk to him when we meet again.
Cecil:The planesgorger!
Palom:Look at that ugly mug! Let's take it down!
Edge:Don't judge a guy by his face... But we do need to defeat it to protect our worlds.
Kain:Then there's only one thing to do.
Yang:We shall fight!
Cecil:Are you with me?
"Kain:Of course, we're with you."
Zidane:Huh? We left the airship at the top of the mountain. Why's it here?
Golbez:I've been waiting. I see you managed to make it out alive.
Golbez:I've disabled the automatic piloting sequence of this airship. You may use it to go anywhere you please.
"Cecil:I...I call you that, but I don't know if I should."
Cecil:I have something to ask of you. Will you join us on our mission?
Cecil:I feel there are things we can overcome because we are in a world not our own.
Golbez:I cannot agree to that just yet.
Golbez:I first must find my path to redemption. But there may come a time I lend you my strength.
Cecil:I understand. Thank you.
"Cecil:Until we meet again, Brother."
Golbez:Until we meet again.
Zidane:Hey! You finally called him brother to his face.
"Cloud:You didn't even realize, did you?"
"Zidane:""Brother."" It has a nice ring to it, don't you think?"
Cecil:I do not know. Perhaps he thought it a nuisance.
Zidane:I don't think so. I could tell b his tone even under all that armor.
Zidane:He appreciated it.
Vaan:You cheated!
Setzer:Real men don't cheat or go back on their word. It's decided. I will pilot the airship.
Vaan:It's like those dice had a mind of their own. I want a do-over!
Setzer:You're acting like a child. Though I suppose you are one.
Vaan:You're not playing fair!
"Setzer:Cecil, are you finished? I'll be your pilot this time."
Setzer:Though I see no reason you would mind.
Cloud:You two were still arguing about that?
Vaan:Setzer cheated! It didn't count.
Cecil:I truly do not mind who pilots the ship.
Cecil:But it seems to be ready to take off.
Balthier:You really thought you could beat the fastest sky pirate of them all?
Vaan:Hey! No fair!
Setzer:My ship!
Balthier:Step aboard before I leave you all behind!
Cloud:Never a dull moment around here.
Cecil:Haha. Alright. Best be on our way.
Zidane:Things would be so much easier if brothers got along.
Penelo:Zidane's been lost in thought since the whole thing with Cecil.
Maria:I think I understand.
Maria:Do you have any brothers?
"Penelo:Yes, older ones."
"Penelo:They're knights, and they taught me martial arts."
Maria:How wonderful.
Penelo:They are. They were. I lost them in the war.
"Maria:Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that."
Penelo:It's all right. I remember clearly who they were and what they stood for.
"Vanille:You have an older brother, too, don't you, Maria?"
"Maria:Yes, but..."
"Vanille:Oh, I don't mean to pry. We all have stuff in our past that's hard to talk about."
"Maria:Thank you. I just hope that when I see him again, things will be back to normal."
Maria:Maybe Zidane's worried about the same thing.
Zidane:Are all you ladies worried about little ol' me?
Maria:A little less now! Though you do seem to be concerned about your brother...or maybe family.
Zidane:It's complicated.
Zidane:But there's no use thinking about it right now. I just wanted to talk to you pretty girls.
Vanille:What do you all think about Golbez?
Vanille:Is it wrong for someone who did a bad thing to want to disappear?
"Penelo:I don't know the answer to that. I mean, if you disappear...that's forever."
Zidane:I don't think people should jump at the chance to quash someone who did something bad.
"Zidane:It's not easy to determine what's ""good"" and what's ""bad."""
Maria:That's true. And dying means you lose your chance at redemption.
Vanille:Right. I've come to think like that too.
Zidane:If Cecil weren't so darn stubborn...
Maria:It seems to run in the family.
"Vanille:They both seem to burden themselves with so much, too."
Penelo:He shouldn't feel like he's responsible for everything...
"Zidane:Well, let's do what we can for them in the meantime."
Balthier:Can everyone hear me?
"Warrior of Light:Yes. What seems to be the problem, Balthier?"
Balthier:In front of us stands a colossal tree of impassable height. Sound familiar to any of you?
Lenna:A giant tree...worries me.
Zidane:It can't be...!
"Zidane:No, it's different from anything else I've seen here... It's the spitting image of the one we know."
Lenna:Maybe someone else did the same for this tree.
"Balthier:If it's going to be trouble, I can always go around it."
"Zidane:No, that tree's more than just big. We'd better check it out."
"Mog:I can sense brilliance there, too, kupo!"
Mog:And there's always a chance Shinryu's larvae are around with something of that size!
Lenna:Is it possible to land atop the tree?
Balthier:I cannot say for sure without knowing what its structure is like.
"Zidane:In our world, it was sealed so that no one could get close."
Garnet:It might be too dangerous to go by airship.
Zidane:Yeah. Let's set down a ways off and hoof it.
Balthier:Understood. I'll search for a nice landing spot nearby.
"Mog:There's someone here, kupo!"
"Vivi:A friend of someone's, maybe?"
"Lenna:In that case, it's good that we landed."
Garnet:But we can't tell if it's a friend or enemy yet.
Warrior of Light:I would like to know more about the area. Let us find them.
Vivi:The Iifa Tree... I wonder who's there...
Vivi:Ah! Wait...!
Vivi:Somebody...!
Zidane:Has anyone seen Vivi?
Quistis:Wasn't he with you?
Zidane:I haven't seen him for a while. I thought maybe he fell from the airship.
Balthier:And here I thought I was driving rather well.
"Zidane:It's not you. Vivi's fallen like that before, so I was just worried."
"Zidane:Have you seen him, Seifer?"
Seifer:The kid with the hat? Isn't that him over there?
Vivi?:U-umm... I...
"Mog:There's someone over there, kupo! I think they might be someone's friend!"
Quistis:What a relief! I was worried it might be an enemy.
Balthier:It would be quite unfortunate to run into Spiritus's minions so soon after landing.
Seifer:You chicken-wuss...
"Balthier:Impertinent as always, I see."
"Balthier:I'm afraid to inform you that that is not called ""courage,"" but ""recklessness."""
Seifer:What was that!?
Mog:I think they're one of Materia's warriors! We should find them as soon as possible!
Vivi?:I-it's nothing. I'm...fine.
"Zidane:Fine, huh..."
Zidane:Then let's go meet up with the others.
Seven:Who are you?
???:Hmm... What unfamiliar clothing. Perhaps they hail from another world.
???:Have you met a man with a tail in your travels?
"Lightning:You must be a friend of Zidane's, then. He should be here shortly."
???:Please don't tell me you forgot my name.
"Zidane:No, I remember. You're Helga. No, Christine? You used to live next door to me...Ratchel?"
"Steiner:Zidane! How dare you insult our precious comrade, Freya!?"
Steiner:Or could it be you've also lost your memory?
Zidane:I'm just kiddin'. You know I never forget a pretty girl's name.
"Freya:You never change, Zidane."
"Freya:Allow me to introduce myself, otherworlders. I am Freya, a dragon knight."
Freya:I have undertaken orders from the goddess Materia to meet you all here.
Lightning:I can tell by the way you treat these two that you're really friends.
"Freya:We are, indeed. I am glad to see you all in good health. Sadly, the same cannot be said of this world..."
Seven:So you know. Did Materia tell you everything?
Freya:For the most part. It came with a warning.
Steiner:What sort of warning!?
Freya:It was about the Iifa Tree.
Freya:It was not made by the gods.
Freya:...It was summoned by Kuja.
Seven:They said that Spiritus' warriors could summon lands they had a connection to by sheer willpower.
Seven:Is that tree special to Kuja?
"Steiner:Not just Kuja, but everyone in our world."
Steiner:Grr... I cannot just stand by any longer!
"Freya:I tried to investigate the tree, but encountered a cavern along the way."
Freya:The entrance was blocked with ice that I could not move.
"Lightning:Well, that should be no problem for us."
Lightning:Our mages and muscleheads can take care of that.
Zidane:I wonder what he's up to...
"Seven:What's wrong, Zidane? You look pale."
Zidane:I-it's nothing! Sorry for worrying you.
"Mog:Did you find your friend, kupo?"
"Steiner:Yes, Mog. Have you learned anything else about the area?"
"Zidane:Then what are we waiting for? You coming, Freya?"
Freya:But of course. I shall wield my spear for the sake of the world.
"Garnet:So this is the cave Freya was talking about. The entrance is blocked, like she said..."
Papalymo:Is this how it was in your world?
"Garnet:Yes. Back home, Vivi was able to dispel the ice with magic."
Vivi?:Huh? R-right... Umm...
Palom:Hey now! I won't let Vivi be the only one to show off his spells!
"Palom:I can cast fire, too!"
Terra:Do you need our magic?
"Palom:You're going to help, too? Let's all three of us compete to see who gets to do it!"
"Terra:Since you can both do it, I'll happily watch from the sidelines."
Palom:What? But that's boring!
Palom:Wouldn't it have been fun to compete against Terra?
Vivi?:Um... I don't mind...
"Palom:You okay, Vivi? Does your stomach hurt?"
Terra:Is something the matter? There's no need to be afraid.
Papalymo:Enough. I'll do it myself...
"Palom:Aww! You cheated, Papalymo!"
Papalymo:We don't have time for childish fights.
Palom:Big talk from another little kid!
"Garnet:Thank you, Papalymo."
Terra:I wonder what's inside...
"Garnet:It's not exactly the same as the one from our world, but I can feel wind..."
Garnet:I think this will lead us to the Iifa Tree.
"Palom:If there's more ice up ahead, I want to melt it!"
"Papalymo:Fine. In any case, shall we get moving?"
"Palom:Let's go, Vivi!"
Kuja:Heh... Did you see that?
"Kuja:In the end, a puppet is just a puppet. You're utterly replaceable."
Vivi:Why did you kidnap me?
Kuja:All I did was exchange one puppet for another. No one has even noticed.
Vivi:That's not true...
Kuja:How are you enjoying your front row seat?
Kuja:I will show you a play that you'll never forget.
"Vivi:...You're the one who summoned the Iifa Tree and Ice Cavern, aren't you?"
Kuja:What of it?
Kuja:The audience is not allowed to ask questions. Their job is merely to watch the drama unfold.
Kuja:You cannot meddle in the affairs of the actors.
Kuja:Whatever happens on the stage is up to the director.
Kuja:No one can interfere.
Vivi:(Hmm... Something seems different about him...)
Vivi:...Are you upset?
Kuja:Upset? Me? You think me capable of such an ugly emotion?
Kuja:Aren't you the one who's upset?
"Kuja:""I'm not a puppet."" ""I'm Zidane's friend."" That's what you want to say, isn't it?"
Vivi:Nngh... Zidane...
"Kuja:Zidane, Zidane, Zidane. That's all you ever say!"
"Kuja:Is that out of friendship? Trust? Whatever it is, you disgust me!"
Vivi:What happened...Kuja...?
Kain:So you're a dragon knight... Your skills certainly do bear resemblance to my own.
Freya:I thought the same.
"Freya:It's a wonderful thing. Even though we hail from different worlds, there are still similarities among them."
"Lenna:Are you a dragon knight, too, Cid?"
"Cid:Me? Why, do I look like one?"
Edgar:Your skills in battle do bear a striking resemblance.
Cid:Don't rope me in with those stiffs. We're nothing alike!
Freya:The world is full of all sorts of people.
"Freya:I left my homeland behind... So when it was in trouble, I..."
"Freya:Despite my efforts, I was unable to help in their moment of need."
Kain:What you did for your country was admirable. I've only ever used my powers for myself.
Cid:Just look at those two! They look like someone died around here!
Lenna:Hehe. You are certainly nothing alike.
"Freya:In any case, it is in the past now. I will resign them to memories. Our focus should be on the mission before us."
Maria:The dragoons I know are proud and righteous people.
Lenna:You two are no different.
Edgar:Indeed. You're both reliable and trustworthy allies.
"Kain:Though our worlds may be different, why don't we exchange what we know, as one dragoon to another?"
Freya:I would like that. I feel I have much to learn from you.
"Cid:And why just this guy? What about the rest of us, huh!?"
Freya:I am certain there are things I could learn from everyone here. I want to know more about the other worlds.
"Cid:Well, why didn't you say so? I'll teach you everything I know about the Highwind!"
Dark Manikin (Zidane):Why you...! I will not hand over the brilliance!
Black Waltz 3:Kwahaha! You are no match for me!
Steiner:Are you alright?
Squall:Zidane's dark manikin. Are you in your right mind?
Dark Manikin (Zidane):You're...of the light... I have brilliance.
"Eiko:We can worry about that later! If we don't do something, this guy is gonna win!"
"Dark Manikin (Zidane):Please, help me! I can't do this alone!"
Steiner:You need not ask. We will lend you our aid!
Squall:Take it easy. Leave the rest to us.
Black Waltz 3:Kwahaha... No matter how many of you Hmm?
Vivi?:A-ahh... Uhh...
"Black Waltz 3:I see. So there are puppets here, too... It reeks of Kuja's doing."
Steiner:How dare you say that!
"Steiner:This is our friend, Master Vivi!"
Eiko:That's right! So stop being so mean!
Squall:Can you fight?
Vivi?:I will fight...with everyone.
Black Waltz 3:Then I will burn you all until there is no difference between human and puppet!
Zidane:Did Kuja send you?
Black Waltz 3:Kwahaha... Does it matter who sent me?
Black Waltz 3:I'm here. And it is once again my mission to destroy all of you!
Zidane:He just won't listen...
Dark Manikin (Zidane):Thanks for your help back there.
Cyan:So thou wert protecting the brilliance.
Bartz:It looks like this Zidane hasn't been tricked by anyone.
Zidane:I expect nothing less of myself! Wasn't it tough being on your own?
Dark Manikin (Zidane):Not at all. Dark manikins were created for that purpose.
Krile:Mog said that Shinryu's larvae might be around here.
"Dark Manikin (Zidane):It's inside the Iifa Tree. But the tree is sealed, so I can't go in there."
Zidane:Do you know if anything happened when that tree was summoned?
Zidane:Did you see Kuja or hear anything?
"Dark Manikin (Zidane):I don't have a heart, so I can't say for sure, but..."
"Dark Manikin (Zidane):Kuja seemed different, like he'd lost his cool."
"Cyan:Kuja, losing his composure? But why..."
Dark Manikin (Zidane):Dark manikins don't understand what others are thinking.
Dark Manikin (Zidane):But...Kuja looked like he was obsessed with the me from the World of Light.
Krile:Zidane? But why? Because they're enemies...?
"Bartz:His goal was to change his fate, wasn't it?"
Bartz:So why are we enemies in this world? He's even helped us before.
"Cyan:He seemed to me different from Kefka, one filled with ill intent..."
"Krile:Maybe he just wants to see Zidane and his friends suffer, like Exdeath."
Zidane:No... I think it's more complex than that.
"Zidane:He's up ahead, isn't he?"
Dark Manikin (Zidane):Yup. He may even be watching from nearby.
Bartz:I wonder if we'll have to fight him...
"Cyan:Well, we won't get any anwers by standing around here."
Cyan:We must proceed. Thank you for your help.
Dark Manikin (Zidane):No problem!
"Krile:Let's go, Vivi."
Vivi?:Ah... Okay...
Dark Manikin (Zidane):...Hey. About that guy...
Zidane:I know.
"Zidane:I don't want the others to worry, so I haven't said anything. But I'll do something about it."
Dark Manikin (Zidane):...Alright then. Thanks.
Zidane:Thanks! Same to you.
"Zidane:You've still got things to do, don't you?"
Dark Manikin (Zidane):That's right. Take care of yourself.
Vivi:What are you going to do with Zidane and the others?
Vivi:And why the Iifa Tree...
Kuja:...It's not the stage I had hoped for.
Kuja:...How ironic.
Seymour:Exdeath's magic summoned a part of his own world here.
"Seymour:Be it illusion or reality, it shook the hearts of Materia's warriors."
Seymour:Isn't it fascinating?
Kuja:Hardly. Should I be impressed?
Seymour:Heh... Did you not know?
Seymour:Most of Spiritus's warriors know their fate.
Seymour:That's why we try to defy it and were made to battle our worst enemies.
"Kuja:You talk a lot, but just what is it you're trying to say?"
"Seymour:You were destroyed in your own world, weren't you?"
Kuja:...What of it? What does it have to do with you?
"Seymour:Coincidentally, you and I are the same."
"Seymour:In myhome world, my form is preserved bypyreflies..."
"Seymour:But in this world, that notion doesn't exist."
Seymour:...Which means that Spiritus may have revived us.
Seymour:How much value does one brought back from beyond the grave by a god have?
"Seymour:I think that life is meaningless, which is why I seek the release of death..."
Seymour:Are you not the same?
Kuja:...Don't make me laugh.
Kuja:I am living here for my own purposes.
Seymour:As a puppet made to dance upon the gods' stage?
Kuja:Me? A puppet!?
Kuja:Do not speak as if you know!
Seymour:Very well. But let me leave you with a word of advice.
Seymour:Those who have played their role on the gods' stage may be cast aside without hesitation...
Kuja:...The audacity of some people.
"Kuja:I am not a puppet whose strings are being pulled, no matter which world we are in!"
Kuja:Hmm... Perhaps it's time to turn this boring world into the stage I dreamed of!
Kuja:This is...not the stage I dreamed of.
Kuja:It can't be! Not this tree!
Kuja:...Is this all I'm capable of after all?
Kuja:I'm just...a failed puppet.
Kuja:Hahaha... AHAHAHAHA!
Kain:What's the matter? Are you unwell?
Vivi?:O-oh... I'm fine...
"Eiko:Are you sure? You can tell me, Vivi!"
"Eiko:I'm here for you, so if you need anything, just say the word!"
Prishe:That's weird. I can't read him at all.
"Prishe:But it's not just Vivi. There are others, too..."
Warrior of Light:Is something the matter?
"Prishe:Yeah, with you! Maybe it just doesn't work with people from other worlds..."
"Firion:What do you mean, Prishe?"
"Layle:Really? You, a mind reader?"
Prishe:What's that supposed to mean!?
"Prishe:Anyway, something tells me I shouldn't go too deep into this..."
"Layle:I'll kindly ask you not peek into my heart. Just thinking about it gives me the creeps. Right, Vivi?"
Vivi?:My... My heart...
Warrior of Light:I see. Your silence is your way of showing consideration toward your comrades.
"Firion:There's no need to hold back, Vivi. This is an important place to you and your friends."
"Firion:If you're worried, tell us. We can share the load."
Vivi?:Could I really be...considerate...?
Eiko:Of course! There's no doubt about it!
"Eiko:You've got a big heart, after all!"
"Prishe:I guess he just can't put it into words. But as long as we're together, you should be fine, so let's get a move on!"
Layle:You can take your time and tell us while we try to find our way out of this meat locker.
Kuja:Hahaha! Look at those fools!
"Kuja:Talking to a puppet, pretending to be friends!"
Vivi:...What is he? And why can he talk?
Kuja:I told you: he's a puppet.
"Kuja:He is a dark manikin of you, born from the crystal core of darkness."
Kuja:Though I did make some...changes.
Vivi:So that's why he can talk...
"Vivi:I know...he has a heart, too."
Kuja:...It's pointless to pretend.
"Kuja:You're scared, aren't you? You know that nothing will happen even if you die here."
Kuja:Look there.
Kuja:It's just as I said. He will soon betray all your precious comrades.
Kuja:I can't wait to see the look on Zidane's face!
Garnet:Zidane. About Vivi...
Zidane:I know.
Zidane:I promised I'd do something about it...to the other me.
Garnet:But how...
Zidane:Watch out!
Garnet:Oh no! Zidane!
Ramza:Vivi!? Did you do that!?
Vivi?:Uh... Um... I...
Vivi?:I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
Cloud:He's lost consciousness. Is he a dark manikin?
Vivi?:But I... We...
Vivi?:...are puppets...
Vivi?:...who must defeat Zidane...
Ramza:Assassins! They must have been sent by Kuja.
"Cloud:""Puppets,"" huh... There's a sick joke."
"Garnet:Can you stand, Zidane?"
Zidane:Yeah... This is nothing.
Cloud:Can you fight?
"Cloud:He looks like one of your friends, so it's fine if you leave it to us."
Zidane:No... I'll fight. Garnet?
Garnet:Yes. We have to!
Vivi?:I'm sorry...!
Garnet:Vivi... Do we have to fight?
"Vivi?:I-if I don't, I can't stay like this..."
Vivi?:So...I'm sorry...!
Freya:Is this Kuja's doing?
Zidane:Dammit! Doesn't he know this won't change anything? Just what is he trying to do?
Vivi?:A-ahh... Everyone...
Sazh:So he was a dark manikin after all.
Rem:He used magic to change his appearance so we wouldn't notice.
Zidane:...Don't disappear.
"Freya:You held back... You have strength left, haven't you? Now stand."
Vivi?:But I... I tricked everyone...
"Zidane:No, you didn't."
Zidane:We knew you weren't the real Vivi.
Vivi?:Then why...?
Zidane:Don't know. I didn't really have a reason.
"Sazh:But this was Kuja's doing, not yours."
Rem:Dark manikins are easy to control.
"Vivi?:Y-yes, but..."
Vivi?:I did what Kuja told me to do because...
Vivi?:I wanted to know what it felt like to be alive.
Freya:Hmm... You still have traces of Vivi in you. I suppose he took advantage of that.
"Zidane:Now that you've traveled with us, do you understand?"
"Vivi?:No, not yet..."
Vivi?:But you're very precious to the real me...
Vivi?:That much I understand.
Vivi?:That's why I want you to rescue him. He's been captured.
"Sazh:Do you know where he is, Mog?"
"Mog:No... I can't tell, kupo..."
Vivi?:Kuja seemed strange.
"Vivi?:I don't understand sadness or anger, but..."
Vivi?:I think that's what it is.
Mog:His feelings might be interfering with his dimensional coordinates...
Mog:Kupopo... Kupo! I found him!
"Mog:He's inside that big tree, kupo! I can sense a strong will right next to Shinryu's larvae."
Rem:Then what are we waiting for?
"Vivi?:Please, save the real me..."
Zidane:What are you saying? You're coming with us!
Zidane:We're not just going to leave you here.
Zidane:You've been helping us out in Vivi's place. Can you lend us a hand for just a little longer?
Vivi?:But I'm just a fake...
Zidane:You're not a fake. You're just a different person!
Zidane:Vivi is Vivi. And you are you.
"Freya:No matter who you are, you have a heart. That will pave the way for you."
Vivi?:Can I really...help...?
Zidane:Of course you can! You know you can!
Vivi?:Right... I'll do my best.
Zidane:That's the spirit! Now let's go!
"Palom:I knew you weren't Vivi the whole time! Uh-huh, I wasn't fooled for a second!"
"Eiko:Yes, you were. You totally fell for it, Palom!"
"Vivi?:Did you know, Miss Eiko?"
"Eiko:You don't need to call me ""miss""! Just ""Eiko"" is fine!"
"Eiko:Actually, when you said you would try your best...I could tell that you wanted to stay with us."
Eiko:That's why I didn't say anything. I didn't want you to have to leave.
"Raijin:Sounds like she didn't notice at all, either, ya know."
"Vaan:They look exactly the same. But he was so timid, it was weird."
"Vaan:I guess he was just scared, though."
"Yuna:It's so strange... Looking the same, but being a completely different person..."
"Palom:Hey, hey! Don't I look cool?"
Vivi?:Huh? Uhm...I guess.
"Eiko:You're such a child! You made Vivi your follower, so you just want to make him your follower, too."
"Raijin:Friendship isn't a one-sided thing. Each needs to be able to rely on the other, ya know."
"Vaan:Aren't you one of Seifer's followers, though?"
"Raijin:It's not like that! We're friends, ya know!"
Yuna:Please don't fight. You'll scare our new friend.
Vivi?:Um... It sounds hard to be friends...
"Eiko:It's not! After all, you and I are friends already!"
Eiko:And I'm sure you'll be great friends with the real Vivi!
Vivi?:...That would be nice.
"Yuna:You'll be fine if you believe in yourself. Now then, I see the tree over there."
Palom:Yay! I'm gonna get there first!
"Eiko:Wait! Don't run off alone! Come on, we have to catch him."
Vaan:Those kids sure are lively!
"Raijin:Wait a second! The adults should go after them, ya know?"
Kuja:Why... How dare they be in such high spirits!?
Kuja:They accepted that puppet into the fold without question! Even after he betrayed them!
Vivi:So the other me is still okay...
Vivi:That's a relief.
"Kuja:You're not bothered, even knowing how easily replaceable you are?"
"Vivi:It's hard to explain it, but..."
Vivi:He feels like a little brother to me.
Kuja:...A brother?
Kuja:You insolent!
Kuja:I will set the stage for Zidane...with your corpse!
Vivi:Nngh... Ugh... Z-Zidane...
Y'shtola:...It appears we can go no further.
"Edgar:There's some sort of magic blocking our way, isn't there?"
Shantotto:I suggest you put your theory to the test!
Lenna:He was pushed back! It must be a magic barrier.
Edgar:Undoubtedly... But doesn't our objective lie inside?
Eiko:But I don't know about this place.
Y'shtola:Is it possible for you to dispel the barrier?
"Shantotto:After a quick inspection, I believe it capable of individual detection."
Eiko:What do you mean?
Edgar:She means it only allows certain people in.
"Lenna:Kuja is the one who summoned this place, so I suppose the one he wants to let in is..."
"Zidane:Sorry I'm late, guys. What's the hold up?"
"Y'shtola:An invisible barrier is blocking our path. You, however, might be able to pass."
Zidane:...You're right.
Eiko:Wow! Now we can all get through!
Lenna:Thank goodness.
"Shantotto:The enemy is drawn to you, Zidane."
"Y'shtola:Indeed. I don't know why, but he is definitely after you."
"Zidane:Aww, are you worried for me?"
Lenna:Please don't laugh. We are truly concerned. We don't know what traps possibly lie ahead.
Zidane:Even so...I have to keep going forward. There's someone I need to save.
Eiko:That's right! Vivi's waiting for us!
Zidane:Vivi...and him.
"Zidane:Let's get moving! You're joining, right?"
Lenna:Of course. I will not abandon you here.
Edgar:Hmm... I suppose I must try again...
Eiko:Hurry up! We don't have time for this!
"Shantotto:Ohoho! Pardon me for mocking you, but are you afraid of something shocking you?"
Edgar:How dare you laugh at me!
Edgar:But enough of that... Let us hurry on.
Dark Manikin (Eiko):We've been waiting for you!
"Dark Manikin (Steiner):We have something to tell you, warriors of the World of Light."
"Zidane:You guys are just like your real selves, too!"
"Dark Manikin (Garnet):Of course. Even so, we're still just imitations..."
Zidane:I guess you're right. You remind me more of Garnet from when we first met.
Zidane:...It was love at first sight.
"Garnet:When you're done reminiscing, shall we listen to what they have to say?"
Dark Manikin (Steiner):It's about Kuja...
"Dark Manikin (Freya):He appeared before us, while we were defending the World of Darkness."
Kuja:...What pitiful puppets.
Dark Manikin (Steiner):We are defending this world as ordained by the crystal core of darkness!
Dark Manikin (Freya):I don't recall ever being pitied by Spiritus's warriors.
Kuja:Haha... HAHAHAHA!
Kuja:You all have such empty existences. I can't help but laugh.
"Kuja:After you've saved this world, it will have no more use for you."
Kuja:You'll have nowhere to return.
Kuja:That will be the end for you.
Kuja:You'll simply...stop.
Kuja:You do not know fear. You do not feel your fight to be unjust. You do not oppose your master.
"Kuja:In order to make you such controllable puppets, the crystal core of darkness did not give you hearts."
"Dark Manikin (Garnet):Even if that's true, we have no intention of running from what we must do."
"Dark Manikin (Steiner):Exactly! We will fulfill our duties, whether we can feel or not."
Kuja:I see... And do you feel the same?
Dark Manikin (Vivi):I... My heart...
Dark Manikin (Garnet):Then he took the very same Vivi that is with you now.
"Dark Manikin (Freya):For a time, things passed just as Kuja said they would, but it seems like there are no ill feelings between you."
Zidane:Us? No way! He's been a great help.
Vivi?:Is it okay...for me to stay...?
Dark Manikin (Freya):We were originally made to help the warriors from the World of Light. It's best you do what is expected of you.
Dark Manikin (Garnet):Kuja has lost control of himself. He is in the depths of despair.
"Dark Manikin (Garnet):We cannot guess his reasons, nor understand his feelings, but we know that he is dangerous."
Dark Manikin (Garnet):Please be careful.
"Garnet:Thank you... I guess the other me was worried about Zidane, too."
Zidane:There's no need for you two to fight over me...
Garnet:Zidane! Were you even listening to what they were saying!?
Zidane:I was joking!
Zidane:Sounds like we need to be extra careful with Kuja. We'd better brace ourselves for the worst.
Freya:Indeed... And what he said about exhausting one's use after saving the world is a bit...troubling.
"Jecht:We're not much different, though."
Galuf:Could it be that Kuja has already been destroyed in his world...?
Freya:...Perhaps that is the fate he is trying to change.
"Galuf:So once this world is saved, he won't have a place to return to..."
Zidane:But he has no intention of doing what the gods want.
Zidane:...He's such a pain.
Galuf:His contradictory thoughts caused him to spiral out of control... Do you think we can stop him?
Zidane:We have to try. If he can be saved...I want to save him.
Kuja:...You're late.
Vivi:Ngh... Guys... Zidane...
Kuja:Zidane... You truly are remarkable.
Kuja:You're courageous and care about your comrades. Truly a flawless hero...
Kuja:Even so...you cannot defeat me.
Kuja:Do you think you can stop a man who fights tooth and nail against his preordained death?
"Kuja:If you end this, you'll be putting an end to me and the other puppets, including him."
Zidane:Is that the reason why you kidnapped and hurt Vivi!?
Kuja:That's right!
"Kuja:Behold his pain and suffering! He wishes to live, therefore he desires to escape!"
Kuja:And there is no one who can stop this!
Vivi:The other...me...
Kuja:Lowly puppets... What a farce.
Aerith:Something's wrong with Kuja...
Aerith:His eyes are different than that time he helped us.
Kuja:I've had enough! I've always played the clown!
"Kuja:Trying to escape the gods and my fate, but failing again and again!"
Kuja:I tire of this play! I tire of this stage and this role and...everyone!
"Tidus:You alright, Vivi?"
Vivi:Yes. I'm fine! But the other me...
"Zidane:Do we really have to fight, Kuja?"
"Kuja:Playing the cool, collected hero, Zidane? You want to steal the spotlight, don't you!?"
Zidane:No! Just listen to me!
"Tidus:If he keeps this up, this whole area's done for!"
Aerith:And he won't listen to us...
"Zidane:I know. And if my words won't work, then..."
Zidane:I'll fight him until he's satisfied!
"Kuja:Ahahaha! Come, Zidane, let us put on a show to remember!"
Zidane:Kuja! Enough of this!
"Kuja:Your words are meaningless, Zidane!"
"Kuja:You can all burn, along with this hideous tree!"
Vivi:Please wait just a little longer...other me...
Vivi:Kuja... I know you kidnapped me instead of my other comrades for a reason.
Kuja:Huff... Huff... To think you could understand...
Kuja:...I must look like a fool to you... A true clown...
Vivi:...I don't know if what we feel is the same.
Vivi:I can't forgive you yet for the things you did back home...
"Vivi:I'm scared, too. And...lonely."
Auron:Let him speak.
"Vivi:But after I came to this world, I met a lot of people... People who will remember me."
"Vivi:And as long as they don't forget me, then in those memories..."
Vivi:They'll be a place to call home.
Vivi:That's why I'm not afraid on this journey. I'm happy to have met everyone.
"Vivi:Kuja... There's still a place for you, even after life ends."
"Kuja:Idealism... That's all that is. This is a tragedy, and nothing can change that."
Shadow:...He won't go far. He's simply hiding.
"Auron:Living on in the memories of others... Hmph, I never thought of it that way."
"Zidane:It seems like you remembered something, Vivi."
Vivi:Uh-huh. When I talked to Kuja...
"Shadow:In memories, huh..."
Auron:Is that...brilliance...?
Vivi:It's the other me!
Zidane:Hang in there!
Vivi:...Are you okay?
Dark Manikin (Vivi):I don't know... I feel...weak...
Onion Knight:He looks like a dark manikin again.
Dark Manikin (Vivi):I'm sorry... This is the real me...
Vivi:There's no need to apologize.
Vivi:Thank you for helping my friends.
Dark Manikin (Vivi):Aren't you...mad?
Vivi:I was...surprised at first. But then I started to see you as a little brother...
Vivi:I wish we could have talked more... This is the only place I can meet others like me anymore.
Dark Manikin (Vivi):I liked...traveling with everyone...
Dark Manikin (Vivi):I wanted to learn...about hearts and life...
Dark Manikin (Vivi):And I think I...understand now...
Steiner:Master Vivi of the World of Darkness is disappearing!
Zidane:He has so much brilliance...
Dark Manikin (Vivi):Take this...brilliance...
Dark Manikin (Vivi):Save...the world...
Ace:He's...gone.
Firion:To think he was hiding so much brilliance in that little body.
Vivi:Thank you. I won't forget you.
Ace:I also have memories of him in this world.
Onion Knight:Parting ways with comrades is part of the journey...
Firion:But you have to make the most of every meeting and parting.
"Firion:He was our comrade. We won't forget him, either."
Vivi:...Thank you.
"Zidane:Hey, Vivi... Do you hate Kuja for what he did?"
"Vivi:I still can't forgive him for what he did in our world, but..."
Vivi:But I know that he feels sad and lonely.
"Vivi:And...no matter what terrible things he did, I knew you would want to save him, so..."
Vivi:I want to go with you.
"Zidane:...Thanks, Vivi."
Steiner:I agree. I cannot overcome my hatred so easily...
Steiner:But I know I cannot move forward with only that in my heart.
Onion Knight:Have you saved Kuja before? ...Even though he's your enemy?
Zidane:I saved him because he was within reach...
"Zidane:And he's something of an older brother to me, even though I didn't know for a long time..."
Zidane:We weren't close or anything. But I couldn't just cast him aside.
Ace:But you still want to save him in this world.
"Onion Knight:If that's what you guys want, we're not about to stop you!"
Zidane:Sorry for dragging you guys along.
Ace:Don't worry about it. Things could get a lot worse if we just let Kuja have his way.
"Zidane:You're right. Alright, let's get going then!"
"Eiko:Welcome back, Vivi! We were worried about you!"
Vivi:Thank you.
"Palom:By the way, I could definitely tell that the other Vivi wasn't you!"
Palom:His face didn't fool me for one second!
Eiko:It's nothing to brag about. Everyone could tell. In any case...
"Eiko:Kuja did mean things to you, didn't he? Did he say anything to you?"
"Vivi:Oh, that's right. I have to tell Zidane what Kuja said."
Zidane:About me?
"Vivi:No, no... About the Iifa Tree."
Vivi:Kuja wanted to make this world into a stage and tried to summon something from our world.
Vivi:But...this wasn't what he wanted. He felt like he had failed...
Freya:Hmm... I suppose this place holds many memories for Kuja.
Freya:He was defeated by us and shown mercy by Zidane here...
Tidus:Sounds like this guy just can't let go of the past.
Palom:So that's why he was so mad!
Vivi:I think he needs to find a reason for living in this world...
"Tidus:...He's not the only one without someplace to return to. Even so, the people here go on living in their own way."
Freya:I wonder what he's up to now... Shall we find him and extend a helping hand?
"Zidane:If he's somewhere we can reach, then let's!"
Zidane:And I'll do it because I want to.
Zidane:Even if we can't change fate...
Tidus:Going with the flow and doing it because you want to are two different things.
Zidane:You got that right!
Tidus:I won't let you be the only one looking cool around here.
Freya:Birds of a feather...
Freya:Now then...we're almost inside. Shall we?
Cater:Do you all...remember that dark manikin of Vivi?
King:Yes. I have memories of both his words and actions.
"Rem:If we return, we may forget..."
"Ace:And not just Vivi, either. Everyone here."
Freya:They seem troubled.
"Freya:They all wear the same uniform, too. Could they be from the same world?"
Vivi:That's right. The world Ace and the others are from is very special.
"Vivi:When someone dies, all memories of them disappear..."
Freya:How terrible...
"Cater:It's not, really. We actually thought it was a good thing."
King:Remembering the dead might prevent you from focusing on the battle before you.
Rem:...Do you think we're heartless?
Freya:No. The rules of each world are different.
"Freya:In a world where children like yourselves are forced to fight, it may be the right thing to do."
"Vivi:That's right! Someone very precious to you, too."
Ace:Why did he continue to fight even without his memories?
Freya:Nobody knows. Not even he himself.
Freya:He has forgotten everything. Even his hometown... Even me...
"Cater:Are you okay with that, Freya? Don't you want him to remember?"
"Freya:...At first, I did. Being forgotten was agonizing."
Freya:But now...I am just happy he's alive.
"King:Still... If he's forgotten everything, doesn't that mean it can't go back to the way it was before?"
Freya:Perhaps not. But as long as he still draws breath...
Freya:We can make new memories.
Vivi:Even if you'll eventually forget those who die...
Vivi:You can still make memories with them now while they're alive.
"King:""Now,"" huh..."
Rem:Like on this journey!
Vivi:That's right! I want to make as many memories as I can while I'm alive.
Vivi:Even if someday I forget the time I spent here...
Vivi:I'm still happy to be together with my friends at this very moment.
Ace:Vivi... You've got a strong heart.
Freya:What are you saying? Everyone has their own strength.
Freya:I think you are all strong.
"Freya:You live each day to the fullest, even knowing someday you will be forgotten. Is that not strength, too?"
Rem:I guess you've got a point.
"Ace:I'll do my best to focus on making memories ""now."""
"Ace:We may lose our memories of the people who die, but what they taught us lives on."
Kuja:I've had enough... I will put an end to this farce.
Kuja:What!?
"Kuja:Is that... I see... So they were called to this world, too."
Kuja:Your roles are insignificant.
Kuja:You have no place in this play. I will end it all!
Zidane:Do we have to get rid of this guy before we get to Kuja?
"Mog:That's right, kupo!"
Vivi:So then Kuja's fought this enemy already?
King:Or maybe Kuja put Shinryu's larvae up to the task.
"Mog:Even as one of Spiritus's warriors, he can't summon like this without Shinryu's larvae, kupo."
"Zell:So you mean Kuja didn't call it here, but used this place because it was already here?"
Zidane:And Kuja's already gotten past it...
Zidane:Did he fight it alone?
King:Does it matter? It's still here.
Zell:Right! So get ready!
"Vivi:Come on, Zidane. Let's go!"
Vivi:Is it injured...? Was that Kuja's doing?
Zidane:It might be his way of taking responsibility for all this...
"Freya:In any case, this creature is still in our way."
Steiner:That's right! We must brace ourselves for battle!
"Garnet:Even though we defeated Shinryu's larvae, nothing's changed..."
"Mog:A very intense will is distorting the dimension, kupo!"
"Mog:Their will is strong enough to maintain this space even without the larvae, kupo!"
Zidane:That means he's still here.
Steiner:I-i-is that...!?
Cid:Fog...? But it's sunny out.
Cid:Huh? Sounds like it's no ordinary mist.
Garnet:It hardens people's hearts and makes them fight. It's caused many conflicts in our world.
"Freya:It was used as energy for airships, though it held a much darker power..."
"Mog:Kupo! I sense a super strong monster, kupo!"
Garnet:Most likely that one born from the mist...
Steiner:We must defeat it before it can affect the world!
Freya:But this is unusual with the mist around...
Zidane:It's too quiet.
Garnet:Yes. There should be more dangerous monsters here.
Cid:What the $#&% are you doing standing around here talking for!?
Cid:You got a responsibility to bring down the monsters from your own world!
Zidane:Cid's right. Let's get a move on!
Kuja:GUAH...!
Kuja:I must be so...unsightly... Haha...
"Soulcage:Even having summoned me, you attempt to stop me..."
Kuja:This is...not your stage. It was...my mistake.
Soulcage:Your self-ordained mission is meaningless.
???:You okay?
Kuja:Zidane... The lead should not know what goes on behind the scenes.
Kuja:I'm culling the unnecessary scenes from the play...away from the audience's eyes.
Steiner:...Are you trying to defeat this monster on your own?
Freya:Is that your way of taking responsibility?
"Vivi:That's enough, Kuja... You can barely stand..."
Kuja:Even if I fall here...nothing changes. Nothing at all.
Soulcage:...It is as I expected.
Soulcage:I am connected to a different world...
Soulcage:I cannot send the overflowing willpower form this world to Gaia...
Soulcage:Was I not called here to use my power and force your surrender?
Kuja:...I don't need you. I want not to use any more paltry tricks.
Kuja:A never-ending story...is not one worth hearing.
"Kuja:I leave the finale to you, Zidane."
Zidane:I won't let you do this alone.
Steiner:And neither will I!
"Freya:We are with you, whether you like it or not."
Freya:I lend my spear to your cause!
Kuja:Should I not suffer punishment? Do you not remember what I've done to you?
Garnet:You're right. Countless people were sacrificed...
Garnet:But blaming you for all those crimes won't solve anything.
"Garnet:Even if you made the wrong choice and wanted war... You're still a citizen of Gaia, like us."
Zidane:There were lives I couldn't save.
"Zidane:I have my regrets, and I've thrown my tantrums."
Zidane:My weakness was detestable.
Zidane:But instead of getting mad at others and taking their lives... I decided to save them instead.
Vivi:You have to live.
"Vivi:Even if you know it will end, you have to live in the time that you have left, Kuja."
Kuja:Haha... This play really is a flop...
Kuja:I can't even hate my enemies... How ironic...
"Zidane:That may be, but we're all in agreement."
"Zidane:We stand with you, Kuja."
"Zidane:And we don't need a reason to help you, other than that we can."
"Zidane:We'll protect you, and this world!"
Kuja:I've come this far. I suppose I don't mind playing a supporting role for once.
Zidane:That's the spirit!
Kuja:...And so the curtain rises on the final act!
"Soulcage:You attempt to fulfill your mission, your reason for being in this world..."
Soulcage:So I will also carry out the purpose for which I was summoned.
"Kuja:Unfortunately for you, you have no place upon this stage."
Kuja:And all useless props will be disposed of accordingly.
Zidane:You won't be alone! We're all with you!
"Vivi:The monster is gone, but this place is still the same..."
"Mog:It looks like this space has stabilized, kupo."
"Mog:Your will was super strong, kupo! You maintained a part of a different world here!"
Kuja:Do you mean I've rewritten the gods' world?
"Mog:Looks like it, kupo!"
"Mog:If Shinryu's larvae aren't here, the Torsion connecting to another world is gone, kupo."
Zidane:And we gathered all the brilliance here. Should we just leave it as is?
"Mog:Well, there's not much we can do about it, kupo."
"Mog:We have to leave it up to the gods, kupo."
"Vaan:Not exactly a solid plan, Mog..."
"Mog:What else can I do, kupo? If I don't know, I just don't know!"
Kuja:They accept what they cannot do... And I... My will...
Vivi:Why do you compare yourself? Is it so bad being different from Zidane?
Vaan:I don't get it. Aren't you two brothers?
Zidane:No... It's fine.
Kuja:We're not like normal brothers. We have no parents.
Kuja:The only thing we have in common with other siblings is being unable to choose them.
Zidane:The feeling's mutual! Who would ever choose you as a brother!?
Kuja:Haha... Things are finally getting interesting.
Kuja:I think I'll enjoy the story a little longer. I'll take complaints later.
Vivi:...There he goes.
Cecil:Will he not be tainted by darkness again? He may send assassins after us...
"Zidane:It's just a feeling, but...even if we fight, I don't think he'll do that again."
Zidane:He might not know what he's living for here yet...
Zidane:But he's decided to live whatever time he's got left.
Vivi:If he makes a mistake...I'll stop him. If he's somewhere I can reach...I'll speak to him.
Zidane:Yeah. Let's do that. Are you guys okay with that?
"Cecil:We have no reason to doubt you and your friends, Zidane."
"Mog:Then let's get going to the next area, kupo!"
Cid:$#&%! How could I lose to Setzer!?
Vaan:You guys decided the pilot without me!?
Cid:Of course we did! You weren't even in the running! No fool'd put an inexperienced brat like you in the cockpit!
"Vaan:I'm no amateur! Come on, I can fly, too!"
"Vaan:And anyway, you shouldn't gamble with Setzer. He cheats."
Cid:WHAT!? That $#&%! I lost big time!
Vaan:You can't just name the airship like that!
Zidane:Hahaha! There's never a dull moment with these guys.
Vivi:Yeah... I like our new friends.
"Vivi:Even if I'm scared...I can still be brave. Not because I want to defeat my enemy, but because I want to protect my friends."
"Zidane:Yeah, same here."
Cecil:Are you two ready to go? The journey isn't over yet.
Zidane:I was born ready! Let's go!
Spiritus:So Kuja rewrote the world.
Spiritus:This place has always been unstable...
"Spiritus:But even if he overwrites what is here, it has no influence on my world."
Spiritus:This realm is meant to be a respite for the warriors.
Spiritus:They should change it however they see fit.
"Spiritus:I cannot imagine Materia taking this so lightly, though..."
Spiritus:Hmph... She can do whatever she wishes with this trivial little world.
Spiritus:My only concern is my world alone!
Materia:How could it be? This world has been altered by one of Spiritus's warriors...
Materia:This is precisely why I opposed his aim of giving them both their memories and unbridled power!
Materia:The warriors were meant to rest under my protection...
Materia:They were supposed to forget their painful past and restore their spirits here.
Materia:...Who must be dealt with first? Kuja? Or Spiritus?
Materia:No... Spiritus's warriors are strong. I mustn't be reckless and send my warriors to their deaths.
Materia:I will keep watch a little longer and summon new warriors to gather brilliance...
"Materia:And when they are strong enough, they will defend this world from them."
"Materia:Together, we will protect this world...!"
Materia:There are those you know fighting to protect this world.
???:No. You're making them fight.
"???:Besides, didn't you say they won't even remember me?"
Materia:It was done so that she can fight.
???:But Yuna's finished with that.
???:You just decided to do that on your own.
Materia:I have a duty to protect this world.
Materia:And the safety of this world means rest for all of you.
???:Are you even listening to me?
???:Not like it matters. You're not going to let me go home anyway.
???:What should I do when I meet up with Yuna?
Materia:You'll be able to see her once you leave this place.
Materia:But do not forget: they won't be the same people you knew.
"???:So then what? Just say, ""Nice to meet you""?"
Materia:That's correct. It will give their hearts some needed respite.
???:Give whose what a respite now?
???:Stop deciding things for me.
???:I'll make my own choices.
Materia:I summoned warriors who possess powerful wills...
Materia:But humans can easily lose their way... I pray they do not stray from the path.
Setzer:Is that a storm...?
Zack:Drive safely now! There are children aboard.
Setzer:The clouds ahead are unbelievably large...
"Setzer:Is it unusual in this world, Mog?"
Mog:Kupo kupo... Yes. Something seems to be wrong with the space-time continuum.
Tidus:Did you detect something?
"Mog:It seems like there's brilliance nearby! That's what's causing the distortion, kupo!"
Lightning:It's most likely an enemy.
"Yuna:Isn't it possible it's friendly, though?"
"Mog:I won't know until we get closer, kupo."
Setzer:I'm landing the ship. Carefulit may be a bumpy ride!
Firion:Those clouds... Could it be...?
"Yuna:Though I knew I had never seen that devastated town before, something about it felt familiar."
"Yuna:And even knowing it was created by the gods, we all gazed at it so sadly..."
Lightning:They've got poor taste.
"Zack:You know this place? I feel like I've seen it before, too."
Zack:I guess it reminds me of the slums...
"Zack:No, the slums were different. It wasn't deserted like this. It was full of life."
"Zack:...Then again, I don't know what became of it after that. ...Huh?"
Tidus:Maybe it's part of the enemy's plan. They might be trying to scare us.
"Lightning:Back in my world, it took years to reach this level of destruction."
"Lightning:Even if someone purposely made it this way, I won't be shaken by it."
Lightning:What do you think?
Tidus:Hmm... It's complicated.
"Jecht:We have a city like this, too. But still...to look at ruins like these after all this time..."
"Yuna:This is...a fake, right?"
"Mog:If you're asking about the shape of this world, that cloud over there is causing a huge distortion, kupo."
"Mog:I think most places originally from the World of Darkness are like this, kupo."
"Lightning:Will we find the brilliance in that storm, Mog?"
"Mog:That storm looks dangerous, kupo. Let's search this town first!"
"Mog:Kupo! My pompom is tingling, kupo!"
"Mog:It senses a strong will in someone over there, kupo!"
"Mog:It might be someone with a connection...to Yuna, kupo!"
Yuna:Me? I wonder who it could be...
"Tidus:If they have a connection to Yuna, shouldn't all of us know them?"
"Mog:I don't get that feeling, kupo... Let's be careful!"
Yuna:I wondered who it could be...
"Yuna:Sadly, I didn't remember her at all."
???:You're really here.
Yuna:Oh! Um...
Warrior of Light:Mog said she might be someone you know. Is she an ally of ours?
"???:Sorry, but I don't know you. The only one I know here is Yuna."
Tidus:...An old acquaintance of Yuna's?
Auron:...Not that I know of.
"???:But I know you. You're a legendaryguardian. And you're Wakka, fromBesaid."
Wakka:Huh? Have we met before?
"???:""Are you a warrior of Spira?"""
"???:...You really don't remember, do you?"
Yuna:I...I'm so sorry.
Yuna:I just can't seem to recall who you are...
???:It's fine. I knew this would happen. It's that goddess's fault you forgot in the first place.
Paine:I'm Paine.
"Paine:""Nice to meet you."""
Yuna:But it wasn't our first time meeting.
"Yuna:I'm so sorry I made you say such a terrible thing, Paine..."
"Warrior of Light:If you've met Materia, then that means you know what's happening here. Would you lend us your strength?"
"Paine:Hmm... Don't know. Nobody knows who I am, after all."
"Wakka:Is it a good idea to bring her along? We don't know anything about her, so she could possibly be our enemy..."
"Tidus:Whoa! ...Did you remember something, Yuna?"
"Yuna:Um... Well... No, not really."
"Yuna:...But I know you aren't our enemy, even though I can't remember who you are."
Paine:...Stop looking so sad already.
"Paine:I appreciate the sentiment, Yuna."
Yuna:But I feel terrible...
"Yuna:I know you're someone very important to me, and yet I've completely forgotten..."
"Paine:No, no, no. You've got it all wrong!"
Paine:Was Yuna always like this?
"Auron:To my knowledge, yes."
"Auron:...But to your knowledge, perhaps she was different."
"Auron:Seeing as you're an acquaintance of Yuna's, why not come with us?"
"Auron:If you don't like it, you can get off the airship wherever you please."
Warrior of Light:There seem to be discrepancies in some of our memories.
Warrior of Light:Traveling together may give you a chance to resolve these differences.
Paine:I'll do that. I didn't plan on leaving Yuna like this anyway.
"Yuna:Everyone wanted to know more about Paine, including us."
Paine:You want me to introduce myself?
"Zidane:Yeah! Like how you met Yuna, or what you think about this world."
"Yuna:But you hate those kinds of things, don't you? I'm so sorry we pushed you."
Paine:I'll have to pass.
"Zidane:Bummer... If you change your mind, let us know."
"Serah:Take your time getting used to us. At first, people didn't know who I was, either."
"Wakka:You're a friend of Yuna's, right?"
Wakka:I feel like I should know you. But I can't remember where we met...
"Paine:Well, don't feel bad. I don't know this version of you. You're less tubby than when I met you."
"Serah:Compared to the time my sister comes from, I'm from the future."
"Serah:And if you're also from the future, Paine... That must mean Wakka gets tubby, right?"
Wakka:Stop saying that word! I'm not tubby! I'm a professional blitzball player!
"Tidus:Tubby, huh... That's why you can't neglect your training."
Zidane:She looks upset.
Zidane:Did Tidus do something rude to you?
Paine:Not really.
"Zidane:Tidus, you had better apologize."
Zidane:Especially to people like her...
Tidus:Why do I need to apologize!?
Tidus:I remember everyone I met in Spira!
Tidus:I mean...
Tidus:...I remember everything about our journey.
Tidus:Even what happened to me...
"Yuna:I wonder how I knew you, Paine. What kind of connection did we have...?"
Serah:There's no point worrying about it now. You'll remember eventually.
"Yuna:...It's not just myself I'm worried about, but Spira as well."
Yuna:Because Paine is so strong...
"Yuna:It makes me think that the people in Spira's future have to be strong, too."
Paine:You're worried about everyone.
Paine:Nothing.
Zidane:You sure don't beat around the bush. But you don't seem like a bad egg to me.
Zidane:I meant it as a good thing.
Zidane:I wanted to lighten the mood a little since you and Yuna seem to be troubled by all this...
Paine:...Nobody asked for your help.
"Wakka:Oh, man... Now she's mad."
"Tidus:Yeesh. I don't envy you, Zidane, that's for sure."
"Serah:Don't think so hard about it. If you travel together, you'll figure it out at some point."
Paine:Wouldn't that be nice.
Yuna:It was like Paine said. The me of that time was working hard for the sake of everyone...
Yuna:I thought only of others and never stopped to think about myself.
"The Emperor:Show yourself, you insolent fool."
"Seymour:Insolent, am I?"
The Emperor:And what business have you with it?
Seymour:A partnership. It seems I also have ties to this place.
"Seymour:And a ruler needs resources, does he not?"
The Emperor:You feign to offer me an alliance...
The Emperor:But you're naught but a wolf in sheep's clothing.
"Seymour:It's better than being betrayed by a trusted confidant, is it not?"
The Emperor:You mean the dark knight... He was merely a sacrificial pawn.
Seymour:...If you say so.
"Seymour:Now then, the moogle's group draws ever closer to you."
The Emperor:My castle will not be shaken by mere worms.
"Seymour:And yet a single hole eaten through the walls can bring down an entire hall, can it not?"
Seymour:...I suggest exterminating the pests before they infest your fortress.
The Emperor:Hmph... Just what are you trying to do?
"Seymour:I would like to use this castle, if only for a moment."
Seymour:I desire nothing more than to break their willsthe source of their power in this world.
"Seymour:Next you see them, they will be so thoroughly crushed that they can barely crawl"
Seymour:Like the very worms they are.
The Emperor:Interesting... Is that truly your desire?
"Seymour:It would benefit us both, would it not?"
The Emperor:Then know this: I will not forgive any damage done to the foundation of my rule.
"Seymour:...Indeed, it changes not what I intend to do."
"Yuna:Even though we were journeying together, I still couldn't seem to remember..."
"Yuna:I was trying too hard, just like before."
Yuna:That's why Paine...
Paine:...You're really an adult?
"Laguna:Doesn't look it, right? But that's what he says!"
Laguna:It seems like the discrepancies in our memories is reflected in our appearances.
Eiko:But I'm sure you'll remember eventually!
"Eiko:Paine might be sad for now, but Yuna will definitely remember!"
Paine:Pitied by a child...
"Paine:...Or are you an adult, too?"
"Laguna:Naw, Eiko is as much a child as she looks. But, well...it's complicated."
"Eiko:How rude! Even though I'm small, I'm still a lady!"
Laguna:Whoops! You're right! I hope you'll forgive ol' Laguna!
Layle:What's with the long face? Are you really that bothered by it?
Yuna:Yes...and no. Maybe.
Yuna:Lightning and Cecil found both their brilliance and memories after meeting people they knew.
"Yuna:And now that Paine's here, I feel like I need to remember."
"Layle:""Need to,"" huh..."
Layle:You're pretty hard on yourself.
Paine:Stop trying so hard.
Yuna:But why?
Paine:I don't want you trying so hard for me.
Yuna:But I...
Eiko:Hey! That's harsh!
Layle:...It must be hard being so tactless.
Layle:You won't be able to do anything if you're that worried about those around you.
Seymour:Well... This is a rare treat.
Layle:Tsk. I doubt anyone called you. To what do we owe the pleasure?
Seymour:I came to tell you about this woman. Who she is and her connection to you...
"Paine:Well, you're no friend of mine. ...Though I guess I know as much about you as anyone else."
Seymour:Spiritus told me about what happened after I perished.
Seymour:And embarked on a journey with you.
Seymour:All for the purpose of fulfilling a selfish wish.
"Seymour:Though the people were counting on her to be their strength, she betrayed their hopes. Just how many despaired, I wonder..."
Yuna:I would never...!
Seymour:And what's worse... You've completely forgotten and have immersed yourself in self-sacrifice once more.
"Laguna:Don't listen to him, Yuna. I have a bad feeling about what he's saying."
Layle:You came just to say that? Don't you have better things to do?
Layle:Do you think anyone will believe what you're saying?
Seymour:She knows this to be truth.
Yuna:What!? Did I do something like that!?
Paine:Wanna get hurt?
"Eiko:That's right! If you bully Yuna, I won't forgive you!"
Seymour:That's fine with me... Let chaos consume you.
Seymour:How intriguing... Seeing you defend someone who has forgotten you...
Paine:I decide who I fight.
"Tidus:You never change, do you?"
Yuna:What should I do...?
Paine:Don't let him shake you. What he says doesn't matter.
Yuna:What he said probably wasn't true.
Yuna:I think he just wanted to dishearten us...
"Seymour:You are strong, Lady Yuna... Your will is still firm."
"Seymour:To you, I'm someone who should not exist, aren't I?"
Yuna:What do you mean?
"Seymour:You think some people deserve to exist, while others don't. That man, for example, is one you believe should exist."
"Tidus:What are you rambling on about, Seymour!?"
Seymour:Let me remind you what happened.
Seymour:You went on a journey with her to save him.
Seymour:You selfishly decided who deserved to live and did not.
Seymour:You cared not for the others who perished and thought only of your own emotions.
Paine:He's wrong. Don't listen to him.
Seymour:Am I?
Seymour:Did the grand summoner not embark on a journey to find clues of this man's whereabouts?
"Paine:So what!? In the end, Yuna"
Paine:...I'm gonna hurt you!
Seymour:But of course. Next we meet.
Ramza:Taking advantage of the blanks in someone's memories... How knavish. And there's nothing we can do about it.
Tidus:You were...looking for me?
Yuna:I don't know... I can't remember. Did I really do something for my own sake...?
Paine:No! He's wrong!
"Quistis:Calm down, Paine. There's no point in pushing yourself."
Paine:You guys have no idea what's going on here.
Freya:But it is because of that we can be of help.
"Ramza:Why not explain it to us? If we understand what's going on, there might be something we can do."
Freya:...Paine does not want you to rush to get your memories of her back.
Freya:Regaining one's lost memories is no easy feat...
"Freya:Moreover, it is difficult to bear the sight of someone trying so hard..."
"Quistis:It seems Paine can be clumsy with her words, so we thought it best for us to explain it in her stead."
Freya:She wishes for you to be positive. That is all.
Yuna:Be positive... But is that enough...?
Ramza:Seymour's story is extreme. You ought not put too much thought into it.
Tidus:My head hurts just remembering it... There's no point in thinking at a time like this.
"Yuna:...I understand. It won't be easy, but...I'll give it a try."
Yuna:It felt strange trying to do my best to not do my best.
"Yuna:But at that time, I really did try my hardest just to be positive."
Jecht:All of Materia's warriors seem to be having trouble with their memories. Even Yuna.
Squall:But Spiritus' warriors don't.
"Jecht:Yeah. He filled in all our blanks, even for things we don't want to remember."
Jecht:It just makes my head hurt.
Kain:Our memories are not all good things.
"Kain:Within them can lie resentment, hatred, a longing for unfulfilled wishes..."
Kain:It seems Spiritus thinks those things give them power in battle.
"Hope:In this world, a person's emotional strength becomes their power..."
"Hope:I wonder if it's the same for negative emotions, too."
Squall:(Now that you mention it...)
"Raijin:Poor Yuna. Lost her memories, and now followed around by that Seymour guy, ya know?"
"Seifer:Hmph. If he wants a fight, he'll get one."
"Seifer:The next time we meet, I'll cut him down before he can get a word out."
Squall:(The only reason he has sympathy for Yuna is because he wants to be a sorceress's knight.)
Squall:Maybe it's better to fight without any memories...
Kain:Spiritus seems to be very good at using people's emotions.
Jecht:And what about Materia? Were you told anything?
Hope:I think a lot of our comrades were already in this world when they came to.
"Hope:But it seems Materia's become more cautious since the World of Light's crystal core shattered, telling everyone about the situation since."
Kain:...The gods originally made this world as a place of respite for us.
Jecht:So does she think losing our memories is going to make us happy? ...And here I thought I was a dunce at emotions!
Hope:Forgetting...makes you happier... That reminds me!
Hope:There's no way... No. If that's the case...
Jecht:We can't hear you when you mumble. Care to share with the rest of the class?
Hope:Umm... I might have told you that I'm much older than I look.
Squall:You said you chose that appearance.
"Hope:Yes. And, at that time..."
Hope:...I remember Materia helping me.
"Kain:Are you suggesting Spiritus has the power to give memories, and Materia has the power to take them and give respite?"
Squall:(...How absurd.)
Jecht:So what then!? Are we supposed to just leave her be even when Yuna's suffering!?
"Hope:It's just a theory, but maybe the memories Materia took from us were being held by Spiritus."
Hope:And now those memories are manifesting themselves in this world as brilliance.
"Kain:You might be right. Whenever we get our hands on brilliance, it seems we regain our memories."
Squall:(Isn't that a bit irresponsible?)
"Jecht:If that's the case, then we need to find Yuna's memories."
"Raijin:You all look so serious. We should get going, ya know?"
Seifer:Leave 'em alone. They're just talking nonsense.
"Hope:Thanks. We'll be on our way shortly, so go on ahead."
Squall:(How old is he again?)
Jecht:Let's go. Nothing's gonna happen by us standing around here waiting.
Yuna:Sir Jecht said that Spiritus told his warriors all kinds of things about us
Yuna:Biased things to make them want to fight us.
Yuna:But why would he do such a thing...?
Spiritus:The world after your death is vibrant and full of life...
Spiritus:Do you know why?
Seymour:The people of Spira abhorred me and projected that same hatred onto my entire race.
Spiritus:Their home is now occupied by others.
Spiritus:The remaining few now wait to die out in solitude.
Seymour:...I understand what you are trying to do.
Seymour:You wish to light a fire in those who have lost and spur them into battle.
Spiritus:One's will is power in this world.
Spiritus:My warriors need only be strong.
Seymour:Then I shall consider it an honor to be chosen by you.
Seymour:Now then... I felt strong presences nearby...
Dark Manikin (Auron):Are you after the brilliance?
Seymour:How interesting... Puppet soldiers with no emotion.
Dark Manikin (Wakka):Are you...an enemy...?
"Dark Manikin (Auron):If you intend to enter this area, we'll strike you down."
"Seymour:I see... The more emotional the original was, the more distant their puppet becomes."
Seymour:And I suppose those borne of cold originals can effectively use their power to complete their mission.
Dark Manikin (Yuna):We will not hand over our precious memories to you.
Seymour:Oh? She seems slightly different.
Dark Manikin (Yuna):We carry important memories with usboth good and bad.
"Dark Manikin (Yuna):We must return them to ourselves, the ones from the World of Light."
Dark Manikin (Yuna):I know these memories will make them stronger.
Seymour:So the strength of your will is the same as your originals...
Seymour:And those who retain memories as brilliance are easily influenced by their originals...
Dark Manikin (Tidus):What do you want from us?
Seymour:Nothing. Do you intend to wait for your originals here?
Seymour:Or...perhaps you would like to wait in that castle over there?
Dark Manikin (Auron):Are you working with the Emperor?
Seymour:I wouldn't say that.
"Seymour:I have no intention of becoming someone in power, but of using him."
Dark Manikin (Yuna):Yuna from the World of Light...
"Yuna:Shortly after that, I got the feeling that someone was waiting for me."
Squall:(What's going on... She's surrounded by people.)
"Zell:Hearing you say stuff like, ""Wanna get hurt?"" is always so cool!"
Cater:Maybe I'll give it a try next time!
Squall:(She seems annoyed...)
Zell:You're so unsociable! You remind me of Squall.
Squall:(We're nothing alike.)
Paine:We're nothing alike.
Squall:(...I'm glad I kept my mouth shut.)
"Aerith:It's not easy dealing with us when we crowd around like this, is it?"
Paine:You got that right.
"Squall:(She's got that right... It looks like she's clumsy with people, too.)"
Aerith:Are there any others who remember you?
Aerith:It must be hard being the only one who remembers.
"Paine:Back in my world, we have a saying."
"Paine:""Memories are nice, but that's all they are."""
Paine:I finally understand. I think of those words a lot here.
Cater:You're not wrong. People can't help but reminisce.
"Aerith:But I like making new memories in this world, too."
Paine:You're quite positive.
Aerith:Isn't life better that way?
"Zell:But not being able to remember is annoying, too..."
Squall:(That's right. Zell and the others haven't yet...)
"Aerith:Still, I'd want to enjoy the time it takes until I do remember."
Squall:(She's strong...)
Paine:You're strong.
Squall:(I better keep my mouth shut when she's around...)
"Yuna:When we met them, we could tell they had no evil intent."
Tidus:Are there still things I'm forgetting?
Dark Manikin (Tidus):Yeah. Very important things.
"Dark Manikin (Yuna):Even though we have memories, there's nothing we can really do..."
Dark Manikin (Yuna):We cannot laugh or cry.
Dark Manikin (Tidus):That's why you should take them. They'll be of more use to you than they are to us.
Yuna:It would have been better had I not known. What should I do...?
"Cecil:Fret not, Yuna. You're strong."
"Zack:Besides, if you continued not knowing, wouldn't you just feel bad later on?"
Dark Manikin (Yuna):You'll be fine as long as you stay positive.
Yuna:You're right. Paine said the same.
Yuna:...I'll do my best!
Tidus:Yuna... You've changed.
Dark Manikin (Tidus):That's what you need to remember.
"Zack:So if we fight you, you'll hand over those memories?"
"Dark Manikin (Yuna):That's correct. Our wills must clash. Everyone, please lend them your strength."
Yuna:Would you help us?
Zack:Of course!
"Cecil:We'll fight together, to get back everyone's memories!"
"Auron:Is there something I'm forgetting, too?"
"Dark Manikin (Yuna):Yes. It's not much, but it's sure to come in handy."
Auron:I see... Then I look forward to remembering.
"Tidus:Yeah. If there are still gaps in my memories, I wanna fill them all!"
Jecht:This brilliance must be Yuna's memories.
Y'shtola:What's the matter?
Yuna:I'm so embarrassed about what I remembered...
"Tidus:Yeah. Me, too."
Jecht:What happened to them?
Auron:Rejoice. They have a future we didn't.
"Jecht:...Right. Heh. I don't know what kind of miracle happened, but..."
"Jecht:As long as they live, there's always a way, eh, Auron?"
"Auron:Please, don't bring up the past..."
Jecht:Haha! You were such a stiff back then.
Jecht:But Auron...
Jecht:Now that other way has shown us something amazing.
Auron:...I suppose you're right. Something like this used to be impossible...
"Yuna:I'm so sorry I forgot, Paine."
Paine:It's too late now.
"Yuna:""Wanna get hurt?"""
Paine:Don't say that again...ever.
"Yuna:That's very kind of you to say, Paine."
Paine:You'd rather me be mean?
"Yuna:I, I was just kidding!"
Y'shtola:I'm so relieved. Even we could tell she was trying much too hard.
Jecht:Yeah. And now she's all smiles.
"Jecht:I guess that means life in Spira's gotten easier, huh? No more kids Yuna's age carrying such a heavy burden."
"Tidus:You don't have to worry about that, old man. But still...it ain't easy being human."
Jecht:Don't talk like you know.
Auron:Enough. You're not old enough to be giving sermons.
"Yuna:Well, it's been about two years since that journey. Spira has changed a lot since then."
Yuna:I really wish you two could see it...
Paine:Positive thoughts!
"Yuna:You're right! At least in this world, we can still talk about it."
Auron:It's the only merit of this world.
"Y'shtola:Yes... Here, you can learn things you should not know."
Y'shtola:And you can see comrades whom you've missed... I think that is indeed its only merit.
"Tidus:I figured that, Yuna being Yuna, her life as the Grand Summoner would still be hectic, trying to help everyone."
"Paine:It was, for two years. But then she tried to change."
Yuna:Did I change?
"Paine:Can't say. In the end, you couldn't turn a blind eye to anyone who needed help."
"Yuna:But it was all for my own sake...or, it should have been."
"Paine:But that's fine, Yuna."
"Yuna:Hearing that from you makes me feel strong, Paine!"
Yuna:I wish I could see her. Then we can all go hunting together!
Yuna:And my next journey starts now!
Yuna:Um... Have you remembered?
Tidus:Yeah. I met you after you changed.
Yuna:I see.
"Yuna:...To be honest, I'm a little nervous even now."
Yuna:Maester Seymour still resents me for what I've done.
Yuna:He was not one of the people I wanted to save.
"Tidus:I don't think anyone would fault you for it, Seymour being who he is."
Yuna:Was it all right for me to decide who should be saved and who shouldn't?
Tidus:It wasn't something you decided. The reason you brought me back had nothing to do with that.
"Tidus:I'm sure there were a lot of others you wanted to bring back, too."
"Yuna:In my heart, I know that, but..."
"Tidus:You went on a journey to find me, didn't you? Don't say that it was a mistake."
Yuna:...It wasn't.
"Sabin:I suppose it's best we don't bother them now, even though we found a road into the storm."
Auron:Let us take our leave.
"Jecht:Stop right there, Auron."
Jecht:You need to stay!
Auron:...Why should I?
Jecht:Because I say so!
Jecht:Seeing my son and Braska's kid like that...mumbling to each other...
Onion Knight:Awful antsy for a father.
Jecht:There's no old man in the world who can calm down after becoming a father!
"Auron:You're not an old man yet, though, are you?"
"Galuf:You make a good point, Jecht. The same will be true when you're a grandfather."
Galuf:Grandchildren are such a joy. You'll do anything for them.
"Jecht:Ugh, I don't even wanna imagine it!"
"Sabin:Haha! It sounds like you've got a lot to learn, Jecht!"
"Jecht:If you ever have kids, you'll understand!"
"Onion Knight:Yeah, yeah. In any case, let's get a move on."
"Vaan:I'm happy that you got your memories back and all, but is anything different now?"
"Paine:If I told you the whole story, it'd take days."
Cloud:Maybe Seymour was saying things to try and stir up trouble.
Yuna:Yes. But there are still a few things I should explain.
Yuna:Not everything Maester Seymour said was untrue.
Yuna:I had heard news about Tidus.
"Tidus:After the battle, I disappeared in front of everyone's eyes."
Tidus:So Yuna went on a journey to find me.
Yuna:I suppose it is true that I did it for my own sake.
Vaan:But I don't think it's as bad as Seymour made it seem.
Cloud:But he used that information to drive Yuna into a corner...
Yuna:I think he wanted to weaken me and my friends.
Cloud:He tried to crush our wills by trampling on our feelings.
Wakka:Calling me tubby sure trampled on mine...
Paine:Tubby.
Wakka:Show some respect! I'm not tubby now!
"Yuna:Anyway, at the very end of my journey, I was able to see Tidus again."
Yuna:Though I'm afraid he may still be a dream and disappear again...
"Paine:Everyone feels the same, even people from different worlds."
Cloud:Yeah... People can vanish from your life at any time.
"Vaan:I don't really get it, but aren't you together now?"
"Tidus:Yeah, we don't need to worry about what happens later."
Yuna:I think I'll be fine facing Maester Seymour now.
"Yuna:Because there are things I will believe and won't give up on, no matter what he tells me."
Cloud:You've gotten stronger.
Paine:No. This is the real Yuna.
"Vaan:By the way, why was she angry at you?"
Tidus:...I completely forgot that I made Yuna worry.
"Paine:And if you do it again, you're in for a world of hurt."
"Tidus:I won't do it again, I swear!"
"Vaan:Hmm... You look scary, but you're actually very nice, Paine."
"Paine:You wanna get hurt, too?"
Cloud:Quit while you're ahead. There's no helping Vaan.
Vaan:Hey! What's that supposed to mean!?
Paine:What're you laughing at?
"Yuna:The fact that you're one of us now, Paine."
Paine:Say it clearer.
Yuna:I'm happy we can go on another journey together!
Seymour:It seems like you've gotten your memories back.
"Seymour:Now you understand what you threw away and what you gained, don't you?"
Yuna:I haven't thrown anything away.
Seymour:You mean to say you saved everyone on your second journey?
Seymour:Or perhaps you never thought of them to begin with?
Paine:Stop trying to pick a fight. We did what we could.
Seymour:Is that so? But did you not put your own desires first?
"Seymour:Of course, that includes you..."
Paine:You're ticking me off.
Seymour:Humans cannot escape their own desires...
"Seymour:And should those desires conflict, a fight is inevitable."
Seymour:Certainly the Grand Summoner defeated a great evil and brought about peace.
"Seymour:However, doing so uprooted Spira's values and conflict ensued."
Seymour:Humans are foolish existences that desire strife for as long as they live.
Yuna:It's true that there was conflict...
Yuna:But we can stop it!
"Yuna:And even if you say that fighting is inevitable, I refuse to give up so easily."
Ace:You didn't give up...on resolving the fight...
Onion Knight:Aren't you the one who tried to pick a fight by saying that dying is better?
Yuna:It's easy to give up on resolving something and pick up a weapon.
Yuna:But I can't say people who do that are fools.
"Yuna:Still, I don't want to give up. It's not something I will just accept!"
Seymour:Hahaha! What a hypocrite!
"Ace:Even if she is a hypocrite, Yuna did what she set out to do."
Ace:If there is a path to resolution that isn't filled with violence and death...
Ace:Then I want to take it!
Onion Knight:That's right!
"Onion Knight:If sacrifices are made for some goal, whether it be yourself or others..."
Onion Knight:In the end...there's nothing but sadness.
Paine:Everyone stands with Yuna. We won't listen to what you have to say.
Seymour:So my words have no audience here...
"Seymour:It's no matter, as long as you face me with knowledge of your own crimes."
"Seymour:Now, accept death as your punishment!"
Seymour:You resort to your weapons in the end... But I cannot expect more from those already soaked in blood.
Yuna:You were the one who gave up on talking.
"Yuna:But I can't agree with you, Seymour. I don't believe that death is salvation."
Yuna:I want to keep on living and searching for new possibilities!
Seymour:So be it then... It's time for you to be judged!
Seymour:...So my turn ends here. But now...
Bartz:What!? A castle...!?
Firion:Is this...the Emperor's Pandaemonium!?
Seymour:...It will be the stage for your revenge.
Firion:The rebel army doesn't need revenge!
Seymour:You mean to say you fought with only righteous indignation? There was no resentment at having your family and hometown stolen from you?
Seymour:Be honest. For what reason did you take up your sword and fight?
Seymour:Were not both comrades and enemies slain in the name of vengeance?
Firion:What do you know!?
Shantotto:Don't lose your cool. He's trying to play you for a fool.
Yuna:Do you intend to make others miserable with your lies?
Seymour:Lies? What an interesting choice of words.
Seymour:I speak only the truth.
Yuna:You're twisting the story!
Seymour:You should understand my words better than anyone.
Seymour:...Until next we meet.
"Bartz:You said the Emperor, right? The one who wants to rule us?"
Bartz:...Did he make this castle?
"Mog:I sense a strong will in there, kupo...and one of Shinryu's larvae, too."
"Shantotto:If past experiences are any indication, the castle's keeper must be in a nearby location."
Firion:We need to defeat him! We cannot leave the Emperor to his own devices.
Yuna:Let's go together. We can support you.
Bartz:Yeah! We won't let you go alone!
"Mog:It seems like it was very meticulously built. We should proceed with caution, kupo!"
Irvine:Hey. What're you folks talking about?
Cyan:Sir Sabin saw those two doing something rather...careless.
Irvine:He saw who now?
"Lilisette:Serah and Snow. Even though they're engaged, they're not doing so hot..."
Rem:They love each other very much. Anyone can see that.
Penelo:But all they do is make the other worry...
"Rem:They sure aren't the only ones, though."
"Irvine:Ohhh, you mean Yuna and"
Freya:I think that is best left unsaid...
"Cyan:But because of his long training, Sir Sabin is unfamiliar with the nuances of gossip..."
"Penelo:But it's great, isn't it? You get the feeling that they understand each other."
Freya:Indeed. The brilliance of their honesty is a joy to behold.
"Cyan:Young, passionate love will gradually turn steadfast over time. There is nothing for us to worry about."
"Irvine:Whoa. I never took you for that kind of person, Cyan."
Penelo:Hmm? I can see what you mean...
Cyan:Does not everyone have something to protect?
Lilisette:You're right! It'd be great to have a partner like that! The only people I seem to attract are weirdos!
"Lilisette:But...if we're talking about special someones, I guess I might have some..."
Freya:Everyone has someone or something worth fighting for. There is no need to put a name on it.
"Irvine:Hmm... In the end, it's love, isn't it?"
"Firion:...Revenge, huh."
Tidus:What's the matter?
Maria:Sorry. I was just thinking about Seymour's words... Something about it makes me uneasy.
Tidus:You should just ignore what he said.
Edgar:It seems like your rebel army was also involved in quite the serious fight.
Maria:Yes... We lost many of our friends along the way.
"Maria:I cannot say I did not bear any hatred for having my family taken from me, either."
"Maria:Still, many of my friends lost their lives because of my contempt..."
Maria:I suppose that makes me a villain...
"Firion:Our comrades all had their reasons for fighting. When their lives were lost, they passed those reasons onto us."
Firion:We didn't waste their precious sacrifices.
Maria:But those who perished will never return!
"Edgar:Please, calm down. I would hate to see you cry."
"Cait Sith:Sad as it may be, it's something you can't avoid during a revolt. It's the price you pay for trying to change something."
"Ashe:I guess you're right... For the powerless, there are only sacrifices."
"Edgar:Don't think it's only a problem for the princess who's lost her kingdom, though."
"Edgar:Even having a wielder of sealed magics on your side, there are still those who lose their lives."
Edgar:Even saying that it wasn't a matter of personal hatred...
Edgar:Those lost lives won't come back.
"Cait Sith:Far from it, those who say it's for the sake of ""everyone"" are the most dangerous."
"Cait Sith:They say ""everyone,"" but exclude people who they consider ""necessary sacrifices."" That drives me batty."
Cait Sith:What of the sakes of those sacrificed?
Firion:I...couldn't just stand still.
"Firion:My hometown was razed to the ground, and I was saved by the rebel army..."
Firion:But I didn't want it to end like that. I knew there was something we could do...
Firion:There was definitely hatred and sadness then.
"Firion:So if someone calls it ""revenge"" and ""selfish desire,"" then...there's not much I can say in return."
Tidus:Were you pretending to fight for everyone's sake even when it was only for yourself?
Maria:That...might not be untrue.
Edgar:I understand your fear. Even I have difficulty collecting my thoughts.
"Ashe:So you mean that, even though what you did was meant for the sake of all, in the end it may have been for your own reasons?"
Edgar:You get bound by that spell the moment you lose sight of your peoples' faces.
Edgar:...It's a sad reality of royalty.
Cait Sith:But Seymour went too far. There's no point in thinking about what he said. It's just a waste of energy!
Tidus:That's right! You shouldn't take what he said at face value.
Firion:Right... I'll try not to.
Yuna:Is everything alright? You seem...down.
"Firion:I look that way even to you, Yuna? ...Tidus said the same."
Firion:My apologies for making you worry.
Yuna:Please don't apologize.
Yuna:Is there anything we can do?
Maria:...You're very kind.
"Yuna:Maester Seymour was originally after me, but he dragged you into it, too."
Firion:I know I shouldn't listen to what he says.
Firion:But the others have had similar experiences.
Maria:It makes me remember the friends I've lost.
Yuna:That feeling is certainly important.
"Yuna:Being mad, holding a grudge, or feeling sad..."
Yuna:You're told that not having those are better.
"Yuna:...I used to believe that, so I would always show a smile."
Yuna:But I know I was wrong...
Yuna:Ignoring those feelings will cause them to explode later.
Maria:I thought that those who were held by hatred were bad.
Yuna:But what makes a person good or bad
"Yuna:Is not what they do, but what they've done."
Firion:What we did... I wonder if we could have avoided sacrifices.
"Yuna:But it's not like you can say, ""From now on, we must do this,"" right?"
"Maria:I wonder if the day will ever come where I can avoid a fight, even with sadness and regret in my heart..."
"Firion:Yuna, you said you fought for the sake of everyone, didn't you?"
"Yuna:My first journey was for everyone, yes."
Yuna:I abandoned my own feelings.
Yuna:But the journey I took with Paine was different. I did it for myself.
"Yuna:...In the end, I got everyone involved, and it became another journey of saving others."
Yuna:But I have no regrets.
Yuna:Because I learned that my own feelings are as important as those of others.
Maria:Can those two truly coexist? Doesn't one have to be sacrificed...?
"Yuna:I'm no sure, but...I've decided not to give up."
"Yuna:If I accept something as inevitable and give up, I might regret not doing anything later."
"Firion:...You're right, Yuna."
Maria:Seymour was trying to rile us up with his words and destroy our will to fight...
"Maria:Thank you for talking to us, Yuna. I feel better already."
"Yuna:I'm sure there are things the others can do for you, too, so don't be afraid to ask."
"???:Spiritus gave me a craving for power, and the Emperor took advantage of that, but..."
???:No. Now is not the time for thinking. It is the time for action.
"Mog:It looks like he made the castle using the dimensional hole this larvae made, kupo!"
Warrior of Light:Are you sure about this?
Firion:Yes... I think so.
Yuna:Shall we listen to what it has to say?
Paine:...Even though it's a monster.
"Mog:Planesgorgers aren't like humans or animals, kupo. They don't move on their own will."
"Papalymo:They are an independent existence, even more primitive than organisms who hunt for food."
Papalymo:They are akin to an object that falls when you throw it.
"Mog:That's right, kupo! I'd like you to think about them that way."
Maria:They don't know good or bad...
Paine:You let down your guard.
Warrior of Light:Are there traps here? Is this the Emperor's doing!?
Paine:And if it is? Will you drop what's precious to you and let it break?
Firion:...I don't want it to break. I want to protect it!
"Papalymo:Those are the eyes of determination. I will gladly lend you my strength, Firion."
Maria:As will I. I refuse to lose anything else precious to me!
Yuna:That's right. Everyone feels the same!
"Yuna:We will protect our memories, and our worlds, too!"
"Paine:Say it, Yuna."
Yuna:Wh-what!? Um... How many people are there?
"Yuna:F, M, Y, P... There's not enough time for everyone!"
"Paine:Then let's just say: everyone, in position!"
Yuna:It's showtime!
Yuna:Mission accomplished!
Yuna:...Or not?
Maria:There are no signs of Pandaemonium's collapse... Does this mean we've failed?
"Mog:Kupo... It's a little different than that, I'm afraid!"
"Mog:This castle is steadily growing toward every dimension, kupo!"
"Mog:It's become something like a planesgorger! It's worse than I thought, kupo!"
Maria:Does it need the Emperor to grow?
Firion:He said before that he would conquer every world using this one as a base.
"Firion:...I suppose this is his base, then."
Yuri:Are the possibilities of the world changing...? I get a bad feeling about this place.
"Chelinka:It's not your imagination, Yuri. Order is being distorted here."
Chelinka:It's like that day we got separated fromfatherintown.
Yuri:So this has nothing to do with our power... It's the castle that's rewriting the possibilities?
Chelinka:Probably... I think it's connecting this world to all other dimensions.
"Mog:If we don't hurry up and stop it, this castle is going to become a hole that links all the worlds, kupo!"
Yuri:There's no time to waste. Firion!
Firion:Let's go. We'll stop it!
Maria:...Do you think you can keep your composure?
Paine:You'll be fine even if you don't.
"Yuna:Depending on who we're up against, you might be able to let it all out!"
Chelinka:Right. Let your will be known!
Yuri:We'll help you fight!
"Maria:...Thank you, everyone. I'm counting on you."
The Emperor:Hmph... So the worms have squirmed all the way into my castle.
Paine:Who's this guy?
"Yuna:The Emperor. Even still, I just can't respect him."
Firion:He's the one responsible for destroying my home...
"Celes:He's a man who craves dominion over all, including other worlds."
Celes:His greed knows no bounds.
Maria:What do you intend to do after you've invaded the other worlds?
Maria:Will you try and control them with monsters and servants as you did with us?
The Emperor:And if I do?
The Emperor:I have no need for those who refuse to submit to my rule.
The Emperor:The lives of the insubordinate have no value to me. They are worthless and deserve to be crushed like the worms they are.
Firion:Do you know just how many lives will be lost to that logic of yours!?
The Emperor:What use have I for such sentiment?
???:Hmph... What's wrong with sentiment?
???:You have nothing to protect. No one will willingly obey the commands of someone whose only power is to take lives.
???:Sentiment has the power to save lives
???:Though it's not something I'd expect you to understand!
Leon:He's nothing more than a monster. I doubt we'll ever reach an agreement with him.
"The Emperor:I have nothing to say to traitors, and you are no different."
Leon:You may be right. Perhaps I am a traitor...
"Leon:But as such, I will fight you with all I have!"
Celes:Allow me to join you.
Celes:Our enemy is the very incarnation of greed. I cannot allow this to continue.
Paine:And you?
Maria:I refuse to be governed by someone who doesn't listen to his people!
"Firion:I will fight, too."
Firion:Even if my sword is filled with burning rage!
"The Emperor:It is time to rid my castle of you pests... In the end, that man proved to be very useful."
The Emperor:Consider it an honor to be crushed by my hand!
The Emperor:I haven't time to set new traps...
"The Emperor:Instead, I shall reduce everything to ash! Then I will rule all!"
"Firion:You don't care about people's feelings at all, do you!?"
The Emperor:Feelings are nothing more than filth nesting inside of worms.
"Leon:Even so, these worms will destroy the very foundation of your rule!"
The Emperor:Urgh... What is this...?
Tidus:What's happening to the dimensional distortion!?
The Emperor:I see... So this was his true aim...
The Emperor:It is as I thought. I need no other subordinates than my pawns to fulfill my goals.
The Emperor:I shall build another castle.
Firion:Wait! We're not done here!
Yuna:Stop! It's no good pursuing him.
"Ramza:Yuna's right. We need to get out of here now, or else we'll be crushed in this castle!"
Leon:We must get out of here now!
Firion:That distortion...
Leon:...Do you not trust me?
"Firion:No, I trust you. Come on, everyone!"
Ramza:We're...outside the castle. In the city.
Tidus:It looks like we made it out safely!
Firion:Pandaemonium was destroyed...
"Yuna:Was this his aim, I wonder..."
Tidus:I wouldn't put it past Seymour.
"Ramza:They worked together for their own purposes. The Emperor with his traps and Seymour, his cunning..."
Yuna:The Emperor said that Seymour was his subordinate... I wonder if that was true.
"Firion:In any case, had we stayed in that castle, we would have been swallowed by the dimensional storm..."
Firion:If Leon hadn't rescued us...
"Yuna:Where did he go? Mog, do you know?"
"Mog:...He's fine. But it seems like he wants to be left alone for now, kupo."
Firion:Your situation is no different.
"Firion:Before you got your memories back, you bragged about remembering everything up until the end of your journey, didn't you?"
Tidus:Trying to explain it now is...complicated.
"Prishe:Everyone has their own circumstances. There must be a lot going on inside of you, too."
Tidus:But I'm here.
Prishe:Oh! Then that's enough. Let's go back to the airship!
Yuna:We defeated the planesgorger and got the brilliance!
Yuna:We'll start our search for more brilliance once the airship lands!
"Mog:It seems like neither the Emperor nor Seymour are here, kupo."
"Mog:Pandaemonium also stopped growing and this area seems to have stabilized, kupo!"
Firion:The castle ruins... the scars still remain...
"Tifa:Are you okay, Firion?"
Firion:I couldn't suppress my hatred for the Emperor...
Firion:I should have known nothing good would come if I wielded my sword with those emotions in my heart...
Firion:...I lost my composure.
Tifa:But isn't he the one who destroyed your home? ...I think it's impossible not to hate him for what he's done.
Cecil:I think everyone understands how you feel.
Cecil:I myself donned the name of a paladin and fought my enemies with hatred.
"Cecil:Though I claimed to fight for justice, I could not say that negative emotions did not exist within me."
Yuna:Pain and hatred... They're part of your emotions.
Yuna:The worst thing you can do is suppress them.
"Zack:You shouldn't lie about your feelings. But you shouldn't be held captive by them, either."
Zack:Look at them from a distance. It'll help you see what's really important.
Firion:I...see. I can't keep looking down.
Paine:We're leaving.
"Firion:You're driving, Paine?"
"Yuna:Well, she did mention wanting to fly an airship back home."
Paine:We don't have time for chitchat. Get on.
"Yuna:Over here, Paine! We'll get on right away!"
Paine:Who's the captain around here?
Yuna:Umm... Everyone?
Paine:What a weird world.
Yuna:But that's fine with me!
Yuna:Fly safely now!
"Mog:Some people misunderstand, but Materia and Spiritus are both very important gods to this world, kupo."
Yuna:Do they hate each other?
"Mog:Yes. But it wasn't always like that, kupo."
"Mog:Now they both claim that this is their world and won't make any compromises, kupo."
"Lightning:But if they manipulated our memories to make us fight, they'll pay for it."
"Mog:Materia can be...insensitive sometimes, kupo."
"Mog:She governs matter, but doesn't know how to deal with people's emotions, kupo."
Yuna:That certainly sounds...insensitive.
"Lightning:And it was that Materia's idea of ""respite"" that we were thrown into..."
Mog:She's an important entity to this world. But Mog is...kupo.
"Mog:I don't want to make you push yourselves or fight anymore, kupo."
"Mog:If you can't accept their decisions, you should say something to them, kupo."
"Yuna:I feel like they may not want to hear us out, though."
Lightning:There's also a chance they don't understand the meaning of our questions.
"Mog:Spiritus governs the mind, so he's quite keen on emotions, kupo. I don't recommend talking to him directly."
Yuna:Do you think he'll try to win us over?
"Mog:If that's all, that would be fine, kupo. He might say he only chooses strong warriors... But there's really no telling what he'll do."
Lightning:My head hurts...!
Yuna:I'll try to think of a nice way to lodge my complaints.
Noel:I was the only person left in the world. I was all alone.
"Noel:But I went on a journey of hope, believing I could change the future."
Noel:Then the goddess of my world gave me a chance.
Noel:A chance to go back in time and change the future.
???:Noel Kreiss... You pitiful little boy...
???:All that awaited you was tragedy.
Noel:I heard that I could find Serah in this world.
"Noel:I thought I could protect her for sure this time, but..."
???:The goddess Materia has abandoned you.
???:You will wander the desert forever.
"Noel:If you hadn't been here, I might have given up this time."
???:You possess a strong heart. I am just a voice to keep you company.
Noel:You really won't show me what you look like?
???:My visage is truly abominable. You will certainly become my enemy...
Noel:But you're kind. We wouldn't be enemies.
???:...That is my destiny.
???:More importantly...
Noel:Wh-what is this...!? A town!?
???:An empty city... No doubt the doings of that broken buffoon.
Noel:Am I...still alone?
???:It does not matter if you stop walking. You need not become that irresponsible goddess's puppet.
"Noel:You might be right, but...I want to go a little further."
"Noel:She asked me to help her, so...I believe her."
Noel:I'm sure I'll meet her.
Noel:Even in this empty world.
"Noel:And then this time, for sure..."
"Mog:Is there really something here, kupo?"
"Terra:You don't sense anything, Mog?"
"Locke:That doesn't sound good, now does it?"
"Noct:Huh? Well... If you guys think something's up, I guess there must be."
Setzer:I have nothing but bad memories of this town.
"Setzer:The goddess said that this world was meant to be a respite for us, and yet..."
Terra:There's no respite for my heart here.
Alisaie:Meaning this place might be yet another summoned by the enemy.
"Mog:Kupo... You might be right. But, but...!"
Mog:I can't sense any brilliance or larvae around!
"Lilisette:How weird... That doesn't usually happen, does it?"
"Mog:I don't know, kupo... Maybe something's wrong with my pompom?"
Locke:What do you think?
"Setzer:This may be a dangerous gamble, but we can't just leave it like this."
"Terra:Please, Mog, let us pass through here."
"Locke:We might just find some treasure, too!"
"Alisaie:If you believe it worth the risk, I shall follow. This is an unknown world, after all."
"Setzer:Hey, Prince. If you've got something to say, now's the time."
Noct:I've got nothing. I'll leave it up to you guys.
"Noct:...Wait. ""Prince""? I don't remember telling you guys that."
"Setzer:Haha! I thought you were just some spoiled kid, but it turns out you really are a prince."
"Setzer:We're not on vacation, so stop staring. There's no one to babysit you here."
"Noct:What? I'm not staring! ...I'll leave if I'm in the way, though."
"Mog:Don't go, kupo! We've got strength in numbers!"
Mog:It doesn't matter if you're highborn or a high roller! We can all work together!
"Locke:Just call him what he is: a gambler. Anyway, I'm with you, Mog."
Terra:Yes! I agree!
Locke:There's no need to be so anxious. It's hard to keep our eyes on the prize if we're all worked up like this.
Alisaie:Let's take a moment to calm ourselves before moving forward.
"Setzer:Yet another noble, I suspect..."
Setzer:My apologies. I had no intention of prying.
Noct:Don't worry about it. Let's just find some good treasure and get out of here.
Setzer:Good grief... Yet another treasure hunter added to our ranks.
Paine:...What a lively bunch.
Paine:Who're you!?
Noel:Are you human...? A real human!?
Celes:Identify yourself!
"Serah:Are you okay, Celes? You sound like a soldier..."
"Celes:Apologies... I mean, I'm sorry. It happens unintentionally sometimes."
"Locke:What did you find, Paine?"
"Paine:Not what, but who."
Noel:Serah... What a relief.
Serah:Noel!? Is that really you!?
"Mog:A friend of yours, kupo? I couldn't sense him at all!"
Noel:I'm here... Finally...
"Celes:Call a healer, stat!"
"Paine:...She's from the military, isn't she?"
"Locke:She's really straining herself here, though I doubt she's noticed it quite yet..."
Serah:Noel... What happened to you...?
Eiko:You should be alright now! You were really exhausted.
Noel:Thanks. Um... Are you all warriors of Materia?
Locke:That's right. Everyone here is on the same team.
"Celes:You're a friend of Serah, right? Have you met Materia?"
"Noel:I met her a long time ago. After that, I was wandering this huge world..."
Mog:Kupo? You mean Materia didn't show you the way to us?
"Noel:She opened up a portal, but it led to an empty desert."
Noel:I've been alone since then. I've been searching for you guys for ages.
Serah:How long is that?
"Noel:I don't know. It could have been days, months... No, years even."
"Locke:From the looks of it, you seem like a formidable swordsman. Would Materia really let someone so strong just lose their way like that?"
"Mog:That really is strange, kupo! You have a really strong will!"
"Mog:Wills are drawn to each other, kupo."
"Mog:Even if you get lost for a little while, you should have been able to meet up with us or Spiritus's warriors in no time, kupo!"
"Celes:If that's the way this world works, then...why was he lost for so long?"
Eiko:Were you lonely? It must have been tough out there...
Noel:It's no big deal. I'm used to it.
Eiko:Used to being alone? You're just like me.
Serah:Not quite.
"Noel:Yes. I was the last survivor. In my time, the entire world was destroyed."
Celes:So you were theonly onein adesolate world...
Noel:It's fine. I went on a journey with Serah in order to change that future.
Locke:Is it alright for you to come with us?
Noel:Of course. I'm a great hunter. There's no prey I can't catch.
"Locke:Perfect. Let's move out, then!"
"Serah:Are you alright, Noel?"
Noel:I'm fine...
"Noel:What about you, Serah?"
Serah:I'm doing just fine.
"Serah:My sister, Snow, Hope, and the others are here, too."
Noel:Sounds like fun. You get to fight beside them now.
Serah:Noel... He's pushing himself. I wonder what happened while he was lost...
"Lightning:So you were abused by this world's goddess, too... How unfortunate."
Noel:Is Materia really so careless?
Cyan:She has regrettably little understanding of human emotions.
"Edgar:Even so, I think she went a bit too far with Noel."
"Bartz:Yeah. When I regained consciousness, I was already here, but I met up with the group right after."
Lightning:Were you really alone the whole time?
Noel:Well...I didn't meet any living human beings.
Cyan:It must have taken great mental fortitude to last so long without anyone around.
"Noel:I heard a voice, though. It spoke to me."
Onion Knight:A voice? Are you sure it wasn't a hallucination?
"Noel:If it were, I think I would have broken long ago."
Lightning:I know you. You don't look broken.
Lightning:Someone was there with you. They must have hidden their presence and talked to you.
Bartz:So someone was there! What did you talk about?
"Noel:All kinds of things. This world. Trivial things, too..."
Noel:And... The future that awaits me in this place...
???:Even so...you will continue walking?
"Noel:Yes. As long as I don't give up, there's still hope."
???:A lonely child... You're just like me: destined for destruction.
"Noel:Are you alone, too?"
???:Yes. As I've always been.
???:It is my nature to be forgotten.
"???:From long, long ago...it's been my fate to be alone."
"Noel:But it's different in this world, isn't it? Can't you talk to me face-to-face?"
???:I am a symbol of terror and hatred... People fear me...
"???:If you looked at me, you would fear me, too."
Noel:It doesn't matter what you look like. I know you're a nice person.
???:Haha... You're very kind.
"???:I cannot show myself to you, but I can still talk to you."
???:Now let me hear your story...
"Noel:Well, my journey and its end..."
Bartz:It sounds like you had a friendly companion. But why didn't they want to show you what they looked like?
Onion Knight:Isn't that suspicious? Are you supposed to be grateful for that?
Noel:I don't know. I don't know what the voice wanted or why it chose me.
"Cyan:Nevertheless, simple words can become one's hope."
"Cyan:For Sir Noel, that voice may have been the only reason he made it through the desert."
"Lightning:I won't deny whatever ""hope"" you have, but remember this--"
"Lightning:In this world, there are warriors of Materia and warriors of Spiritus."
Onion Knight:Many of Spiritus's warriors are our enemies.
"Edgar:What they mean to say is that if someone is not your ally, then you should think of them as your enemy here."
"Noel:...I see. It would be great if they were our ally, though."
"Cyan:Perhaps thou were too harsh... He is still just a boy, is he not?"
Lightning:He may be mistaking this woman's voice for his mother...
Onion Knight:It's best he prepare for the worst.
Onion Knight:I don't recall any of our allies talking to him before he joined us.
Edgar:Indeed. The voice belongs to someone unknown. We should be on our guard.
"Zack:Hey, Noel!"
Zell:We heard you know how to hunt! Teach us!
Lightning:He's usually very cheerful. I think they'll get along just fine.
Noct:I wonder if I could make a call...
Noct:Then again...I'd have nothing to say. I don't even know how to get back...
Noel:Is this a bad time?
Noct:Not at all.
"Noct:Are you taking a break, too? Why don't we sit there?"
"Noel:Actually, I wanted to go hunting. But I couldn't find any big prey here in town..."
Noel:Or is it just that this world doesn't have anything to hunt?
"Noct:No, we've even hunted behemoth before."
Noel:Behemoth!? Can you eat those!?
Noct:You eat them in your world?
"Noel:In my time, people did. But it might be different for Serah and the others."
"Noel:The monsters didn't look very edible there, though."
"Noct:Yeah, I guess there weren't many of those."
"Noel:You dress like Lightning and the others, so I thought you might be from their time."
"Noel:Sorry if I was wrong. Are you a hunter, too?"
"Noct:Yeah. It's a part-time-- Well, a way to make money."
Noct:And a way to gather ingredients for dinner.
Noel:Same here.
Noct:But I specialize in hunting.
"Noel:When I said adamantoise was delicious, Serah looked so surprised. So I think I understand."
Noct:You managed to catch one of those turtles? Impressive.
"Noel:Have you ever tried it? If not, let's snag one here."
Noel:Yeah. Let's give it a try next time.
"Noel:Your name is Noctis, right? I think you can do it."
Noct:Alright. If you're sure.
Noct:What was your name again?
Noel:Noel. Noel Kreiss. I guess I forgot to introduce myself...
"Noct:I probably just never asked. I won't forget it, though."
Noct:And...you can call me Noct.
"Noct:Our group is pretty big, but...they're all good people. There are some you'd get along with for sure."
Noel:I have no doubt about it!
"Noel:Well, let's get going, Noct! The others are waiting!"
Dark Manikin (Edgar):Am I...the only one...conscious...?
Dark Manikin (Edgar):Someone... The warriors from the World of Light...
Sabin:A dark manikin of Edgar? What happened!?
Dark Manikin (Edgar):...Thank goodness. Please...gather the others.
Sabin:They'll be here soon!
Noel:...He looks like he'll disappear any second now.
Locke:What happened? Who did this to you!?
Dark Manikin (Edgar):It was...Kefka.
Warrior of Light:Kefka...? Just what is he planning?
Dark Manikin (Edgar):There's something I need to tell you... But not now.
Dark Manikin (Edgar):There's something planted in us...
Sabin:What's happening to our manikins from the World of Darkness?
Noel:It's no good. They're not themselves anymore...
Locke:What!? You mean they're being controlled!?
Noel:I'm not sure. I can see something black...
Warrior of Light:...There's darkness inside of them.
Dark Manikin (Edgar):There's a dark impulse...overflowing from inside.
"Dark Manikin (Edgar):Warriors from the World of Light. Please, stop us. No matter what it takes."
Locke:But you've still got control of yourself!
Sabin:He's right! You're still my brother--
Sabin:Smart and calm and considerate of everyone...
Dark Manikin (Edgar):It is out of consideration for others that I ask you to destroy us now.
Warrior of Light:...We have no choice but to grant his wish.
"Noel:I agree. And if we're lucky, they'll come to their senses soon enough."
Dark Manikin (Edgar):There's no need to take pity on us.
"Dark Manikin (Edgar):Please, destroy this abominable feeling...!"
Sabin:Big brother...!
"Dark Manikin (Edgar):Please, stop us before it's too late."
Sabin:Ngh...! It looks like we have no choice!
"Edgar:Yes, it certainly seems that way. Focus, Sabin!"
"Sabin:...You got it, big brother!"
Dark Manikin (Edgar):The remnants of the Blackened Will...are out of control!
Celes:Look! The dark manikins' bodies are...!
Edgar:What happened? Do you have time to explain?
"Dark Manikin (Edgar):...Yes, but not much..."
"Dark Manikin (Edgar):Listen, warriors of the World of Light..."
Dark Manikin (Edgar):We were captured by Kefka and put into a medium meant to create something...
Dark Manikin (Edgar):He called it the Blackened Will.
Terra:The Blackened Will... Isn't thatwhat possessed Mog before?
"Mog:Kupo!? But the Blackened Will takes time to be born, kupo!"
"Dark Manikin (Edgar):...Indeed. In order for any of us to become its incubator, a certain aptitude was necessary."
Dark Manikin (Edgar):But we weren't suitable... We couldn't propagate the Blackened Will.
Dark Manikin (Edgar):But... Celes and Terra from the World of Darkness...
Locke:Their dark manikins are still prisoners!?
"Dark Manikin (Edgar):Yes. They were implanted with the Blackened Will, and it continues to absorb their magic."
"Dark Manikin (Edgar):In time, they will give birth to evil..."
Celes:So Kefka's trying to create that monster with his inhumane experiments...
"Locke:My dark manikin isn't here, either. Was he defeated?"
Dark Manikin (Edgar):No... He stayed to protect them.
"Dark Manikin (Edgar):Even without emotions, we can't seem to forget our desire to protect others..."
"Edgar:Come now, it's not like us to give up so easily! Hang in there!"
"Dark Manikin (Edgar):Ever since I was captured, my leadership's gotten rusty..."
Dark Manikin (Edgar):I have no choice but to leave this to you. Please forgive me...
Edgar:...There is nothing to forgive.
Terra:It looks like Kefka was connected to this town after all...
"Mog:Then there's a good reason there's no brilliance here, kupo..."
"Mog:If Kefka is incubating a Blackened Will, it takes an enormous amount of energy, kupo."
Celes:So he took the brilliance to use as material?
Edgar:Unforgiveable. He's violating the existence of others!
Locke:Where is Kefka? Can you locate him?
"Mog:I'm afraid I can't sense him right now, kupo..."
"Mog:But if he needs the brilliance here, I can't imagine he's too far, kupo."
Celes:I think I have an idea. We need to find him before something terrible happens...!
"Hope:It sounds like a lot happened to you, Noel. But your memories aren't too different from ours."
"Noel:I was surprised to see you so small, Hope."
Rydia:So you met him after he grew up. I see...
"Yang:We were surprised to see Rydia grown up, too. Though the situation is different, I understand your feeling."
"Snow:It's your first time seeing me like this, right?"
"Noel:You haven't changed much, Snow. You're as reckless as ever."
"Snow:Don't get so upset. Geez, you may be younger than me, but you can nag with the best of them."
Yang:We know Snow to be someone always doing his best in a battle. Was he the same in your world?
Noel:Yes. He really made Serah worry.
"Rydia:You journeyed across time, right? What was it like?"
Noel:...I wonder if it was selfish of me to want to change the future.
"Squall:Most people live for that purpose, even without traveling through time."
"Snow:Whoa, Squall! I never knew you could be so passionate!"
Squall:(I should've kept my mouth shut...)
"Noel:But because of that, Serah and Lightning..."
Snow:Did something happen to them? I thought they were as lively as ever!
"Hope:This isn't like you, Noel. Usually you're more cheerful."
Rydia:Maybe it's just hard to talk to people...
"Noel:No, no. I'm really happy to be around so many people."
Noel:...I'm just not used to it.
Snow:You were wandering alone for a long time. It makes sense that you're tired.
Squall:(A journey across time... Past... Future...)
Squall:(...They don't stir up good memories in me.)
"Snow:He's actually a really good kid, though, so please be good friends."
"Noel:Ugh, quit acting like you're my big brother!"
Yang:It's good to see people regain their sense of self when spending time with old friends.
Rydia:Indeed! Let's talk again sometime!
Noel:Of course. Anytime.
"Hope:Take your time, Noel. You're always pushing yourself too hard."
Squall:(Good advice. But just how old is Hope again...?)
Noel:Is Kefka your enemy?
"Celes:Yes... It's hard to express it in a word, but he's like a plague upon our world."
"Noel:What did he want? If he destroys the world, he has no place to go."
"Kain:As far as I have seen in this world, he has lost all rational thought."
"Kain:Even among Spiritus's warriors, eh's the only one who desires destruction for destruction's sake."
Noel:Do you have any clue where he might be?
"Locke:In our world, there was acitythat looked like this one. It was the capital of theempire, the place that gave birth to Kefka."
Locke:He's got ties to both the castle and the research lab. I'd like to look for those first.
Vaan:Doesn't he usually just show up around this point?
Celes:What do you mean?
"Vaan:When we're in a tight spot, he usually comes to make it worse."
"Kain:You have a point. That clown normally appears for no reason to provoke us, then vanishes."
Cyan:The fact that he hasn't shown himself this time must mean...
Celes:He hasn't the time. He's got his hands full with something else.
"Locke:If what the dark manikins said was true, then Celes and Terra from the World of Darkness are...!"
Kain:Calm down. Rushing in is what he wants.
Kain:Could you tell us anything more concrete about where he may be?
Noel:This is a big town. I can't tell which building is the castle.
"Celes:It's a place Kefka has a connection to, and..."
Edge:Hey! We found something strange!
Locke:What is it? And where?
"Rydia:A tower that reaches high into the sky! The top was hidden in the clouds, so we couldn't see it, but it looked huge."
Kain:A tower...
Edge:We don't have any good memories of towers. How about your world?
"Celes:A tower... No, something in the sky...!"
"Cyan:Something that floats... Yes, I have an idea."
Celes:I can imagine Kefka using that as a base.
Locke:It's worth climbing. Let's go!
"Noel:...By the way, is Kefka a man?"
Vaan:Yes. Why do you ask?
"Noel:I see. I thought he might be the voice that spoke to me, that's all."
Kefka:More! More! There's still not enough magic!
"Kefka:After all the trouble I went through to sow those planesgorger seeds, this is the thanks I get!?"
Kefka:Put some effort into it! I want to see my little Blackened Will as soon as possible!
Ultimecia:Your voice tests my patience...
"Kefka:Nobody invited you, witch! Leave us alone! Can't you see we're busy?"
"Kefka:No, no! Where do you think you're going? My little bundle of joy isn't ready to be born yet!"
Ultimecia:Abominable buffoon...
Kefka:Concentrate all your dark magic and fill it to the brim! That will give the Blackened Will shape!
Ultimecia:To make that artificially is...
Dark Manikin (Locke):Someone's coming...!
Ultimecia:A clear will in a puppet from the World of Darkness...?
Dark Manikin (Locke):I need to protect them... I'll protect everyone...
"Ultimecia:Fascinating that emotional people normally become such inorganic dolls, and yet..."
Ultimecia:You're different. You've been abandoned.
Dark Manikin (Locke):You're not Kefka...
Dark Manikin (Locke):Who are you? An ally...?
Ultimecia:I am neither friend nor enemy now. Has the power already been squeezed from you?
Dark Manikin (Locke):Do you know my friends Terra and Celes...?
"Ultimecia:They are still alive, if you can call something that merely drifts ""alive."""
Ultimecia:Leave this place. I will open the path for you.
Dark Manikin (Locke):No! I can't just leave them here!
Ultimecia:I see... You wish to protect them. Then I will tell you where to find them.
Ultimecia:Run straight ahead. There you shall meet your end.
Ultimecia:...Or bring the clown to his.
Ultimecia:Foolish puppet knight...
Ultimecia:There is no place in this world for that sense of duty and what you should protect.
"Kefka:Well, well, well! What do we have here? Still alive?"
"Dark Manikin (Locke):Let my friends go, Kefka!"
Kefka:Hehehe! Let them go!?
"Kefka:Who's the clown around here!? I can't release them, not when they're sooo full of dark magic!"
Kefka:What horrible fate awaits this world now? I'm almost too scared to find out!
"Dark Manikin (Celes):No, Locke... Get away from us...!"
Kefka:Did you know it's futile to grow a will inside of a puppet?
Kefka:But it won't go to waste! I'll suck them all up and feed them to the planesgorgers!
"Noel:Who are you? You're not a friend of Mog's, are you...?"
???:Indeed. This is our first time meeting like this...poor child lost at the ends of time.
Noel:That voice! You're the one who talked to me while I was lost!
"???:You cannot get close to me, for you see..."
Noel:You know her?
Squall:What did you say to him?
Layle:I feel like this is about to get complicated...
Noel:So your name is Ultimecia.
Squall:Don't let her confuse you. She's the enemy.
Serah:We have to listen to the others about their worlds. We've fought heronce before.
Layle:She used an unknowing boy as a sacrificial pawn. It was a very dirty trick.
Locke:Why did you throw Seifer away and decide to use Noel instead?
"Ultimecia:He was the same as me, a lonely child on the edge of the future..."
Squall:Don't listen to her.
Ultimecia:I won't tell you to lower your sword.
"Ultimecia:You, too, cannot escape your fate. You have a destiny to defeat me."
Squall:Enough excuses.
Ultimecia:I was born as an evil sorceress. I cannot change the future.
"Layle:Calm down. If you don't want to fight, step back."
Locke:I believe Squall. This woman is suspicious no matter which way you slice it.
"Serah:I'll fight, too."
Serah:I can't forgive you for saying such cruel things even after knowing what Noel's been through!
Noel:Serah! I'm sorry...
"Locke:Think about it, here and now: who should you be protecting?"
Noel:Count me in...!
Ultimecia:Hehe... No matter.
Ultimecia:Those who live in the future and destroy the future... Their destinies are bound to be different.
Squall:What were you planning to do with Noel!?
Ultimecia:Hahaha... You think me a villain? Very well.
Noel:What do you mean!?
Seifer:Enough talk!
"Seifer:If you don't know what to do, just stay out of my way!"
"Ultimecia:For now, this is fine... As long as you feel the weight of destiny..."
"Ultimecia:You there... You're from the same world as that jester, are you not?"
Celes:You mean Kefka?
Ultimecia:I saw him atop that tower with your puppet and a man trying to defend it.
Locke:My dark manikin?
"Ultimecia:Yes. He was on the brink of death. I tried to help him escape, but he desired to save his friends and did not heed me."
"Ultimecia:He had emotion...or perhaps a will that grew inside of him. In any case, he may still be alive."
"Ultimecia:If you seek words worthy of believing, then you had best find him."
Squall:Trying to confuse us again... What is it that you want?
Ultimecia:I wish to resist my solitary future and destiny.
Ultimecia:But... Now is not the time for my destiny.
Locke:She got away... I don't understand what her aim is.
"Celes:Destiny...and future... They're words with deep meanings, but they sounded so empty when she said them."
"Zidane:Hey, Squall. We've got some new friends who might need an explanation."
Squall:About Ultimecia...
Noel:I want to know.
Noel:Why did she try to trick me?
"Y'shtola:Talking may not be your strong suit, and yet I would urge you to tell us all you can."
Y'shtola:I wish not to harbor doubts about our new companion.
Celes:It's possible that people think Ultimecia made you her spy.
Squall:Ultimecia is a sorceress full of anger and hate. She tried to erase everything but herself.
"Squall:The past...the future, too... She wants a world where only she exists."
Noel:Did she travel through time?
Squall:No. But...she interfered with it in a way that's possible in our world.
Squall:She snuck into the gaps in people's hearts and made them do her bidding.
Squall:She even fooled people into thinking they were happy being controlled...
Noel:And she wanted to make that me in this world...
"Locke:I'm glad it didn't turn out that way, though. You're our friend now, Noel."
"Noel:I know. But when she said she was alone...that was a lie, right?"
Squall:I don't know what she really meant.
Celes:We've only ever faced her as an enemy thus far.
"Noel:And if you're not allies, you're enemies in this world..."
"Zidane:That's not the case with everyone, though... You had better think about it long and hard, Noel."
"Y'shtola:When you consider that some people are here to destroy the world or humankind, the choice should be an easy one."
Noel:...I'll keep that in mind.
Squall:(He still hasn't accepted it yet...)
Squall:(It makes sense... If you're told someone you trusted is suddenly your enemy...)
"Seifer:Hey, nitwit."
Noel:You mean me?
Seifer:Is there anyone else here?
"Raijin:We wanted to see how you're doing, ya know."
"Seifer:No! We knew he'd be down in the dumps, so we came all this way to check on him."
Squall:(How is that different?)
Seifer:That sorceress... She's a force to be reckoned with. She even managed to fool me.
"Raijin:She lied and said she'd make Seifer her knight, then tossed him aside, ya know?"
Fujin:LIES. UNTRUSTWORTHY.
Seifer:The fact that you fell for it means you're still a simple kid.
"Squall:(You're one to talk, Seifer.)"
"Raijin:Ultimecia only thinks about herself, y'know?"
"Raijin:It's unfortunate, but we want you to come to a clean decision, ya know."
Noel:Maybe. Are you worried about me?
"Seifer:In any case, we need to stop dragging our feet and climb that tower!"
Locke:Did Seifer come by to give him some clumsy encouragement...?
Squall:(Locke... You must be in a hurry.)
"Locke:Hey, Noel. Come with me."
Noel:Are we in a rush?
"Locke:No, no. Just taking a small break. Don't tell Edgar, though."
"Locke:You come, too, Squall. You look like you could use a break."
"Locke:Hm... Let's invite Noctis, too."
Noel:H-hey! Wait!
Squall:What is he planning...?
"Squall:(How can he be the same as always? Even though they're dark manikins, they're still his friends who're in trouble...)"
Noel:Sorry. I know we're in a hurry...
Locke:Don't worry about it. I'm sorry if you feel rushed. Treasure hunters should be free.
Locke:I'm sure you understand if you're really a hunter.
Noel:I hunted for food. Things like treasure didn't exist anymore.
"Noel:In my time, things like monster horns and ancient beads were considered treasure."
Noel:But any friends or family I wanted to give them to had long since passed.
Noel:Even people I really wanted to protect...
"Noel:I studied the sword so I could save them, but in the end...it was useless."
Locke:You really think so? Lightning told me Serah said you're very reliable.
Noel:Serah was my partner.
"Noel:But here she has Snow and Lightning, her family..."
"Locke:Do you think you're alone, even in this world?"
Noel:...I'm not used to being around so many people.
"Noel:Ever since I was born, I've been able to count the number of people in my village."
Noel:I wanted to journey with optimism... But it hurts a lot more than I expected when things get tough.
Locke:We are a pretty big party now... Can't be easy on Squall either.
Squall:Don't bring me into this.
Squall:(But he's right when he says there's something troubling me. But saying it out loud doesn't help...)
Locke:...The friends I've made here remind me of my friends back home.
Noel:You mean like Terra and Edgar?
Locke:From kings to former imperial soldiers... We had all kinds of allies from all walks of life.
Locke:We all had different reasons for fighting. I don't know if I fully understood them even at the end.
"Noel:Even still, you fought as one?"
"Locke:Of course. We're all adults, and we all have a past."
Locke:It's good to surround yourself with all kinds. It doesn't matter if your reasons for fighting aren't the same.
Locke:I think it's important to treasure your bonds with friends and family while you're young.
"Locke:Even if their way of thinking is different, you can still stand by each other's sides and fight."
Noct:...I get what you're saying.
"Locke:You, too. You might be uneasy not knowing many people here, but..."
Locke:Don't hesitate to rely on us. We've done our growing up.
Locke:Now we'll share the burden with you younger guys.
"Noct:It's really not that serious, but...thanks."
Locke:You're a lot better off than when I was a kid!
"Noct:...I am twenty, you know."
"Locke:Whoa, my bad! Well, our ages aside, we should work together...as friends trying to find their way."
"Locke:If there's ever anything you need, let me know. I'll protect my friends with my life!"
Noel:Thank you. I feel like I'm ready now.
Locke:Then let's get going! Before anyone finds out we're gone!
Zidane:So Locke is a treasure hunter and Noel is a monster hunter.
Zidane:Yuffie is a self-proclaimed materia hunter... We've got all kinds of hunters.
Noel:What's that?
"Zidane:It's an event where the more you hunt, the more points you get. Vivi and Freya participated, too. It was a lot of fun!"
Noct:Sounds awesome.
"Steiner:Is it true that you only ate monster meat, Sir Noel?"
"Noel:Yeah. The ground was infertile, so you couldn't grow anything."
Noel:There weren't any vegetables.
"Noel:Even if there were, you couldn't cultivate them. The techniques were long gone."
Zidane:That sounds like a harsh future to live in...
Steiner:What a cruel life...! I'd be happy to share some of my pickles with you.
Prishe:Maybe it's better not to start him off with those pickles...
Noct:So you mean there were no veggies at all?
Noel:Absolutely none. Even grass withered.
Prishe:What's up with you? Do you hate vegetables?
Noct:What!? I don't remember telling you that!
"Steiner:Even if you didn't, it's clear on your face."
Noct:It's not like I hate them...
"Noct:No. I do hate them, but..."
Zidane:This is painful to watch. Vegetables are good for your health.
"Noct:Yeah, so I heard... And somehow they found their way into the food I'd always eat."
Steiner:Ahaha! You had an excellent chef!
"Prishe:Even without him around, you shouldn't be so picky."
"Zidane:He looks upset. Don't tease him so much, Prishe."
"Noel:I heard that you like meat, but I didn't know you hated vegetables."
Noct:I definitely prefer my meals without them.
Prishe:Those two seem to get along great.
Zidane:I don't get it. They seem like complete opposites.
Prishe:People's hearts are a funny thing. I'm just happy that they can be friends!
Edgar:It looks like it was worth slacking off.
Noct:They found us out.
Edgar:I like knowing how my comrades are faring.
Shadow:...It was needless work.
Edgar:Don't say that. I was worried.
Firion:Is everyone here? We found an escape door on the tower!
Firion:But there's some kind of machine blocking the way.
Rydia:Could it be...the tower's...
Edgar:Befitting of Kefka.
Edgar:I wouldn't put it past him to take things from other worlds just to shake us.
Edgar:Because our will is our strength in this world.
Cecil:How despicable... Putting an obstacle we've already overcome before us.
Firion:He's trying to make you doubt Golbez and crush your will...
Rydia:But we won't be shaken! We believe in Golbez!
Firion:We saw it with our own eyes.
Edgar:Are you ready for the hunt?
Noel:Yeah. I'll show you what I can do.
Noct:You call this a hunt?
"Noel:Are you gonna join or not, Noct?"
Noct:Of course I am.
Cecil:Our wills stand firm. Let's go!
Cecil:The defense system should have a weakness.
Cecil:Each machine has a complementary mechanism!
Noel:Got it! I'm used to hunting prey that work together.
Cecil:And together we shall overcome!
Terra:This place... I knew it!
Vivi:Do you know where we are?
Shadow:This is theFloating Continent. It was Kefka's base inour world.
Setzer:Perhaps Terra and Celes's dark manikins are being held here somewhere...
Vivi:...I think dark manikins have hearts and lives.
Vivi:I can't help but wonder what their dark manikins are feeling now...
Vivi:Aren't they being turned into tools to destroy the world?
Shadow:If you believe what the enemy says.
"Setzer:The less I want to believe it, the more likely it's true."
Setzer:I imagine even an underworld assassin feels the same.
"Shadow:If what is common sense in my world is true here, then yes..."
Setzer:Blast it... I'd feel a lot better if he'd just attack us directly.
Terra:Isn't there a way to search for their presence?
Yuna:Hmm... We usually depend on Mog for these things.
Yuna:But it seems like friends from the same world can somehow find each other.
"Vivi:Are you okay, miss? Aren't you afraid to go forward?"
Setzer:It was hard enough seeing ourselves... It may be better if Terra and Celes don't see what's up ahead.
"Setzer:Kept in a nursery, treated no different from plants..."
Terra:...I appreciate your concern.
Terra:I would be lying if I said I wasn't scared...
"Terra:But if my dark manikin thinks the same way I do, she would never want to be a tool of destruction..."
Terra:That's why...I want to go ahead. I need to stop Kefka.
Vivi:We'll be beside you.
"Vivi:If you're scared, please rely on us."
"Yuna:Yeah, we'll all go with you!"
Kefka:Hehehe! The time is near!
Kefka:Look! Brilliance!
"Kefka:It's alive! My experiment was a success! Happy birthday, Willy!"
"Kefka:And you, my broken containers, are now useless!"
Kefka:I'm going to raise you until you're strong enough to destroy this whooole dimension!
"Kefka:Attention, everyone!"
Terra:This presence...!
"Ultima Weapon:""I am power both ancient and unrivaled..."""
"Ultima Weapon:""I do not bleed, for I am but strength given form..."""
Noct:It's talking...
Noel:But it looks edible.
Noct:It'd be a pain to pick out all those bones and horns though...
Cyan:It looks like thy true power comes out once thou hast relaxed.
Locke:But this is not an enemy to take lightly.
"Noel:But the bigger the prey, the more fired up you get, right?"
Noct:You bet.
Cyan:How promising.
"Terra:I suppose Kefka summoned this one, too."
"Locke:Along with the Floating Continent. If that's the case, then he's a powerful foe..."
Noel:Perfect. Let's do this!
Noct:We'll split the spoils.
"Locke:With treasure, the early bird gets the worm!"
"Ultima Weapon:""Feeble creatures of flesh... Your time is nigh!"""
Noel:We'll show you who's feeble!
Noct:You got that right.
Locke:We'll show you what we're made of!
Locke:But it was supposed to be in the deepest part of our home world...
Celes:I can feel Kefka's will. He doesn't want us to get inside.
Terra:We haven't a moment to waste! We need to defeat this monster and find Kefka!
"Mog:Kupo!? Look over there, kupo!"
Warrior of Light:Shinryu's larvae... A planesgorger's carcass?
Locke:Did Kefka...defeat it?
"Mog:I don't know. This is the first time I've seen one like this, kupo."
"Mog:It's been stripped of its power to eat dimensions, kupo!"
Garnet:Maybe it's like what happened with Kuja. Perhaps he fought and weakened it?
"Mog:It's more accurate to say there's nothing left in it, kupo."
Warrior of Light:After being used as a medium to summon this place...
Warrior of Light:He removed the planesgorging part of it...
Noel:It's just an empty husk now.
Terra:So Kefka now possesses the power to consume dimensions...
Locke:I can't believe he sacrificed even a planesgorger to get more power...
Noel:So what do planesgorgers do?
"Locke:Eat dimensions. Or, put simply: destroy the world and the future."
Warrior of Light:And not just this world. Even our home worlds are in danger.
"Noel:So it'll become a wasteland where nobody can live, like this world?"
Terra:Yes. Which is why we need to stop him.
Garnet:Look! The body...!
"Mog:Seeing that shell of energy become empty and disappear is a bad sign, kupo."
"Terra:We need to find Kefka, quickly!"
Noel:What the... Everyone's collapsed.
Locke:Get her away. This isn't something for a child to see.
Celes:This is like...in war...
"Mog:The brilliance... All of its power's been absorbed, kupo."
Noel:I'll go look for survivors.
"Noel:If there are any, I want to find them for sure."
"Celes:Yes... We'll split up and look, too."
"Krile:I'll help. It's sad, but I'll be okay."
"Locke:It's our own feelings that are the problem... If you're going, take Galuf and the others with you."
Krile:Got it!
Dark Manikin (Locke):...? Is someone there...?
Noel:I found one! It's Locke!
Locke:Hey! Hold on!
Dark Manikin (Locke):I'm sorry... I couldn't protect them...
Noel:Does he still have Celes and Terra from the World of Darkness?
"Dark Manikin (Locke):Yes. Up ahead, he's still...performing his horrible experiment to birth the Blackened Will..."
Celes:...You tried to protect us. Even getting this hurt...
Dark Manikin (Locke):He took the brilliance with him.
Dark Manikin (Locke):I was so obsessed with my promise to protect...
Noel:Obsessed with...a promise...
Dark Manikin (Locke):I should have given my power to you...warriors from the World of Light...
Locke:You idiot! That's enough!
"Locke:I'll take those feelings with me, along with the strength of your will."
Locke:I won't waste either.
Dark Manikin (Locke):...Thank you...
"Celes:The dark manikins keep saying that you don't have any feelings, and yet..."
"Krile:They've inherited strong emotions, just like the real deal."
Noel:Locke feels the same about protecting others.
Noel:...Though he pretended to be carefree in front of me.
"Celes:Oh really? If Locke says he's going to protect someone, I know he will."
"Celes:It wasn't easy, but..."
Locke:You weren't someone to just be protected.
Noel:Sorry. Did you hear that?
Locke:Of course I did. You're loud.
"Locke:Like my dark manikin, I know the pain of being unable to protect someone."
"Locke:You know it, too. That's why you feel like we're getting nowhere fast."
Noel:Bull's-eye. It's so frustrating...
Noel:Do you think we can make it to Celes and Terra?
Locke:We won't know until we try. We may be able to save them yet.
"Celes:That's right... And I will fight, no matter what."
Celes:Because I know who is evil...
Lightning:Look! It's those two!
Dark Manikin (Terra):Blackened...Will... We are... Nursery...
Terra:Hold on!
Dark Manikin (Celes):Don't come...closer...
Edgar:Stand back. They don't look normal.
Celes:But they can still talk!
"Lightning:It doesn't look like we'll have any meaningful conversations, though."
Dark Manikin (Celes):The Blackened Will...devoured...our bodies...
Dark Manikin (Celes):It's all...gone... All...stolen...
Dark Manikin (Celes):The Blackened Will...ate...everything...
Terra:No... That's not how Celes speaks...
Celes:Something... Something is inside of her...
Dark Manikin (Terra):You...don't know...
Dark Manikin (Terra):The disgusting will...crushed us...
Dark Manikin (Celes):Life... Dreams... Hope... All will vanish...
Dark Manikin (Terra):Anything... Everything... All became nothing...
Lightning:You don't have to listen to them. It won't make you feel any better.
Terra:No. I must face them. Their pain won't end otherwise.
Dark Manikin (Terra):It's gone... Everything we loved...
Dark Manikin (Celes):It was taken... It all vanished...
Dark Manikin (Celes):Vanished... Dis...appeared... Gone... All gone...
Dark Manikin (Celes):What vanished? We...don't know...anymore...
Edgar:My heart is trembling... I can't...
Dark Manikin (Terra):...We are...vessels.
Dark Manikin (Terra):At the bottom...of our hearts... Hidden...will... Brilliance... Shoved in...
Dark Manikin (Terra):We felt it...for a long...long time. It was painful...
Dark Manikin (Terra):And then it was born. It fed...on our wills...
Celes:You mean the Blackened Will has already been born!?
Dark Manikin (Celes):We could not stop it... Sorry...
"Dark Manikin (Celes):Sorry... Sorry, sorry..."
Dark Manikin (Terra):The vessel is broken... We do not need to exist... Sorry...
Edgar:Enough! You've suffered enough!
Dark Manikin (Terra):Destruction...
Dark Manikin (Celes):Destroy... We must destroy everything... Everyone...
Celes:...We won't be destroyed.
Celes:We will live on your behalf!
"Terra:I will defeat Kefka, the monster who destroyed your hearts!"
"Terra:Everyone, with me!"
Lightning:Of course.
"Edgar:It is painful, but...they have an impulse for destruction..."
Celes:We'll take the pain away...!
Dark Manikin (Celes):No one...can ease our pain...!
Dark Manikin (Celes):Ahhh...! This...power...!
"Celes:We need to stop them quickly, or there won't be a shard of consciousness left."
"Locke:If we're fast enough, there may yet be a heart to save!"
Edgar:Then let us hurry. I can't stand to see their suffering any longer.
Dark Manikin (Terra):Thank you...everyone...
Dark Manikin (Celes):Please forgive us... We were...powerless...
"Celes:No, you weren't powerless..."
"Terra:Even though your hearts were in pain, you entrusted us with your feelings..."
"Onion Knight:Terra... It must be tough, but you're holding up well."
"Celes:Kefka was subjected to experiments to inject people with magic in our home world, too."
Celes:Maybe he was trying to get revenge by unconsciously reproducing that here...
Locke:Stop thinking before you start projecting...
"Locke:...You're hurt, Celes. Take care of yourself first."
"Onion Knight:He's right. You, too, Terra. You should rest, if you can."
"Onion Knight:It worries us, seeing you like this."
Terra:...You're very kind.
Cloud:So victims from the experiment create yet more victims...
"Vincent:to inject one life into another... Guess I have to see that nightmare here, too..."
Noel:You two are also worried?
"Cloud:Hearing the word ""experiment"" brings back memories."
Vincent:Indeed... It's not something we can turn a blind eye to.
Vincent:Unless it was something that they desired and accepted. Otherwise...
Noel:I understand one thing: I want to defeat Kefka no matter what.
"Cloud:But if the Blackened Will has been born, we'll be in for a tough fight."
Noel:What kind of enemy is it?
Vincent:One that corrodes dimensions.
Cloud:It was originally a parasitic part of Shinryu.
Noel:Shinryu... You mean the enemy that eats dimensions and destroys worlds?
Cloud:Yes. And the Blackened Will we faced swelled up by absorbing the power of others.
Cloud:I can only imagine one born with Kefka's patronage to be even worse.
Noel:It sounds like we just have to bring it down. For the sake of everyone's future.
"Cloud:Right. Once they recover, we need to go after Kefka."
"Noel:Can you move? If it's too much, then..."
"Celes:We'll be fine. We're not alone, after all."
"Locke:Once they say they're going, they won't listen to anything else."
"Locke:We've just agreed that if they don't feel good, we'll protect them."
Noel:I see... And you agree?
Terra:Yes. I can't be resting here while Kefka is still running rampant.
"Onion Knight:Even if you've been through a lot, you're as stubborn as always, Terra."
"Cloud:If you're ready, let's get moving."
Locke:Right. I want to settle this once and for all.
"Kefka:Oh, baby, have I outdone myself this time!"
Kefka:This little guy is different from those plain gorgers. Dimensions it munches on'll be the energy it uses to get to other worlds!
"Kefka:It's waaay better than that sorry, moogle-sucking excuse for a parasite!"
Kefka:...Don't you think?
Locke:I don't have words for you anymore. We came here to defeat you!
Kefka:Have a cigar! A birth is a joyous occasion! And it's all thanks to those wonderful magitek mamas!
"Kefka:Even as empty dolls, they were still able to give birth to something this magnifico!"
Kefka:Because I stuffed those hollow noggins of theirs with the darkest of dark emotions!
Noel:This guy is just the worst of all worlds.
Celes:He has nothing but thoughts of destruction in his head. You don't need to sympathize with him.
Noct:You don't need to tell me twice.
Noel:I get it. I know which side I stand on.
Kefka:What's this? Were you thinking to bully my bouncing baby Blackened Wilbur?
Kefka:Well sucks to be you! I also had my own little buff-fest this time!
"Kefka:I went ahead and stuffed all the brilliance, magic, will, et cetera I gathered for my little bundle of joy into myself, too!"
Noel:Watch out!
Noct:Are you okay?
"Noel:I may have been too rash, but look...!"
"Kefka:You worms are always, always, always getting in my way..."
Locke:Dammit! He's not messing around anymore!
Kefka:I'll have them crush you until not even a speck of dust remains!
Locke:Are you guys ready?
Noct:I can go anytime! I won't let him have his way.
Noel:Same. I won't forgive anyone who tries to take the future away from others.
Locke:Perfect. I won't stand by and let this clown go free. Let's get him!
Kefka:You never learn...
Kefka:Just what do you gain by clinging to life?
Noel:You'll always have a future as long as you don't give up.
Noel:I won't let this world be destroyed by you!
Locke:We waver no longer!
"Kefka:Ow, ow, ow! It hurts! My stomach hurts!"
"Kefka:Hehehe! You made me laugh so hard, my sides are splitting!"
Kefka:Did you think Willy was going to wait around while you were busy hitting me?
Locke:The air is shaking...!?
Noel:The Blackened Will is moving!
Alisaie:How despicable... I can't move. Is this the end?
Kefka:And now a little bug is about to snuggle under this continent's rug!
"Kefka:Which means so long, and thanks for all the laughs! Kefka out!"
"Mog:Kupo! If we don't stop it, the Blackened Will will go on a rampage!"
"Alisaie:If what he said is true, then it has unlimited energy to run rampant!"
Warrior of Light:Is there no way to detect it?
"Mog:No, kupo! The entire world is jumbled! It's like being in a storm, kupo!"
"Mog:There's no way I can trace its movements with just my pompom, kupo!"
Locke:So we have no way of finding it. This world is in danger!
"Mog:In any case, let's evacuate to the airship, kupo! This place might be corroded at any minute!"
Noel:Grab on! We're getting out of here!
Locke:We can't stay here long!
Setzer:I'm here!
"Setzer:Quickly, get on, everyone!"
Warrior of Light:I can't believe it... This world we tried so hard to protect is going to be consumed by that beast!
"Locke:No, it won't. We're going to stop it! But we have to survive this first!"
"Noel:Yeah. If we lose our lives here, we won't have a chance to retaliate!"
Noel:We won't give up!
Warrior of Light:But where...
Warrior of Light:Where did it go!?
Locke:Hey! I know you know what's going on here!
"Materia:Yes... After being born anew, the Blackened Will fled..."
Edgar:Finding out where it's gone is proving a difficult task.
"Edgar:The corrosion is starting here in your world, is it not?"
"Materia:That is true. I have tried to find its whereabouts, but..."
Materia:...It seems to be somewhere in the World of Illusions.
Chelinka:Do you know anything else?
Yuri:I thought you gods had the power to write new possibilities... Can't you do anything about it?
Materia:The World of Illusions belongs to the summons. It's a place with an ambiguous connection to ours.
Locke:Can't you open it by force?
Materia:Searching their world on my own is no easy feat. It will take time.
"Spiritus:You asked the wrong god, pathetic warriors."
Edgar:Spiritus... What brings you here to Materia's chambers?
"Edgar:Seeing as you're the very one who summoned Kefka, I assumed you had no interest in this world."
Spiritus:I sought only those with power to protect my world.
Yuri:So you really didn't expect someone would destroy that very world...
Spiritus:I will take the blame in place of that powerless goddess.
Spiritus:Now go!
Locke:Can we find Kefka through there?
Spiritus:I detect the urge to destroy within... This will certainly put you in the right direction.
Materia:Wait. Simply pointing my warriors toward the enemy is not enough...
Materia:Let me guide you...!
Materia:I've fine-tuned the portal with dimensional coordinates. Now you will definitely find Kefka.
Edgar:These gods have done nothing but fight up until this very moment... And now we have no choice but to put our faith in them.
"Locke:Right... Well, let's get moving. Kefka's waiting!"
Kefka:Hehehe... You vermin sure sniffed me out!
Onion Knight:Vermin? Look who's talking.
Lenna:We were supposed to have come out in the World of Illusions... But this place is filled with evil will...
Lenna:It's like we're inside a Torsion.
Kefka:So glad you noticed! It's a custom make.
Kefka:My darling Wilbur snacked on bits and pieces of the world and made its very own nest!
Warrior of Light:We must destroy this world before it's too late. I can feel the darkness swelling up...
Kefka:Bingo! It was nurtured by yours truly!
Kefka:It's chock-full of destructive energy and ready to burst any minute now!
Celes:We won't let you! You won't hurt anyone again!
Kefka:I'd like to see you try! This place is evil will given form.
Kefka:You won't stand a chance in here! You'll be squashed like the vermin you are!
"Onion Knight:If he thinks he can just watch us from the sidelines, he's got another think coming."
Onion Knight:But we need to destroy the Blackened Will first.
"Warrior of Light:No matter how perilous the road, we will traverse it!"
Celes:Yes. We'll pluck all the weeds from this world!
"Mog:I don't feel so good, kupo..."
Lenna:Are you okay? Is something wrong?
"Mog:I think it's because I was possessed by the Blackened Will before, kupo..."
"Mog:It's a weird request, kupo, but... Please don't listen to me until the Blackened Will is destroyed."
Onion Knight:You think it might still be controlling you?
"Mog:Kupo... I don't want to be a bother, kupo."
"Celes:Everyone believes in you, Mog. We're not going to start doubting you now."
Lenna:But he really looks bad... He needs to rest.
Warrior of Light:Searching for the Blackened Will will be harder than ever without Mog...
Warrior of Light:We should make sure we're duly prepared for the road ahead.
"Kefka:Well, well! The fighting energy here sure is intense!"
Tidus:Hey! There he is!
Cloud:Looks like he's out of luck.
Edgar:Not even death would be enough punishment for his deeds. Perhaps we could imprison him between dimensions.
Laguna:Nice thinking! You're gonna pay for all you've put us through!
Kefka:Hehehe. All I've put you through has generated the energy I wanted!
"Kefka:And I took, thankyouverymucho!"
Zidane:Do you think this guy is using our battle energy to feed the Blackened Will!?
Kefka:I also nibble on some of it to keep my super-ultra-maximum buff-fest rolling!
Kefka:Which makes you soggy paper straws before my drink bar of ruin!
Kefka:The one who's out of luck is YOUSE!
Edgar:Don't expect your petty insults to suddenly get a rise out of us.
Edgar:We're prepared to fight.
"Edgar:No matter how strong you've become, we shall defeat you!"
"Kefka:Ooh, what a riveting speech. I'm shaking in my boots."
"Kefka:Well then, let's leave everything else behind and drink to ruin! Bottoms up!"
Terra:We've got you now!
"Kefka:You maroons are always, always, always, always, ALWAYS getting in my way..."
"Kefka:This world has no future, and yet you persist... How stupid can you get?"
"Kefka:Well, let me teach you pinheads a lesson: it all ends here!"
"Locke:This is the final battle! Let's finish this, Kefka!"
"Kefka:No no no no no, cut it out! STOP IT! Please, with a cherry on top."
"Terra:Mog, now!"
Kefka:GYAAAH!
Shantotto:Ohoho! How unsightly!
Shantotto:A perfect prison to hold that clown tightly.
Noel:What is it?
Shantotto:A Torsion we styled to hold him for a while.
"Terra:If we left Kefka to his own devices, something like this might happen again..."
Noel:Is that even possible?
"Mog:With this, he won't be able to do as he wants, kupo!"
"Mog:No matter what way you look at it, this was too much. If this happens again, there won't be enough worlds, kupo!"
"Mog:We'll give him some time to reflect, kupo."
"Locke:How long is ""some"" time? Why not forever?"
"Mog:I thought about that, too, kupo... But Spiritus stopped me."
Mog:He reminded me that it was a world ruled by two gods... And that Kefka is here because he's powerful.
Locke:Does that mean he needs Kefka!?
Lightning:...I've got a message for them.
Lightning:We're not living for the gods.
"Lightning:If they're trying to tame us, they should know we won't go lying down."
Lightning:Tell that to Spiritus and Materia.
"Locke:And don't forget to add this: ""Don't underestimate humans."""
"Locke:Next time, we'll tell it straight to their faces."
"Mog:You got it, kupo!"
"Mog:This time I'm also steamed at them, kupo!"
Noel:What's going to happen to this place?
"Mog:With the Blackened Will gone, the corrupted worlds will try to fix themselves, kupo."
"Mog:So we can relax for now, kupo."
"Terra:Hmm... The world is still unstable, though."
"Terra:But still, I'm relieved. Thank you, everyone."
Spiritus:They narrowly managed to seal away the planesgorger created by Kefka...
"Spiritus:The brilliance it stole, however, has vanished into the space-time continuum."
"Spiritus:There are many types of warriors, even among the strong. I wonder if you can see them for what they truly are..."
???:I have more pressing matters that I must attend to.
Spiritus:That dream has ended... It is time you remembered that.
???:...And so?
???:You revived a man with a shattered dream. Just who are you?
Spiritus:A god.
???:I find that hard to believe... You do not exist in our visions.
Spiritus:A paradise where one can coexist with the gods... That is the order of your world.
"Spiritus:You possess a strong will, and in this world, will determines all."
"Spiritus:With it, you can even reshape the very world to your liking..."
???:What is your goal?
Spiritus:If you must know: your respite.
Kam'lanaut:My respite? Just what would an otherworldly god understand of my plight?
Spiritus:Only that your hatred and indignation of being unable to achieve your dream despite your position...
Spiritus:Will become your greatest strength in this world.
Spiritus:I need the strength of your will to preserve my world.
Kam'lanaut:I see. In exchange for drawing out the power of my will...
Kam'lanaut:I am allowed to do whatever it is I please in this world.
Spiritus:You may see it that way if you wish.
Spiritus:You can even build your beloved Paradise here.
Kam'lanaut:Hmph. I am the will of the crystals.
Kam'lanaut:First I shall see this world for myself.
Spiritus:Show me what you're capable of.
"???:There's something you don't trust about him, isn't there?"
???:That's why you summoned me.
Spiritus:You are also free to do as you wish in this world.
"???:Well, I was imprisoned in that rift. Is this now what you call freedom?"
???:...No matter. I'll find some way to amuse myself.
???:I think I can do a little better than those foolish races strung on by the gods.
"Terra:We succeeded insealing Kefka away, but..."
Papalymo:The dark manikins and the brilliance they held are gone.
Yda:Does that mean the memories you lost are gone forever...?
"Mog:I don't know what to say, kupo..."
"Relm:Cheer up, guys!"
"Relm:I remember everything about you, Terra. Isn't that enough?"
"Terra:Don't worry about us, Relm. The memories I want to protect haven't changed."
Terra:And even if I lose those...I can still make new ones.
"Papalymo:At this point, we can be neither optimistic nor pessimistic. But simply standing still helps no one."
Papalymo:The peculiarities of the dark manikins are even more complicated than they themselves said.
"Y'shtola:Indeed. After all, they were created."
"Y'shtola:So unlike us, they are not restricted to only one body. Everything is brilliance."
Y'shtola:Which means the memories you lost were not necessarily in their possession.
"Terra:I don't know whether or not they had our memories, but they think like us..."
Yda:I wonder if my manikin remembers things even I don't...
Alphinaud:Locke's dark manikin was driven by his duty to protect.
Alphinaud:If his memories resided there...
"Alphinaud:And his conduct was a result of him coming to terms with a will similar to his original's, then..."
Y'shtola:You seem rather intrigued by something.
Alphinaud:I am just trying to get some perspective. Although...I can't tell you anything at present.
Alphinaud:Even if the words of another bring back your memories Whoa!
Setzer:We've encountered turbulence!
"Setzer:The rudder... No, the gauge is going wild!"
Yda:Can't you do anything!?
Setzer:Hold on tight! It's going to be a bumpy ride!
Y'shtola:This is not the fault of the currents...
Lion:It looks like everyone's okay.
Thancred:Although Locke's and Yuffie's eyes are rolling around from the turbulence.
Papalymo:The air is trembling...
Yda:Does that mean this area was summoned from our world?
"Mog:Kupo? I don't get that feeling, kupo..."
Thancred:Do you think it's your pom-pom acting up again?
"Mog:I can't say for sure, kupo..."
"Lion:The atmosphere reminds me of home, too..."
"Papalymo:No matter the case, it isn't the real thing."
Papalymo:But we cannot relax...even if that may be the intention of the gods here.
Y'shtola:Can you sense any planesgorgers?
"Mog:My pom-pom's as broken as the ship's gauge, kupo..."
"Mog:But I think not sensing anything means something's up, kupo."
Papalymo:Someone may be interfering. We should investigate.
Yda:Then what are we waiting for?
Yda:We might meet someone's dark manikin and get some info!
Alphinaud:A dark manikin in a similar area to our home world...
Alphinaud:We must proceed with caution.
"Caius:While you may be a puppet, you have some form of will..."
Caius:The brilliance you hold is in truth the lost memories of your original form.
"Dark Manikin (Lyse):These memories are hers, as is this will..."
Dark Manikin (Lyse):I must get them to her. She needs to remember!
Caius:Is that truly what you wish to do?
Dark Manikin (Lyse):What do you mean?
"Caius:The will, the determination you have..."
Caius:The very memories that drive you... Will she not despair upon getting them back?
Dark Manikin (Lyse):What could you possibly understand? Get out of my way.
Caius:It is true. I hail from another world. It may be difficult for me to comprehend...
"Caius:But the pain of loss is one that affects all worlds, is it not?"
"Dark Manikin (Lyse):You might be right. She may be happier without these memories, but...!"
Dark Manikin (Lyse):But without her determination...she would no longer be herself.
"Caius:And what about you? You are but an imitation, a puppet."
Dark Manikin (Lyse):What are you trying to say!?
Caius:This world was created to be a place of respite...
Caius:The goddess Materia purposely deprived them of their sad memories to give them the rest they deserved.
"Caius:Though a false happiness it may be, such is permitted in this world."
Caius:Would you steal that respite from her?
Dark Manikin (Lyse):There is no such thing as respite here!
Dark Manikin (Lyse):Everyone here needs to regain their memories and their will to stand and fight.
"Caius:Though your emotions may be a farce, if your memories are real, then you can act human..."
Dark Manikin (Lyse):Leave me alone. I must get these memories to her!
Caius:The one you need to fight is not me.
"Caius:This world is your... No. This world is connected to your original's, is it not?"
Caius:Now then... Just what kind of beast was the Shinryu there?
"Caius:It is ""your"" duty to protect the world, isn't it? Which is more important?"
Dark Manikin (Lyse):I... I must do something...
Dark Manikin (Lyse):I'll go. I must!
Caius:A puppet without will...
Caius:Sadness should be the burden of a hollow puppet.
Caius:Because even determination borne of loss...will invite naught but tragedy.
???:Summoning humans from other worlds and altering their memories to suit your purposes...
???:Or feeding them excess information to fan the flames of war between them...
???:...The gods can be so selfish.
Bartz:Huh? I thought I saw someone just now.
"Lion:Me, too."
"Krile:Wait up! What are you doing, running off like that!?"
Bartz:I thought I saw a kid over here.
"Alisaie:But it could have been an enemy, could it not? Running off alone is dangerous."
"Thancred:If it were really a child, it couldn't have been an enemy. They might be someone's friend or family."
Alisaie:This place looks like our world. Things are not always what they appear.
Thancred:You mean we need to be on our guard even with kids?
Prishe:What did the child look like? Could you see anything?
Lion:Not really...
Bartz:I think it was a little boy with golden hair. He was dressed nicely.
"Prishe:That's not much to go on... Have I seen someone like that... No, it couldn't be..."
Lion:...It might be them. That's why I wanted to see his face.
Alisaie:Is he from your world?
Lion:I can't say for sure without seeing his face. I don't want to risk confusing everyone...
"Thancred:He walked off, didn't he? If we go now, we may be able to catch up."
"Krile:If he's really a kid, then we can't let him wander around alone..."
Thancred:No objections here. It's easier to search when we have an objective.
"Alisaie:Indeed. Whether he be enemy or ally, any information is valuable."
Bartz:Then let's go after him!
Lion:He went that way. But...I wonder if it's okay...
"Prishe:Don't worry so much. Whatever happens, everyone here's with us."
Lion:You're right. But we should be careful.
"Thancred:It would be nice if it would stay simple, but..."
Alisaie:This isn't the first time things have gotten complicated.
Bartz:Alright! Let's go!
Maria:Oh no! Are you okay!?
"Fang:Hey, are you alright? I'll go call for help!"
Maria:Please hold on... Everything will be okay.
"Rem:I've given her first aid, though I don't know how well magic works on dark manikins..."
Dark Manikin (Lyse):Are you the warriors from the World of Light?
"Fang:Seems like it, at least. And who are you?"
Dark Manikin (Lyse):I can't yet say... There is something I have to do.
Maria:Wait! Please tell us what happened!
Dark Manikin (Lyse):I must do something...
Rem:We know that you have a duty to protect the World of Darkness.
Zidane:Our objective is the same. Let us help you.
Dark Manikin (Lyse):I can't... This is something I must do alone.
Zidane:H-hey! Wait!
Zidane:I got the feeling I've seen that kid before.
Fang:That so? We don't have any comrades who look like that.
Yda:It can't be...
Faris:Do you know her?
"Yda:She's...my little sister, Lyse."
Rem:You have a little sister!? I had no idea...
"Maria:That was her dark manikin. Perhaps the real Lyse has been summoned here, too."
Zidane:Does that mean her dark manikin appeared even before the original did?
"Zidane:In that case, it means Yda's sister is in this world somewhere."
Zidane:Should we go look for her?
Papalymo:......
"Papalymo:What do you want to do, Yda?"
Yda:...Let's go after her. I want to know for sure.
Yda:I need to know why she appeared here.
Faris:Sounds complicated.
"Faris:But if that's your little sister, then it's best you two talk."
"Faris:...Huh? Not all dark manikins can talk, can they?"
Fang:Something feels off. It feels like she was hiding something.
Yda:I know. But I can't say anything without my memories.
"Yda:Even if I speak now, it might turn out not to be true."
Papalymo:Indeed... I am in the same situation with my memories.
"Papalymo:We lost sight of that boy we saw earlier, and now we're chasing after Lyse."
"Fang:That's fine. If they're your family, it's best you talk."
Yda:Thank you. Let's go.
Alisaie:The dark manikin looked like Lyse...
"Alphinaud:Then she holds brilliance, that which houses our memories."
"Alphinaud:If she looks like that, though, it means her memories are..."
Serah:Do you two know something about Yda's sister?
"Alphinaud:Yes. She... On second thought, I don't know how much has been said already."
Kain:Quite an evasive answer.
"Serah:There are discrepancies in memory even among people from the same world, right?"
"Yuri:Is that why they called you ""Master"" and ""Lady"" when you first arrived?"
Alisaie:That is correct. Their memories are from a time earlier than ours.
Alphinaud:Several of those who came from our world...
Alphinaud:have lost a fair bit of their memories.
Serah:Is that because they're painful memories to Yda and the others?
Alisaie:Seen objectively...yes. You would not think them happy memories.
"Alphinaud:It seems like Yda, Y'shtola, and the others have been here since it was possible for it to be a place of respite."
"Serah:Yes. It was corroded by Torsions, but they were here since the World of Light was well."
"Alisaie:In which case, it is possible that Materia took their memories to make it a place of true respite."
"Alphinaud:However, by the time we were summoned, she needed warriors with strong wills."
Alphinaud:So she let us keep our memories of a time we had the determination to fight.
Warrior of Light:So a time is coming when they will have to face some painful memories?
Yuri:Are you worried?
"Warrior of Light:I know for certain that everyone possesses a stout heart, and the day of facing painful memories will come for all of us."
Warrior of Light:I believe that retrieving brilliance and our memories...is the right thing to do.
"Warrior of Light:However, it seems like the more we pursue light, the deeper we plunge into darkness."
Warrior of Light:Will there really be light at our journey's end?
"Yuri:Are you sure you're not overthinking it? Getting your memories back isn't the same as ""darkness""..."
Warrior of Light:But isn't it troubling to have to unravel your own memories?
"Alisaie:No matter how dark the path may be, standing still will get you nowhere."
Alisaie:Being forced to live in a world of false respite without your memories...
Alphinaud:Precisely. I cannot abide by this.
Alisaie:We are not the pawns of the gods. We are all citizens of the same world.
"Alphinaud:If we cannot choose our battlefield, then we should be given our memories to fight with our own wills."
"Alphinaud:I know that Y'shtola, Papalymo, Thancred, and even Yda would agree."
Kain:Even if the memories they have forgotten are bitter ones?
Alisaie:Did Cecil not say the same thing before?
"Kain:Yes... You are right. However painful your memories may be, one cannot pretend they did not happen."
"Alisaie:Determination and feelings, the words of those who encouraged you... I cannot agree that forgetting is better."
Serah:Aren't you worried that they'll be shocked?
Alisaie:It's better than not knowing.
"Alphinaud:If Lyse has appeared, that means the time has come."
"Alphinaud:I realize that you are worried for your friends, but..."
Alphinaud:We want to be their strength. That is what we can do as those who have retained their memories.
Kain:The ones that hold the key are puppets from the World of Darkness...
"Kain:It is best we see whether they are being controlled, their wills used against them."
Alisaie:...Yes. We must ensure that Lyse's frank and forthright personality is not being abused.
"Dark Manikin (Papalymo):I won't let you do as you please, looking down on us because we can't do anything..."
"Kam'lanaut:Humans are all inferior beings, so what can a lowly puppet do?"
Kam'lanaut:I am allowing you to choose your master.
"Kam'lanaut:If you cannot feel honor even in that, then you should understand your place."
"Dark Manikin (Papalymo):Even without emotions, we can still fight. That is why I'm here."
Kam'lanaut:Give up. There is nothing you can do.
Dark Manikin (Papalymo):There is. The memories in my heart tell me to fight back.
Kam'lanaut:Insolent fool!
Yda:Papalymo!
Yda:Papalymo! Papalymo's in danger!
Papalymo:Calm down. Do not panic.
"Shantotto:Oh my, what have we here? In grand clothing do you appear!"
Shantotto:In fine robes have you yourself furled for an outing to another world? Ohohoho!
Lion:Professor Shantotto! Just how far do you intend to...
"Shantotto:Worry not, my little friend, for I know what it is you wish to have said."
Shantotto:Seeing the archduke of Jeuno on the chase must mean he has much time to waste.
Kam'lanaut:Engaging in paltry nonsense is beneath my station.
Kam'lanaut:I merely needed to gather the necessary...tools.
Yda:I can't watch this any longer! I'm going to help!
"Papalymo:I told you to be calm, did I not?"
"Papalymo:That dark manikin has my form, and therefore a fragment of my power. He can overcome this."
Kam'lanaut:So this puppet controls more magic power than it should because of its original...
Yda:He's trapped!
"Kam'lanaut:With this, I can control the dragon that devours dimensions should it still be a larvae."
Lion:What do you plan to do to this place!? This is different than our own world!
Kam'lanaut:I can rewrite the laws of this world.
Dark Manikin (Papalymo):I won't let you get away with this. There is still something I can do...
Dark Manikin (Papalymo):Papalymo from the World of Light... It is up to you now.
Dark Manikin (Papalymo):Take care of Yda.
Yda:Wh-what!? Wait!
Papalymo:...I will.
Yda:Why did you say yes!? We could have saved him!
Yda:That dark manikin's brilliance might have had your memories in it!
"Papalymo:If he has memories, then his will... It means he has a plan."
"Papalymo:I don't quite know his exact intentions, but as his original, I have no doubt there is one."
"Yda:That may be true, but...if we don't do something..."
Lion:Let's see where they went. We know what Kam'lanaut is after.
"Shantotto:Indeed. Before he chose to disappear, he made his plan to control Shinryu's larvae very clear."
"Papalymo:Let us continue the search, if you don't mind."
"Yda:Yes, let's..."
Yda:Huh? Didn't we come through here before?
Galuf:Yes. It seems we've been going around in circles.
Lion:How strange. I thought for sure Papalymo could lead us out of here.
Shantotto:Ohoho! Does your sense of direction need some inspection?
"Papalymo:I'm doing my best, Professor Shantotto."
Shantotto:Allow me to make up for my rudeness with my shrewdness. It seems some false projections are at play to try and lead us astray.
"Yda:Perhaps I'm too stupid to understand, but...aren't we just lost?"
Lion:It seems like there's some magic or curse preventing us from going further.
"Galuf:""Too stupid""...?"
Galuf:Yda... Have you lost your confidence? Or maybe you're just uncertain?
Papalymo:There are some extenuating circumstances... It's no surprise that she's shaken.
Krile:Can we help?
"Papalymo:It's something we have to resolve on our own, I'm afraid. For now, please just watch over her."
"Papalymo:When the need for help arises, I will be sure to ask for your assistance."
Papalymo:Now I have a suggestion: why not split up and search for a way out?
"Papalymo:Even if I cannot dispel this magic, perhaps one of our otherworldly friends can."
Lion:Good point. I'll go tell the others.
"Papalymo:Let's try not to get too separated. Once we find any clues, we'll regroup immediately."
???:Are you lost?
Bartz:It's you!
Warrior of Light:It seems you are alone. Who are you?
Eald'narche:I am Eald'narche.
Eald'narche:My title won't be useful in this world.
"Galuf:If you tell us from where you came, perhaps we can find your friends."
Galuf:Warriors from all different worlds have been summoned here.
"Eald'narche:I was invited by the gods. They said the battle is spreading, no?"
Papalymo:Then you know what's happening.
Krile:Come with us. It must not be easy on your own.
Eald'narche:Me? With...you? I must decline.
Eald'narche:I must proceed with haste. The exit to this forest is just ahead.
Papalymo:How do you know that?
Eald'narche:The one who cast this spell must have deemed this enough.
Eald'narche:Isn't it best you hurry if you feel like you're being stalled?
Yda:He sure ran off quick... I can't tell if he's an enemy or ally.
Papalymo:Indeed... But what he said about the exit is true. The disturbance in the aether is weakening.
"Warrior of Light:In that case, we had best make our way out of here. Many curious figures have appeared here."
Galuf:It was just like that boy said. We made it out of the forest.
Onion Knight:Whoever wanted to stall us in those woods got what they wanted... Huh!?
Dark Manikin (Lyse):Sorry! Coming through!
Zidane:Wasn't that Yda's sister!?
Kam'lanaut:Why are you here? Have you forgotten who I am?
Kam'lanaut:That I said puppets are nothing more than toys to be manipulated by humans...
Dark Manikin (Lyse):I won't let you get away with this!
Kam'lanaut:Around me is a barrier only the chosen may enter. Puppets cannot enter.
Kam'lanaut:What are you looking at? Get back to work.
Kam'lanaut:I will summon true paradise here.
Dark Manikin (Lyse):Stop this!
Dark Manikin (Papalymo):We don't have the leisure of choices! We simply obey those with strong wills! But...
Yda:Oh no!
Papalymo:We must hurry!
Dark Manikin (Papalymo):But I can entrust it to them.
Dark Manikin (Papalymo):I believe in those from the World of Light...
Papalymo:...I see. These are the memories I lost.
Papalymo:I will take good care of them.
Kam'lanaut:Hmph... What a farce.
Kam'lanaut:I have been filled with Shinryu's power. I shall journey to a new world beyond space-time.
Kam'lanaut:But before that...I must exterminate those unworthy!
Dark Manikin (Lyse):I won't let you! I can't...!
Yda:That's my role.
Yda:I'll take care of it from here.
Kam'lanaut:I wish you would not interfere...
Papalymo:I will not back down...now that I have my will.
"Kam'lanaut:Hmph... Then I will strike you down here, and have you submit your will to me!"
Lion:Now give up! We'll stop you no matter how many times it takes!
Kam'lanaut:You have not stopped me yet. Look closer.
Kam'lanaut:This unshapely world has borne but an unshapely door...
Kam'lanaut:But the clumsy work of those bungling gods will become the cornerstone of a new world!
Papalymo:You mean you made a world no longer under the rule of Spiritus and Materia?
Papalymo:I cannot believe it. You did not seem to hold such power...
Kam'lanaut:I needed only take what I lacked.
Kam'lanaut:Those puppets who carried the powerful wills of their originals... They were more than they appeared.
Kam'lanaut:The gods are utterly moronic...
"Kam'lanaut:By giving the memories they stole to those puppets, they created slaves."
Yda:Y'shtola! Thancred!
"Lion:After wasting away our world, you now want to try and turn this one into your ""Paradise""?"
Lion:Your selfishness knows no bounds!
Kam'lanaut:Selfish? Just who loses in my plan?
Kam'lanaut:My world is a peaceful one... Eternal. Perfect. Paradise.
Kam'lanaut:That is exactly why I plant o build the world of respite that Materia and Spiritus failed to create.
Lion:Don't be fooled. His ideal is far from peaceful.
Firion:I'm not surprised. He forcefully stole the will of another. There's no way a world made from that could be paradise.
"Kam'lanaut:Of course, there is no way rabble like yourselves could enter my new world..."
Yda:But you're going to take those two manikins with you!?
"Yda:They might have brilliance, memories in them!"
"Papalymo:If you take them somewhere else, their originals may lose those memories forever."
Papalymo:Such a thing
"Dark Manikin (Lyse):Such a thing, I cannot forgive!"
Lion:Be reasonable!
Kam'lanaut:I tire of this...
Yda:We have to go after them!
Lion:Your sister's manikin was moved by a powerful will.
Firion:Even though she didn't stand a chance... It was like she was out of control.
Papalymo:The dark manikins have given their memories to us and have drawn out our will with it.
Papalymo:...Like my dark manikin did.
Yda:Papalymo... Just what did you...?
Papalymo:That is something you must reclaim for yourself.
Yda:I understand. Let's get to the other side of that door!
Aerith:Is this the world that Kam'lanaut made?
Zack:It doesn't seem that much different. Are you sure this is it?
Alphinaud:The atmosphere is unstable.
"Alisaie:It seems just as uncertain as those places summoned from other worlds, but..."
Alisaie:Is this really his wish for a new world?
Lion:All I know is that this talk of being full of the crystal's brilliance and co-existing with the gods...
"Lion:Is something he's been insisting is the true form of Vana'diel, our home world."
Aerith:So you don't know if it's true.
"Zack:So the same world emerged? Does this make any sense to you, Lilisette?"
"Lilisette:Huh? Uh, well... I don't have much to do with the archduke."
Lilisette:But I do know this world looks nothing like the one I know.
Alphinaud:I wonder if his plan has yet to be completed.
Alisaie:Indeed. He plans to use those dark manikins to nourish this world he's creating.
Lion:Their dream once fell apart.
Lion:I think he is trying to create a world like Vana'diel here closer to the vision that they knew.
Alisaie:Spiritus seems like just the type to permit that sort of selfishness.
"Zack:If we leave him to his own devices, Y'shtola and Thancred's memories will be swallowed up, won't they?"
Aerith:We can't let that happen.
Alphinaud:It may be that outsider Materia who decided they were better off without them.
"Alphinaud:But I will not accept that, and neither will their originals."
Aerith:You must be worried about Yda's sister.
Alisaie:That dark manikin was clearly out of control...and I think her memories are the cause.
Zack:Then let's go after them!
Alisaie:Indeed. I'll ask around and see if Mog or our comrades have any clues.
"Lilisette:I'll go, too! I might be able to help if there are traces of my home world around."
"Alphinaud:By the way, Lion..."
"Alphinaud:When you were talking about Kam'lanaut's plans, you said ""they."" Is there more than one person we should be worried about?"
"Lion:Back home, Kam'lanaut didn't do his scheming alone..."
Lion:There was someone more powerful at his back.
Aerith:Is that person here?
Lion:It's possible. I have a feeling I've seen someone who looks like him.
Alphinaud:We had best be prepared then.
"Prishe:Hey, Lion. Maybe it's a good idea to tell everyone about the archduke of Jeuno."
Prishe:Only a few of us know the whole story.
"Ashe:Yes, we would love to know what happened. He was a prominent figure, was he not?"
Lion:Kam'lanaut is the archduke of the Grand Duchy of Jeuno.
Lion:It's true he turned that place from a small fishing village into a prosperous city-state...
"Lion:But he thought himself ""chosen"" by the crystal, and tried to open the Gate of the Gods to a new world."
"Cecil:Chosen, huh... He said so himself a few times."
"Cecil:If he had the power to lead people, why didn't he use it for peace?"
Ashe:Maybe his pride at being chosen turned into arrogance...?
"Lion:Eventually, his plan was exposed and brave adventurers from our world defeated him."
"Yda:And now he's here, trying to make that evil plan come true."
Papalymo:Calling upon those who have unfinished business and letting their hatred be strength... This sounds like Spiritus's doing.
Ashe:But...aren't they trying to create a world without war and death?
"Prishe:Yes, but only for those allowed to enter."
Lion:But they think that humans are imperfect and therefore not worthy.
"Prishe:But it's because we're imperfect that makes us so great, right, Princess?"
Ashe:...Please don't ask me.
"Mog:Kupo! We picked up a hint, kupo!"
"Prishe:How's your pom-pom doing, Mog?"
"Mog:It still feels swirly, kupo... But!"
"Mog:It sensed the movement of a very strong will! I think it's the dark manikin, kupo!"
Papalymo:It's her.
"Mog:If we go after it, we'll catch Kam'lanaut in no time, kupo!"
Lion:This is our best chance to catch him. Let's go.
"Mog:This way, kupo!"
"Yda:Hey, Cecil..."
Yda:...Nevermind. I had better think it over myself.
Cecil:You haven't seemed yourself lately. Can we do anything to help?
Cecil:It's not unusual that you feel uncertain about siblings and memories.
Yda:I'm sorry to worry you...
"Yda:Back when you didn't have your memories...you weren't your real self, right?"
Yda:I feel like...I'm forgetting something very important. And...
Papalymo:(Why won't Yda talk to me about it?)
Cecil:My real self...
"Cecil:You're right. As a result, I showed everyone here a version of myself that wielded dark power."
Cecil:But retrieving my memories isn't the only reason I was able to get back my sacred light.
"Cecil:I believed in all my friends here. No matter what form I took, they accepted me as their ally."
"Cecil:The same goes for you, Yda."
Yda:Even me...?
"Cecil:Even without my light, they accepted me as I was."
"Cecil:Because we have that bond, my brother was able to give me back my memories of being a paladin."
"Yda:I see... No matter what, you're still you."
"Cecil:Yes, in the same way that you will be you with or without your memories."
Yda:I wonder...if everyone will think the same.
Yda:Thank you. I think I'll be okay...
Papalymo:(I see... So she chooses on her own...)
"Y'shtola:Have your lost memories returned, Papalymo?"
Papalymo:It seems so; however...
Papalymo:They seem to be...cut short. I cannot grasp the full picture.
Y'shtola:You seem perplexed. Perhaps more about that girl than yourself...
"Papalymo:Even with my memories, there are still things I do not know."
Yda:Hey... Do you guys have a moment?
Tidus:This is the first time I've seen your face. ...Isn't it the same as the dark manikin earlier!?
Zidane:I see... So that dark manikin was you without a mask.
"Yda?:You're not...totally correct, Zidane."
Yda?:My name is Lyse.
"Faris:What do you mean? You said Lyse was your younger sister's name, didn't you?"
"Yda?:I've been using my older sister's name, Yda, until now..."
"Warrior of Light:So your real name is Lyse, and that dark manikin..."
"Lyse:She's actually my dark manikin, the person you've known as Yda all along."
Warrior of Light:Was this also a secret to the others from your world?
"Y'shtola:No. We knew, even without our memories."
"Y'shtola:Thancred, Alphinaud, Alisaie... They all realized it."
"Papalymo:""Why?"" We were just waiting until you could say it."
Lyse:...I see.
"Faris:No matter the situation, you're still you."
Faris:It's fine as long as you're one of us. That won't change.
Zidane:Exactly! Everyone has a thing or two they don't talk about. We're happy you could tell us.
Faris:Being able to tell us even without your memories back takes guts.
Lyse:I'm...I'm still uncertain. But it's like he said...
"Lyse:""This is my story."""
"Lyse:I can't explain it very well, but...when I saw my dark manikin, that's all I could think."
Lyse:I don't understand the gods or respite or anything of those difficult things...
Lyse:I don't even know now if taking my older sister's mask is a good thing.
"Lyse:But...this world is my problem, too."
"Lyse:I know that, which is why...I wanted to tell you the truth."
Zidane:You're not alone.
Tidus:He's right! We're your friends.
Lyse:I have to get that dark manikin's brilliance.
"Lyse:But I can't do it by myself, so..."
"Lyse:Please, help me."
Warrior of Light:Of course. We want to help.
Y'shtola:You aren't the only one with lost memories.
Y'shtola:My manikin has been taken as well. I cannot overlook that.
"Lyse:Thank you, everyone."
Tidus:What happened to Lyse?
Papalymo:...It is not my place to say.
Papalymo:(I wonder if there is a turning point for Lyse in the future I do not know...)
Papalymo:(Or if the law of this world has changed her.)
"Papalymo:(If I tell them how perplexed I am, they would only worry.)"
Galuf:What's with the long face?
Papalymo:Is that how I look?
"Ace:You always look so composed, but now you look...uncertain."
Ace:Or maybe we're just seeing things...
Jecht:He remembered the things he forgot. And his manikin was used as a sacrifice...
Jecht:It'd be stranger if he weren't shocked.
"Papalymo:Yes, but...I was entrusted with these."
"Papalymo:What my manikin did, what I've done, and what will happen..."
Papalymo:All these emotions are...complicated. I think I'm just perplexed.
Galuf:Then take your time to digest everything. Wouldn't you agree that's best?
"Jecht:You just wanna be strong in front of your partner, right?"
Papalymo:Indeed... Do I sound ridiculous?
Ace:Not at all. I think it's very heartening.
Papalymo:My memories...are cut off from when I entrusted her to the others.
"Papalymo:And now I am the one who was entrusted with something, and must look back at my own actions."
"Galuf:If you have a partner you can entrust something to, then that means there is hope."
"Jecht:Even if you can't rely on them, they grow up before you know it."
"Ace:I can't remember everything that happened, like how your manikin did."
"Ace:Since we entered the World of Darkness, we've met and separated from many dark manikins..."
Ace:And I can remember it all clearly. This is the first time I've felt like this.
Jecht:Your world sounds like a tough one for sure...
Ace:But...that doesn't mean that the actions of our predecessors come to nothing.
Papalymo:My manikin did indeed light the path before me.
Papalymo:Now I can clearly see where it is I must go.
Dark Manikin (Lyse):Are you okay!?
Kam'lanaut:I see you won't give up...
"Kam'lanaut:As you can see, the power of their wills is now mine."
Kam'lanaut:We needn't suffer this needless violence if you submit yourself to my control...
Dark Manikin (Lyse):Your control...? Never!
Dark Manikin (Lyse):I will continue to fight...for freedom!
Kam'lanaut:There is nothing you can do.
Kam'lanaut:These memories that drive you will make the perfect sustenance for my new world.
Dark Manikin (Y'shtola):I won't allow it...
Dark Manikin (Y'shtola):My apologies...once more.
Kam'lanaut:How can this be!? Where did that magic come from!?
Kam'lanaut:Those worthless puppets are nothing but a farce!
Noctis:What!?
Dark Manikin (Thancred):Warriors...from the World of Light...?
"Y'shtola:That magic just now, was it...?"
Dark Manikin (Thancred):I wasn't expecting it to happen again...
"Dark Manikin (Thancred):No... The first time wasn't ""me."" It was different."
Dark Manikin (Thancred):I suppose I'm...confused.
Vaan:Weren't you captured? How did you manage to escape?
Thancred:Are you yourself?
Dark Manikin (Thancred):Yes...for now.
"Dark Manikin (Thancred):But I don't think I can hold it for long. So you must take my will, my memories."
Noctis:What? Why do we have to fight?
Lightning:They can't just hand them over peacefully.
Dark Manikin (Thancred):It's a defect of this body...
Dark Manikin (Thancred):Kam'lanaut used us to build this space...like Spiritus and Materia did.
Dark Manikin (Thancred):The power we hold is deeply connected to this space...
"Dark Manikin (Thancred):If we can get rid of our bodies before he uses our power, we can ruin his plans."
"Vaan:But why do we have to fight? If we do, then..."
Dark Manikin (Thancred):It's okay. This body is nothing more than a shadow.
"Dark Manikin (Thancred):These memories aren't mine after all, aren't they?"
Thancred:Seeing someone with the same face say that is...
"Dark Manikin (Thancred):As long as we exist as creational gods of this space, we cannot disappear on our own."
Dark Manikin (Thancred):But we don't want to be used for Kam'lanaut's plans.
Thancred:I see. I would say the same if I were in your shoes.
Lightning:I'll help.
Thancred:Thank you.
Dark Manikin (Thancred):Make it quick.
"Dark Manikin (Thancred):I should warn you, though, that not all the memories I have are pleasant ones."
Thancred:Don't worry. I know!
"Dark Manikin (Thancred):Kam'lanaut told me I was imperfect, yet burdened me with the power of the gods..."
"Dark Manikin (Thancred):So don't go easy on me, do you understand?"
Thancred:Don't worry. I understand how you feel.
Thancred:I will collect all the brilliance that resides within you!
"Thancred:Not pleasant memories, he said... He wasn't lying."
Krile:Are they painful memories? Were they better off not remembered...?
Thancred:No. I couldn't forgive myself if I forgot.
Noel:Even though you went through all that trouble remembering...
Thancred:There is no need for that. I am old enough to deal with this.
Thancred:That's right. I caught a glimpse of something my manikin saw.
Thancred:It seems like the dark manikins managed to escape from Kam'lanaut.
Thancred:The other two manikins should be in a safe location somewhere.
Caius:Indeed... They are somewhere that man will not find them.
Caius:Noel. It seems you have not gotten the respite promised by the gods.
Caius:Turning such hatred and sadness toward your master...
"Caius:Had you merely forgotten, you would not have greeted me with different emotions."
Noel:Grr... Why are you here!?
Papalymo:You said you were sheltering the dark manikins?
"Caius:Yes, her manikin at least..."
Lyse:Is there something you want to say to me?
Caius:There are things you do not want to know in your puppet's memories.
Caius:Are you pursuing her even knowing that?
Lyse:...Yes. I had a feeling that something bad had happened in my memories.
"Lyse:But I know I can't go on without them. Like Thancred, I..."
Lyse:I couldn't forgive myself if I forgot.
"Lyse:Aren't you the same, Papalymo?"
"Papalymo:Yes, indeed."
Caius:How regrettable.
Caius:Such sadness should be a puppet's burden to bear. You should not let the opportunity to live in ignorant bliss pass you by.
Noel:How dare you say that about the memories of others!
"Noel:But in truth, you..."
Lyse:She was...precious to you.
"Galuf:Even if you forget, reality itself remains unchanged."
Galuf:You cannot change destiny.
Lyse:I can't stop here.
"Papalymo:I concur. If you wish to hinder us, I will have to fight you."
Caius:Then show me your resolve!
Lyse:I saw my future self in my manikin...
"Lyse:Even if that were the case, I can't go on forgetting!"
Noel:Caius... Do you really sympathize with Lyse?
Noel:Or do you just plan on using her!?
Caius:I am here to see her resolve. It has nothing to do with you.
"Caius:Now, Lyse... Show me how determined you are to get everything back."
Caius:You will find your memories beyond here.
Lyse:Is that where my manikin is?
Noel:You want us to save her?
Caius:I have always only held one objective.
Caius:To test the road to the future countless times...to guide it to the correct future.
Caius:Make haste for she did not heed my warnings...
Caius:She may already be back at that man's side.
Lyse:Let's go.
Lenna:You don't doubt him?
"Lyse:As long as we're together, we can overcome anything...even if it is a trap."
Deuce:I'm so happy you can rely on us.
Lyse:I'm sure my manikin...couldn't have overcome those memories alone.
Lyse:I can't do anything alone. I know that.
Lyse:But I don't plan to rely only on my friends. I'll fight with all my might!
Deuce:The dark manikin Lyse is spiraling out of control all by herself...
Lyse:Yes! We have to stop her!
"Lyse:She's me, after all. There's no way she can do it alone, so..."
"Lenna:We will help. We're your friends, so don't look so down."
Lyse:Thank you!
Papalymo:I am surprised... Do you really not have your memories?
"Lyse:What do you mean, Papalymo?"
Papalymo:Exactly what I said.
"Papalymo:Let us be on our way, partner."
Papalymo:We have a manikin to save.
Lyse:Yes! Full speed ahead!
Thancred:You two could sense it the whole time. Now I know why it felt so different.
"Thancred:Alphinaud, Alisaie... You both had the memories that I lost, didn't you?"
"Alphinaud:We had planned not to say anything, as there is no meaning in not remembering it yourself..."
Alisaie:But you and the others thought there was something weird about us.
Thancred:I can't just let things that bother me go. I thought it had something to do with my memories.
Thancred:Y'shtola and Papalymo probably thought the same.
"Alisaie:In any case, I'm just glad to see them okay."
Alisaie:This is a world where puppets can move and think in the same way as their originals.
"Alphinaud:I had my doubts on whether or not you, Papalymo, and the others were the real deal."
"Thancred:Sorry to worry you. But thanks to you, we managed to get ourselves back."
"Alphinaud:You must have been worried, too."
Alisaie:So there's no need to apologize.
Alisaie:Though it is hard for us to judge whether or not our own memories are complete...
"Alphinaud:Nevertheless, we are happy to meet old friends once more."
Thancred:Same here. Now to get the memories of the others back.
Kam'lanaut:I do not understand. Why have you returned?
Dark Manikin (Lyse):Because I don't want to have any regrets.
Dark Manikin (Lyse):I can't let Shinryu go unchecked...!
Kam'lanaut:How entertaining... You just don't know when to give up.
Kam'lanaut:You possess a very strong will...because within you are powerful memories.
"Kam'lanaut:In that case, perhaps it is your original who is the hollow puppet now."
Kam'lanaut:But I have no need for your will any longer. I haven't time to trifle with foolish humans.
Kam'lanaut:I must rewrite this world...
Dark Manikin (Lyse):I can...still fight...!
Lyse:We're here to help!
Lyse:I should ask you the same. Why did you come here? This is too big a fight to go alone.
Lyse:I know because you and I are the same. Right?
Dark Manikin (Lyse):How did you get your memories back?
"Alphinaud:Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case. People's mental state changes moment by moment."
"Faris:You didn't give Lyse her memories back because you were worried, weren't you?"
Faris:It seems she understands that.
Dark Manikin (Lyse):I... I just...
"Lyse:Hey, Papalymo. Doesn't that Shinryu seem weird to you?"
Lyse:It's being protected by something...
Papalymo:It may be like that barrier the archduke created the last time we encountered it...
Alphinaud:It needs to preserve this space. It's a protective barrier.
Papalymo:A burdensome seal.
Papalymo:(My manikin from the World of Darkness sacrificed himself to break through that thing...)
"Papalymo:Once more, I will...!"
"Lyse:There must be another way, Papalymo!"
"Papalymo:You don't mean ""What do we do!?"""
"Lyse:You wanted to be cool, didn't you?"
Lyse:But my manikin has been trying her very best!
Papalymo:You're right... We will fight together.
"Bartz:Yes, we will. There's no need for any of us to fight alone!"
"Dark Manikin (Lyse):That might have...hurt, a little."
Lyse:Were you protecting me...?
"Dark Manikin (Lyse):It's okay. Even if I disappear, your memories won't."
Dark Manikin (Lyse):I can give them to you... This brilliance...
Lyse:I see... So that's what happened...
Lyse:I can fight! I'm ready!
Faris:Aren't you shaken from remembering it all? You don't have to fight.
Lyse:I know. But I will fight. No... I have to!
Lyse:I'm done hiding behind someone else's back!
"Mog:Kupo kupo! It seems like my pom-pom is working again, kupo!"
"Lion:We defeated Shinryu, but Kam'lanaut's world is still here."
"Mog:It's because he has a strong will, kupo."
"Mog:But I can find that will with my pom-pom! He's definitely that way, kupo!"
Lion:We've got to stop him. Come on!
Prishe:There's no need to rush. We're all together.
"Y'shtola:Still, we should not stay in this unstable atmosphere too long."
Y'shtola:He is undoubtedly waiting up ahead.
Papalymo:Did you get your brilliance back?
Lyse:Yes... I remember. I can't believe I forgot something so important.
"Lyse:But...it's okay. I think I'm getting used to everything, including my weaknesses."
"Papalymo:I was a little worried, but...no longer."
Papalymo:My memories seem like they are cut off...
Papalymo:But I am sure you remember much more clearly what happened after the incident.
Lyse:I'll tell you about it. Now I know more than you about the future.
Papalymo:I never thought I would see the day I would hear such a thing. I am blessed to be your guardian.
"Lyse:We're ""partners,"" right? What did you mean by that?"
Papalymo:Exactly what I said.
"Lyse:It was a difficult time, so...get ready to hear an epic tale."
Lyse:Everyone. Including...that person.
Lyse:I have so many things to tell you.
Lyse:It would take days to tell. I hope you're ready to hear it all.
Papalymo:I look forward to it. But...at another time.
Lyse:You're right. There's still a dark manikin missing...
Lyse:We can't just let them be here in this unstable space.
"Papalymo:You did well, Lyse."
Lyse:...That's not fair. You can't go around pretending like you know everything!
Papalymo:I understand.
Papalymo:Because you are my second partner.
Lyse:We went forward with all our might.
Lyse:Because I didn't want to ignore the things only I could do or the feelings I was entrusted with.
"Lyse:But...when we succeeded, and I wanted to share my happiness..."
Lyse:All together...
Papalymo:I'm sorry.
Lyse:I know it can't be helped. But...just for now...
Lyse:Just for now...even if it's just a little...can I rest?
"Papalymo:Yes, of course."
"Lyse:I was so sure I was ready, but..."
Lyse:I wasn't. It hurts...
"Papalymo:(Even if this is a fake world, and the respite is transient at best...)"
Papalymo:(The emotions on Lyse's face here...are real.)
Papalymo:(The future of my second partner...that which I should not have been able to see...is right before my eyes.)
"Thancred:By some fate, we are able to fight together again."
Papalymo:Though it is a battle forced on us by the gods...
Thancred:Still...I'm happy.
Papalymo:I gave you a difficult task.
"Thancred:If you were me, you would have done the same, wouldn't you?"
Papalymo:I wonder. I am by far your senior by length of service.
"Galuf:Hoho. Papalymo, you're still too young to say that."
"Auron:If one's life is determined by the order of ""that time,"" then you've still got a ways to go in this world."
Papalymo:Indeed... What a strange place.
"Papalymo:Having your memories taken, then being forced to fight is selfish of the gods. I am also curious about what's happening back home."
Papalymo:But traveling with companions from other worlds allowed Lyse to grow even without her memories.
"Auron:She was able to recall the past, even without her memories..."
"Thancred:Our memories may have been toyed with for someone's convenience, but we cannot say for sure."
Galuf:Do you all think the gods are terrible?
Thancred:The worst part is that they bear no ill will...
Auron:We cannot do anything about being called here by them. We must do what we can.
Galuf:Wouldn't it be nice to have time to enjoy it?
Papalymo:I doubt that will happen.
Galuf:A wise man you are.
Galuf:Go to the side of your partner. She is waiting for you.
Papalymo:I suppose I should...
Kam'lanaut:So you are the ones who broke Shinryu's barrier...
Shantotto:Ohoho! It was foolish of you to think we couldn't get through!
Alisaie:This place cannot stand for long without the dark manikins.
Lion:This is the end!
Kam'lanaut:Hmph... While basking in the benefits of this half-hearted world...
Kam'lanaut:You dare to try and stop me?
"Shantotto:I think even the ""half-hearted"" gods would be dismayed by this world you've made."
Shantotto:Your ideal is nothing more than a bore!
Kam'lanaut:I could not expect imperfect beings such as yourselves to understand the true world.
Kam'lanaut:It may feel like you accepted a reality different from the ideal...
Kam'lanaut:But your heart is suffering from the shackles placed upon it.
Lyse:So you think my memories are shackles on my heart.
"Lyse:Well, you're wrong!"
"Lyse:Even if they hurt, they will help me grow!"
Kam'lanaut:I did not wish to use my power here...
Kam'lanaut:But you leave me little choice. I will rob you of your wills for the sake of paradise!
Kam'lanaut:There is no way for imperfect humans to enter Paradise...
Bartz:That's quite the statement for someone born among humans!
Lyse:We won't give up...on reality!
Kam'lanaut:No... This cannot be...!
Lion:This is it!
Eald'narche:I grow tired of watching this.
Alphinaud:You are the one Lion spoke of before.
Lion:So big brother was summoned here after all.
Bartz:You mean Kam'lanaut is the younger one?
Eald'narche:Appearances can be deceiving.
"Eald'narche:Though I do not know how your worlds work, crystal bearers of other worlds..."
Bartz:You're the one who told us how to get out of the forest!
Lyse:We didn't know if you were on our side or not...!
"Eald'narche:Have you gotten your memories back? You've grown a little stronger, but..."
Caius:...It did not meet your expectations.
"Alphinaud:One after the other... If they attack at once, we won't stand a chance."
Kam'lanaut:Why have you come here!?
Eald'narche:I should be the one asking you that. What are you doing?
Eald'narche:Thinking yourself capable of making the true world... How conceited can you be?
Lyse:I guess they aren't friends...
Caius:There is no alliance among us here.
Caius:I just happened to arrive in this world a little earlier than him. That is all.
"Eald'narche:Now then, aside from that vain god, there must be something else worth seeing here."
Caius:You must be a new warrior... Perhaps you know Kam'lanaut?
Eald'narche:What makes you think that?
Caius:Is the answer important to you?
Eald'narche:Perhaps. What do you know of him?
Caius:He tried to rewrite the laws of this world and create a subspace he called the true world.
"Caius:I have yet to meet him, but heard his exploits from a puppet he was using to those ends."
Eald'narche:He created the true world? Don't make me laugh!
Eald'narche:He is not capable of reproducing the paradise where the gods reside.
Caius:The residence of the gods is a paradise? Is that how your world works?
Caius:It is so very different than my own.
"Eald'narche:Only perfect beings may enter that paradise, and yet he would use puppets..."
Eald'narche:...We will leave that for now.
Eald'narche:Can you show me where he is?
Caius:So he is one who can use and dispose of others without hesitation... There is something you should know.
Caius:You can pass through dimensions like this. Follow the coordinates and aim for your destination.
Caius:I have seen you to your destination. What you do now is up to you.
"Eald'narche:I thought it impossible, but to see you commit such an unsightly blunder here is...disappointing."
Eald'narche:I will correct my brother's failure and bury this space at the end of the dimension.
Lion:What do you mean!?
Eald'narche:How annoying... Hold your tongue!
Eald'narche:I do not want to have to fight you...
Alphinaud:He captured the last dark manikin!
"Eald'narche:I think you know this, but she has memories from her original."
"Eald'narche:Allow me to use her, too. Now have fun playing with this puppet."
Alphinaud:He is using dark manikins as a shield so he can escape!
Eald'narche:Did you think I would fight you? You are so very conceited...
Eald'narche:This puppet is more than you deserve.
"Y'shtola:It cannot be helped. Even if we have to sacrifice my memories, we must go after him!"
"Lyse:No, Y'shtola!"
Lyse:We are going to save her! We will stop them!
Y'shtola:Thank you...
Y'shtola:I will get my memories back with these hands of mine.
Dark Manikin (Y'shtola):Gck...!
"Y'shtola:After casting that magic, you were captured and ran rampant..."
Y'shtola:But I will release you. Leave the rest to me!
Eald'narche:All those pitiful puppets were nothing more than trash...
"Eald'narche:But no matter... I will put a quick end to their originals, too."
"Lion:We will stop you, no matter what you're scheming!"
Eald'narche:Putting on the air of the hero... Don't you know that this is a false world?
"Eald'narche:If you still have strength, destroy them!"
Kam'lanaut:Make no mistake... This time I will bury you!
Kam'lanaut:Gck! Not here...
Eald'narche:Expose me no longer to your disgraceful form!
Kam'lanaut:Why... What did I do to deserve...this...
Alphinaud:How could he... To his own brother...!
Lion:There's no brotherly love between these two. Don't let your guard down.
Eald'narche:I see you won't cease talking.
"Eald'narche:This small, worthless existence will be your end!"
Lion:Give up! This isn't the world you've dreamt of!
Warrior of Light:Having the light beside us...is our dream!
Eald'narche:You blasted adventurers... Get out of my sight!
Eald'narche:I will end you here and now!
Eald'narche:Hmph... It is time.
Warrior of Light:Running away?
Zidane:Wait! Y'shtola's brilliance is...!
Y'shtola:I see... I have forgotten so much.
Y'shtola:Now let us hurry forth.
Zidane:Are you sure you're ready to go already? Did you really get your memories back?
Y'shtola:It is because I have remembered that I know I cannot stand idle.
Lyse:I'm glad you got your memories back.
Lyse:I didn't want you to regret letting them go.
Y'shtola:...Thank you.
"Lyse:If your memories have returned, then you should know. I can't thank you guys enough."
Lyse:There's no way I could let you forget everything here.
Warrior of Light:Have these trying memories...become a guiding light to you?
"Y'shtola:I apologize if I worried you, but I am okay."
Y'shtola:Because I know very clearly what I must do.
"Mog:Kupo! Without those brothers here, the atmosphere has become really unstable, kupo!"
"Mog:Someone open a portal and get us to the airship, kupo!"
Lyse:I'll do it!
"Zidane:I always had a feeling you couldn't do magic, Lyse."
"Lyse:Until now, maybe I couldn't. But now I've decided."
Lyse:Because I remembered that I have things to do back home.
"Lyse:And I want to save this world and return home, and do it with all my might!"
"Mog:The portal is connected to the airship, kupo! Time to evacuate, everyone!"
Materia:Is this truly what you want?
"???:If Noct and the others appear as they do from that time, then I wish to as well."
Materia:I understand.
Materia:They need you.
???:I see...
???:I can imagine. Even more so if they are still themselves from that time.
Materia:Ignis Scientia... Impart your wisdom to them.
"Ignis:For a god, you seem to lack...spirit."
Materia:I am losing the faith of the warriors.
"Materia:I have taken sad memories away from some, including your friends."
"Materia:I wanted to give them respite, even if just for a moment..."
Ignis:Manipulating people's memories without their consent will certainly cause them to lose faith in you.
"Materia:Yes, it seems humans are such creatures. But it is something beyond my comprehension..."
Ignis:A weakened god and a world in peril...
"Ignis:At the very least, I want to keep my memories as they are."
Materia:Are humans happy fighting even with the burden of sad memories on them?
Ignis:You cannot change what you've experienced.
Ignis:My greatest priority is saving Noct.
Materia:...Of course.
"Materia:The memories I took are scattered throughout this world as ""brilliance,"" or fragments of the crystal."
Ignis:Then I suppose Noct will want to get back his memories himself.
"Materia:...Yes, I suppose so."
Materia:Which is why you must...
Ignis:I won't do anything to confuse him. Is that acceptable?
Materia:...I leave it in your hands.
Ignis:Then I shall take my leave.
Materia:Is my authority...being threatened...?
Materia:My warriors... Take care of your comrades...
Ignis:Where am I...?
Vayne:You must be one of Materia's warriors.
Ignis:It seems that way. Are you one of the warriors from another world she spoke of?
"Vayne:That is correct. Nor, as of the moment, do I regard you as an enemy."
Vayne:My name is Vayne Carudas Solidor.
Ignis:Ignis Scientia.
Ignis:I'm looking for a man named Noctis Lucis Caelum.
"Vayne:Noctis... Yes, I know him. Are you a friend of his?"
"Ignis:Yes... Well, not quite."
"Ignis:I am his adviser, to put it simply."
Ignis:You appear to be a wise man of station.
"Vayne:Hmph. In this world, I'm naught more than another warrior."
Vayne:But you are quite keen in your observation. Befitting of an adviser...
Vayne:One such as yourself is certainly indispensable to that prince.
Ignis:He refers to himself as a prince?
"Vayne:He is loathe to be called as such, wishing to be treated the same as his allies."
Ignis:...I see.
Vayne:Can I assume then that he is not a prince to you?
Vayne:Perhaps because of something that happens in his future...something he has forgotten?
Ignis:What do you know?
Vayne:Something that the one who summoned you failed to say.
Vayne:The greatest power in this world is willpower.
"Vayne:In order to strengthen that will, I was summoned by a god who granted me certain memories and knowledge."
Vayne:Though it seems Materia has also come to learn the importance of memories and histories in peoples' wills to fight.
Vayne:So there is a chance you know more than that prince does.
Vayne:A warrior possessing a strong will can manipulate this world to his liking.
"Vayne:You can do things that prince cannot do... Take that device, for example."
Vayne:You can make it work in this world.
Vayne:One with a strong will can overwrite the laws of this world.
Ignis:So I can bend things to my will?
Vayne:It seems you're finally starting to understand.
Vayne:But remember one thing.
"Vayne:Your liege is enjoying his life as a ""prince"" in this world."
"Vayne:As such, you cannot count on the strength of his will. Do you not feel the need to change that as his adviser?"
Ignis:I shall determine that after we meet.
"Prompto:Noct! You're ringing, dude!"
Noct:What? Me?
Lyse:Isn't that sound coming from your pocket?
"Fang:It might be broken. But it's sure making a ruckus, so why not take a look?"
Noct:Maybe it's my alarm... Huh?
Noct:It's Ignis!
Prompto:Really!? Answer it!
Prompto:Are you the real deal!?
Ignis:Of course.
Ignis:My apologies on the wait.
Lyse:So who's our new friend?
"Noct:Oh, right. This is Ignis. He's my..."
"Prompto:Tactician? Isn't that a bit stiff, even for you?"
Ignis:I thought it the best way to speak to those from other worlds.
Ace:I appreciate it.
"Garnet:Since we're all from different worlds, the simpler you can explain it, the better."
Garnet:You must be very reliable to be Noctis's tactician. Welcome to the team!
Ignis:Glad to be of service.
Prompto:You sure are fast friends!
"Lyse:Hehe. Isn't that a good thing? After all, you looked so happy to see him earlier."
Noct:Me? Happy?
"Lyse:Oh, didn't you notice?"
"Lyse:When you got the call from him, you seemed so relieved, and your voice sounded so happy."
"Noct:I wouldn't say happy... It's normal to feel relieved when one of your friends turns out to be fine, right?"
"Ignis:""Relieved,"" I see. You haven't changed at all, Noct."
Ace:What's the matter? Something on your mind?
Ignis:I suppose I'm also relieved nothing has changed.
Lyse:There's no need to worry. Noct is doing fine.
"Mog:Kupo, kupo! I sense brilliance!"
"Mog:And this time, there's no trace of Shinryu! We might be able to gather it up easily for once, kupo!"
Ace:Could it be a trap set by the enemy? Is there a chance something is interfering with your pompom?
"Prompto:You're thinking too hard, Ace. I'm sure everything'll be fine!"
Noct:Then let's go get that brilliance.
"Lyse:It's definitely best we get our hands on it first, before the enemy can use it."
"Ignis:So we are to gather this ""brilliance""?"
Noct:I'll explain it along the way.
"Garnet:We'll introduce you to the others, too."
Steiner:So Sir Ignis is responsible not only for the group's battle strategies...
Steiner:But their nutrition as well!
"Ignis:It certainly isn't easy, especially with such picky eaters about."
"Edgar:Though you and Noct are close in age, you hold different viewpoints and offer him advice..."
"Edgar:And not just that, you look after his health and cook, too. How fortunate he is to have a tactician such as you!"
"Lenna:Indeed. You may not be siblings, but you're just as reliable as one."
Ignis:Has everyone been eating and sleeping properly? I want to learn what I can about the life here.
Rosa:We have everything we need on the airship.
"Rosa:Even if more people join our team, we have plenty of room."
"Penelo:Yeah. There might be dangerous monsters outside, but we want for nothing with the airship."
Edgar:But perhaps we had best let Ignis know about Noct's behavior this morning.
"Steiner:Indeed! This morning, Sir Noct very discreetly left his vegetables on his plate."
Ignis:It is as I feared.
"Ignis:No matter where he goes, he fails to understand the importance of a balanced diet."
Rosa:You are a much friendlier man than your title and appearance make you seem.
Penelo:I agree. Though royals and their retainers seem to be conscious about all kinds of things.
"Penelo:I feel like you're doing your best to be approachable to us, Ignis."
"Edgar:Well, this won't do. I try my hardest to be approachable..."
"Edgar:But perhaps you'd prefer a more frank approach, Penelo?"
Penelo:No. Not...really...
"Edgar:Haha, I jest! I wouldn't want Vaan to get jealous."
Ignis:I don't quite understand the full situation. However...
"Ignis:Perhaps that very aspect is what makes you difficult to approach, Edgar."
Prompto:Ignis sure doesn't hold back.
Noct:He's settling in a little too well...
Noel:It's been a while since you've seen each other. Isn't there anything you want to say?
"Prompto:Well... Yes, but..."
Noel:Why so polite?
"Prompto:Um, well... Sorry about that. I guess I shouldn't be..."
"Prishe:You and Noct are pretty shy, huh."
Prompto:D-did you read my mind?
Noel:It's pretty easy to tell regardless.
"Noel:Why don't you go talk to him? He must have things he wants to say, too."
"Noct:Yeah, maybe, but..."
"Prishe:Oh, I get it. You're afraid of getting scolded, aren't you?"
Noct:But we need to talk to him about what we remember.
Noel:Then I'll call him over.
Noct:So you met Materia?
Ignis:Yes. She gave me the gist of this world and said you had already arrived.
Ignis:Why do you ask?
Prompto:Neither of us met her...
Noct:And we have some allies from other worlds who've lost their memories...
Noct:And some of their friends who arrived afterward had all theirs intact.
Ignis:You're worried your memories may not be complete?
Prompto:I don't want to forget anything important...
Ignis:I may not have all of my memories.
Ignis:And I don't want to risk worsening the situation by saying something vague or incomplete.
"Prompto:We were looking for him and asking around if anyone'd seen a big dude with tattoos, but..."
Prompto:No luck.
"Noct:If Gladio is here, he must be looking for us, too."
"Ignis:In which case, we're bound to run into him eventually."
"Ignis:How have you two been faring here? And what of your camera, Prompto?"
Prompto:It didn't make the trip. I must have dropped it somewhere.
"Ignis:Then we need to keep an eye out for that, too. We should keep a record of our journey in this world."
Prompto:Yeah! It'd be great to look back on all the amazing things we did and all the great people we met!
Prompto:We'll get to look back on those pictures and reminisce about our adventures.
Ignis:Is there anything else you're lacking?
Noct:Not really. Mog takes care of the rest.
Noct:I've even got the hang of fighting with our new friends.
"Prompto:You can't imagine how surprised I was to hear we were in a different world, but I guess we're all in the same boat here."
Ignis:How has the journey been?
"Noct:Well, it's not all bad."
"Prompto:Definitely different from home, but it's been fun so far."
Ignis:...I see.
Prompto:You seem...underwhelmed. Something wrong?
Ignis:I'm no different than usual.
"Noct:(You're as far from ""usual"" as I've ever seen...)"
"???:With this world as the ark, I can fly anywhere."
???:Who controls this world?
???:The gods.
???:The seat of the gods will become my new promised land.
???:But there are those who stand in the way.
???:A powerless god cannot stop me.
"???:Ah, yes... It's best to end them."
???:Ha ha ha...
???:I will take their throne and...
Vayne:...Try to become a god?
Vayne:...But perhaps worth considering. If he strikes down Materia...
Vayne:It might be a chance to release all those held captive by this world.
"Vayne:If one has the strength of will to oppose the gods, he can escape their rule. That is the type of world we are in."
Vayne:They probably make their way for Materia's chambers...
Vayne:She is perhaps easier prey than Spiritus.
Vayne:...I shall make my own preparations.
Vayne:Have you grown accustomed to this world?
Vayne:It seems you've grown suspicious of me... Perhaps you've heard some bad rumors?
Ignis:Vaan and his friends said you were their enemy.
"Vayne:But we have an agreement to fight together in this world, and I have no intention of starting a fight now."
Ignis:What business have you with me?
Vayne:I have a question for you as a newcomer to this world: what do you think of it?
Vayne:For example... How did you find your liege?
Ignis:He seemed fine and at ease here.
Vayne:A safe answer.
Ignis:What are you getting at?
Vayne:Do not think your allies are the only ones who came from your world.
Vayne:It seems your crystal chooses its king regardless of one's sovereignty.
Vayne:It selects a ruler without democracy...
Vayne:And the chosen one has no choice but to obey its supernatural selector.
Ignis:That is our world.
Vayne:They were merely my own thoughts on the matter. Do you feel no resentment at being bound by gods and legends?
Ignis:...I do not need to answer you.
"Vayne:...Regardless, the gods in this world differ from the ones in yours."
"Vayne:You've witnessed Materia's weakness with your own eyes, haven't you?"
Ignis:She said she was losing the faith of her warriors.
Vayne:Yes. And now someone who knows of her weakness is seeking to seize her authority.
"Vayne:Be on your guard. The current state of affairs may be detestable, but..."
Vayne:Being ruled by someone who seeks to be a hero by slaying the gods is perhaps an even worse fate.
Vayne:I would keep a watchful eye on anything...peculiar that may appear before you.
Ignis:What a strange man.
Ignis:I had best regroup with the others.
Materia:You would turn your blade on a god... Why?
Zack:It is the natural reward for a god without a will...
Materia:Accepting the will of the warriors...is my responsibility as a god.
Zack:Ha ha ha...
"Sephiroth:Now, the goddess's throne..."
Sephiroth:The worlds are connected here... However...
Sephiroth:I must first rid it of its parasites.
Sephiroth:They have been divided. Some of them won't respond...
Sephiroth:The power of my will...is being hindered by the law of the gods.
Sephiroth:So how well can empty puppets fare?
Dark Manikin (Zack):Where is this...?
Dark Manikin (Zack):Why are there so many of me...?
Dark Manikin (Zack):So...we weren't unique.
Dark Manikin (Zack):Why are you standing in Materia's place...?
Sephiroth:This place belongs to me now.
Sephiroth:And you...are my warriors.
"Dark Manikin (Zack):Yeah right! To defeat people like you, we"
Sephiroth:You...are puppets.
"Sephiroth:As copies, all you need to do is fulfill your role."
"Sephiroth:Copy their memories, delude them, and crush their will."
Dark Manikin (Zack):My body...won't...listen to me...
Ignis:I just finished inspecting the airship's equipment.
"Noel:It has everything you need, right?"
Ignis:I found it absolutely fascinating.
"Ignis:For example, I saw a vegetable with a star-shaped cross-section."
Yuri:It's like the star carrots from our world.
Ignis:A carrot... So it's a root vegetable.
Chelinka:Yeah! You can put it in a stew or saut it.
Ignis:I see.
Noel:Noct doesn't eat those red vegetables.
"Sabin:Gahaha! Whether you simmer or fry it, he won't even take a bite."
Ignis:I'll give it a taste later.
Prishe:This world doesn't have many unique foods like those pickles Steiner carries around...
"Prishe:There are ""similar"" foods, though."
"Yuri:But if you keep thinking they're fakes, food starts tasting pretty bland."
"Chelinka:Even if we don't eat for a long time, though, we're completely fine here. Maybe we don't need to eat at all in this world."
Prishe:I know how you feel! But that's exactly why I eat!
Prishe:I eat and have a blast here!
"Sabin:Yeah! Even if a cure or potion will heal our wounds, nothing quite rejuvenates the heart like a good meal."
Sabin:And nothing beats drinking a fragrant tea.
Ignis:Then I'll see if I can't find any good tea leaves around here.
Sabin:You get it. Thanks!
Noel:It seems like time's stopped here.
"Noel:I don't get the feeling of really living, like eating or sleeping."
Ignis:Is that so?
Prishe:But Noct is getting by with this feeling somehow.
"Yuri:Well, in that case..."
Yuri:Could we eat some food you prepared for Noct?
Chelinka:Yuri! Remember your manners!
"Yuri:You say that, but aren't you interested, too?"
Noel:I'm interested.
Sabin:I would have anything you make!
Ignis:Very well then.
"Prishe:You're so generous, Ignis!"
Chelinka:Won't it be difficult with vegetables you're not used to?
Ignis:It won't be a problem.
Yuri:Yay! I'm looking forward to it!
Ignis:You won't be disappointed.
"Tidus:That's why I'm the star player now. You're yesterday's news, old man."
Jecht:That so? Didn't anyone tell you that I'm makin' a comeback?
"Tidus:Some people might be saying that, but what they really want is my autograph."
"Jecht:Haha. Well, of course."
"Jecht:But no matter how badly people want my autograph, it's still a fake if you write it."
"Jecht:Keep tryin', kid. I'll keep watchin' you for as long as it takes."
Relm:I need to get back home or else he'll get lonely and senile.
Shadow:...Why are you talking to me?
"Relm:Just because. Besides, you're always nearby, Shadow."
"Galuf:Krile, were you injured in the last battle?"
"Krile:You worry too much, Grandpa."
Krile:I'm fine! Are you okay?
Galuf:Ho ho ho. I am fine. I want to be with my adorable granddaughter and dear friends for as long as possible.
Zack:Is this...everyone's ideal?
Zack:The place of respite that everyone wished for?
Zack:Is this to weaken our wills?
Zack:I need to...entrust it to someone...
Zack:My very cells are being controlled by him... My body won't last...
Yuna:There you are!
"Tidus:Sorry, Yuna. We were just talking."
Jecht:Yeah. We'll be right there.
Warrior of Light:I found them.
Jecht:Who the hell are they!?
Yuna:What's going on...!?
"Tidus:Well, I..."
Jecht:You don't...remember?
Zack:I've been waiting for you!
Tidus:Dad!?
Warrior of Light:What's going on!?
Zack:What's all the fuss?
Zack:Is that...me!?
"Zack:No, I'm not. Neither are they."
Tidus:Why did you do that to my dad...?
Jecht:Maybe he got the wrong one? I'm...
Cloud:They have the same face... Is this some kind of trick?
"Zack:You know, don't you, Cloud? The injured ones are copies."
Yuna:I didn't know. How could I have made such a mistake...?
"Cloud:They're copies who can read our memories. The stronger your emotional attachment, the harder it is to see through them."
Zack:How is that possible!? And why aren't you one of them?
Zack:I'll tell you after we take care of these guys.
Jecht:Having to fight someone with my own face...
"Jecht:If it's a joke, I'm not laughin'."
Yuna:Their voice and personality are identical. I can't bring myself to harm him without knowing why...
"Zack:It's no good if you guys don't do it. If you don't strike them down, it'll infect others."
"Zack:Hey. What we want is different, right? This isn't respite, is it?"
Zack:Hold on a second. What are you talking about?
"Cloud:You don't need to understand, Zack. You know who you need to defeat."
"Zack:Reliable as ever, Cloud."
"Cloud:I'll put an end to these clones. Those who can't take it, stand back."
Tidus:Do we really have to fight? Do we have to disappear!?
Tidus:Why do they...
Zack:I'm counting on you guys.
Zack:Don't force your memories onto us.
Tidus:I didn't like seeing those clones of me and my old man.
Ignis:Have you ever fought puppets like that before?
Vivi:Not really... Most dark manikins we've met couldn't speak very well.
Vivi:Their feelings were different from ours. They were very unique.
Ignis:So they had their own wills and emotions based on that.
Tidus:But these were different. It was like someone went through the trouble of making an exact replica.
Noct:Maybe it's a different type of dark manikin.
Zack:Which reminds me... My clone went somewhere during the battle.
"Zack:He was saying that Cloud understood, if I remember correctly."
Zack:Calamity...?
Ignis:Tell us more.
Cloud:The calamity and those with its power could read the memories of others and had the ability to copy them.
Cloud:They could mimic the face of a deceased father or brother when fighting you.
Cloud:But I don't think there are many who have that power in this world.
"Cloud:Which means those were copies of copies, or a variation of the dark manikins."
"Tidus:They read mine and Yuna's memories, which is why we couldn't tell they were fakes right away."
Vivi:It's different fromthe timemy dark manikin was used as a substitute...
Vivi:They're the ones reflecting everyone's memories.
"Ignis:So they possess no will of their own, merely acting upon the memories of others..."
Tidus:Is there a way to tell them apart?
"Cloud:It's...difficult. In my world, that calamity wiped out an entire race."
Noct:So we just have to stick together?
"Tidus:I'd love to, but it's not always that easy."
"Ignis:If they can only take the form of those they meet, there may be a way to tell them apart."
Ignis:Use information that only you know that the person in question couldn't.
"Zack:Like something they did and forgot, but you saw... I see."
"Zack:You never disappoint, Mr. Tactician!"
Noct:Easier said than done.
Vivi:I'll try my best to remember. Even those fake ones seemed to be struggling...
Cloud:I don't think they're doing it because they want to. There must be someone pulling the strings.
Zack:I'm also interested in what my clone was starting to say...
"Ignis:We must proceed with caution, and be careful after splitting up and regrouping."
"Noct:...You've really become the group's advisor, haven't you?"
Prompto:This world sure is strange...
Prompto:The power of will?
"Prompto:If you have that, you can do anything."
"Noctis:I don't think ""anything"" is possible."
"Prompto:Yeah, but..."
Prompto:We might be able to do things we couldn't before.
Prompto:Like...giving a sad story a happy ending.
Ignis:What's the matter?
"Noctis:Oh, right. Can I ask you something, Ignis?"
Noctis:Do you think there's a way...
Noctis:To bring back the things we lost on our journey?
Ignis:...I see. You're reading my memories.
Ignis:...Or perhaps my desires.
Prompto:We're being serious.
"Ignis:""If only fate had not been so cruel."" ""I wish things had gone differently that time."""
Ignis:I've thought it many times. But...those events won't change.
"Ignis:Even if you keep hoping to be saved by the ""what ifs,"" what you lost cannot be brought back. And..."
Ignis:You two are not that perceptive.
Ignis:Especially concerning memories of that time.
Ignis:I accepted my fate and was still prepared to fight.
"Noctis:Wh-what are you saying, Ignis?"
Ignis:It's time to regroup.
Prompto:Am I dreaming!?
Noct:You can't be serious... They look just like us.
Ignis:You said they transformed after reading my memories?
Prompto:Are we about to get a beatdown!?
Zack:You don't want to fight?
Noct:Then why did you transform?
Cloud:Don't be fooled. They'll use a friendly face to bring your guard down.
Cloud:They're trying to weaken our will. It reeks of...him.
Zack:Are you sure they're fakes?
Ignis:They knew things only I did.
Prompto:We promise we won't do anything. Can't we all just get along?
"Prompto:Aw man, I would totally say that..."
"Cloud:If we leave them alone, they'll turn into monsters. As long as they're being controlled by him, we can't just let them be."
Zack:Then we have no choice but to fight.
"Noctis:Fine then. If it's Ignis, then..."
Noct:Cut that out!
Cloud:Don't confuse our comrades any more.
Cloud:Stop pretending you have a heart!
Zack:My dark manikin...? And two of them!?
Dark Manikin (Zack):Now which of us is pretending to have a heart?
Cloud:They aren't Zack. They're being controlled.
"Zack:They're not themselves, right? We should defeat them...right?"
Ignis:Yes. That much is clear.
Noct:Then let's do it!
Noctis:What's up with these guys?
Ignis:They're our enemy.
Noctis:I know that!
Ignis:Then you know we must bring them down.
"Zack:I kinda knew there had to be more than one or two fakes, but still..."
Firion:It seems like they were made to confuse us and weaken our will to fight...
Ignis:They're simply imitating us as a child would.
Zack:They might all be puppets of me inside. I can't help but wonder why.
Onion Knight:I remember Vivi's dark manikin being manipulated.
Onion Knight:But why would someone use a puppet of Zack to imitate other people?
Cloud:I don't understand the whole story. My memories might still be incomplete.
Cloud:I think this is the work of Sephiroth and the experiments in our home world.
Zack:Experiments? What experiments? ...What is this feeling?
"Cloud:I only have this information as ""knowledge."" My own experiences are...fuzzy."
"Onion Knight:If both your memories are unclear, then there's not much we from other worlds can do."
Cloud:The one thing I do know for sure is that the real Zack wouldn't become like that.
Cloud:But that puppet is different.
Cloud:Dark manikins are easily influenced by a stronger will.
Zack:So they were working for Sephiroth. Were they chosen by him because they're my manikins?
Zack:I don't get it! I just can't remember!
Firion:I thought each person only had one dark manikin...
Firion:But it seems like there can be lots of a body.
"Onion Knight:Do you know anything about that, Mog?"
"Mog:The only thing I really know about is brilliance, kupo..."
"Mog:And the only Zack with brilliance was the first one we met, kupo."
Ignis:So we have no deeper insight into the biology of these dark manikins?
"Mog:Dark manikins are created by the crystal core of darkness, kupo."
"Mog:Which means they belong to neither Materia nor Spiritus, kupo."
Ignis:So they aren't bound by the laws of the gods?
"Mog:That's the first time I've seen so many of them, kupo..."
"Mog:The crystal core is supposed to protect this world, kupo, but it seems to be doing the opposite now."
Firion:Right. If our enemy can create and control that many warriors...
Onion Knight:This world is theirs for the destroying. They're just creating an army.
"Ignis:In any case, what they have are merely pawns."
Firion:I wonder if we'll be able to face them without fear again in battle...
Ignis:Shall we take a detour then?
Ignis:We must first defeat the man behind the curtain.
Zack:No. I can't just let this go.
"Zack:Even if they're no more than clones, I can't forgive them for trampling on other people's memories like that."
Firion:Alright. But don't push yourself too hard. Remember that we're all here to help.
Galuf:Guoh...!
Zack:Are they degrading...!?
Cloud:Have you remembered?
"Zack:No, but what is this feeling? Even though I can't recall, it's like I still remember..."
Noct:Who is he?
Dark Manikin (Zack):You finally made it.
"Aerith:You're Zack from the World of Darkness, aren't you?"
Dark Manikin (Zack):Aerith and Cloud are here... So that's the goddess's idea of respite. Hmm...
Zack:What's going on here?
"Dark Manikin (Zack):It's pointless to explain it. You and I are the same, after all."
Zack:I know that! So you remember everything!?
"Dark Manikin (Zack):If you defeat me, you'll get your memories back. But..."
Dark Manikin (Zack):They're painful.
Zack:Better than forgetting.
Dark Manikin (Zack):I had a feeling you'd say that. We really are one and the same.
Aerith:Everyone is feeling...uneasy. Could you explain it to us?
"Laguna:Hey, hey. They're turning into monsters as we speak. Should we beat 'em?"
Noct:Guess so.
Dark Manikin (Zack):I get it. I need to tell you.
"Cloud:The one behind all this is Sephiroth, isn't it?"
"Cloud:There's no way you could do this, not with Zack's memories."
Dark Manikin (Zack):It's nice to know you have faith in me.
Dark Manikin (Zack):I've got to return this happiness to you.
"Zack:Sadness, regret... I'll take it all."
"Dark Manikin (Zack):There's no other way to save us other than defeating us, so..."
Dark Manikin (Zack):Don't hold back!
Cloud:Are you sure you're alright with this?
"Zack:It's not easy, but I'll be fine."
Zack:I'd hate to keep forcing our memories on them.
Dark Manikin (Zack):Appreciate it.
Dark Manikin (Zack):I leave this dream to you.
"Dark Manikin (Zack):They're painful memories, but...they're all yours now."
Zack:I see... So that's what happened.
Zack:Looks like I forgot a lot of things.
Cloud:So you remember your past now...
"Zack:And things you don't know, too."
"Zack:Hehe... But you're doing fine, Cloud."
Zack:You lived on.
"Zack:You took good care of my honor, my dreams."
Zack:Thank you.
Cloud:You don't need to thank me.
"Zack:Being able to see Aerith and Tifa... This must be what Materia called ""respite."""
Zack:I thought I could become a hero if I saved this world...
"Zack:It's nothing. Don't worry about it, Cloud. Just stay like that until it's your turn."
"Zack:There's still a lot of thinking to do, but there are other things I need to do first."
"Zack:I want to tell the others what I know, Cloud. Could you call them for a strategy meeting?"
Edgar:...He's trying to become a god!?
Zack:I could see what my manikin saw. Sephiroth is standing where Materia stood.
Ignis:So what he said was true...
Vaan:You knew!?
Ignis:Yes. I'd been told so before.
Ignis:By the man you called an enemy.
Vaan:You met Vayne and didn't tell us!?
Noct:Why didn't you say anything to me?
Ignis:There was no way to prove he wasn't a fake. I only wished to say so after I had gathered sufficient evidence.
Ignis:I thought there would be those uncomfortable knowing of our contact.
Vaan:Just how childish do you think I am!?
Edgar:It's not too difficult to discern Vayne's motives as an informant.
"Edgar:He may be the violent sort, but would even sacrifice the world and its gods in order to protect his own realm."
"Edgar:In this case, he wasn't sure what would happen to this world after the goddess had been killed..."
"Edgar:But wanted us to stop Sephiroth from controlling this world, which would make things...difficult for him, I suppose."
"Noct:Not like the world's changed at all, though."
"Vaan:It's just one annoying thing after the other, like making clones..."
Edgar:What's most troubling is the very fact that the world hasn't changed. Why?
Edgar:Is Materia really dead? Is there perhaps a chance she managed to escape and is in hiding?
Zack:My manikin's memories start from Sephiroth being in Materia's chamber.
Zack:That's all I know. I leave the thinking to you guys.
Cloud:Sephiroth in Materia's chambers... It doesn't feel real.
"Zack:If that's how you feel, you might be right."
Cloud:What makes you say that?
"Zack:I wish I could tell you, but I don't know the details. I think it's something you have to remember yourself."
Vaan:So where should we be headed?
"Zack:What do you think, Cloud?"
Cloud:I think...we need to go forward.
Edgar:We have no basis for judgment now...so we'll have to rely on Zack's words.
"Ignis:We can ascertain Materia's safety afterward. For now, let us hurry on."
Noct:Why are you hiding things?
Zack:I don't want to say that I was satisfied...
Zack:Maybe I could have done more... There were things I wanted to do with the others...
"Zack:No. There's no wise way to accept this. But, at the very least..."
"Zack:At the very least, I need to pretend..."
Zack:For their sake.
Zack:What's up?
Cloud:It seems like you've remembered.
Zack:I'll be fine. Just worry about yourself.
Cloud:Even so... My own memories are fuzzy and uncertain...
"Cloud:And just by being here together now, I might be putting you through something terrible."
"Cloud:Usually this is the part where I say, ""I don't care,"" but..."
Cloud:I want to help.
Cloud:I can't just let you carry this burden alone.
"Cloud:...We're friends, right?"
"Cloud:Are the fake memories causing these feelings, too?"
"Zack:No, that's not it."
Cloud:Don't laugh.
Zack:I'm laughing because I'm happy. You're doing good.
Zack:I see... So that's what it felt like.
Cloud:Who are you talking about?
"Zack:Right. Feelings of happiness. Regret, sadness...dreams."
Zack:They're all still here. As a part of me.
Zack:I made up my mind. I won't look back!
"Zack:I'll live, here and now. With you, and Aerith..."
Zack:...Shoot. I'm showing off again.
Cloud:...It's good to see you cheering up.
Zack:It's good to feel this way!
"Zack:...Thank you, Cloud."
Vayne:You made it.
Ashe:Vayne! Have you been waiting here for us!?
Ignis:We have some information on the one who sought to eliminate Materia.
Vayne:I have learned some on my own as well.
Vayne:Incapacitating one of the gods will cause this world to become unstable.
Ashe:Are you colluding with him!?
Cloud:Calm down. You need to keep a clear mind.
Vayne:The goddess Materia has died.
Vayne:To put it more precisely... She was expelled from her seat of power by Sephiroth.
Vayne:The reason this world still persists is because of Spiritus's power and...
"Vayne:The powerful will of you, Materia's warriors."
Zack:So that's why Sephiroth is controlling the puppets...
Zack:And tried to confuse our friend.
Cloud:So we defeat Sephiroth and find Materia. I don't want to live in a world ruled by Sephiroth.
"Vayne:That is a proper solution. Materia is incompetent, but moderate."
Vayne:Sephiroth is trying to use this world for his own purposes.
Zack:He's not someone I'd want in charge.
Vayne:The only question is whether you have the power to defeat him.
"Vayne:Especially you, Noctis Lucis Caelum."
Vayne:You lack the resolution to be a king. Do you have the will to protect?
"Vayne:Trying to protect him, I see. It seems you just can't let go as a caregiver."
Ignis:Noct's memories should be of no concern to you.
Ignis:And we can prove it to you.
Ashe:That he has the strength of will even without his memories?
"Cloud:If that's the case, this should be quick."
"Noct:I don't get it, but I'm pissed off."
Zack:That's the spirit! Let's do this!
Vayne:Now then... Show me what you're capable of.
"Vayne:In this tepid world, can you show a will befitting a king?"
Noct:Does it matter?
Ignis:Noct will be fine.
Vayne:How can you be so sure?
Ignis:We will prove it to you.
Vayne:This is my loss.
Noct:Come on. I could do this all day.
Vayne:...No. This is enough.
Vayne:I wish I were as fortunate as you when it came to comrades.
Ignis:So you understand how strong he is.
"Warrior of Light:Even without his memories, his will is full of light."
Balthier:And? Are you satisfied now?
"Vayne:Next, you must dethrone Sephiroth."
Ignis:You speak as though you're one of us.
Vayne:I thought I had explained our...agreement before.
"Vayne:Furthermore, I doubt he will be as easily defeated as I was."
Noct:You really know how to tick me off. I understand how Vaan feels now.
Vayne:It was a compliment. Be proud of what you've accomplished.
"Cloud:Sephiroth is ahead. You knew and tried to get in our way, didn't you?"
Vayne:But now our objectives are one in the same.
"Vayne:Should you need my aid in the battle, you know how to summon me."
Balthier:He's gone... Now what?
"Warrior of Light:We proceed and have faith in the words of our comrades. Isn't that right, Zack?"
"Zack:Yeah! If Cloud says it, I'm sure it's right!"
Cloud:...That way.
Noct:Ignis.
Ignis:I know you have something you wish to say to me.
"Ignis:I made the decision to withhold information and did not speak to you, putting other comrades first. From where should I apologize?"
Noct:It's not about that!
"Prompto:Easy there, Noct... We're not here to fight."
"Noct:I know, but... Ugh!"
Ignis:I apologize for the confusion.
Noct:Don't apologize!
"Prompto:Hey, Ignis. I'm sure you know things about our future that we don't."
"Prompto:Is it because they're too painful for the present ""us"" to understand that you haven't told us?"
Noct:Are we really that...weak?
Ignis:No. You've got it all wrong.
Ignis:I know that you'll be fine. It's just...
Ignis:You two...
"Ignis:Noct, you..."
Ignis:You're enjoying your journey here.
Ignis:And to me that...
Ignis:Makes me happy.
Noct:Are you serious?
"Prompto:Really, Ignis?"
Ignis:I'm currently not prepared to tell you the truth.
Ignis:Please give me time.
Noct:...Guess we don't have much of a choice.
Prompto:You're definitely different from the Ignis we know.
"Noct:We'll just have to wait, I guess."
Noct:No. I think I'll take back my memories before then.
Prompto:Same here. It's not the time to be enjoying some grand adventure in another world!
Ignis:I never said not to enjoy this world.
Noct:I know. We're just preparing for when that time comes.
"Prompto:I'm a bit anxious about it, but...at least we have Ignis, and he knows the future."
Noct:It's definitely good to have you around.
Ignis:Yes... And I don't plan on going anywhere anytime soon.
Cloud:That's...!
Zack:I'm going in. Are you sure you're okay with this?
"Noct:I don't care, even if it is a trap."
Cloud:You really did expel Materia...
Sephiroth:I am God.
"Sephiroth:I wasn't chosen by someone. No, I chose this world."
Zack:What are you talking about? I knew it... You're nothing more than a monster.
Sephiroth:Heh... The monster is you.
"Zack:...Even so, I won't lose my way. I've still got my dreams and honor!"
Zack:Don't try to push your logic on me!
"Sephiroth:How do you feel, knowing your fate?"
Zack:Enough talk. I won't let you take anything else away from us!
"Zack:My dreams, future, and friends... I'll protect them all!"
Sephiroth:What a pitiful man you are. You've already lost everything.
Ignis:A memory?
Sephiroth:A grounds for yearning. A guide back to a bygone past.
Sephiroth:Where time is stopped and dreams will never come true.
Sephiroth:Do you feel resentment? Did you think you could settle your unfinished business in this land of respite?
"Zack:Cloud! Let's bring this guy down, together!"
"Zack:Listen up, Sephiroth!"
Zack:I'm nobody's replacement. I have my own dreams.
Zack:My dreaming heart is right here.
Zack:That's my only reason for fighting.
Sephiroth:A bold front.
"Zack:Just try me, and you'll see!"
Noct:We'll help.
"Noct:Right, Ignis?"
Ignis:But of course.
Zack:Let's go!
Cloud:Do you know what it means to kill a god!?
Sephiroth:You're still nothing but a puppet. You have no will without someone to pull your strings.
Zack:Enough talk!
Zack:You're nothing but a monster with the face of my friend!
Sephiroth:I'm not so sure about that.
Sephiroth:Ha ha ha...
Zack:What's so funny!?
"Sephiroth:Without a god here, this world will crumble."
Sephiroth:Do you see what's coming from over there?
Noct:Now!?
"Sephiroth:Even now, this world is being eroded. Without its gods, it cannot persist."
"Mog:Wait, kupo! Fighting here is dangerous!"
"Ignis:If we lose, this world will be consumed, and if we win, his place on the throne will only be the firmer."
Cloud:Sephiroth wins either way.
"Ignis:One way or another, a change of scenery is in order."
Zack:Isn't there anything you can do!?
Zack:Guide us to a place connected to our wills!
Zack:Let's settle this!
Sephiroth:You are nothing but cowardly blight on this world.
Sephiroth:I have no need for you aboard Mother's vessel to a new planet...!
Zack:Your mother's vessel...
Zack:You don't hold anything dear. You're no hero!
Cloud:We won't let you get away with this!
Sephiroth:You bore me.
Sephiroth:You will all die here.
Sephiroth:Who dares interrupt me?
Ignis:So this is the other god.
Noct:Aren't we enemies?
Zack:Why did you come here?
Spiritus:To settle this. I cannot overlook your recklessness now.
Spiritus:The fallen hero will be thrown into the rift between space and time.
Sephiroth:Hahaha...
Cloud:What are you laughing at now?
Sephiroth:Don't you understand? The one on the gods' throne can seal away warriors.
Sephiroth:But this world no longer belongs to the gods. The empty throne has no power over me.
Zack:Running away!?
Noct:Calm down.
Ignis:You'll be caught in the seal.
Spiritus:He got away. This place is fine...
Noct:Far from it.
Spiritus:The throne cannot be left empty.
"Spiritus:Yes, but barely..."
Zack:Was Sephiroth able to defeat her because we didn't believe in her?
Spiritus:The authority of the gods should not be shaken so easily. Something is happening to this world.
"Spiritus:While I search for the origin, you must restore Materia to her throne."
Zack:Is she breathing?
Materia:You are all...safe...
"Lightning:I wanted to get back at her for what she's done, but...not like this."
Lightning:How did this happen?
Materia:I'm so sorry...
Zack:Apologies won't help us now. We need to know what happened.
Warrior of Light:Your position wasn't meant to be so easily shaken by us.
Materia:Indeed. But reality is different.
"Materia:When you lost faith in me, I felt my power weakening."
Materia:The wish that desired this world rendered me impotent.
Noct:But you made this world.
Materia:The ones who made the world and its laws was us.
Materia:But the one who wished for its creation was neither Spiritus nor myself.
"Materia:It was the crystal's desire, and the ones we summoned."
Materia:But I was unable to fulfill that wish and my duty...
"Lightning:Do you understand that the ""respite"" you tried to force on us was a mistake?"
"Materia:...I didn't understand. even now, I still don't."
Materia:I merely govern the physical laws.
"Materia:Even if I know that a human body needs rest, I don't understand how to rest one's spirit."
"Materia:But even though I don't understand, I cannot leave my throne."
Ignis:Like a king's throne. It is a predetermined position.
Materia:Perhaps that is true in your world.
Warrior of Light:You should have left it to us. We could have talked it out.
Noct:I suppose you just didn't get around to that.
Lightning:Why didn't you resist your fate?
Ignis:There must have been some reason behind it.
"Materia:No, it's as you said. I probably should have resisted."
Materia:Perhaps I should have said something.
Materia:Even if your respite was hollow and fake...
Materia:I felt...happy.
Materia:Seeing you laugh and deepen your friendships made me...happy.
Materia:That is all I can say.
Noct:Now what?
Warrior of Light:We cannot leave the throne empty. Can you stay here and be our strength?
Materia:Is that acceptable to you?
Zack:We can't just abandon you now. Let's talk again after you've rested up.
Ignis:This world's danger affects us all. We must face it together.
"Materia:Thank you, my warriors. Let us meet again."
Noct:Why is that guy only trying to get close to Ignis?
Squall:You mean Vayne?
Ignis:He was the first person I met upon arriving here.
"Prompto:Even before us, huh."
"Rinoa:Until now, our friends who had their memories intact have shown up near us."
Ignis:I think that was Materia's intention when she sent me on my way.
"Balthier:But she was weak, wasn't she? Perhaps she misjudged the distance."
Noct:And that alone created the pretext for another fight...
Squall:Did he do something you didn't like?
Balthier:He said so himself that he wished to have been as fortunate in his comrades.
"Balthier:If Vayne returns to our world, he will be a candidate for the next emperor. He was in a dispute with his siblings over the right to succession."
"Ignis:Yes, he did mention something like that."
Balthier:His path up until then is stained with blood. That empire has always been that way.
Prompto:Totally different from Noct!
"Noct:Not now, man."
Squall:I suppose he might be jealous of your friends.
"Balthier:That might be the truth, however hard it is to believe. At the very least, it seems you and he have no common ground."
Prompto:No way! I wouldn't want to be close to someone surrounded by conspiracies like that.
Ignis:Quarrels are merely something that follow royalty around.
Ignis:Though most should be easily avoidable.
Rinoa:Hmm... To that guy...
Rinoa:Noct must seem so happy.
"Rinoa:I guess that's what might make him jealous, like Squall said."
Rinoa:Noct is surrounded by reliable friends who laugh and smile with him.
"Noct:I don't get it, but isn't it normal to be happy to have good friends?"
Prompto:It must be tough being him...
Ignis:An arbitrary and false accusation.
Balthier:Indeed. Our worlds are governed by different principles. It's not a problem worth meddling in.
"Locke:I thought the gods were making fools of us, but seeing them like that is...sad."
Ignis:Even the gods cannot choose their fate.
"Warrior of Light:Being chosen by the crystal, or being born royalty..."
Warrior of Light:It must be frustrating having to accept that fate. It was a mistake turning our anger on Materia.
Zack:Maybe the story's gotten too confusing. We should tell Materia...
Zack:Tell her what we're thinking and how she can help.
"Lightning:I might not like it, but she's our ally now. We just have to accept that."
Warrior of Light:We need to work together to rid this world of danger.
Spiritus:What's this...?
Spiritus:The crystal core of darkness's power is growing...
Spiritus:The balance of light and dark is crumbling. Someone is giving it limitless power...
Spiritus:Is it losing control?
???:So the gods don't understand after all. I am fighting my fate.
???:Making light of the will of humans... You will regret making this world.
"???:I will draw in the darkness and destroy the kings, gods, and world."
Dark Manikin (Bartz):I see... With this...
"Faris:Bartz! Hey, hang in there!"
Galuf:How terrible...
Krile:Wake up!
"Lenna:Please, get up, Bartz!"
Galuf:This reckless fool...!
Spiritus:Rectify the distortions in this world as one of my soldiers.
Leo:I am grateful for your trust and the arrangement. However...
Leo:Allow me to think about the command you have given.
"Leo:There appears to be an order to this world, as there is within me."
"Leo:Though I have lost my life once... No, because I have..."
Leo:I must ensure I use this one wisely.
Spiritus:Very well... You may have the freedom to do so for a while.
Spiritus:Descend to the land of respite and discern for yourself what you must do.
Leo:Why did he choose me...?
Gilgamesh:Ho? A new face?
Leo:You there! Are you some sort of monster!?
Gilgamesh:Well that's not very nice! Though I can see where you're coming from...
Gilgamesh:I am Gilgamesh! A warrior of humanity and justice! I merely wish to talk to you.
Leo:A warrior?
Leo:Are monsters capable of masquerading as warriors in this world...?
Gilgamesh:Never you mind that! The ways of this world take some getting used to.
"Gilgamesh:Were you summoned by Spiritus or Materia? Depending on which, I may be able to lend a hand!"
"Leo:So I take it you were also summoned by a god, sir?"
Gilgamesh:There's no need for pleasantries. Just call me Gilgamesh.
Gilgamesh:So what happened?
Leo:...I find that difficult to determine.
"Leo:It might be hard for you to understand, Sir Gilgamesh, as we've just met, but..."
Leo:I was once slain in battle.
Gilgamesh:Ha ha! So you're one of those.
Leo:What do you mean?
Gilgamesh:There're plenty more what have stories like that in this world!
Gilgamesh:What selfish gods.
Leo:I heard what happened in my world.
Leo:...And those I knew stopped his evil ambitions.
"Gilgamesh:It doesn't seem real if you weren't there, does it? I know how you feel!"
"Leo:Have you been in this world long, Sir Gilgamesh?"
"Gilgamesh:I think I arrived quite early on, wandering between the dimensions."
"Gilgamesh:Say! If you don't know where you're going, why don't you come with me?"
"Gilgamesh:There are monsters roaming everywhere, so there's safety in numbers."
Leo:You have my gratitude.
Gilgamesh:Sweat it not! A journey needs a companion as the world needs compassion! It ain't in me to look the other way if someone's in a bind.
Gilgamesh:Uh-oh...
Gilgamesh:Where did Little Leo go...?
Mog:Kupo! The coordinates are right here...kupo!?
Bartz:Seriously? It's just Gilgamesh.
"Gilgamesh:What do you mean, just me!? I set off these coordinates on purpose!"
Gilgamesh:You sure took your time getting here! I was starting to get worried!
Lulu:I suppose you aren't the only one who's disappointed. We thought we would find a new comrade...
"Mog:Yeah, kupo!"
"Terra:Mog was sure someone was here, which is why we came down."
Celes:Did you send out a strong signal to lure us in?
Gilgamesh:How rude! I wasn't trying to lure you in! I called you on purpose!
"Gilgamesh:I made a new friend named Little Leo, but we got separated."
Gilgamesh:He isn't used to this world and seemed to have a lot on his mind...
Gilgamesh:But I can't find him on my own here because...of reasons! Please help me!
Gilgamesh:Yes! He said he was from the same world as you ladies!
Celes:You mean General Leo!?
"Gilgamesh:Oho! A colleague, I see!"
Lulu:A friend of yours?
"Terra:No, but...he wasn't a bad person."
"Celes:Before he could achieve his goal, Kefka..."
"Gilgamesh:He knew about that, too! Spiritus told him all about it."
"Gilgamesh:But unlike Spiritus's other warriors, he doesn't seem out to avenge himself."
Gilgamesh:He wanted to know more about this world and those he's fighting.
Celes:That sounds like him alright.
Terra:General Leo... I wish I could have learned more from him.
"Bartz:I'd love to meet the guy. He should be around here somewhere, right?"
Lulu:Are we really going to look for him? Won't that be going out of our way?
"Mog:That's true, kupo..."
"Mog:But if this is where one of Spiritus's warriors landed, then there's got to be a reason."
"Celes:General Leo's got a good head on his shoulders, but he's still an imperial general at the end of the day."
Celes:His honest personality may or may not be being used by someone.
Bartz:Then let's go find Gilgamesh's friend.
Gilgamesh:I am in your debt!
Leo:Hmmm... Where did Sir Gilgamesh go?
"Leo:Well, I suppose this too is destiny."
Leo:They were all such fine soldiers.
Leo:But I was summoned back to the empire at that time...
Leo:Kefka acted selfishly and disobeyed the emperor.
Leo:Without an empire or a people to protect...what do I do?
Leo:For what purpose am I living this life...?
Cyan:So even General Leo has come to this world...
Cyan:But he does not know what befell our world. His devotion to the empire should still be intact.
Ashe:Your homeland... Have you two fought before?
Sabin:Yeah. Cyan's hometown was in a desert like this one.
Ashe:It sounds like you lost to the empire...
Sabin:I think General Leo is someone who can discern right from wrong.
Sabin:But the result was tragic... Not even townspeople or children escaped.
Sabin:What do you think?
Shadow:Cyan's home fell while Leo was back in his own country.
"Shadow:What do you intend to do, Cyan?"
"Lenna:If we leave him alone, I fear he will be manipulated by some ill-willed warrior."
"Ashe:That said, though, whether or not we journey together depends on Cyan..."
"Onion Knight:According to Gilgamesh, he's one of Spiritus's soldiers, right?"
"Onion Knight:If we can reason with him, maybe we should keep him on our side."
Lenna:Of course... But my heart does hurt at the thought...
"Onion Knight:Seifer wasn't told anything, Jecht isn't aware of the details, and Kain was called at an early time."
"Onion Knight:This General Leo knows what Spiritus is thinking now, which makes him very rare."
Cyan:We needn't stop out of consideration for me.
"Cyan:Facing an old enemy again is some sort of fate, I am certain."
Sabin:We can think about it more after we meet him. But we gotta find him first!
Cyan:Indeed. The time I spent with that general was short.
Cyan:Perhaps in this world we share a righteous heart.
"Sazh:So how did you meet General Leo, Gilgamesh?"
Gilgamesh:Oho! The million-gil question!
Edgar:Was our lone wolf yearning for some company after wandering the dimensions for so long?
Gilgamesh:You got it all wrong! My elite warrior senses picked up a troubled will!
Gilgamesh:Listen to this. When we were in the space between dimensions...
Leo:I see... So even you have served as a general.
Gilgamesh:And not just any general!
Gilgamesh:I served a warlock who would've sacrificed anything for power!
Gilgamesh:Anyway... A lot of things happened and I asked to be dismissed from duty.
Leo:So you could no longer support your liege?
"Leo:I suppose that makes us both traitors, then."
Gilgamesh:You didn't betray anyone! That was just Kefka's usual nonsense!
Leo:But the emperor didn't know the truth...and I remain a powerless traitor.
"Leo:I never thought of severing my ties like you did, Sir Gilgamesh."
"Leo:I couldn't make the right call, and now I'm left with nothing but regrets."
"Gilgamesh:Hey, hey! You can't let your thoughts stray into darkness! In this world, those feelings can turn into a terrifying power."
"Gilgamesh:You'll get swept away by your emotions and fall under someone's control, and that'll be it."
"Leo:Why do you continue your journey here, Sir Gilgamesh?"
Gilgamesh:I've always been a wanderer of dimensions.
"Gilgamesh:Staying in one place cramps my style, and I lend Bartz and his friends a hand once in a while."
"Leo:I have no country or people to serve, and I know that I must determine my path on my own."
"Leo:But for some reason, I just can't bring myself to serve the god of another world."
Gilgamesh:Did Spiritus tell you to obey him?
Gilgamesh:That's weird... Spiritus has never told his warriors what to do.
"Leo:I don't quite understand the situation, but it seemed urgent."
"Leo:I know I must obey orders, but..."
"Gilgamesh:You don't need to worry about a thing, Little Leo, because you'll have me around! Ha ha!"
"Leo:Thank you, Sir Gilgamesh. ...But please don't call me ""Little Leo"" anymore."
Gilgamesh:Request denied! Ha ha ha!
Edgar:So General Leo was given an order from Spiritus...
Edgar:Interfering directly with the world... I suppose even that god has found himself between a rock and a hard place.
"Sazh:He's more likely to listen to orders than someone like Kefka, that's for sure."
Bartz:And that's how you two became friends?
Gilgamesh:That's right!
Gilgamesh:What happened in his home world doesn't affect me. That's the great part of being a wanderer!
"Edgar:Gilgamesh's friendships aside, I'm curious what that general and Spiritus are up to."
Gilgamesh:Don't you dare put my new friend aside!
"Bartz:Easy there, Gilgamesh. We're going to go find him now."
"Gilgamesh:I knew you wouldn't let me down, Bartz!"
Terra:General Leo!
Leo:That voice... Could it be?
Gilgamesh:You're alright! Hoorah!
"Edgar:You can call me a ""Returner"" if that's easier for you."
Celes:Edgar! Not now
"Leo:Ah, my apologies. For me..."
Leo:You are still the King of Figaro. As Celes is still a general.
Terra:I remember. You were betrayed by Kefka.
Terra:You didn't do anything wrong. We can join forces now.
Leo:Terra... You've changed. Did this happen in the future unknown to me?
"Papalymo:""The future..."" Spiritus can be cruel."
"Edgar:General. I have no doubt of your loyalty, so I don't want to coerce you."
Edgar:But we would hate for someone with a will as strong and forthright as yours to be taken advantage of.
Edgar:So I want to ask you: Did Spiritus ask you to stop us?
Leo:No... But I was thinking it was quite heavy a task to bear alone.
Leo:To fight to protect this world would require some like-minded comrades.
Terra:That's perfect!
Papalymo:It's not that simple. He has no place to return to.
Papalymo:Time has stopped in this land of respite. There's no reason for those without a future to try and save it.
"Papalymo:You saw what happened to the others who despised the world they came from, didn't you?"
Leo:It is as he says.
Leo:I have no intention of clinging to my life for the greater good. I do not want to cause anything out of anger or hatred.
Leo:But without the empire or its people...I have no reason to fight.
Leo:I am simply lost...for the first time in my life.
Celes:I'm sorry I couldn't do anything for you.
"Leo:You've changed, General Celes."
Leo:There is something I want to ask you.
Leo:Is it worth protecting both this world and the one you come from?
"Gilgamesh:Good grief, Little Leo! What are you doing!?"
"Leo:You taught me that the stronger someone's will, the greater their power, Sir Gilgamesh."
Leo:The Terra I knew was an emotionless young woman who had lost her will.
Leo:I would like to join hands with her and her friends.
"Leo:If that power is true, I will believe that she regained her humanity."
Terra:Then I'll show you what my will is capable of.
Edgar:As expected of the great General Leo. Then we won't hold back.
Leo:You have my gratitude...King of Figaro.
Leo:Why do you fight?
"Celes:There are people I love, and I want to protect their world!"
Terra:I want to save those precious to me from my home!
Leo:That love... I see. It is as I thought...
"Leo:You knew, didn't you, Terra...? In that case, show me that power!"
"Leo:...You've grown strong, Terra."
"Leo:I can't say the same for myself, however. A wandering will makes for a weak warrior in this world."
Barret:Of course it does! Tch. What a pathetic reason for fighting...
Locke:I remember you beat Kefka once. But it doesn't seem you're as strong as you were then.
"Leo:I wielded my sword for my country. In a world without the empire, it's useless."
Sabin:I understand where your loyalty comes from. You really believed in Gestahl...
"Sabin:But you were also worried about your troops. You treated them as individual people, didn't you?"
Leo:I fought for the sake of peace...
"Leo:I believed that if the empire ruled everything, peace would come."
"Leo:But I was wrong, wasn't I? The empire..."
Sabin:Nobody's blaming you!
Leo:I can't yet bring myself to think that way.
Leo:Please... Give me more time.
"Gilgamesh:H-hey, Little Leo! Wait for me!"
Barret:Is he gonna be okay? He's pretty indecisive for a soldier.
"Bartz:I never thought I'd say this, but...Gilgamesh is with him, so he'll be fine."
Bartz:What worries me is...
Locke:Why they're in this area.
"Locke:We don't yet know the mission Spiritus gave him, but..."
Locke:That god's not stupid enough to just release a warrior like this without reason.
Barret:I'm sure there's a reason he's here.
Sabin:Barret's right. I don't think there's any harm in looking a little while longer.
Bartz:I feel something... It's like the wind is calling...
"Barret:Did you say somethin', Bartz?"
"Bartz:It's nothing. C'mon, let's go after them."
Gau:Thou...okay?
"Cyan:My apologies, Sir Gau, I did not mean to make thou worry..."
"Gau:Thou, Thou! Cheer up!"
"Ashe:But he's an enemy from your homeland, is he not? Allying with someone like that is..."
"Lyse:When you fought, you gripped your weapon with strength. I know how you feel, Cyan."
Cyan:I suppose it is pointless trying to hide it... General Leo's siege was not short.
Agrias:I heard he was a great commander. His swordsmanship was quite magnificent to behold.
Agrias:But you must have seen him as an enemy who stole the lives of countless countrymen.
"Sabin:Do you remember, Cyan?"
"Sabin:After the world fell to ruin, you sympathized with the lover of an imperial soldier..."
"Cyan:""We humans tend to allow the past to destroy our lives."""
Cyan:...Yes. I wrote a letter.
Gau:Thou! You kind! You good person!
Cyan:Everyone has someone precious to them... Even those from the empire.
Cyan:It is enough that war divides people into friends and foes.
Agrias:We are not at war here...for now.
Ashe:We allow the past...to destroy our lives...
"Cyan:We cannot let history repeat itself, much less in this world."
Gau:Thou right! But Gau worry. Thou face in pain...
"Cyan:I am a soldier of Doma, Sir Gau."
"Cyan:If I swing my blade with hatred, it will not strike true."
Cyan:We must go forward.
"Lyse:...You're so strong, Cyan. All soldiers of Doma are amazing."
"Lyse:But please don't push yourself, Cyan. You don't need to bear all this alone."
"Lyse:Everyone helped mewhen I was trying to take back my memories, and I want to repay that debt."
"Sabin:She's right. Don't overdo it, Cyan."
"Galuf:You can stick to your beliefs, regardless of your reservations."
Cyan:Thank you...everyone.
Leo:I understand why His Majesty did what he did.
"Leo:His experiments on Kefka and General Celes, his controlling of Terra, and everyone's thirst for power..."
Leo:I should have admonished him. And yet...
Gilgamesh:Loyalty is too hard to just throw away.
"Leo:Yes. Emotions can be such a burden. I could never be like you, Sir Gilgamesh."
Gilgamesh:You can't just force yourself to become friends with your enemies. You have to decide how you want to live on your own.
"Gilgamesh:I know a few people who sat in pretty high places back in their home worlds. I can introduce you, if you want."
Leo:I appreciate the consideration.
Leo:But I can't just swear my allegiance to any country.
"Leo:If it's not the Empire of Gestahl, then it's meaningless. It's my home. My life."
"Gilgamesh:It might be I'm missing the mark again, but..."
"Gilgamesh:The country you're trying to protect is your home, right?"
"Gilgamesh:The place you were raised, the rivers that flowed, the sound of the wind, the heat of the hearth...and the people there."
"Gilgamesh:You became strong in order to protect those things, right?"
"Leo:My home... Yes. The people, places, and nature there..."
Leo:I became a general to protect those things.
Gilgamesh:You can still protect it from afar. I know someone who did that.
"Gilgamesh:But he didn't do it alone. Just like you now, Little Leo."
Gilgamesh:So that's why...
Gilgamesh:You shouldn't feel like you have to do this on your own!
Leo:Sir Gilgamesh... I see.
"Leo:There are still those living in the place I called ""home""..."
Leo:I want to do what I can here to protect those people and that place.
Gilgamesh:What are you going to do? Meet Spiritus's other warriors?
"Gilgamesh:There are some real weirdos on that team, but they're not all bad eggs."
Leo:No. I want to face Terra and the others once more.
"Leo:Cyan, a warrior of Doma, is with them..."
Leo:To atone for what I did...I know where I must be.
Gilgamesh:Huzzah! Then let's get a move on!
Exdeath:Gilgamesh... That bungling fool.
Exdeath:Befriending Materia's warriors!?
Exdeath:No matter. I have a powerful will in my hands.
Exdeath:The one who forced this sadness onto you is rejoicing in his freedom out there.
Exdeath:Bring down your original and retrieve your lost memories.
Dark Manikin (Bartz):Alone... Lonely...
"Cyan:Have you made up your mind, General Leo?"
Leo:There is nothing I can do alone. I need allies.
Terra:Does that mean...?
Leo:There are others in this world possessing strong wills.
"Leo:One ruling of a country, another living for his home, and even one who governs natural providence... Becoming allies with them is also an option."
"Faris:If you find our power lacking, you're free to cozy up to those sea dogs."
"Leo:Terra and warriors from other worlds... Once again, I ask you to show me your power."
Leo:To reaffirm my own will!
Bartz:We'll take you on anytime!
Gilgamesh:That's the spirit! I'll be on Little Leo's side this time.
Gilgamesh:It wouldn't be a fair fight otherwise!
"Bartz:Your math is a bit off, but have it your way."
Bartz:We won't hold back!
"Cyan:Allow me to test thy will for myself, General."
"Leo:You have my gratitude, Sir Cyan."
"Leo:Let's finish this, here and now. You can have your revenge!"
Cyan:Nay! Our enemy is within us.
"Cyan:Nothing is born out of our ill feelings, yet we cannot abandon our convictions."
Cyan:I will overcome without throwing away those memories!
Leo:A spectacular resolve... I expected no less of you. Now come!
"Leo:The last time we fought, my power wasn't at its fullest."
"Leo:By strengthening my will, I can fight you as equals."
Gilgamesh:Little Leo's made up his mind and I'm going to help him see it through!
"Leo:I stand before you not as a general, but as a warrior... Now, come!"
Terra:Did that help?
Leo:I'm not sure. But I have gained the resolve to fight.
Leo:I would like to travel with you and fulfill my mission.
Edgar:Then let me ask you again: What exactly is the mission Spiritus gave to you?
"Gilgamesh:Wait, before that!"
Gilgamesh:Hear me out! There's a reason I have to cut in now!
Krile:Because you can't wait your turn?
"Gilgamesh:No, no, no! This is important! I need your power!"
Bartz:Alright. We'll listen to what you have to say. You never show up without a reason anyway.
"Gilgamesh:Don't you feel something around here, Kupo Kupo?"
"Mog:Kupo? Hmm... Let me see, kupo..."
"Mog:Kupo!? He's right! I sense brilliance, kupo!"
"Mog:But I can't pinpoint it, kupo... I think someone's interfering."
Terra:Is it different from other places?
Gilgamesh:Yes. Exdeath is planning something up ahead.
Gilgamesh:And your manikins are fighting to stop him.
Krile:You mean our dark manikins?
Gilgamesh:Yes. But it's strange... Bartz's manikin was missing.
Exdeath:Mwa-hahaha... Is that all the puppets of the Crystal Core of Darkness can do?
"Dark Manikin (Galuf):You won't get away with this, Exdeath!"
"Exdeath:With those distorted memories, your wills are too weak to stop me."
Exdeath:It is a struggle just to maintain your form.
Dark Manikin (Lenna):Urgh... Sister...
Dark Manikin (Faris):Hang in there! Dammit... If only he were here...
Dark Manikin (Krile):Grandpa... I'm scared...
Dark Manikin (Galuf):We must hold fast until the warriors from the World of Light arrive...!
Exdeath:Impossible... Your inquisitive little friend is my pawn.
"Exdeath:By controlling him, I will be able to shatter the seal on these ruins."
Dark Manikin (Faris):Hold it!
Gilgamesh:Isn't that the spry old fellow and his friends!? This is bad!
Gilgamesh:...And that's what I was going to tell you when I ran into Little Leo here.
Leo:Spiritus asked me to stop his warriors from running rampant.
Edgar:Where are the dark manikins?
"Gilgamesh:After I saw them, I was roaming around the dimensions for a while, so... Where was that..."
Krile:That's the most important part! How could you forget?
Bartz:I'm sure...they're around here somewhere.
Edgar:We must trust our instincts.
Gilgamesh:You said it! Let's go!
Leo:So you're Bartz. I heard about you from Gilgamesh.
Bartz:Good grief... What did he say about me?
Leo:Only good things. He mentioned you were a curious traveler with a good heart and a warrior of light who saved his world.
Leo:He said you were a formidable warrior who makes quick work of monsters.
Bartz:...He sure can spin a story.
Leo:It means he has faith in you.
"Leo:When telling tales of other warriors, Sir Gilgamesh looks as happy as if they were his own heroic deeds."
Leo:He is without a doubt someone who is willing to give his life for you.
Bartz:Give his life...? Gilgamesh? For me?
Leo:It seems you are missing some of your memories.
Leo:I'm sure Sir Gilgamesh is happy that you are able to continue forward nevertheless.
Leo:How spectacular... I could never live my life that way.
"Leo:Traveling for the sake of one's world, even leaving the one your home is in..."
Bartz:Leaving...my home...
Bartz:I only started traveling...because it was my father's last wish.
Leo:...My apologies. I didn't mean to pry.
Leo:There is much I wish to learn from the other warriors.
Bartz:...Am I really that great?
Bartz:I was just drifting with the wind...
Bartz:No... There's something I'm forgetting. Something important...
Bartz:I remember my father was sick three years ago.
Bartz:But... What? ...That's right.
Bartz:The people I met in this world...
Bartz:It wasn't because I could see them again. No...
Dark Manikin (Bartz):...You were happy.
Bartz:Who's there!?
Dark Manikin (Bartz):The memories you left beyond the wind.
Bartz:Do you have my memories!?
Dark Manikin (Bartz):The goddess wanted the adventurous heart that resides in me.
Dark Manikin (Bartz):So memories of the journey's partings were just extra baggage.
Dark Manikin (Bartz):That's why I'm holding onto all of it. So you can smile.
Bartz:Give them to me.
"Dark Manikin (Bartz):I'm an emotionless puppet, an accumulation of all your sadness."
"Dark Manikin (Bartz):I'm just a shadow, so it doesn't bother me. I'll take it all."
Dark Manikin (Bartz):It doesn't bother me...at all...
"Bartz:If that's the case, then why..."
Bartz:Why are you crying?
Lenna:Bartz... Bartz!
Galuf:This reckless fool...!
Zidane:Hey! What's going on!?
"Faris:His body seems fine, but no matter how much we shake 'im, he won't wake up..."
Squall:What happened?
"Krile:We saw it from way over there, but...Bartz was talking to his dark manikin."
Bartz:...So it was you calling me.
Dark Manikin (Bartz):Did I...?
"Bartz:You were all alone, carrying my painful memories."
Dark Manikin (Bartz):Yeah... I was calling you...
"Dark Manikin (Bartz):Back home, far, far away...the flowers are blooming just like these..."
Dark Manikin (Bartz):But there was no one to see it with you. Neither Dad nor Mom...
"Dark Manikin (Bartz):You were called by the wind, and while on your quest..."
Dark Manikin (Bartz):The memories you left behind brought me pain...
Bartz:I made you bear that burden for a long time.
"Bartz:While on my journey, you were always..."
Dark Manikin (Bartz):I want to go home...
Bartz:...Don't make that face.
"Dark Manikin (Bartz):Parting, sadness, loneliness... It can drive you crazy."
Bartz:Then you can have it all.
"Bartz:Everything I remember. Courage, hope, compassion..."
Bartz:I'll give it all to you.
Dark Manikin (Bartz):I see... With this...
Dark Manikin (Bartz):...I have to go!
"Lenna:We could not hear what they were saying, but...it looks like Bartz gave him something."
"Galuf:Not only his memories, but his feelings... I feel they were taken by his dark manikin."
Zidane:So...he's empty?
"Faris:Don't be ridiculous. Hey, get up!"
Squall:(Seriously...?)
Squall:Why did you...?
Zidane:What happened to his dark manikin?
"Krile:He went off in a hurry, almost like he was running away..."
Zidane:Then let's go after him!
Lenna:But we can't just leave Bartz like this!
Squall:So he can move...
Galuf:We don't have any clues right now. We must do as Zidane says and follow that manikin.
Faris:...Can we get him back to the way he was?
Squall:Why ask me...? Still...I'm sure we can.
Zidane:We'll save him for sure.
Krile:Then let's go. We've gotta help Bartz!
Dark Manikin (Galuf):Warriors from the World of Light! You're here!
Galuf:Bartz isn't with you?
Dark Manikin (Lenna):He was captured by Exdeath...
Dark Manikin (Faris):He intends to use his feelings for his own ends.
Lenna:Feelings? But dark manikins...
Lenna:...I am so sorry.
Dark Manikin (Lenna):Do not worry. What you say is true.
Dark Manikin (Faris):Right. There are things we can shoulder simply because our emotions are so shallow.
Dark Manikin (Faris):But Bartz is a different story...
Faris:So do you guys have our memories?
Dark Manikin (Galuf):...Of course. That is why we were able to fight.
Dark Manikin (Galuf):The memories you lost came to us. They were full of such emotion.
Dark Manikin (Lenna):They gave us hollow manikins strength...as a momentary power of will.
Lenna:Memories full of emotion...
Lenna:Are those the ones Materia thought we were better off without?
"Faris:I had a feeling I was missing something, like there was a hole in my memories somewhere."
Galuf:...I knew. But I did not want to say anything.
"Galuf:However, if there are those pained by those memories...we must take it from you."
Dark Manikin (Faris):Who cares if they're painful? We got this far because of your memories.
Dark Manikin (Faris):You overcame your pain with the help of your family and friends. Those memories gave us strength.
Dark Manikin (Lenna):But Bartz...
Dark Manikin (Galuf):Something was wrong with him even before Exdeath appeared.
Dark Manikin (Galuf):Freedom and loneliness together are too much for dark manikins to bear...
Dark Manikin (Lenna):Exdeath intends to control our Bartz.
Dark Manikin (Lenna):We were fine. We had our friends with us. But I am not so sure about Bartz...
Faris:You guys are holding onto our painful memories... No.
"Faris:Our painful memories are the only ones you have, right?"
Dark Manikin (Faris):...Yes. Memories of...partings.
"Dark Manikin (Krile):We got this far because of your memories, but..."
"Galuf:You must return them to where they belong, yes?"
Dark Manikin (Krile):It must be so painful. After all...we can't always be
Galuf:Even the Krile from the World of Darkness has a stout heart.
Galuf:But...it's time.
Krile:I know... But it's a little scary.
Lenna:I can't look the other way... So please!
"Dark Manikin (Faris):""Mercy"" ain't in my dictionary."
Faris:You've got a lot of brass! I like it!
Krile:...I'm sure it's painful. But it's fine now.
"Krile:Because everyone is here, together."
Faris:Yes. We're not alone.
Lenna:And we can overcome anything together.
"Dark Manikin (Galuf):How promising... Now then, here I go!"
Dark Manikin (Galuf):Warriors of the World of Light... We leave the rest to you.
Lenna:Our lost memories...
Krile:...Grandpa.
"Galuf:What's the matter, Krile? I'm alive and well here!"
Galuf:We haven't the time to worry about me. We must rescue Bartz!
"Lenna:Y-yes, you are right. We must safeguard the world our manikins were protecting..."
Krile:You're right... I want to help Bartz.
Bartz:The wind...
Lenna:B-Bartz just...spoke!
Bartz:...is coming.
Galuf:Ruins are rising up...! Those are the ones from our world!
Cid:What's going on!? You folks still on the ground!?
Setzer:We have confirmed a mechanical structure in the sky. Are these ruins from your world?
Lenna:Yes... But they might be too high to reach in the airship.
Cid:Just what do you think mechanics are for!?
Setzer:Gilgamesh told us this might happen.
Setzer:So we made a few minor adjustments while you were fighting.
"Cid:There was nothin' ""minor"" about it, you jerk!"
Cid:We gave this thing a complete overhaul from stem to stern!
"Faris:Well done, lads!"
Setzer:What happened to all that boundless enthusiasm he usually has...?
Setzer:Let's see what we can do to help.
Sazh:Hey! We're ready to go when you are! All aboard!
"Lenna:No matter the circumstance or the world we come from, our allies are always here to help us."
"Krile:They're the best! C'mon, Bartz, let's go!"
Cecil:Bartz... What's on your mind?
"Firion:I wonder. If he lost everything, including his memories..."
Squall:Did you remember a way to get him back to his old self?
Galuf:It is not so easy. What we remembered were things from our home world.
"Krile:Bartz was always so positive, I thought he would be fine even on his own."
Squall:(I see... You're fine both on your own or with others.)
Galuf:But it's like Lenna and the others said. The harm to his home took a toll on him. He was just a young lad.
Zidane:He kept up a brave front. He didn't let us see any of that.
"Firion:I acted like I knew, but I never did. I'm sorry..."
Galuf:Perhaps even he forgot. One hardly pays any mind to growing nostalgia.
Cecil:What?
Krile:Bartz's dark manikin said he was lonely.
Krile:Maybe...you didn't hear it.
Firion:With all those memories of partings and loss...I wouldn't be surprised if his emotions took a turn for the worse.
Cecil:Perhaps he felt sympathy when told that by his dark manikin.
Squall:(I wonder.)
Squall:(Are you okay with people just imagining what's going on inside of you?)
Squall:(We won't know unless you tell us...)
Zidane:You're talking like that because you know he won't reply...right?
Squall:What did you say?
Zidane:I know what you're thinking without saying it.
Zidane:We were so reliant on his cheerfulness.
Cecil:He always encouraged us whenever we were lost or uncertain of our path.
"Cecil:Bartz... Perhaps you can't hear us, but..."
Cecil:We are here to help you. Would you let us be your strength this time?
Zidane:That's right. We're going to be the ones helping you out now!
"Squall:...You can do so without saying it, too."
Warrior of Light:Giant mechanical ruins floating in the sky... Is this Exdeath's doing?
Galuf:Yes. Our dark manikins saw him with their own eyes.
Galuf:I suppose Exdeath intends to summon something like the crystal and use the giant Torsion that opens up to gather power.
Leo:Why is he so obsessed with power?
"Galuf:He is the physical form of evil residing in a giant tree, the very incarnation of wickedness."
Warrior of Light:So he is a tree that wishes to absorb the nourishment of the earth to his heart's content...
Tidus:Meaning there's no logic to what he does.
Faris:Most likely not. I think that's why he captured Bartz's dark manikin.
"Faris:Complicated emotions can create a powerful will... You know that, don't you?"
Tidus:Is he different?
Galuf:In this world where complex memories can become our power...
Galuf:An existence filled with negative emotions may be even stronger than pure evil.
Leo:So that's why he took Bartz's dark manikin.
Tidus:But something's different.
Tidus:Galuf and the others' dark manikins were holding only painful memories.
Warrior of Light:Bartz's manikin should be the same. His will should have been strong enough...
"Warrior of Light:If they met once before, why didn't they fight?"
Faris:...Maybe he gave him his memories.
Galuf:Hmm... Why would he do something so absurd...?
Tidus:He's always so cheerful. Seeing him like this is throwing me off my game...
Warrior of Light:His light...is with his shadow. We must get to those ruins.
Steiner:I see... So that is why Sir Leo cannot use magic.
Leo:But I wished to protect my home with my own hands.
Ignis:It sounds like we will get along swimmingly.
Cecil:And you? Is there something that speaks to your loyalty as an advisor?
Ignis:...I cannot well express if that is what it's called.
Steiner:But losing your country and thus your resolve to fight must have been terrible!
"Leo:At first, I thought the same. But I later realized that my loyalty was really my love for the people of my home."
Leo:I would sacrifice anything for the people of my home.
"Cecil:A loyal man... I was estranged from my people, so I admit I'm a little envious."
Cecil:There was a time that my countrymen hated me because of a misunderstanding.
"Ignis:I think you are very loyal, Cecil."
Ignis:As for myself... I have memories of both the city I was raised in and the world I traveled...
"Ignis:But if Noct were not the king, I am uncertain I would have done the same things."
Cecil:Everyone has their own circumstances... There is a lot to be learned here.
Ramza:I wonder if I ever felt that toward someone...
"Agrias:Even if your memories were sound, thinking that way is pointless."
Agrias:A strategist's emotional attachment...
Agrias:And a general's compassion for people...
Agrias:Both are ideas you might have.
"Ramza:...Thank you for your kind words, Agrias."
"Ramza:Because of you, I can still believe in myself."
"Agrias:Even my memories are untrustworthy. For now, we need only accomplish our mission in this world."
Krile:Sniffle... Grandpa...
"Ignis:Is it painful, reclaiming your future?"
"Krile:Yeah... Once we finish our journey here, I won't be able to be with Grandpa anymore..."
Krile:I thought we would always be together... I don't want to be apart...!
"Krile:I want the world to be peaceful, but...then I'll be all alone..."
"Krile:...I'm sorry, Ignis. I didn't mean to..."
Ignis:Never you mind that. I understand well the pain of loss and solitude...
"Krile:I'm so happy I could see Grandpa again, but...I'm scared of saying goodbye."
Krile:But if I get sad and cry...Grandpa will laugh at me.
Krile:When I think about the bad guys from other worlds...I kind of understand how they feel.
Krile:I start to wonder if I could change what happened then...
Ignis:...I see.
"Ignis:If you could change it, that future would not have you in it, Krile."
Ignis:There would be people who missed you... Including your grandfather.
Krile:Even Grandpa...?
Ignis:You are together now. You ought to be searching with Galuf for the course you should follow.
Krile:...You're right. We are together now.
"Zack:Hey, Krile! Do you have any memories that might get a reaction out of Bartz?"
Zack:Everyone's trying to talk to him now.
Krile:Huh!? But there are so many...
Ignis:Everyone is worried about Bartz.
Krile:...Right. I need to help him.
"Krile:After all, he was a good friend to me when I was all alone!"
Zack:I've got a bad feeling about this...
"Zack:Hey, it's me, Zack! Cloud's here, too. Remember us?"
Cloud:Enough. He can't hear you.
Zack:We don't know for sure until we try!
"Zack:Even if he lost his memories of his home world, there's a chance he still remembers us."
Noel:You might be right.
"Noel:His heart might just be out on a stroll, looking for a reason to come back."
Ignis:Noct. What is Bartz's favorite dish?
Noct:How should I know?
Noct:Well... We went fishing together and ate that before.
Ignis:Fish... I'll give it a try.
"Cloud:...Are you really going to do that, even if it won't work?"
"Ignis:It's worth a try, especially since he's from a different world. There must be something we can do."
Zack:And it's not like I can just look the other way.
Noel:Agreed. I don't want to give up on the living.
Noct:He always acted so...free.
Noct:It doesn't feel right just leaving him like this.
"Ignis:It sounds like he embarked on a journey on his own. Nevertheless, he's a gentle person who won't turn down a friend."
Noel:I can see how he became a leader. I wish I could go on a journey like him.
Cloud:But now he's just a husk of who he used to be...
"Zack:See! Even you know this isn't right, Cloud! What should we do...?"
Cloud:...Everything we possibly can...for a friend.
"Squall:No response, as usual."
Lenna:But we've tried so many things...
Squall:(It brings back some bad memories...)
Squall:You weren't always like this...
Zidane:He's usually such a positive guy...which makes it that much harder to look at.
Leo:Bartz... I'm sorry for what I said that time. I was careless.
Leo:I didn't think it weighed so heavily on you that you would surrender your own heart...
Zidane:You talked to him before it happened? Did anything seem...different?
Leo:We were talking about leaving our hometowns.
Lenna:Usually Bartz doesn't talk about such things.
"Faris:He knew he couldn't returnhome, yet hewent to save a friend."
"Lenna:No matter how far he traveled, Bartz never forgot where he came from."
Squall:(It's like talking to a wall.)
Leo:...No doubt Galuf brought to mind the memories of his passed father.
Leo:His dark manikin is carrying all that sadness on his own. He may be stronger than even Bartz himself.
Squall:There's no way he'd lose...
Lenna:What do you mean?
"Squall:Even without his memories, Bartz is still Bartz."
"Squall:He must have had a reason, and temporarily entrusted his manikin with his memories."
"Zidane:I think so, too. His memories weren't taken by force. He gave them to his manikin."
Zidane:...Maybe he wanted to share the strength of overcoming that sadness with him.
Squall:(And still no response.)
Squall:And here I thought you would be the only one who wouldn't get so down like this...
Faris:Hear that? Folks from other worlds have faith in you.
"Zidane:You guys all know how reliable he is, right?"
Lenna:Of course. Everyone depends on him.
Lenna:But that's exactly why...I want to help him now. I want to be with him again.
"Zidane:So we're all in the same boat then! Leave it to us, Bartz!"
Dark Manikin (Bartz):...You're too late. The crystal's power is near.
Krile:Are you a servant of Exdeath now!?
"Dark Manikin (Bartz):He who saved the world but couldn't save himself is here... You all remember what happened, don't you?"
Lenna:...We do. We remember everything until the end of our journey.
Faris:So why are you doing this!?
"Dark Manikin (Bartz):No matter what you say, it's pointless now."
Dark Manikin (Bartz):A great power is about to be reborn from this Torsion...!
Dark Manikin (Bartz):...Just kidding.
Dark Manikin (Bartz):As if I would do something like this!
"Faris:Huh!? Bartz, have you come to your senses!?"
Lenna:You mean you weren't being controlled by Exdeath?
"Dark Manikin (Bartz):I was. He used the wounds in my heart to control me, but..."
Dark Manikin (Bartz):The real me...helped me remember how to overcome it.
Galuf:I see. He wanted to save you from sinking into despair...
Faris:So that's why he gave you everything he had...
Dark Manikin (Bartz):Well...it didn't go quite as planned. It looks like his heart went on a journey of its own...
"Dark Manikin (Bartz):I was borrowing it for a little while to stop Exdeath, but..."
"Dark Manikin (Bartz):Now that you're here, I can return his memories to where they belong."
Dark Manikin (Bartz):That's right. Fight me and remember who you are!
Bartz:......
"Dark Manikin (Bartz):You poor thing. Your friends are beside you, but you can't talk to them..."
Dark Manikin (Bartz):I'm not alone. I'm not sad anymore.
Dark Manikin (Bartz):So I'll give it all back to you. Thank you...me.
Dark Manikin (Bartz):My heart was so full... Thank you.
Bartz:Yaaawn... Why do I feel like I woke up from a long dream...?
Lenna:Bartz! You can speak again!
Bartz:Huh? What's everyone doing here? And are we...in some ruins?
Krile:Come on! Get it together!
"Faris:We were worried about you, matey!"
"Galuf:The same old Bartz... No, this Bartz has come back to us with all of his memories intact."
"Bartz:...Yes, I'm back. Sorry for all the trouble."
Galuf:Just what were you thinking doing something so reckless?
Galuf:What would have happened should your dark manikin use your memories for foul purposes?
"Bartz:I knew he wouldn't. He's me, after all."
"Bartz:And even if I was wrong, I knew you would all be there to stop him. It all worked out in the end, didn't it?"
Galuf:Is that really true?
Bartz:Of course it is!
"Bartz:Thank you, everyone, for giving me strength."
"Bartz:There are so many things I want to talk about, but first...we need to deal with these ruins."
Lenna:There's a big Torsion where the crystal should be.
Faris:Is this Exdeath's target?
"Exdeath:...Even without that puppet, my plan will not fail."
Exdeath:I will gain the power of the world released from this Torsion!
Exdeath:Shinryu! Come to me!
Galuf:Just how far are you willing to go for power?
"Exdeath:All power shall be mine, and I shall become the ultimate existence!"
Gilgamesh:Not on my watch!
Exdeath:Gilgamesh... So this was your doing after all.
Leo:Defying the god who summoned you and chasing after power... I cannot let this go unpunished!
"Exdeath:God? Mwa-haha... So they still have some strength, I see."
Bartz:What's so funny!?
Exdeath:The world abandoned the gods a long time ago.
Exdeath:The crystal core of darkness is under the control of a much stronger will.
Exdeath:What I seek is that power!
Terra:The crystal cores no longer belong to the gods...!?
Exdeath:You servants of the old gods are no longer necessary in this world...
Exdeath:Return to the Void!
Bartz:We won't give up!
Gilgamesh:That's right! Don't believe a word he says!
Gilgamesh:I believe in the will of people like Bartz and Little Leo!
"Bartz:Let's do this, everyone! For the future!"
"Exdeath:Anger, sadness, loneliness... You accepted all of it."
Bartz:Yes. I remembered what I lost.
Exdeath:Then why do you still refuse me?
"Exdeath:Kneel before the Void, where there is no sadness or hatred! Bow before its power!"
Bartz:There's no way you could understand. I won't let you turn my memories to nothing!
Lenna:The ruins are crumbling...!
Faris:Exdeath ran away like the yellow-bellied coward he is! We need to get out of here now!
Krile:Grandpa! Bartz! Come on!
Galuf:Yes? This is no time to be gloomy.
Bartz:I know.
"Bartz:I'm happy I could see you again here, alive."
Galuf:Ho ho! You needn't make a mountain of a molehill!
Galuf:But...I am happy to hear it.
Warrior of Light:Exdeath said this world is out of the gods' hands...
Leo:The mission Spiritus gave me was about that.
Leo:He said the crystal core of darkness was starting to lose control.
"Leo:He said it was on the verge of becoming something that bestows unlimited power on those with strong wills, regardless of good and evil."
Edgar:So Spiritus realized the gravity of the situation and appointed a general as one of his warriors to resolve the problem...
Onion Knight:The power of wills is law here.
"Onion Knight:If there is someone with a will stronger than the gods, then...the world obeys them."
Bartz:Exdeath said the same thing...
Warrior of Light:So this is even beyond Spiritus's control now...
Onion Knight:Calling on someone like General Leo may have been his way of saying he indirectly wanted to work with us.
Onion Knight:It sure would be great if he would only summon people like General Leo...
Edgar:There have been cases like that in the past. But the gods are not to be counted on.
Galuf:Just where is the crystal core of darkness now?
"Warrior of Light:With so many warriors shaping the world to their will, we can't be sure of its location."
Leo:Indeed. Spiritus told me he is searching for places of unusual activity.
"Bartz:Well, in that case, I guess we'll just let the wind decide where we go next!"
Onion Knight:How carefree... Still...
Warrior of Light:We are happy to have you back here safe. It seems like an even brighter light shines within you.
Bartz:Mm. I'm alright now. Thank you.
Bartz:Even though my heart wasn't here...I could hear your voices.
"Bartz:Not just my old friends, but everyone here."
Warrior of Light:Now let us all go forth together...as warriors of light.
Galuf:The crystal gave out four powers...
"Galuf:My ""hope"" was Krile."
Bartz:Now there are five of us. I hope that's alright.
Bartz:We've just got double the hope now!
"Galuf:Ho ho. With your memories back, you're even cheerier than ever!"
"Bartz:I told you, I'm happy."
Bartz:After talking to my dark manikin who was all alone...I remembered a lot of things.
Bartz:I didn't think I was lonely. It was my father's dying wish...
Bartz:But something happened and I wanted to lay my dad to rest next to my mom as soon as possible.
Galuf:You mean you may have gone home had you not met me?
"Bartz:I'm sure of it. After all, I only went after you and Lenna because of Boko..."
Galuf:It's nothing to fret about. You were traveling around that world we met in.
"Galuf:So even if we had parted, I'm sure our paths would have crossed again."
Bartz:I'm glad we journeyed together from the start.
"Galuf:I told you, no more gloomy words!"
"Bartz:When I told you not to die, I didn't mean to meet me in a place like this..."
"Bartz:Or at least that's what I thought. But being together again is great. When you came back, I was so relieved."
Galuf:...Is that so.
Galuf:The hope the crystal entrusted to us...is something we must achieve on our own.
"Galuf:Krile with her hope, me with my hope..."
Galuf:We will search this world together.
"Bartz:I'll go with you, no matter how far."
"Galuf:If you really feel that way, stop being so reckless from now on."
"Galuf:It's not just us who worry about you now, but people from other worlds."
Bartz:I wasn't being reckless. I believed in everyone...
"Galuf:You're a fool, Bartz. If you make your companions worry, that trust is meaningless!"
Bartz:...I know. I'll be more careful.
Galuf:What are you doing grinning there without a word? Lost your memories again?
"Bartz:It's just...when I think of being able to journey with you again, Galuf..."
Bartz:I feel so happy. And when I think about what lies ahead...
Bartz:I know that we can overcome anything.
"Galuf:...You really are a fool, Bartz."
"Galuf:It is not just me, but everyone who will help us overcome what lies ahead."
"Galuf:When we battled Exdeath here, you said you were fighting for everyone's future."
"Galuf:You were as reliable as ever. Even without your memories, you were still you."
"Galuf:And being there as one of your friends is something I am proud of. Next to my Krile, of course. Ho ho!"
Galuf:Let us overcome the battles ahead and protect the future with all of our comrades.
"Bartz:You're right. Thanks, Galuf."
Galuf:(Dorgann... Your son has become a man more reliable than most.)
"Bartz:What's the matter, Galuf?"
Galuf:Never you mind this old man. We have a journey ahead of us!
Ace:Where am I...?
Ace:You're that monster trying to destroy the world...aren't you?
"Cloud of Darkness:When the balance of light and dark is disrupted, we return the world to nothingness."
Ace:Is that...my dark manikin!?
Cloud of Darkness:Your will is incomplete. So we will give you what this puppet keeps.
Cloud of Darkness:The light and darkness of this world still hang in a dangerous balance...
Cloud of Darkness:But the world has already fallen into chaos and heads toward destruction.
Cloud of Darkness:The flood of darkness is near... So we bestow you with the power of will.
Ace:Why me...?
"Ace:Mother? Is she in this world, too?"
"Cloud of Darkness:That Mother has great power... As such, we cannot locate her."
Ace:So are you returning my memories because Mother told you about me?
Cloud of Darkness:We grant her wish with this powerful will.
Cloud of Darkness:The crystal core of darkness will bestow you with as much power as you wish.
Cloud of Darkness:Now take it!
Ace:These are...my memories...
Ace:Is that it...? Was that...the end?
Ace:...I see.
Ace:So that's why you're trying to make me use the power of my will...
"Cloud of Darkness:Will is law here. With it, one can create anything they desire."
"Ace:And if my wish comes true, then so does yoursunleashing a flood of darkness."
Cloud of Darkness:All is according to the will of humans. The choice is in your hands.
"Cloud of Darkness:If you will not use that power, we need only choose another."
Ace:...That won't be necessary.
"Ace:We have nowhere to return, no one to remember us."
Ace:That's why we'll live here... I'll create a home for us in this world!
Cloud of Darkness:Then go forth. The land of respite awaits you.
Ace:...I will decide my own fate.
Ace:I know the fear of death.
Ace:And now I choose...
Ace:To live in a world where I have a future.
Ace:That's right. This is my place of respite...
"Dark Manikin (Machina):Back again? You really like chocobos, don't you?"
Ace:Is that weird?
Dark Manikin (Machina):But you could be doing better things with your time than wasting it here.
Dark Manikin (Machina):Couldn't you think of something else to do?
Ace:This is fine. I don't want to make things worse.
Dark Manikin (Machina):Still... Don't you want to see the others?
Ace:Not right now. I want to be somewhere quiet.
"Chocobo:Kweh, kweh!"
Dark Manikin (Machina):Does this sound quiet to you?
Ace:They're just hungry.
Dark Manikin (Machina):I know. Wait your turn.
"Dark Manikin (Machina):Well, if you're going to stay, at least help out."
Ace:Right. Who's this?
"Dark Manikin (Machina):Ah, this one's name is..."
Onion Knight:He also said the crystal core of darkness is running wild and being manipulated by someone.
Leo:Spiritus tasked me with locating the crystal core and putting a stop to whoever is abusing it.
Kain:Heh... So I'm finally one of them now.
Warrior of Light:We've been fighting together for a long time now. As we have with others summoned by Spiritus.
Onion Knight:Aside from the rotten apples we can't reason with...
"Onion Knight:Right now, I want to work with the other warriors who haven't joined us yet."
Machina:You're so calm. It's like you aren't worried at all.
Onion Knight:Me? I guess it's because the Cloud of Darkness from my world is like calamity given form.
Onion Knight:And there's no way you can reason with a storm or natural disaster.
Machina:I see... I guess everyone's got their own circumstances.
"Kain:Exactly. Yourself included, Machina."
Kain:There is no need to compare yourself to others. You must decide your own route for yourself.
Machina:...I wish I could.
"Mog:Kupo! I found a new area, kupo!"
"Mog:I can sense brilliance, and Shinryu! Prepare to land, kupo!"
"Rem:Now that you mention it, it does."
Fran:This wasteland is your home?
Deuce:Well...a part of it.
"Rem:There are, unfortunately, a lot of places that look like this because of the war."
Laguna:So it's a battlefield. Life sure is tough for soldiers...
"Deuce:Weren't you a soldier, too, Laguna?"
"Laguna:Yeah, but I quit the army. You kids are still fighting."
"Rem:But we had a lot of combat missions, so we got used to it pretty quick."
Machina:Huh? Oh...sorry. What were you talking about?
"Laguna:How you kids are so young, but doing an amazing job!"
Deuce:Is something the matter?
"Machina:Well, I just realized that I haven't seen Ace in a while now..."
Fran:He may still be aboard the ship. Proper preparation is vital.
Machina:...I hope you're right.
Deuce:In a place that looks so much like home...
Deuce:We might be able to find someone else from Orience here.
"Mog:And my pom-pom is in tip-top condition! So let's go go go, kupo!"
Basch:Could you tell us more about Orience?
Basch:It might help us learn what to look for here.
"Seven:Orience is comprised of four nations, each with their own culture and crystal."
"Irvine:You guys were trained at school in how to fight, right? Like us?"
"King:Strictly speaking, our training wasn't just for warfare."
King:We cadets are the ones trained to become Agito.
Seven:You can only use magic when you're young.
"Seven:That's why everyone in the dominion army is as young as they are, cadets included."
Basch:So they sent you to war because you can use the strongest power out there...
"Penelo:You guys are the same age as us, but you're so much more mature..."
Penelo:I guess it's because your world forced you to grow up.
Zell:We aren't that far apart in age either...but you can tell actual battle experience changes the look in your eyes.
"Irvine:Yeah, well, we're just mercenaries."
"Irvine:Nationality doesn't figure into it, and only a select few of us ever even went on covert ops and that stuff..."
Irvine:Same here! Talk about a coincidence.
Basch:An international war using magic on such a large scale...
"Basch:As a commander, I wonder how I would handle sending out such young troops..."
Seven:You make it harder to answer when you look that gloomy about it...
Seven:But sending your best soldiers out first should minimize casualties.
Basch:I can understand your superiors coming to such a rationalization.
"Penelo:That's why I can't see anything ""rational"" about it."
Zell:Hmm... Hearing all this makes me realize just how complacent peace has made me.
King:I understand the theory of being better off without war.
"Seven:But we've never experienced a world without it, so we can't imagine what that's like."
Basch:I suppose that might be why Materia wished to give you respite here.
"Zell:Which would be nice, but we've had nothing but problems here, too!"
Zell:Do you have any idea who could have summoned this place?
King:No one...in my memory.
"Seven:If it's anyone we'd previously neutralized, we wouldn't remember them."
"Penelo:Oh, that's right... You forget those who died..."
"Irvine:Then all we can do is go forward, right?"
"Irvine:If you remember anything else, let us know!"
"Cloud of Darkness:The power of darkness grows, responding to the desires of the warriors..."
Cloud of Darkness:The flood of darkness is at hand...
Ciaran:Huh? Where did you come from?
"Cloud of Darkness:Where the balance of light and dark is disrupted, we appear."
Ciaran:Where did she go? I wonder if she was a friend of someone's...
Ace:Ciaran... What are you doing here?
Ciaran:That's what I'd like to ask you: where have you been?
Ace:...Nowhere important.
Ciaran:You seem...different from before.
Ciaran:...Did you find your respite?
Ace:What do you know?
Ciaran:Nothing. It just doesn't feel like you're stretched so thin anymore.
Ace:Are you going to tell the others?
Ciaran:Why? I didn't plan on it.
"Ciaran:It's important to you, isn't it?"
Ace:...Then that's fine.
"Ace:By the way, Ciaran..."
"Ace:You said it was natural to lose your memories, didn't you?"
"Ciaran:Right. No matter how precious they are, you can't hold on to all of them."
Ace:Materia thought we were better off forgetting the things that weighed us down.
"Ace:In our world, forgetting was a way to move into the future. It was the crystal's blessing."
"Ace:But here, nobody wants to forget..."
Ciaran:It's not wrong for them to treasure their memories. But...
"Ciaran:They hurt you without realizing it, didn't they?"
Ace:This world might really be a land of respite for us.
Ace:Everyone is alive here. There's no need to...go back...
Ciaran:...I see.
Ace:Do you think I'm a coward?
"Ciaran:Your secret's safe with me. I won't deny the way you feel. Everyone's different, after all."
Ace:...I might become everyone's enemy soon.
"Ace:If that happens, even you, I..."
Ciaran:I won't be done in so easily if it comes to that.
Ciaran:You're doing this because you have hope for the future. Right?
Ace:...Right. I will fight for my future.
"Ciaran:Gotcha. But, if possible...I'd rather not fight such a good friend."
"Freya:Hmm... No matter how far we go, it all looks the same."
Cinque:Uh-oh! Did we lose our way?
Tidus:We're counting on you guys to get us out of here! Did you remember anything?
"Cater:Even if we had, it doesn't change the fact that this isn't Orience."
"Mog:The presence of brilliance and Shinryu is all mixed-up in my head now, too, kupo..."
Freya:Is it possible we've fallen into someone's trap?
"Mog:Very possible, kupo!"
"Machina:If it's someone with a grudge against us, we might not be of much help..."
"Cinque:Because if they go bye-bye, so do our memories of them!"
Tidus:That again... So you really can't remember anything? Not even traces of their existence?
"Cater:If it were an ally of ours, we might know their name from things they left behind."
"Machina:But not from enemies. Ideas, beliefs, words... They all vanish."
Cinque:But we can keep crushing our enemies to itty-bitty pieces because of that.
Freya:I see... And that is the rule of your ceaselessly warring world...
Ace:Forgetting is the crystal's blessing.
Tidus:You still think you're happier forgetting? Even after all this!?
Tidus:You've seen people in this world without a future!
Cater:Don't lash out at us! It's just the way our world works!
Cinque:She's right. Getting mad at us won't change anything.
Freya:We understand. But...it's not easy.
"Freya:Even if that is the way your world works, some of us find it...sad."
Cater:Oh? Would you mind keeping that sadness to yourself?
"Machina:Come on, Cater. That's enough."
Cater:Am I wrong? They're treating us like we're some cold-blooded animals!
Cinque:We're just trying our very-berry best here!
Ace:...Let me say this:
Ace:The world we grew up in is different. We could never understand each other.
"Machina:Stop it! I don't want to see this here, too..."
"Cinque:Aw, Machy, you're so sweet!"
Cater:Always the honor student! Ugh! Don't you ever get mad?
Machina:Say what you want about me... But I can't tolerate anyone disrespecting my friends.
"Machina:The students of Class Zero aren't cold-blooded. You know that, right?"
Tidus:...I just don't get you guys.
"Freya:Forgive me, I spoke out of turn. Nothing will come of us arguing."
"Mog:Kupo, kupo! I know where the brilliance is!"
"Mog:So stop your fighting. We've got to go, kupo!"
Dark Manikin (Machina):You're back... You've come here a lot lately.
Dark Manikin (Machina):Did you have a fight with someone?
Ace:The people from the other worlds are just...suffocating.
Ace:But it's fine because I have this place.
"Dark Manikin (Machina):You won't be able to take breaks soon. They're heading to this Akademeia, aren't they?"
Ace:Yeah. That moogle sniffed it out. He can tell when someone does this sort of thing.
Ace:I'm sure they'll try to take me down as soon as they see the Akademeia.
Ace:Even though all I want to do is live a quiet life...
Dark Manikin (Machina):Will you fight them? Your classmates are with them.
"Ace:They'll choose to live here, at this Akademeia."
Ace:But the others...I'll fight.
Ace:Like how I've always done... I'm...used to it.
Dark Manikin (Machina):Just one or two of us won't be enough.
Ace:We won't know until we try.
"Dark Manikin (Machina):Right! And even if we don't win, you can always get away on this one."
Ace:A chocobo...
Dark Manikin (Machina):She's different from the ones who wandered here from other worlds. She was born from your will.
Dark Manikin (Machina):She can take you wherever you want.
Ace:What was her name again...?
"Dark Manikin (Rem):...He can't know. He's empty, after all."
"Dark Manikin (Rem):If Ace doesn't know, neither does that Machina."
Dark Manikin (Rem):It seems like I can move... Maybe I can leave Akademeia.
Dark Manikin (Rem):I must tell the me from the World of Light... This needs to stop.
Machina:The brilliance here must belong to Class Zero.
Vaan:What makes you say that?
Kain:You know the future your friends don't...don't you?
Machina:I know I can't hide it forever. But I couldn't bring myself to say it...
"Cecil:It was something so painful and terrifying that you wanted to hide it, wasn't it?"
Machina:I survived... A helpless fool until the very end...
Machina:There's no way they would forgive someone like that.
Vaan:Aren't they your friends? You seem pretty close to me.
Machina:Only because they don't remember fighting with me.
Machina:No... It wasn't even a fight. I turned on them.
Vaan:What did you do?
Machina:I was convinced that his death was the fault of Class Zero. Of Ace and the others.
Machina:So I held a grudge against them...
Kain:Seeking responsibility for a death on the battlefield can't go well.
Machina:Right... I was such an idiot. If only I had been more mature
Vaan:It's not that simple.
Vaan:Your brother was important to you. You wanted a culprit.
Vaan:You couldn't rest without someone to blame.
Vaan:Because you recognize just how helpless you are...
"Machina:...You're right, Vaan."
"Machina:When my brother died, I wasn't far away."
"Cecil:You blamed yourself, thinking you might have been able to save him."
Machina:I couldn't forgive myself for being so powerless. I didn't want to lose anyone else...and I envied them.
Machina:...It's a feeling that the powerful cadets in Class Zero can't understand.
Vaan:You can't know that. Have you ever tried talking to them?
Vaan:Not just about your brother.
"Vaan:Wanting power, feeling pathetic... Have you talked to them about your feelings?"
"Kain:Vaan is getting quite worked up, for Vaan."
Vaan:You won't know until you tell them. It's too late if you wait until they can't respond back.
Vaan:They're alive in this world. Talk to them.
Vaan:What's there to laugh about!?
Machina:It's not you. I just never realized it until you said it.
Machina:They're still alive in this world. I can talk to them. I can face them.
"Machina:I don't know what awaits us in the future, but...I'm going to talk to them."
Machina:I want us to understand each other this time. I want us to enjoy life...as friends.
Cecil:A fine resolution. And this is a world where you can make that come true.
"Jack:There you are, Machina! Have you seen Ace?"
Machina:Did something happen?
Deuce:We can't find him anywhere...
"Jack:He even ignored Mog's call. Maybe he's slacking off somewhere, yo."
Machina:Ace? I wonder...what happened.
Dark Manikin (Cinque):What's up next again? Was it outdoor practice? Or another snorefest in the classroom?
Dark Manikin (Eight):It's drills in the arena. We better hurry or we'll be late.
Dark Manikin (Cater):Out of the way! First in line coming through!
"Dark Manikin (Cinque):Aww, no fair! You're always first!"
"Dark Manikin (Eight):She can at least get good marks in drills, so she's going all out."
"Dark Manikin (Jack):Oh, yeah. I guess Nine'll be just as desperate then."
Dark Manikin (King):Assuming he isn't waiting in the wrong place. We'll have to go find him if he isn't there already.
"Dark Manikin (Jack):I was planning to skip class, but if we're doing drills, I can give it a try."
"Dark Manikin (Seven):Your grades suck, too. At least do better than ""try."""
"Dark Manikin (Deuce):It was easy, so everyone did well. I scored a 90."
Dark Manikin (Cinque):Easy? I scored a make-up exam...
Dark Manikin (Cater):Hey! Practice is about to start!
Dark Manikin (Deuce):Right! Let's go!
"Ace:If it just stays like this, everything will be alright."
Ace:Everyone will understand.
"Ace:If they remember, they won't want to go back. They can live their future here."
"Ace:We can make whatever we lack. Streets, airships, other countries..."
Ace:And...Mother. Mother will definitely find us here.
"Dark Manikin (Machina):You're still here? The CO's looking for you, Ace."
Ace:...You're the only one completely a puppet. You only do exactly what I tell you to do.
"Ace:What I mean is...the real Machina knows everything, but says nothing."
"Ace:I can't know what happened after the end, but living in this world..."
Ace:I wonder if he still hates us. Maybe that's why he's hiding the truth.
"Dark Manikin (Machina):If you don't know the answer, neither can I."
Ace:I know...
Ace:I know what the others are thinking. But I've never understood you.
"Ace:Why do I want you to be here, too...?"
Machina:Where did Ace go?
"Rem:If we don't find him soon, we should ask Materia..."
"Mog:Kupo... I can't help but feel like he's refusing my calls, kupo."
Seven:You mean he left us of his own will?
Penelo:I wonder if something bad happened to him. Or some villain kidnapped him...
Ciaran:Villain... Hmmm...
"Machina:Do you have any idea where he went, Ciaran?"
"Ciaran:I don't know if it's right for me to say, so...let me think about it for a while."
Seven:It would be nice if we had that kind of time.
"Mog:Kupo!? It seems like there's a dark manikin with brilliance over there, kupo!"
Machina:Brilliance? So...memories?
Rem:Let's go. They might be able to tell us something about Ace!
"Seven:What's wrong, Machina? You seem hesitant."
"Machina:It's nothing... No matter what happens, I'll face it."
Dark Manikin (Rem):Thank goodness you found me!
Dark Manikin (Rem):Yes. I've been looking for you. It looks like you managed to escape.
Machina:Escape? So we were trapped? Was it the Emperor or a monster or...
Dark Manikin (Rem):No... The one gathering us dark manikins isn't an enemy of yours.
Dark Manikin (Rem):The one who made this Orience and the Akademeia up ahead...
"Dark Manikin (Rem):...Is Ace, from the World of Light."
Penelo:Ace!? So he didn't answer the call just now because...
Dark Manikin (Rem):He's closed his heart up in Akademeia...
Dark Manikin (Rem):He gathered us dark manikins to recreate his old life.
Rem:Why would he do that all of a sudden?
Machina:Could it be...he got his memories back?
"Dark Manikin (Rem):We don't know when it happened, but someone gave him his brilliance."
"Dark Manikin (Rem):With all his memories until the end, Ace decided to create respite in this world."
Ciaran:So that's why he made all this. A place to feel at ease...even for just a moment.
Seven:So my dark manikin is at Akademeia then?
Seven:Isn't anyone going to stop him?
"Rem:Right. If you have memories, then you should have a will."
Rem:It's not like us to be controlled like this.
Dark Manikin (Rem):It's not like we're really being controlled. We haven't forgotten our mission to protect this world.
Dark Manikin (Rem):But it is hard to resist the powerful wills of those from the World of Light.
"Dark Manikin (Rem):That's why we let him do as he pleased, waiting for you to show up."
Seven:So that's why you came here to tell us.
Dark Manikin (Rem):And to pass on memories of the truth to myself from the World of Light.
Rem:The future that I can't remember...
Dark Manikin (Rem):Don't worry.
Dark Manikin (Rem):This brilliance... These memories will make you strong and kind.
Rem:...Okay. I'm ready.
Rem:I wonder...if we were together until the end.
"Dark Manikin (Rem):The future isn't as scary as you think. Isn't that right, Machina?"
Machina:...I was worried because Rem is so kind. I couldn't bring myself to say it.
Machina:But I won't waver anymore. I want you to get your memories back and be by my side.
Rem:...Okay. Tell me...what really happened.
Rem:My memories...
Rem:Oh no... No...
Rem:Everyone... Why...?
Lyse:Are you okay?
Rem:Machina and I...survived.
Rem:I thought I would die first because I was weak...
Rem:But even though I lived...
Rem:I can't be happy. This is so sad...
Lyse:You survived? But you still...remembered your friends?
Rem:You're right...
Machina:Our classmates only know the old order.
"Machina:After they risked their lives fighting, the people of Orience became unable to forget the dead."
Machina:But only Rem and I remembered our classmates.
"Rem:So you knew all along, Machina, but didn't say anything."
Machina:I didn't have the courage. I didn't know what to say.
Rem:But everyone's brilliance is up ahead.
"Lyse:Should we keep quiet? If you want to, I won't say a thing."
Machina:Ace got his memories back and is out of control.
Machina:The others might do the same.
"Rem:If we rewrite the world the way we want, our real home might fall to ruin."
"Machina:I'll talk to them. I don't know what will happen, but I have to try."
"Lyse:Hey, Rem."
Lyse:You said you survived even though you were weak...
Lyse:I think...I might understand how you feel. So...
"Rem:""You're not alone."" I know. I'll be okay."
Lyse:You don't need to say that you're okay right away...you know?
Rem:Huh? Oh... I suppose it's a habit.
"Lyse:You have a lot of good friends here, people who understand you. So please...don't hesitate to rely on us."
Cater:So what happened after that fight?
"Machina:Orience changed. But in that future, you all..."
"Cinque:Stop messing around, Machy! There's just no way that happened. We all remember each other."
Cater:Talk about a bad joke. Are you sure it wasn't a dream?
"Machina:Maybe it was a dream... I mean, I can see you all in this world..."
King:Ace got his memories back and is out of control. We had all better be prepared.
Eight:Right. I don't think someone as serious as Machina would lie to us.
"Machina:Once everyone has their memories back, I've got a lot to apologize for..."
Quistis:That's right. It might be something similar to your Akademeia.
Selphie:We even have uniforms like you guys!
"Cinque:Did you have icky homework and tests, too?"
Selphie:Of course! We all studied together before our exams.
Cinque:Rather than sitting and taking some stuffy test...
Cinque:Wouldn't it be better if we could just beat some baddies for our grades?
"Selphie:Ohh, I know what you mean! Tests and homework are so tough."
"Quistis:They study important things, like history and nature, too."
"Deuce:Fables of founders, how flowers bloom and bud..."
Deuce:Hmm... I get a feeling I said something like this before...
Selphie:You guys never studied history or nature before?
"Deuce:Not really. We learned about magic and endurance in class. And geopolitics and the other nations' strengths, too."
"Quistis:I guess it's to be expected of a warring nation... When you become part of the army, you need to devote time to your drills."
"Deuce:We're actually separate from the army, but it was an emergency..."
Seifer:Hey! You have some nerve wearing sloppy uniforms like that around here!
Seifer:Fasten your jacket properly! And why is it so short? Nobody would believe you're elite looking like that.
King:All cadets at Akademeia were allowed to remodel their uniforms how they liked.
"King:...Believe it or not, mine has fewer modifications than most."
"Raijin:I guess we don't have much power here, being out of uniform ourselves, y'know."
"Seifer:Shut up! You over there! You skipped out on airship cleaning to take a nap, didn't you?"
Seifer:I saw that four-eyed chef cleaning the kitchen by himself!
"Jack:Me? Nahhh, I asked Prompto to take over my shift!"
Jack:I'm sure Ignis wanted to clean the kitchen himself because it's his sanctuary!
"Raijin:Come on, Seifer. Can't we all just get along, y'know?"
Seifer:Hmph! You had better clean up those sloppy uniforms next time I see you!
"King:You're the Discipline Committee, right? I don't mind you cracking down on people, but...keep it to your own world."
"Raijin:I think Seifer just wanted to talk to you because you seem like a nice guy and you're the same age, y'know?"
King:What? I never would have guessed that...
"Jack:Aww, he likes us! Life must be hard for a committee leader who can't show his true feelings, yo."
Deuce:Hehe... Isn't it nice being around people who don't treat us like we're special?
Deuce:Yes. Our red capes make us Class Zero. We were different from the other cadets.
"Quistis:SeeDs are mercenaries whereas you folks are elites added to the army, but..."
Quistis:I suppose separating students into ranks is fairly commonplace.
Deuce:Even for you folks?
Selphie:We did all kinds of missions as SeeD mercenaries!
"Quistis:Our worlds may be different, but we have things in common. It would be nice to have a cultural exchange."
"Deuce:I want to know all about what you studied, too."
Deuce:I feel like I'm going to learn some very valuable things!
Cloud of Darkness:Planesgorgers...gnaw at the warped world.
Cloud of Darkness:But the dragon who stands powerless before the world's rules is naught but a gatekeeper.
Cater:Whoa! It's Akademeia!
Deuce:The dark manikin was right... But who are you?
Cloud of Darkness:Are you the souls raised by the Mother?
Ignis:Who are you?
Onion Knight:The Cloud of Darkness. It appears when the balance of light and dark is upset.
Cloud of Darkness:The world has fallen into chaos. But it is not yet time to return to nothingness.
Cloud of Darkness:So we wait for a strong will to create the flood of darkness...
"Cater:Hold it! You said something about Mother earlier, didn't you?"
Deuce:Do you know something about Mother?
Cloud of Darkness:You say the same as that boy.
Cloud of Darkness:See him with your own eyes. It is not our time now.
"Onion Knight:It got away... No, it's just not time to fight it yet."
Onion Knight:It said a powerful will is going to cause a flood of darkness.
Terra:General Leo said the crystal core of darkness is out of control and giving power to warriors.
Deuce:So then maybe it gave someone the power to create Akademeia.
Cater:Huh? So this isn't the power of will?
Onion Knight:Probably. But...I think the crystal core of darkness is overreacting to a strong will.
Onion Knight:I think it will grant anything to those with a strong will.
"Ignis:Anything, from making a phone call..."
Terra:To creating a place to call home.
"Onion Knight:But if it continues to grant these wishes, this world will gradually fall into chaos."
Ignis:Because it cannot grant every single wish.
"Onion Knight:If that happens and darkness floods this place, the Cloud of Darkness will return the world to nothingness."
Cater:So then what do we do?
"Ignis:Search the area, find Ace, and speak with him"
Deuce:A planesgorger!? Here!?
Terra:I thought they were always at the end of those labyrinths...
Onion Knight:Don't let your guard down!
Warrior of Light:To meet in such a shallow place...
"Mog:Something's not right, kupo!"
Bartz:It feels like he won't let us in.
Ace:That's far enough!
Onion Knight:Do you really intend to fight your friends?
"Ace:You came to destroy this place, didn't you? That makes us enemies."
Onion Knight:Do you want to create more chaos between the worlds?
Ace:This is the place I belong.
Ace:I won't let any of you take it away!
Ace:Gck... At least the planesgorger is gone.
Ace:Akademeia is still in good shape. It won't be threatened by anyone.
Eight:Ace! Did you really do this!?
Ace:I did.
Deuce:Why? That makes you the same as the bad guys!
Ace:I can't help it if that's how you feel. But I had no other choice.
"Warrior of Light:Please, explain it to us. At this rate, the world will sink into chaos."
Ace:How could you possibly understand?
Ace:Don't ask anymore. Just leave me and the rest of Class Zero here.
Cater:So that we're the only ones abandoning our mission!?
Ace:Our mission... Right. This is also a mission.
Ace:Saving this world and returning home...
"Ace:That was the purpose of this journey, wasn't it?"
Ace:We're different from the others. We need a place to go home to.
Eight:So then what Machina said was...
Ace:I don't want you to remember.
Ace:There's no place for you to return to except here. That's all you need to know.
Deuce:I refuse to accept that!
"Eight:No matter what happened after that fight, I was ready for it."
Ace:You say that because you don't know.
Ace:And I don't want you to know.
"Cater:But what about Mother? Mother's protecting us, isn't she?"
"Ace:Mother only let us choose at the very end. We weren't revived, but..."
"Ace:If we wait here, Mother might come eventually."
Warrior of Light:I understand what you're saying. But I cannot decide what you should do.
Warrior of Light:Because your opinions are split among you.
Ace:That's why I want you to leave us alone.
Warrior of Light:We cannot overlook things if they continue like this. The power of wills is the light that guides this world.
Warrior of Light:Your will created this place. That is one choice.
Warrior of Light:But whether they choose this place or not is up to each of their wills.
Eight:Our choice...
Ace:Think about it carefully.
Cater:Hey! Where are you going!?
Penelo:I'm sorry! But Mog...
"Cinque:What's the matter, Moglin? Come over here by Cinquey!"
"Mog:I can't, kupo! I keep trying, but it's not working, kupo!"
"Fran:A magical barrier, perhaps...to keep Mog out."
Machina:That's impossible... Ah!
"Cinque:So you can't get out, Machy?"
Jack:Is he trying to trap all of Class Zero in here?
Machina:...Including me?
"Fran:It looks like you will have to wait, Mog."
"Mog:Kupo! Be careful, kupo!"
Dark Manikin (Eight):What's Ace doing?
Dark Manikin (Seven):He's with Machina at the chocobo ranch now.
Dark Manikin (King):He thinks we're studying.
Dark Manikin (Eight):Then let's go find our originals. They should be close.
"Dark Manikin (Jack):Wait up! I'm going, too!"
Dark Manikin (Jack):Ace thinks I'm always slacking off.
"Dark Manikin (King):You know where we're going, don't you?"
Dark Manikin (Jack):Of course! I'll be fine.
Dark Manikin (Seven):Alright. Then let's move.
Eight:Who's there!?
Seven:Wait. It's us...from the World of Darkness.
Dark Manikin (King):I'm glad we found you.
"Jack:Are you guys okay? You look beat, yo."
King:You're wounded. What happened?
Dark Manikin (Eight):This place was made by Ace's will. It's hard for us to move on our own.
Dark Manikin (Seven):He doesn't want us to give up our brilliance.
Dark Manikin (Seven):That's why he shut out that moogle who can sense it.
Eight:He did it so we wouldn't meet up...
King:So you slipped through to give us the brilliance back.
Dark Manikin (King):It's hard for us to determine right from wrong.
"Dark Manikin (King):Even with memories, our decisions are ruled by those with strong wills."
Dark Manikin (King):We dark manikins were created to protect this land of respite.
"Dark Manikin (Seven):We thought it would be fine to let him do what he wanted, so we tried to be useful..."
Dark Manikin (Jack):But Ace didn't make Akademeia on his own.
Jack:Was it the Cloud of Darkness? We met her at the entrance... She sure was spooky.
"Dark Manikin (Eight):No matter how strong your will is, you can't recreate a place to this extent with a crystal on your own."
Dark Manikin (King):The crystal core of darkness is giving away too much energy...
"Seven:So at some point, there will be a flood of darkness..."
Dark Manikin (Seven):We will fulfill our role and give you back your brilliance and restore your powers.
Dark Manikin (Seven):But remember: it's up to you what happens from here on out.
"Eight:Our future... I prepared myself for more than fighting on the battlefield, but..."
"Dark Manikin (Eight):Once you know everything, it's okay to choose the same path Ace did."
Dark Manikin (Eight):We're fine with it...even if you end up fighting with your friends from other worlds.
King:...We accept.
"Seven:If we know what lies in store, we might be able to go forth with a level head."
"Seven:Machina and Rem have their memories, but those two are too nice..."
"Jack:I'm a little scared, but Ace already has his memories."
"Eight:It's not fair if only Ace carries that burden, and Machina and Rem are the only ones suffering."
"Eight:The fourteen of us are Class Zero, right?"
Dark Manikin (Eight):...I'm glad. I wanted to hear that from you myself.
Dark Manikin (King):Memories of worries and partings...
Dark Manikin (Seven):We'll give them all to you.
Dark Manikin (Seven):...I'm sorry we can't be of more help.
King:We have to be strong to set a good example for the others.
Eight:Let's make a promise not to be hasty.
"Jack:You made up your mind, didn't you? Then let's do this, yo."
Seven:Don't worry. You can leave everything to us.
Dark Manikin (King):Thank you.
Dark Manikin (King):This is all we can do... The rest is up to you.
King:I was prepared for this.
Seven:But it was...unexpected...
Faris:Are you being serious? How can you be so calm?
"Jack:Class Zero, taken doooooown right here! I don't think it was too bad."
Eight:It wasn't an empty death. There was...meaning to our fight.
Sazh:Are you holding back for the rest of us?
"Faris:You think if you waver, the rest of us'll get lily-livered?"
Basch:Is there anything we can do?
"Basch:Our worlds, positions, and ages are different..."
Basch:But we are here for you if you need us.
Jack:Haha... You're a good guy.
Jack:But my tears dried up back home.
"Seven:...We're happy to hear it, though."
"Eight:All we ever did was obey someone else's orders, so we're bad at relying on others."
"Faris:Well, if there's ever anything, just say the word."
Sazh:Seeing kids like you risk your lives without a tear...
Sazh:What kind of adult would I be to just let that go?
"Faris:There's no such thing as a life I'm fine with sacrificing, even for the sake of the world."
Eight:Our last fight was when the world was on the brink of destruction.
Jack:We all thought about it. How we would escape. But in the end...
"King:Rather than waiting for death, we accepted it and chose to fight."
"Seven:It's like the dark manikins said. It's our choice, from here on out."
"Sazh:It's okay for you to stay here, like Ace said."
Eight:Wh-what!? But our journey...
Sazh:I'm trying to tell you that we adults can handle it.
Sazh:You're still kids. Be selfish once in a while.
Sazh:Ask for help. Rely on the grown-ups.
Basch:Expecting to die... Expecting to kill...
Basch:Expectations change a lot during war. I don't want your lives to end with those expectations unshaken.
"Sazh:At the very least, we adults will never think of your deaths as unavoidable."
King:Sazh... But we...
Sazh:Enough. A gun may be your weapon for war...
Sazh:But you yourself aren't.
"Sazh:You said so yourself, didn't you? It's your will that pulls the trigger."
Sazh:So what does your will want to do? How does it want to live?
"Basch:You may have been bound by duty, but you're free of that here."
"Eight:Vayne, from your world, refuses to accept a world where the gods control its fate."
King:Thelast personwe fought was agodlike that.
"Seven:We were led around by the crystal and legends, but..."
Seven:I don't begrudge being born in Orience.
"Eight:If I weren't born in Orience, I wouldn't have met my friends."
King:My only regret...is not having much time being sad.
Seven:We had our hands full comforting our crying comrades.
"Eight:Attachment, regret, fear, remorse... Even if I felt them, I couldn't express them."
Jack:So do we do it now? Now's the chance to whine all we want!
"Eight:You're right, Jack. We have time in this world."
"Seven:We're alive. Even if we don't have a place to return to, we're here."
King:Even so...I don't think I want to stop here.
Sazh:Is that what your will says?
Sazh:Then we'll keep going together.
Faris:Are you sure? This place is like your home.
Jack:Psssh. It's not the same. There's no one here but monsters. I wouldn't want to call this home!
Eight:Ace is being manipulated. I can't overlook that.
Seven:Right. We can choose where we want to return to after that.
Seven:That's my choice.
"Basch:In that case, we support your choice wholeheartedly."
"Faris:And if you ever wanna talk, we're all here for you."
Cinque:I wonder if we'll be okay.
Cinque:Can we really accept it that calmly...?
Dark Manikin (Deuce):We found you! What a relief.
Deuce:Our dark manikins!
Cater:We heard you encountered some interference from Ace and the Cloud of Darkness.
"Dark Manikin (Cater):Yeah... It wasn't easy breaking through the barrier, but I'm glad we made it."
"Cinque:You came to return our memories, right?"
Dark Manikin (Cinque):That's right. But...we're being influenced by a powerful will.
Dark Manikin (Cater):Ace doesn't want us to return your memories.
Dark Manikin (Cater):So we started thinking that we don't want to give them back...
Dark Manikin (Deuce):Only humans can choose their own fate.
Dark Manikin (Deuce):Dark manikins can't.
Deuce:So...you want us to choose.
Cinque:Are they sad memories? Painful memories?
"Dark Manikin (Cinque):If you leave them, things will only be sadder and more painful."
Dark Manikin (Deuce):Our ability to decide as dark manikins is being controlled by Ace's will and the Cloud of Darkness pulling his strings.
"Dark Manikin (Cater):At this rate, everyone's memories will disappear into darkness."
Cater:But aren't they so painful you want them to disappear?
Dark Manikin (Cinque):Do you want them to disappear? To forget everything and live a fun life?
Cinque:Hmm... I feel like that's not a good idea.
"Cinque:I mean, Seven and the others got their memories back. I don't want to be the odd one out."
"Cater:And if we let Ace do what he wants, this world is in trouble, isn't it?"
"Cater:I would be lying if I said I wasn't scared, though."
"Cater:But it's not fair to talk to Ace, Rem, and Machina with my memories as hazy as they are."
Dark Manikin (Deuce):So you'll take them?
Dark Manikin (Cater):Just so you know...you can't even begin to imagine what's in these memories.
"Dark Manikin (Cinque):We could take it because we're puppets, but...they'll make you cry."
"Cinque:Even if I do, it's fine by me."
Cater:It'd hurt me more not remembering like the rest of Class Zero.
Dark Manikin (Deuce):I see...
Dark Manikin (Deuce):Then let's do this.
Dark Manikin (Cinque):It's like Seven and the others said: the rest is up to you guys.
Dark Manikin (Cater):Get your memories back and think carefully. It's fine if you want to ally with Ace after that.
Deuce:I'll keep that in mind.
Cater:Alright! Bring it on!
Dark Manikin (Deuce):I wasn't sure if I should return your memories or not. You looked like you were having so much fun.
Deuce:But we'll have to face it someday.
"Cater:Right. I am a little worried, though..."
Cinque:I don't know if I can face it like a grown-up...
"Dark Manikin (Deuce):If you can't, rely on your friends. They're beside you for a reason."
Deuce:So that's how it ended...
Cinque:We ran ahead...
"Cater:With all our might... Yeah, that's alright..."
"Rem:They're holding back, aren't they...? Isn't there anything I can do?"
Selphie:There is. Give them time.
"Selphie:Well, think of it this way..."
"Selphie:If they died, there would be nothing you could do. But here, they're alive."
Selphie:So...believe in them.
Selphie:And get ready so that they have nothing to worry about when they get back. How does that sound?
Selphie:Hehe. I guess I got carried away!
"Selphie:Anyway, it's your turn to talk now!"
Rem:Right. Thank you.
Freya:Now that you have your memories back...would you like to rest a little?
Freya:Rem told me what happened. You don't need to talk about it if you don't want to.
Cater:It's okay. We were the ones who didn't know anything.
Cinque:I'm...sorry about before.
Cinque:It really is scary... I don't want to die...
Cinque:I don't want to be forgotten...
Freya:I will make sure no one comes. Let your tears wash your soul.
Yuffie:Whoa! Cinque? And Cater! What happened!?
"Freya:Not now, Yuffie"
Yuffie:So Machina's story really wasn't a dream!?
"Cinque:Yuffie... Well, we... Sniffle..."
Yuffie:Oh no... No way that's fair...
"Cater:N-not you too, Yuffie..."
Yuffie:But...there's nothing I can do...!
"Cater:Still! Crying... Sniffle... Not me, too!"
Yuffie:Everything...disappears in war.
Yuffie:Everyone...knows that...
Freya:Hm? Are you alright?
"Deuce:Hehe. For some reason, I'm happier than I am sad."
Deuce:It's great to have friends who will cry with us.
"Deuce:Back home, everyone kept their distance from Class Zero..."
"Deuce:Ah, but of course we had some friends among them. I hope they're doing okay..."
"Selphie:Look! It was worth waiting. If you want to talk, now's your chance!"
"Rem:You're talking about the other students, right? In that case..."
Deuce:Yes... Huh... Hehe... What! Really... I see...
"Leo:Children without a place to call home... I wish I could help, but..."
Leo:I am much older than everyone. Perhaps that makes it difficult for them to get close...
"Cater:If our army was led by someone as accomplished as you, we might have changed, too..."
Leo:Cater!? Are you...alright?
"Cater:Cinque and Yuffie are still crying their eyes out, but I'm done with that."
"Cater:You don't have a place to go home to either, do you? And still you fight..."
Leo:My situation is far different from yours. I don't know if you could compare the two.
"Cater:It doesn't suit me to look back. Right now, I'm still alive."
Cater:Mother is gone. So maybe I'll give listening to army folks like you a try.
Leo:If it's stories you want to hear...I'll gladly tell you all I can...
Vincent:...How are you feeling?
"Cinque:Ohh, the strong and silent Vinny! Did you come looking for us?"
Yuffie:Haha! Strong and silent is right!
"Vincent:Your eyes are red, Yuffie... I just came to see how you were doing."
Cinque:Hehe. I guess they noticed all our wailing...
"Cinque:Right now, I can choose."
Cinque:I can do things here that I couldn't choose to do in Orience.
"Yuffie:Do you want to take a break here, like Ace?"
Cinque:Mm... I don't think so.
"Cinque:It seems like Machy is still hiding some things. And I want to talk to the others, too."
"Machina:I'm so sorry, everyone...!"
Machina:I held an unjustified grudge against you and couldn't do anything even at the end...
"Machina:It might be selfish of me to ask now, but please... I hope you can forgive me!"
Eight:Aren't you and Rem the ones who helped us at the end?
Machina:But...I don't think you needed it...
"Deuce:We chose to fight. And we fought together, didn't we?"
Machina:I fought you guys because I was weak...
"Machina:But I wanted to fight beside you, so we could protect each other..."
"Machina:I wanted to be able to laugh and have fun together, as friends..."
Machina:But I didn't have the strength. I was weak...
Cinque:You don't saaay... Hehehehe...
Machina:Wh-what are you laughing at!?
"Cinque:It feels like we went around in a circle, and you're back to the Machy we first met!"
Seven:...I see it now. Earnest and stupidly honest.
Cater:Only now he thinks of us as friends. Before it was like Rem was his only ally.
"Machina:...It's stupid, isn't it? I abandoned you all... To try and act like a friend now..."
"King:I don't know if it's stupid or not, but you remembered us."
King:Remembered and sympathized... Isn't someone who does that considered a friend?
Machina:...I don't know if I deserve to be called that.
Eight:Choosing the wrong path out of kindness... It's not much different from Ace right now.
Machina:Not much different from...Ace?
Seven:Ace has the kindest heart among us...
"Jack:He built Akademeia, after all, out of sympathy for us."
Cater:I think Machina's words might hit home with Ace right now.
King:The Cloud of Darkness used Mother's name to try and confuse us.
King:But I don't think Mother is really here.
Cater:And both Materia and Spiritus are telling us about people who might be our allies.
Machina:But I don't remember hearing anything about a doctor from Spiritus...
Cater:Huh!? Does that mean you're one of Spiritus's warriors!?
Machina:Th-that's the part you pick up on!?
Cinque:This is news to Cinquey!
"King:...So we had a lot to talk about, but at least we're all on the same page here."
"King:First, we'll get Ace back."
"Seven:This Akademeia is a home for monsters, not cadets like us..."
Onion Knight:The Cloud of Darkness gave Ace the power to make it so he could cause the flood of darkness...
King:Ace can be reckless sometimes. He might not be able to turn back now.
Warrior of Light:Have you chosen to fight with us?
Seven:...We've only fought a battle on our own orders once.
Seven:We'll search for a reason to fight after this...with Ace.
"Onion Knight:I got it. Let's go and get our friend back, then!"
Onion Knight:And stop the flood of darkness!
Dark Manikin (Machina):It's not safe here anymore. Get on this chocobo and get out of here.
Ace:Everyone got their memories back... So why don't they understand?
"Dark Manikin (Machina):As long as you stay alive, there'll be another chance. What's important now is to protect yourself."
Dark Manikin (Machina):This darkness will eat away at humans and continue growing with no end...
Dark Manikin (Machina):So get going!
Tidus:What is this place...?
Zidane:The darkness is swirling... Is Ace really here?
Machina:We went around the whole Akademeia... He has to be.
"Dark Manikin (Machina):You're so weak, and still poking your nose where it doesn't belong, I see."
Bartz:Is that Machina's...huh?
Bartz:So even Spiritus's warriors have dark manikins?
"Y'shtola:Well, this is a first."
Dark Manikin (Machina):I was born from Ace's wishes.
Dark Manikin (Machina):I am not a warrior to protect this world. I am a giver of respite!
Machina:I can't imagine Ace getting close to something that looks like me.
Dark Manikin (Machina):I atoned for what you could not.
"Dark Manikin (Machina):For Ace, this place meant peace."
"Dark Manikin (Machina):With nowhere to return, he had to make a new home."
Tidus:But he did that because he was tricked by the Cloud of Darkness!
Dark Manikin (Machina):He was hurt by the values of those from other worlds.
Zidane:Even knowing that what's important is different for everyone...it must've been tough for him.
Bartz:We should have listened more.
Dark Manikin (Machina):This won't be resolved by talking. You were raised in different worlds.
Machina:Is that what Ace thinks I'm like?
Y'shtola:He relied on you.
Machina:But it's wrong.
Dark Manikin (Machina):What is?
Machina:I'm not that strong. I'm absolutely pathetic...
"Machina:I need to atone on my own. Otherwise, there's no point."
Dark Manikin (Machina):It's too late. Ace is beyond your reach now.
"Machina:Then I'll chase after him, no matter where he goes!"
Dark Manikin (Machina):He wants to be left alone. Stop trying to get in his way!
"Tidus:I'm with you, Machina. I need to apologize, too."
Zidane:Yeah. I want Ace to stay our friend. I want him to believe in us!
Y'shtola:Then it's decided.
Machina:Thank you...!
Dark Manikin (Machina):I'm all Ace has left. I won't let you hurt him...!
Seven:He even made a dark manikin to protect this place...
Eight:He probably took elements from people other than Machina to make his ideal friend.
Cinque:Like playing dress up with a doll!
Deuce:That means Ace is serious. We have to find him quickly!
Dark Manikin (Machina):Guah... Dammit... Isn't there anything I can do...!?
Onion Knight:Agh!
Machina:No! Grr...
"Machina:Where are you, Ace!?"
Machina:Ace! Aaace!
Ace:I'm here.
Ace:You've got some nerve coming here.
Ace:Surviving as a coward...
Machina:You can call me whatever you want. I won't make excuses.
"Ace:Did you enjoy your life, forgetting the cadets you hated so much?"
Machina:Forget!? I never forgot.
"Machina:The doctor told me to remember you, her children."
Ace:Mother? Mother was there?
Ace:No... I can't believe it. She wouldn't abandon us and save you.
"Machina:I don't understand why, either. But I remember. Please believe me."
"Machina:After the war ended, I saw the vermilion flag. You were all beneath it."
"Machina:You were in the middle, Ace. Cater and Deuce were beside you... I would never forget something like that."
Ace:...So what? You think I'm going to be convinced just like that?
"Machina:I have so many things I want to talk to you about. To apologize for, and to tell you..."
Machina:I won't leave you here alone!
Ace:Like a child throwing a tantrum...
Vaan:You're both kids.
Onion Knight:I understand that you want some peace and quiet. But this is not the way to go about it.
Squall:You don't have to force yourself to get along with us. But you can't hurt others.
"Tidus:We might not understand your world even now, but..."
"Tidus:You're our friends. We wanted to understand, which is why we argued."
"Onion Knight:You decided this on your own, Ace. So whether you come back to us or not is fine, but..."
"Onion Knight:If you continue to rely on the power of darkness, you'll be in danger. And I won't abandon a friend like that."
Vaan:We can talk about this. Say the things you want to say.
Ace:I don't want your pity. Sadness won't change the past.
Ace:Just leave me alone!
Ciaran:It looks like the peace you found has vanished.
"Ciaran:This place is submerged in darkness... It can't give you the respite you wanted, right?"
Ace:...There's no going back for me.
"Onion Knight:You give up too easily! Where there's a will, there's a way."
Ace:This is the path I will follow...and I'll fight you if I must!
Ace:Gck... You're all...in my way...!
Ace:She said she resonated with Mother. She must be...close...
Machina:Gch... Ace...
"Ace:Still standing, I see..."
Machina:Listen to me!
Machina:Just what are you trying to do!?
Machina:Are you going to wait for Dr. Arecia here? In this monster-infested building!?
Ace:Maybe. I can't exist anywhere else...
Machina:That's not true. Give us a chance...
Machina:I hate it... I'm tired of leaving people behind... Going forward without them...
Ace:Those weak thoughts are what made you choose to be a l'Cie!
Machina:I couldn't forgive myself for being weak. I wanted to stand side-by-side with you guys...
Ace:I can't imagine a bleeding heart like you would survive that battle.
Machina:But I might have become a little better at fighting.
"Machina:I can't use magic as well as Rem, but...we completed the same missions."
Ace:Hmph. Didn't you skip out on an important mission?
Machina:I know it's unforgiveable!
"Machina:But at that time, most of my own will was gone..."
Ace:That's trivial for a l'Cie.
"Machina:I know, but...I wanted to protect."
Ace:You only wanted to protect Rem.
Machina:I know that! But I lost her...and understood.
Machina:I wanted the power to protect you guys until the end.
Ace:...What a pretty excuse.
Rem:Should we do something? They've been arguing the whole time...
"Deuce:It's nice to have someone you can argue with, though."
"Jack:But you're so quiet, Rem, we never had a thing to fight with you about."
"King:For being so sensitive, Ace is awful at showing his emotions."
"Eight:You don't need emotions to complete a mission, so this was just fine back home."
Eight:But this world is different... We need to find an answer that works.
"Rem:Machina isn't really the type of person to argue, either."
Seven:...We know.
Seven:Some of us sensed that he was suffering from a sense of helplessness...
"Eight:But in order to continue fighting, we had to throw away that feeling. Still..."
Eight:What's moving Ace right now isn't a sound argument...
Seven:But words spoken with all his might.
Rem:Can we just leave them like this? What if they start fighting again?
King:They'll get tired of it eventually. Then we'll come back to get them.
Seven:Machina's emotions are much more powerful than our arguments right now.
Eight:Let's give them a little more time. I'm sure Ace will find an answer soon.
"Machina:(I felt it was the first time we said what we really felt. It was overdue, but...)"
Machina:(I hoped my feelings would reach him.)
"Machina:Please, Ace... There's still time in this world."
Ace:What a nice excuse to ignore reality.
Machina:Reality is different here.
"Machina:You're alive and talking to me here and now, Ace."
"Ace:I'm...alive. Here, and now..."
Machina:Chichiri!?
Ace:You know her name?
Machina:Huh? Well...the name just appeared in my head...
"Bartz:She's been waiting for you, Ace, thinking you'd run away together."
"Seven:You didn't run...because you were waiting for us, right?"
"King:Talk about ""high-maintenance."""
"Ace:Are you all...okay with this? Even if we protect this world, we..."
Deuce:We decided to think about it later. The answer's not going to come right away.
"Deuce:If this world is destroyed, we won't have that time."
Eight:You won't have time for those arguments you haven't had yet.
Ace:Do I look like someone who argues all the time?
Bartz:Are they wrong?
Machina:Am I like that too...?
Ace:...Don't ask me.
"Bartz:Chichiri, huh. I like it. If you don't have anywhere to go, why not stay on our airship?"
Bartz:Ace seems pretty attached to you. And we can't leave you here with all these monsters.
Seven:Right. It might be nice having a chocobo. Ace would make a perfect caretaker.
Chocobo:Kweh! Kweh!
Ace:At least ask first.
Ace:...Leave me alone already.
"King:How persuasive. How about it, Machina?"
"Machina:Come on, let's go."
Machina:(This is only momentary... I can't reverse the fate they chose.)
Machina:(But I can talk to them right now.)
Machina:(In this world...I want to be friends with Class Zero.)
Cloud of Darkness:Your craving for power has ceased. Darkness casts a shadow over the transient light...
"Machina:The Cloud of Darkness? You're the cause of all this, aren't you?"
Cloud of Darkness:But the darkness is deepening. The balance is crumbling.
Cloud of Darkness:You are the only light left in this world. We will enjoy crushing you...
"Ace:You haven't fulfilled your mission yet, have you?"
Machina:What do you want?
"Onion Knight:It's not something you can reason with. Get ready, everyone!"
Onion Knight:We won't let you destroy this world!
Cloud of Darkness:Now then... How bright is the light of your will?
"Ace:You used me, saying Mother's name..."
Cloud of Darkness:Your will summoned a deep darkness. But it is not enough for a flood.
Ace:...Saying that I found my way would be a lie. But I won't rely on you any longer!
Cloud of Darkness:So you have returned to the light. Then we will test your strength!
"Cloud of Darkness:It is not yet our time. When the time comes, we will appear."
Cloud of Darkness:Even if that be at your side...
"Mog:Kupooo! The barrier is gone, so I'm here now, kupo!"
"Mog:Are those dimensional coordinates!? From the Cloud of Darkness, kupo!?"
"Onion Knight:I don't know what it's thinking, so I can only guess..."
"Onion Knight:But if we continue, we're bound to find the crystal core of darkness."
"Basch:And beside it, we might find the one using its power."
Onion Knight:Maybe it plans to show up when that person destroys the balance of the world.
Machina:And you're okay with this? Isn't she your enemy?
"Onion Knight:Like I said before, it's like a natural disaster."
"Onion Knight:It's scary, but powerful. I think it's better we use that to our advantage."
"Ace:She hinted knowing something about Mother, too..."
Noct:Which reminds me... Someone else mentioned someone we haven't met.
Noct:Which means they heard stories about our world's crystal and king from someone. Huh?
Basch:You mean Vayne... Perhaps Spiritus's warriors exchange information among themselves.
"Mog:There's a chance Spiritus's warriors are trying to make friends just like we are, kupo."
"Mog:This world is very unstable. Not even the gods can help, kupo."
"Machina:If the crystal core of darkness continues this way, what will happen to this world?"
"Onion Knight:It'll be returned to nothingness. Or at least, that's what the Cloud of Darkness wants."
Basch:Or a world ruled by the one controlling the crystal core.
Noct:Both sound pretty terrible to me.
"Mog:So we need to find and get the crystal core of darkness under control, kupo!"
"Machina:How do you feel about that, Ace?"
Ace:Do you really think I'm going to stop here?
Ace:I can't just do nothing.
Ace:I'll go with you. I need time to think.
"Noct:You don't need to be friends with all of us, you know."
"Basch:If you want to spend your time in peace, do so."
Ace:Don't treat me like I'm fragile.
Machina:Ahhh... You're not listening.
"Machina:You really were fragile. Normally, you're so composed, so everyone was worried about you."
"Machina:They were trying to figure out how they should treat you, how much space they should take."
Ace:But I plan to say what I mean from now on.
"Machina:I hope so. If there's anything I can do, let me know."
"Onion Knight:If we can save this world, I'm sure there will be time for you guys to think."
"Onion Knight:After all, this world was meant to be a place of respite."
Ace:I knew fear. I also knew what it was like to face death without it.
"Ace:But this place is different from Orience. Even if it's only temporary, I can choose my own future."
"Noct:Hey, it doesn't all have to be so serious. You can have your own chocobo here."
Noct:Even Prompto was excited to see it.
Machina:Can we really keep Chichiri on the airship?
Basch:I don't foresee any problems.
Ace:Then Machina will help me take care of her.
"Machina:Really!? That's fine with me, but why...?"
Ace:You named her. So take some responsibility.
"Machina:Alright. I don't mind. I like chocobos, too."
Onion Knight:I'm glad you two can be friends again. Now then...
"Mog:Let's fly, kupo!"
Seven:We never really had a future because of how it all ended...
"Cinque:But we're still alive in this world, aren't we?"
Cater:And we said we would go on a trip!
"Edgar:Well, I would love to show you lovely ladies around our country..."
"Sabin:You're the king, Big Brother. You could feed them all the best food!"
"Seven:That would destroy the balance of this world, and then where would we be."
Cater:Maybe we'll see someplace similar. That would be fun!
Setzer:We can take you anywhere your heart desires with the airship.
Cinque:That's right! Why don't we travel the world?
Edgar:I will do everything in my power to see your wishes fulfilled.
Sabin:Right. Say whatever it is you like!
"Seven:We appreciate the kindness. There might come a time when we lose our way in the future, but..."
"Edgar:It's like Sazh said. In those times, rely on the grown-ups."
Edgar:We will do what we can to help.
"King:Things we couldn't do back home... Now that I think about it, I feel like I was interested in music."
"Rem:You, King!? This is news!"
"King:I can't remember well, but I have a feeling I wanted to perform."
"Jack:Yeaaah, that sounds like fun! Why don't we form a band?"
"Jack:I think Trey would join us, too!"
King:But none of us have ever played an instrument before.
Eiko:I could teach you! There are all kinds of instruments on the airship!
Machina:It seems like our airship is equipped with a lot more than we expected.
"Eiko:Flutes, guitars, fiddles, drums... You can choose whatever you want!"
King:Then let's give it a try.
Jack:Maybe I'll even take this practice seriously!
"Machina:Well, at least you're serious about something..."
Rem:Everyone's mood changed so quickly now that we have time.
"Rem:Is there something you want to do, Machina?"
Machina:I don't know. I've only been thinking about apologizing to Class Zero this whole time...
Rem:Hehe... Then I guess you and I have some thinking to do about how to spend our time here.
Machina:Well...I'd like to spend as much time with Class Zero as possible.
Rem:Oh! Don't you have to take care of that chocobo?
"Machina:Right. If I'm late, I'll get an earful from Ace."
Ciaran:That gentle light's come back to your eyes.
"Ace:I've just delayed the problem. Once this fight is over, we'll have to face it again."
Ace:...I know. I won't do it again.
Ace:I don't want to be taken by that darkness ever again...
"Machina:How are you doing, Chichiri?"
Ace:...What a weird name.
"Machina:It's not that weird! I don't even know why I named her that, though."
Ciaran:I think it's a fine name. She seems to like it.
"Chocobo:Kweh, kweh!"
Ciaran:Are you fine with being here?
Ace:I am. Because it's what my friends chose.
Ace:And Machina is here. Someone I can take my frustrations out on.
Machina:That's fine with me.
Ace:But...we just finished arguing. So I'm out of steam right now.
Machina:You've got to be kidding me!
Ciaran:It means you're friends. Take good care of each other.
"Ciaran:In the future, you'll be happy you did."
Lenna: Father! Do you really have to go?
"King Tycoon: You know I do, dear. I need you to protect the castle. Under no circumstances are you to follow me, do you understand?"
"Lenna: But, Father..."
King Tycoon: Something is wrong with the wind... I must go to the Wind Shrine to make certain nothing's happened to the crystal.
"Lenna: Yes...I've noticed it as well. But, to go alone is-"
"King Tycoon: Lenna. Don't worry, I'll be fine. Have faith."
Faris: The wind just...stopped...
Old Man: I've got to hurry!
Lenna: The wind's stopped. ...Father!
King Tycoon: What in blazes...!?
"Bartz: Boko, wait here, okay?"
"Bartz: Hey, are you all right?"
Lenna: Y-yes... I believe so... I give you my thanks. My name is Lenna. And you are...?
Bartz: Me?
Bartz: Call me Bartz. Me and my chocobo just go wherever the trail leads us...
Lenna: Bartz...
Lenna: This rock suddenly fell from the sky... The impact must have knocked me out.
Bartz: Guess it's a meteorite.
Lenna: A meteorite... I wonder if it has a connection to the wind stopping?
"Lenna: Again, I give you my thanks. I wish I could do something more to show my appreciation, but I really must go..."
"Bartz: Whoa- hey, hold up a sec..."
Lenna: Bartz... Did you hear something?
Bartz: Huh?
Bartz: Over there!
Lenna: Are you all right?
Old Man: Where am I... Oh...my aching head!
Old Man: Sakes alive...what's happened? I don't remember... Ehh...? I can't remember anything!
Bartz: Looks like you hit your head pretty bad... Maybe you got amnesia.
Old Man: Oh! Something came back to me... My name is Galuf!
Lenna: That's a start! Anything else?
"Galuf: ... ...Nope, just the name! Other than that, my memory's a blank slate..."
"Lenna: I'm very sorry...but you must excuse me, I have no time to waste."
Bartz: Where're you going?
Lenna: I must go to the Wind Shrine...
"Galuf: The Wind Shrine! Now that you mention it, I'm pretty sure that's where I was headed! It's decided, I'm going with you!"
Lenna: But...
"Galuf: I could never let such a sweet girl go all by her lonesome. Plus, I know I've gotta get to that shrine...I feel it in my bones. You've gotta take me with!"
"Lenna: Bartz, What about you?"
"Bartz: ...Sorry, I'm gonna bow out on this one. Good luck, though."
Lenna: Bartz... Thank you again. Farewell...
"Galuf: Godspeed, and all that whatnot!"
"Bartz: Come on, Boko, let's go!"
"Bartz: Ow!!! Boko! Bad, bad chocobo! What are you doing, stopping like that!? ...Now don't you give me that look."
Boko: Kweh! Kweh kweh!
"Bartz: ...I know, it's just a girl and an old man... And with all those goblins around... Fine, I got it, I got it."
Lenna: Augh!
Galuf: Geh!
"Bartz: Boko, come on!"
Boko: Kweh!
Lenna: Ohhh...
Bartz: G'morning.
Lenna: Bartz! It seems I cannot escape being in your debt...
"Bartz: Hey, don't worry about it."
Bartz: The shockwave from the meteorite's impact caused landslides... The road's covered in rubble. I don't think you're gonna be able to make it to Tule that way.
"Lenna: But...if I can't get to the Wind Shrine, then..."
Galuf: Uhhhh...
Galuf: Wind Shrine...gotta hurry...
"Bartz: The old guy's pretty dead set on getting there, too... All right. I'll go with you and personally see to it that you get there safely!"
Lenna: Oh! Really?
"Bartz: Yeah! You know, it was my dad's dying wish that I go out and travel the world... Plus, this time, it feels like- like the wind is calling me."
Galuf: What a sweet-talker! As if you don't just have the hots for the little missy.
Bartz: What- You're awake?
Galuf: Don't sound so surprised. This old dog is always ready for anything!
"Galuf: Still, if the road is blocked, that makes things a sight more difficult..."
Bartz: Hrm...
Lenna: ...
Lenna: I won't give up. There must be a way to reach the Wind Shrine!
Galuf: Right! And we'll find it!
Bartz: All right! Let's ride!
Lenna: I don't remember there being a cave here...
"Bartz: Probably opened up during one of those quakes. Boko, I think this is gonna be a little too dangerous for chocobos. You stay here, okay?"
Boko: Kweh!
Bartz: What's that spring?
Bartz: Aha! So that's how you get in!
Bartz: What's that?
Bartz: That ship just now... How was it sailing with the wind so weak?
Bartz: This is a pirate hideout...meaning that ship we saw must've been a pirate ship!
Lenna: I wonder if they would give us a ride?
"Bartz: Um, I think the only ride they'd be interested in would be a keel-haul for all three of us."
Galuf: Yeah...you can't ask a favor from a pirate! That's why we'll just sneak on and steal their ship!
Bartz: Whoa! You're pretty gutsy for an old-timer.
"Bartz: Yo-ho-ho, and stuff! Time to cast off!"
"Galuf: ...Well? ""Cast off"" means start sailing, kid."
Bartz: I know that! The wheel won't even budge. How do you work this thing?
Faris: Try working anything and there'll be the devil to pay!
"Faris: Trying to steal my ship, are you? You've a lot of brass... ...or mayhap you're just lacking in brains! I'd wager it's the latter."
Lenna: Wait! I am Princess Lenna of Tycoon. Please accept my apologies for attempting to commandeer your ship.
Bartz: Wha? Princess...
Galuf: ...of Tycoon!?
"Lenna: Sir, this is a formal request from the kingdom of Tycoon. Please, allow us the use of your vessel. I must get to the Wind Shrine - my father is in danger!"
"Faris: Oho, the princess of Tycoon, here on my ship? I'm sure we could fetch a good price for this one."
"Bartz: Hey! Leave her alone, you degenerate, lecherous, piratey...pirate!"
"Lenna: I beg of you, please..."
Faris: That pendant...!
Faris: ...Toss the lot of 'em into the brig!
"Pirates: Aye-aye, Cap'n!"
"Galuf: Well, this is a fine how-do-you-do. What genius came up with the idea to steal a pirate ship, anyway?"
"Bartz: Look in the mirror, Pops."
"Galuf: ...Ohh, my aching head! I can't remember a thing!"
"Bartz: ...And your amnesia oh-so-conveniently returns. Still...I can't believe you're really the princess of Tycoon, Lenna!"
Lenna: I'm sorry... I didn't intend to keep it a secret.
"Bartz: It's not that big a deal. But, if you're the princess, why were you going to the Wind Shrine all alone?"
"Lenna: My father is there. He hadn't been gone long when the wind slowed down to almost nothing... I just can't shake the feeling that something terrible is happening. I slipped out alone to head to the shrine, but then that meteorite fell, and...you know the rest."
Faris: Why does the princess of Tycoon have the same pendant as I do?
Faris: She said her father's at the Wind Shrine...
"Faris: Prepare to cast off, lads. Set a course for the Wind Shrine."
Pirate: But Cap'n... What about the landlubbers?
Faris: Untie 'em.
"Faris: I meant, sometime today!"
Lenna: But...why?
Faris: I reconsidered your request. You can go back into the brig if you'd rather. Pull anchor! We sail for the Wind Shrine!
Pirates: ...
Faris: Hey! Something wrong with your ears? I hope I don't have to repeat myself!
Faris: Well!?
"Pirates: Aye...aye-aye, Cap'n!"
Lenna: But the wind stopped... How can the ship move?
"Faris: Full of curiosity, aren't you, lass? Syldra! Come up and say hello!"
"Faris: Beautiful, isn't she? Syldra and I were raised together. We're close as siblings."
"Faris: All right, we're off!"
"Pirate: Captain, shall I sail 'er to the Wind Shrine for ye?"
Pirates: Grog! Grog!
Faris: Think I'll stop in and have a drink as well.
"Bartz: Hold on, I'll go check on him."
"Galuf: Bartz, what've you got that goofy look for?"
"Bartz: Uh...nothing, I didn't see anything! Must've been a trick of the light or something..."
"Galuf: For crying out loud, shove over and lemme see!"
Galuf: Great Caesar's ghost! Just gorgeous...sure haven't felt like that in a spell!
Lenna: What in the word are you two going on about?
"Faris: *yawn* Ahh...slept like a babe, I did..."
Faris: What're you two gawking at? Get ahold of yourselves.
"Faris: I need a little time to myself. So shove off, you!"
"Lenna: Mmm...I'm pretty sure that this is Zok's house, but..."
Bartz: Someone you know?
Lenna: Yes. He built the Torna Canal.
Lenna: Looks like Zok isn't home...
"Bartz: Okay then, let's check again later."
Faris: Oho? Trying to give me the slip? I think not.
Chancellor: Princess Lenna!
Lenna: What's happened? What's the matter?
"Chancellor: The wind suddenly stopped, and now there are monsters in the shrine!"
Lenna: What about Father!?
Chancellor: The king went up to the top floor... He has yet to return.
Scholar: Something must have happened to him...
"Faris: The crystal's up on the top floor, right? Won't hurt to go up and take a look."
Lenna: Faris... Come on!
Bartz: Incoming!
Lenna: The crystal-
Bartz: It's shattered!
Bartz: What the-
Bartz: What...
Faris: What's happening?
Galuf: Feels warm...
Lenna: Are these the crystals' essences?
King Tycoon: Le...nna...
Lenna: Father!
"King Tycoon: Listen, and listen well. You four are the chosen ones, the warriors of light...bearers of the four crystal essences."
Lenna: Father... What do you mean?
King Tycoon: The wind crystal has already shattered. The other three crystals are in danger as well. You four must protect them! An evil presence is awakening... One that wishes to return everything to darkness...
Lenna: Father!
"King Tycoon: Go forth, Light Warriors! Save the crystals..."
"Lenna: Wait- No, Father!!!"
Lenna: ...What are these?
Bartz: Guess they're pieces of the crystal...
Bartz: The crystal... it's lending us its power...
"Galuf: ...For now, let's get out of here."
Faris: Lenna...
Lenna: ...There should be a warp panel to the outside behind the altar.
"Zok: Ohhh, Princes Lenna!"
Lenna: Zok! It is good to see you.
Zok: Yes... It's been a long time.
"Lenna: Zok...I have a favor to ask. We must go to Walse, so we need to pass through the Torna Canal."
"Zok: Oh, dead. Ever since the wind crystal was destroyed, the beasts in the canal have multiplied like rabbits! It is much too dangerous to enter! Moreover... I-I seem to have lost the key to the canal somewhere... I'm sorry I cannot help you with the key. Still, since you've come all this way, won't you at least stay the night?"
"Zok: Wonderful. Then, follow me!"
"Bartz: The crystals... Now that I think of it, they're the reason Dad..."
"Dorgann: The crystals must be protected at any cost! Stella - if anything should happen to me, never tell Bartz about the crystals... They aren't his burden to bear."
"Stella: Oh, darling...please don't say things like that..."
Lenna: ... ...Father...I'll protect the crystals...promise...
"Zok: What's the matter, Bartz?"
"Bartz: Nothing... I just was reminded of my folks... They died a while back, though..."
Zok: ...Here. Take it.
Bartz: Huh? Take what?
"Zok: The key to the canal. With it, you can open the gate and travel to Walse. I was worried about Lenna, so I hid the key, but... Please! Take care of her!"
Pirates: Captain! Wait up!
"Faris: Sorry, lads. I'm leaving you laggards behind."
Pirates: Cap'n! But why!? You know we'd follow ye to th' ends of th' earth!
"Faris: I know, and I thank you for it. But not this time."
Pirates: Cap'n!!!
"Faris: This smells of a long journey... While I'm gone, I need you louts to guard the hideout. We can't just let anyone raid our booty!"
"Pirates: But, Cap'n!"
Faris: Please.
Pirates: ...
"Pirates: Aye-aye, sir!"
"Pirates: Wind at your back, Cap'n. Godspeed!"
"Bartz: Lenna, what's wrong?"
"Lenna: The wind crystal has shattered... Right now, the only difference is that the wind has slowed... But soon, it will stop blowing completely. And in a few years, the air will grow stagnant, and the birds won't have any place to fly... Father said that we had to protect the three remaining crystals."
Bartz: ... Three crystals?
"Lenna: Yes, the crystals of fire, water, and earth."
"Bartz: If those were lost too, then..."
"Lenna: At first, nothing would happen. But it wouldn't be very long before the earth began to decay... the seas dirtied and rivers ceased to flow, fires lost their heat and the world became dark and cold... It really would become an unlivable world..."
Galuf: We've gotta protect the crystals!
Bartz: Huh? Did that trigger any of your memories?
Galuf: Nope... Doesn't matter. I'm still gonna help!
"Faris: Well said, old man. I'm coming along too. Plus, we still have to find Lenna's father."
Bartz: King Tycoon? But he disappeared into thin air.
"Faris: He still lives, I feel it in my bones! Never for a moment believe otherwise!"
Lenna: Bartz... Will you come with us?
"Bartz: Before, I was just coming along for the ride... But seeing everyone here..."
Lenna: The crystal shards...
"Bartz: We were given power to protect the world... The power of the wind crystal... ... ... ... That's it, I'm in! We've got some crystals to save!"
Galuf: Sure enough! Let's be off!
Galuf: Bartz! Where in tarnation did you get that key?
Bartz: Does it matter? Let's get going!
Bartz: Hey...what's that?
Lenna: Oh no...the sealed monster...
Faris: Thundering typhoons! The rudder's not responding!
"Galuf: You'd better figure something out fast, 'cause we're getting sucked in-"
"Faris: Syldra, what's wrong!?"
"Bartz: Look alive, something's coming!"
Faris: Syldra!
"Bartz: ...I'm sure she's okay. She's a fighter, and you know it."
Faris: Syldra!!!
"Faris: Lemme go! I said, get off! Syldra!!!"
Bartz: How's Faris?
Galuf: As well as can be expected. We should leave him be.
Bartz: The ship is just drifting with the current...
Galuf: Wonder where we'll end up?
"Lenna: Faris... Syldra is- Surely Syldra is still out there, alive, somewhere..."
Faris: ...
Bartz: Where is this?
Faris: The graveyard of the sea...
Lenna: A gathering place for ruined and scuttled ships...and a nest for the undead.
Galuf: Brrrrr. All the more reason to hotfoot it out of here!
Faris: Do we have to go this way? We'll get soaked...
"Bartz: What, are you going to melt or something? Come on!"
Bartz: I'm soaked... Yow! There's a fish in my shorts!
Lenna: This room seems safe enough... Let's take a rest.
Lenna: I'm going to change into dry clothes... No peeking!
"Bartz: Okay, time to get dry!"
Faris: I'm fine like this...don't worry about me.
"Galuf: Are you crazy, boy? You'll catch pneumonia in those wet things!"
"Faris: Hey, what're you doing? Get away! Don't touch-"
Lenna: What's all the commotion?
Bartz: Yeow! Lenna- this- he-
"Galuf: Oh, my stars and comets! HE'S A SHE!"
Faris: Well- maybe I am! You got a problem with it!?
"Lenna: Of course not... Just, why were you trying to hide it?"
"Faris: When I was just a lad- er, lass, a pirate band took me in. I've been one of them ever since."
"Bartz: Yeah, so?"
"Faris: Well, would YOU want to be the only girl on a ship full of pirates?"
"Bartz: ...Ah, right. Yeah."
Galuf: Haw! I knew from the start that you were too pretty to be a man! *whew...*
Faris: Anyhowmake fun of me for really being a woman and I'll shiver your timbers but good!
Bartz: Uh...okay...
"Faris: That's right, it's okay! Now, I'm turning in, and you louts had best do the same!"
"Faris: Ahhh, slept like a log! Rise and shine, dullards! Time's a-wasting!"
"Faris: Hey, old man! That's enough lollygagging from the likes of you! On your feet! Let's go!"
"Galuf: Bah... If you aren't gonna dress like a girland you should, a real shame to hide such assetsy'could at least talk like one..."
Bartz: Heh... No point in trying to change her... Faris is who she is!
Lenna: That's for certain!
"Bartz: Something's fishy about this place, and it ain't cod..."
Stella: Bartz... Come closer...
Bartz: Mom?
"King Tycoon: Come here, honey..."
Lenna: Father!
Faris: Lenna!? ...ah...
"Girl: Grandpa, over here..."
Galuf: Who's that? I just can't remember...
Siren: Just let us have your soul... become one of us!
Galuf: Demon! What are you?
"Siren: Oho... I didn't expect any of you to escape the effects of my magic... Greetings. I am Siren. I'm afraid your companions' souls now belong to me. Still, I'm feeling generous... I could be convinced to spare yours if you ran home quietly."
"Galuf: You think I would abandon these kids? Fat chance, missy!"
Siren: Why would you risk your life for these people?
Galuf: Because... They're my friends!
Galuf: Don't be fooled by her trickery! Open your eyes!
Bartz: Galuf!
Bartz: Uh-oh- here it comes!
Bartz: Galuf! You saved us... I owe you my life.
"Galuf: Ehh, don't sweat it."
"Bartz: Aww, you're blushing!"
Galuf: I'm doing nothing of the sort!
"NPC: The kingdom of Walse is south of here, beyond the sea. They use a machine to amplify the power of the water crystal."
Lenna: We must stop it! How can we get to Walse?
"NPC: Walse is across the ocean. It's a quick trip by ship, but since the wind slowed, there aren't any ships sailing..."
"Galuf: Hrn... Haven't got Syldra, either..."
Galuf: Faris I'm sorry.
"Lenna: Bartz, have you any ideas?"
"Bartz: No ships, so we can't go by sea... So if we can't go by land or sea, then..."
"NPC: My husband claims he saw a wind drake flying to North Mountain! Everyone says it's hogwashreally now, wind drakes? But then he got all nettled, and now he's having himself a sulk upstairs in the pub. I don't know what to do with him!"
"NPC: I really saw it! Up at North Mountain, flyin' aroundit was a dragon, sure as I live!"
Lenna: What kind of dragonwas it tamed? What did it looks like?
"NPC: Uhh, looked dragonlike... It was wearin' some sort of armor, as I recall... Could've been a real live wind drake!"
Lenna: Hiryu! Fathe's wind drake is on North Mountain...?
Faris: What!? Why would it be there?
Lenna: On North Mountain grows a plant called dragon grass. It is the only substance that can heal a wind drake's wounds... That means Hiryu must be hurt!
"Galuf: Wind drake, huh? ...Say, Bartz. Since land and sea're out..."
Bartz: ...We should take to the air!
Lenna: We could ride to Walse on Hiryu!
"Galuf: That's the ticket! Now, let's get moving to North Mountain!"
Lenna: Father's helmet!
Bartz: Lenna!
"Magissa: Ohohoho... I came here after that wind drake, but seems like I've caught something even more valuable."
Bartz: Wait...you'd hunt a wind drake!?
"Magissa: Of course. Their horns fetch quite a high price on the black market, ohohoho! And I see I've caught no less than the princess of Tycoon! Yes, you'll make a lovely souvenir for my husband."
"Faris: Let her go, you addle-pated foul-complexioned scofflaw!"
Bartz: Faris!
"Magissa: Oops, I guess he slipped. Pity."
Magissa: What!?
Bartz: Lenna! Hang on!
"Magissa: Ooh... Annoying little twerps, ruining my plans... Fine, it just means I'll have to crush all four of you!"
Magissa: Honey! Come here and take out the trash!
"Lenna: Faris, thank you!"
Lenna: Hiryu!
Faris: He's hurt pretty bad...
"Lenna: Hiryu... don't worry, I'll take care of you."
Faris: Lenna! WhatWhere're you going!?
Lenna: Don't come any closer! I will be fine. Just...must reach the dragon grass...
Lenna: Give the dragon grass to Hiryu...quickly...
"Lenna: Please, get well..."
"Galuf: My stars and garters! You're out of your gourd, young ladythat was insanely reckless!"
Lenna: Hiryu...thank you!
Galuf: Looks like you're both hale and hearty again! Let's saddle up!
"Bartz: ...Actually, I, uh, I don't really like heights..."
Bartz: What's so funny!?
"Galuf: Your face, kiddo! Anyway, get on!"
King Walse: Princess Lenna! This is certainly a pleasant surprise!
Lenna: King Walse. You look well.
"Lenna: I come with a request. Please, stop amplifying the power of the water crystal!"
King Walse: Ho ho ho... You must be joking. I could never do that! My people live comfortably thanks to the crystal's power.
"Lenna: King Walse, if left as it is, the crystal will shatter!"
"King Walse: Hmm... I have heard about the incident with the wind crystal... However... No evidence proves that the same thing will happen to the water crystal. Furthermore, I am certain that the people would be opposed to ceasing the crystal's amplification."
"Bartz: Look, we don't have time to be arguing over this..."
Bartz: Holy moly! What's going on!?
NPC: It's an emergency! A meteorite fell near the Tower of Walse!
King Walse: What!?
King Walse: There is no time to lose. Assemble the guard! To the tower at once!
"NPC: Yes, sire!"
King Walse: Pardon this interruption... I believe you understand the severity of the situation. We'll continue this later.
King Walse: Move out!
King Walse: Garula's upstairs... Please...save the crystal...
"NPC: They're controlling you, aren't they! Well, I won't let you destroy the crystal!"
Bartz: Uh-oh- here it comes!
Lenna: Look!
Faris: The crystal...
Lenna: We're too late...
NPC: Uhnnn...
NPC: Uhnnn... ...Lord Galuf!
Galuf: ...Me? You know who I am?
NPC: Lord Galuf... Couldn't protect it... For-forgive...
"Galuf: Hey- stay with me, man! Please, tell me who I am!"
NPC: Fire crystal...protect...ngh...
Faris: The crystal fragments are glowing...
"Bartz: Are they gonna give us their power, too?"
Bartz: What's going on!?
Faris: The towerit's sinking!
Bartz: Aughhh!!!
Faris: Syldra!
Faris: Syldra! You're alive!
Faris: Syldra!
Lenna: Syldra... You used the last of your strength to save us...
"Faris: What are you saying? Syldra! You can't die, I won't let you!"
Lenna: Syldra... Thank you...
Faris: ...Syldra...
Lenna: Bartz!
Galuf: Did he make it? Did he...warp?
Lenna: We won't know until we try!
Galuf: This...this all looks really familiar... And that soldier in the tower knew me... Who am I?
NPC (1): You there! Freeze!
NPC (2): There they are!
NPC (2): They're with the monsters! We saw you all crawl from the meteorite- don't try to deny it!
"Cid: Oh, horsefeathers!"
"Cid: My great escape, and it's another cell! That's the last of my explosives, too... Nuts!"
"Cid: Oh, you kids think that's funny, do you?"
Cid: Ehh...doesn't matter. The name's Cid.
Lenna: What? The same Professor Cid who made those terrible machines to amplify the crystals?
Cid: ...
"Lenna: Forgive me, that was rude..."
"Cid: No, you don't have to apologize. It's the truth, after all. I'm to blame for everything... It's been years... One day, I found an ancient tome in the Library of the Ancients. It said that thousands of years ago, the crystals held much more power than they do now. So, I studied the crystals at Tycoon, Walse, and Karnak, and build machines to enhance them... But I was wrong...increasing their power output only caused them to shatter... Oh, it's all my fault!"
Bartz: But why are you locked up?
"Cid: I was too late to save the crystals in Tycoon and Walse... Figured I could at least save the one here in Karnak. But when I tried to switch off the machine, they threw me in here."
"Bartz: So, you're in the same boat as us..."
Cid: You're here to protect the crystal?
Bartz: Yup! They asked us to!
Cid: What!? A crystal shard... Who are you people!?
Chancellor: This is terrible! Oh no! Professor Cid!
Cid: What's happened?
Chancellor: You were right all along... The crystal's cracked!
Cid: What!?
Chancellor: I turned off the amplifier but the crystal's power output has only increased...
Cid: The fire-powered ship...
Chancellor: Yes? What about it?
Cid: Most likely the fire-powered ship is what's leeching power from the crystal.
"Chancellor: Professor, please. We cannot do this alone. Please help us!"
Cid: I need these kids' help as well.
Chancellor: What? They were seen coming out of the meteorite. They're in cahoots with that werewolf!
"Cid: If they can't help, I guess I can't either."
"Chancellor: ...All right, Professor."
"Cid: You're willing to help me, right?"
Cid: I'll go ahead to the fire-powered ship. It's not exactly a safe place to be...you get ready and meet me there. I'll be waiting!
Soldier: The werewolf!!!
Soldier: Don't let it in!
"Soldier: We scared him off using some of Professor Cid's explosives... But he'll be back, you can count on it."
Cid: Took you long enough! Just as I suspectedthe ship's engine is what's draining the crystal's power.
Bartz: The engine?
Cid: Yes... If the engine isn't stopped- and quickly- the fire crystal will shatter. Will you go?
"Cid: You can get inside here...but it'll be tough going from here on. The ship's packed with monsters! Good luck, kids... We're counting on you."
Lenna: Queen Karnak!
Bartz: What's going on?
Queen Karnak: Infidels... You shall pay for interfering with my revival!
Bartz: Queen Karnak!
Queen Karnak: I...I was being controlled by something...an evil spirit... It desires to envelop everything in darkness...
Bartz: Your highness...
Queen Karnak: The crystals...it's not just the machines that are destroying them... Something evil is using their power to resurrect itself... Please...save the fire crystal. It's in the room just through that pipe...
Lenna: The fire crystal!
"Wolf: Thank goodness, it's still intact!"
Wolf: Galuf!?
"Bartz: We won't let you touch the crystal, werewolf!"
Wolf: Stand down. I am not your enemy!
Bartz: I'm not so sure about that!
"Wolf: Galuf, say something! What's happened...is something wrong?"
"Galuf: You know me? Ughhh... Can't remember a thing... Who in blazes am I, anyway..."
Wolf: You therewhat have you done!? Sending that much power through the crystal will smash it to smithereens!
NPC: And this makes three... One more and the seal is broken. Mwah-hahaha!
Bartz: No good. The switch is broken!
Wolf: Galuf! I'll hold this backyou four must escape! Only one chance remains... Save the earth crystal!
"Wolf: Go! Once the crystal shatters, the whole room will go up in flames! Get out of here, and protect the last crystal with your lives!"
Bartz: Werewolf!
Lenna: We have to help him!
Wolf: Galuf... You're our only hope...
Faris: The flames are dying...
Bartz: The fire crystal must've lost its power...
Lenna: The crystal's shattered...
Galuf: Where's the werewolf?
Bartz: He probably got trapped in the fire...couldn't get out...
Lenna: We have to hurry! The castle was held together by the power of the fire crystal!
"Bartz: Hold upso now that the crystal's gone, the castle's gonna blow!?"
Lenna: Exactly! We've got no time to lose!
Sergeant: You better bring it!
Bartz: This guy...
Lenna: He's no ordinary soldier!
Galuf: Show us your true form!
Sergeant: Hahahahaha! You wish to know my true identity? I am the famed bounty hunter... Iron Claw! MORPH!!!
Bartz: Crystal shards...
Lenna: Will you lend us your power as well?
Cid: If only I'd never made that infernal machine... Everythingall of this is my fault! If it weren't for me...
Bartz: Cid!
Lenna: Professor!
Faris: ...
Galuf: Must be tough for him...
Bartz: Cid!
Cid: Leave me alone! If only I hadn't made that infernal machine...
"Lenna: Professor, it wasn't your fault..."
"Cid: Please, just let me be!"
Bookshelf: Bwah-ha-ha! None shall pass!
"Ifrit: I am Ifrit... For many years I have existed, sealed within the pages of this book... Only those who can withstand my flames will be granted the privilege of summoning me."
Ifrit: ...Enough! You have proven your worth. I shall grant you the use of my powers.
Bookshelf: Bwah-ha-ha! None shall pass!
"Bookshelf: GahIfrit! S-sorry, sir!"
Bartz: What's that?
Lenna: Mid?
Galuf: Stay on your toes! I have a bad feeling about this place.
"Byblos: Arrrgh! So, this is the end...but only for me. Very soon, the master's seal will be blown wide open!!!"
Mid: Huh? I told you not to bother me when I'm reading!
Bartz: Don't tell me you were engrossed in that book the whole time!?
"Mid: What whole time? Now that you mention it, I did hear some rustling behind me... Oh, was that you?"
Lenna: ...!?
Galuf: You've gotta be kidding.
"Faris: A strange bird, this one..."
"Mid: Whatever...guess it's time to go back, huh? You guys coming too? I know a shortcut."
Scholar (1): Mid! There you are!
NPC (2): Mid! You're all right!
NPC (3): Thank you for finding Mid!
NPC (4): Thank goodness you're back!
"Mid: Huh? You came to save me? I dunno what I needed to be saved from, but it was nice of you anyway. Oh yeah! Look at this!"
"Mid: I found the most amazing book! Check it out... I bet with this method, we could repower the fire-powered ship! I've gotta tell Grandpa Cid about it right away!"
Bartz: Cid?
"Mid: Oh, you know of him? He's my grandfather. Grandpa is so awesome! When he's researching, he's unstoppablehe never gives up until he's found the solution!"
"Faris: Maybe that's how he was in the past, but now..."
Mid: What're you talking about?
Faris: I'm just saying... He sure is acting like he's given up now...
Mid: What!? He would never do that!
Lenna: WaitMid!
Bartz: Cid!
Cid: ...
Lenna: Mid isn't here?
"Faris: Come on, man. Pull yourself together!"
Cid: Leave me alone... Don't waste your time on a worthless old lump like me.
Mid: Grandpa!
Cid: Mid?
"Cid: Ouch! Mid, stop that! What are you doing?"
"Mid: What am I doing? What are YOU doing, you silly old fool!? You never give up! Never!"
Cid: Mid...
"Mid: You always told me not to be afraid of failing... That if you messed up, you just had to start over and try again... What happened to that!?"
Cid: Mid...
Cid: Mid... ... Just try again... ... Mid! You're absolutely right!
Mid: Of course I am!
Cid: It's not over. The earth crystal is still out there!
"Bartz: Yeah, but where?"
Cid: That I don't know. But we've got to find it and protect it! And to do that...
"Mid: We'll need the fire-powered ship! I'm right, aren't I?"
Cid: Yes... We'll need the fire-powered ship moving again. But without the crystal...
"Mid: Way ahead of you, Grandpa. Just look at this!"
"Cid: Ohh, where'd you dig this up? Hmm... Ahh, I see, like that... Nice work, Mid, this could do it! All right! Let's get to work!"
Mid: Yeah!
"Mid: Move it, guys!"
"Cid: You'll have to excuse Mid, he's all fired up! We'll take care of the ship, so you kids just sit tight."
"Bartz: Galuf, what's wrong?"
Faris: Yes...you do look even stranger than usual.
"Lenna: Galuf, are you all right?"
Galuf: My head...
Galuf: It was like I could almost remember...
Mid: Grandpa!
Cid: Mid?
Krile: Grandpa!
Galuf: Krile!
"Cid: Ouch! Mid, stop that! What are you doing?"
"Mid: What am I doing? What are YOU doing, you silly old fool!? You never give up! Never!"
"Galuf: Owww! Hey, knock it off!"
Krile: Silly old fool!
Galuf: K... Kri... Krile...
Bartz: Galuf! What happened!?
Lenna: Did you remember something!?
Galuf: I'm...I'm not from this world!
Galuf: I warped here through a meteorite from another world. Because... The evil we'd sealed thirty years ago was beginning to reawaken... So I came to stop it...
Bartz: Evil is reawakening?
"Galuf: That's right... Big, bad evil, toothe dark warlock, Exdeath!"
???: No doubt about it! The power of the four crystals is gathered here!
???: Perfect! We'll use their power to seal Exdeath here!
"Galuf: To seal him, I came here once before, thirty years ago..."
"Lenna: So... If all four crystals are destroyed, then Exdeath's seal will be broken as well?"
Galuf: Right... Ughhh...my head...
Bartz: Galuf!
Galuf: Still...still can't remember clearly...urg... We can't...allow Exdeath t'...be reborn...gkk...
Bartz: Galuf!!!
Galuf: 'M...okay...
Mid: Zzz...zzz...
"Cid: *yawn* ...Ahhh, slept like a top!"
"Mid: *yawn* ...Ahhh, slept like a top! Heheh, I sound like the old man! It's finished! We are so awesome!"
"Cid: Presenting, a boat that will sail without any wind!"
Bartz: So we can use this ship to go find the earth crystal!
Cid: Righto! We're counting on you. We'll return to the Library of the Ancients for now.
Mid: We should be able to find some more clues there.
"Cid: If you need anything, then just stop by!"
Mid: Take care of yourselves!
Bartz: We're off!
NPC: Not again... It's another quake!
"Bartz: What theCrap, the ship!"
"Bartz: Oh no, the ship's sinking!"
Galuf: What the heck is that?
Lenna: A chocobo...?
Faris: Doesn't look like any chocobo I've ever seen.
"Bartz: Whatever it is, I'll catch it!"
"Party member: Go for it, Bartz!"
Black Chocobo: Kweeeh!
Bartz: He's a black chocobo!
Lenna: Oh! This means they aren't extinct after all!
"Bartz: Guess not! Black chocobos can fly, so... Giddyup!"
Black Chocobo: Kweeeh!
Galuf: He didn't giddy. Did you break him or something?
"Faris: Not funny, old man. Sounds like he's got something stuck down his gullet..."
Lenna: Crystal shards!?
Faris: They must have been blown here by the explosion in Karnak...
"Bartz: ...And 'cause he swallowed them, he couldn't fly!"
"Bartz: Ew, they're still sticky."
Galuf: But maybe this time he'll be able to fly!
Cid: Hey! You're back!
"Bartz: Cid... We found Crescent Island, but the fire-powered ship sank!"
"Cid: Oh, so?"
Mid: Whatever. We'll just build another one!
"Cid: More importantly, we've learned the whereabouts of King Tycoon!"
Lenna: What!?
"Cid: He was seen in Karnak. From there, he moved on to the Desert of Shifting Sands..."
"Faris: Shifting Sands, you say?"
"Mid: It's the desert to the west of here, where the sand flows like water..."
"Cid: That's the name. It's impossible for people to enter. They say that past the desert is the Town of Ruin, but no one can actually get there to see."
"Bartz: If no one can enter the desert, how did the king manage to do it?"
Cid: Good question.
Mid: Witnesses claimed to see him floating in midair.
Bartz: Floating!?
Lenna: Father...
"Faris: Come on, it's not like we're getting any closer to that desert by sitting around here."
Galuf: Doesn't matter how close we get TO it if we don't know how to get IN!
"Faris: Maybe we'll see it and be inspired. Don't tell me you're afraid of some sand, old man..."
"Galuf: Please! When I was your age, we crossed burning sand every day and liked it! Come on, Bartz!"
Bartz: Let's check it out!
"Galuf: As expected, it's hopeless..."
Cid: Wait!
"Mid: It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings, and the orchestra hasn't even started tuning up yet!"
Cid: We'll build a bridge!
"Mid: It's a little risky, but you guys are all about danger, right?"
"Cid: How it works is, we use this bell to call the sandworm..."
Mid: ...then you guys trash it...
Cid: ...and there's your bridge!
Galuf: Not the most sophisticated of methods...
Cid: You aren't that sophisticated of a guy! I think it suits you fine!
"Cid: All right, we're going to call the sandworm!"
Mid: You guys ready?
"Mid: Oh yeahif you use any magic on the sandworm, you'll be sorry. Good luck!"
Cid: Here goes!
"Mid: Game, set, and match!"
Cid: Now you can get into the desert!
"Bartz: Cid, Mid, take care of the black chocobo while we're gone, okay?"
Cid: Good luck!
Mid: Take care!
Bartz: Guess this is that Town of Ruin Cid was talking about...
Lenna: That was...
Faris: King Tycoon...?
Lenna: Father!
Faris: ... P...Papa...
Lenna: Faris!
Faris: ...
Lenna: I knew it! You really ARE my sister!
"Faris: I'm sorry... I wasn't certain at first, and then I didn't think I should tell you..."
Lenna: Sister!
Faris: Lenna...
Bartz: Uhhh... Where are we?
Lenna: This place is strange...
Faris: Say...what happened to the old man?
Bartz: Huh? He's not here?
Lenna: We must have gotten separated when we fell...
"Bartz: He'll be okay. He's a tough old cuss! I'm sure we'll run into him again later. Come on, let's get going."
Galuf: Now wait one cotton-picking minute! That was an awfully quick decision to ditch me!
Bartz: Yikes! Uh...sorry!
Bartz: What is this?
Bartz: Look out!
"Cid: East, west, home is best- even if you're a chocobo, huh!"
Mid: Bartz should be thrilled! We went above and beyond the call of duty!
Bartz: Phew... That was close.
Galuf: I suppose that was a warp device.
"Faris: After not being used for so long, activating it must've caused an overload..."
"Bartz: This is...? Hey, it's the fire-powered ship! I thought it had sunk."
Bartz: ...But what's that ship over there?
Bartz: Propellers on a boat? What's up with that?
"Bartz: Cid, Mid!"
Cid: Oww...
"Mid: What the... Bartz? Lenna, Faris, Galuf...what're you guys doing here?"
Bartz: I think that's our line! Where'd you guys come from?
"Mid: We rode the black chocobo back to Crescent Island. Then, all of a sudden a hole opened up beneath us, and we fell..."
"Bartz: Wait, so we're underneath Crescent Island?"
Bartz: That explains the fire-powered ship being here...
Mid: This place must've been built by the Ancients.
Bartz: Huh... And this propeller ship?
"Mid: Uhh...maybe you should ask Grandpa about that. Huh? Wait, where'd he go?"
Cid: Hot diggity dang! This is mind-blowing!
"Bartz: Hey, Cid"
"Cid: Don't bother me, boyo!"
"Cid: ...tighten this...and adjust this...righty tighty, lefty loosey..."
Cid: Voila! That should do it!
Bartz: That should do what?
Cid: That should get this ship moving!
Mid: Wow! Amazing!
"Bartz: Cid, what is this thing?"
"Cid: Isn't it obvious? It's an airship! Amazing...I've only ever seen these in old texts! I can't believe I'm getting to use one in the flesh! ...Er, well, you know what I mean!"
"Bartz: Oof, what was that!?"
Cid: Something's dragging us down!
Bartz: Creeping crawdads! Some monster's got a death grip on the ships's hull!
Cid: Ha! Looks like that overgrown lobster just got served!
Bartz: With cheese biscuits AND mashed potatoes!
Cid: Looks like damage to the ship was minimal... We can use parts from the fire-powered ship to make the airship good as new.
Bartz: Cid...
"Cid: If you're just going to thank me, I don't need to hear it."
Mid: We'll stay here and search for some clues about the earth crystal!
"Cid: The skies are yours, kids. Now get out there!"
"Faris: The evil warlock, Exdeath..."
Lenna: We must prevent him from returning...
Galuf: All that's left is the earth crystal!
Bartz: No point in dawdling... Let's go!
Bartz: What's going on?
Galuf: Look! The town...
Bartz: Cid! Mid! We've got an issue here...
Cid: Save your breath...
Mid: ...'coz we saw the ruins through the telescope!
Mid: This is bad...the earth crystal is way up there!
"Mid: The ancient Ronkans amplified the earth crystal to make their town float. But once they realized amplifying the crystal could make it shatter, they stopped the machine."
"Cid: Shake a leg, miscreants! Somebody's turned the machine back on!"
Lenna: It couldn't- you don't think that Father...
Faris: Never! He would never do such a thing!
Bartz: How're we supposed to get that high?
Cid: With this...
"Mid: ...Adamantite! If we reinforce the ship with it, it'll fly higher! But we'll need to find some more..."
Galuf: That's simple enough!
Galuf: That meteorite I came here in... I remember seeing some adamantite reserves inside!
Bartz: Are you sure?
Galuf: You calling me a liar!?
"Bartz: Of course not... It's just that your memory's still kinda spotty, right?"
Galuf: Pish-posh! The adamantite part is clear as day!
Faris: It's good a place as any to start. Let's go check it out.
Cid: We'll stay and get things prepared.
Mid: You guys hurry and bring us some adamantite!
"Galuf: Hrm...It was around here, I'm sure of it..."
Galuf: There! Inside there!
Galuf: There it is!
"Galuf: How about that! Pretty sharp memory, huh?"
Bartz: How would an amnesiac like you know!?
"Galuf: Ah-hahahahaha! ...Wait, are you mocking me?"
Bartz: There's something in here with us...watch out!
"Cid: Great, you got the adamantite!"
"Mid: Quick, give it here so we can install it! Bartz, you guys take a break."
Bartz: *yawn*... Weird... I dreamt that the airship was already finished...
Cid: Rise and shine! It's done!!!
"Bartz: Yikes, you work fast!"
"Cid: After you lift off, press the A button to fly higher!"
"Lenna: So with this, we can go to the floating ruins?"
"Cid: Technically, yes, but... Well, take a gander at this."
"Cid: The floating city is equipped with a heavy defense system... If you don't disable it, you won't be able to enter."
"Mid: According to this book, the cannons are really powerful..."
Lenna: But we must go!
Faris: No question about it!
Galuf: I don't even see the worry. What's a couple of overblown pop-guns against the likes of us!?
"Bartz: Cid, Mid, thanks for all your help. Now, let's get to the crystal before it's too late!"
"Bartz: Yo-ho-ho, and stuff! Time to cast off!"
Bartz: So much for their defenses!
Lenna: Wait- what's that!?
"Galuf: Cripes, look at the size of it!"
Faris: Guess there's one last thing to take care of...!
"Bartz: So, I guess that hole's the way in?"
Galuf: Sure looks like it.
Faris: We'll know in a second!
Lenna: Father!
King Tycoon: Urgh... That bedamned clapperclaw blocks the path!
Faris: Papa
King Tycoon: Silence! There is no time for chatter! That beast is the guardian of these ruins. It can change its weakness at will... Make yourselves useful and defeat it!
King Tycoon: Oh! Look at it! Such energy! This is the true power of the crystals...!
King Tycoon: Good work! Very good... Mwa-hahahaha...
Lenna: Father!
Faris: Papa!
Bartz: The earth crystal should be just ahead...
Lenna: Father!
Faris: Papa!
Galuf: This is bad! Something's gotta be controlling him!
"Lenna: Bartz, stop!"
Faris: Don't even try it!
Bartz: Step aside!
"King Tycoon: Heh... With the four of you gathered like this, it will be easier to destroy you all!"
Girl: Grandpa! I'm so glad you're okay!
Galuf: Krile... You're...Krile...!
"Krile: Grandpa, I missed you so much..."
Lenna: Father!
Faris: Papa!
"Krile: Oh, don't worry. I just hit him with a little strike of Thunder! He should be okay."
King Tycoon: Ughhh... Where... Lenna...Sarisa? Sarisais that you!?
King Tycoon: It really is you... Sarisa! I can't believe it! You're alive!
Faris: Papa...Papa!
Bartz: Oh
Galuf: Exdeath...!
Exdeath: Galuf. It's good to see you again...for it means I have returned! Mwa-hahahahaha!
Exdeath: Crystals! Obey my magic... Give me your power! Smite these vermin!!!
Bartz: You think we're gonna just sit back and let you do whatever you want!?
Bartz: Nngh...
Lenna: Bartz!
"Exdeath: Hah! Now the crystals have been destroyed. Next shall be your world, Galuf!!!"
Lenna: Father!
Faris: Papa!
"King Tycoon: Sarisa...Lenna...Bartz, and you, warriors from another world. I fear your work is still unfinished. You must not allow the world to disappear into nothingness..."
King Tycoon: Light of earth! Come forth and reclaim your essence from me!
Lenna: Father!
Faris: Papa!
King Tycoon: Get back! The crystal...must be saved...
Lenna: Father! Hold on!
Faris: You can't die!
"King Tycoon: Sarisa... Forgive me... I wasn't...much of a father... Lenna... Sarisa... Please, stay together... Become each other's strength... Bartz...take care of them...as I cannot..."
Lenna: WaitFather! You can't
Faris: Don'tdon't leave us!
Bartz: What's going on!?
Galuf: It's the ruinsthey're falling!
Bartz: We've gotta get out of here! Everybody to the airship!
Faris: Lenna... Come on!
"Faris: Hold fast, this'll be a bumpy ride!"
Faris: Lenna...
"Lenna: Father... He's gone, isn't he..."
Bartz: Galuf... Something wrong?
"Galuf: Yeah... We've got to get moving, and now!"
Bartz: Huh? What's going on?
"Galuf: It's all come back to meI remember everything. Exdeath is an evil warlock from my world... Thirty years ago, he came here to destroy this world's crystals. I and three othersthe Dawn Warriorssealed him with the power of the crystals. Everything was fine for thirty years...we thought it was all over. But something bad was happening to the crystals. Once we figured it out, we took the meteors and came back here... But I was too late... Exdeath's not only been freed, but has returned to our world..."
"Bartz: That's because we used too much of the crystals' power, right?"
"Galuf: No... We were the ones who left Exdeath on this world in the first place. Back then, we should have dragged him back to our world, like he said..."
Bartz: So you guys are really going back?
"Galuf: Yup. We've got to seal Exdeath again. Krile's meteorite should still have some juice left... Probably only enough for one more trip, though. Bartz, Lenna, Faris... Thank you so much for everything. I'll miss you guys."
Bartz: What kinda nonsense is that? We're going with you!
"Galuf: No, you're not. This is the last meteorite. That means that if you went to my world, you'd never be able to come back here. Farewell!"
Krile: Goodbye!
Bartz: Galuf! Krile!
Lenna: Bartz...
Bartz: Yeah?
"Faris: So, we've been talking..."
"Lenna: They're still fighting Exdeath in that other world, and..."
Faris: We've got to avenge Papa!
Lenna: Yes! What's more...
Faris: Galuf... He's...
Bartz: He's one of us.
Lenna: Bartz!
Faris: We knew you'd get it!
Bartz: Let's go thento the other world!
Lenna: ...But how do we do that?
Faris: The meteorites don't have enough power to warp anywhere...
"Bartz: Well, when I think meteorites, I think Cid! He'll probably know something!"
Bartz: It's in Cid's handwriting.
Note: '...adamantite left over from the airship renovations is dangerous... Went to return it...'
Lenna: I hope nothing has happened to Cid...
Bartz: Return the adamantite? That means...
Black Chocobo: Kweh!
Bartz: Huh? What's the black chocobo doing here?
Bartz: Cid! Mid! What're you guys
"Cid: Bartz, stay back! It's dangerous!"
Mid: A huge wave of power just started flowing from the adamantite!
Cid: We just thought to put it back where it came from... Hold on...!
Cid: Jumping Christmas! The floor is absorbing the energy from the adamantite!
Lenna: Say...do you think the meteorite could be recharging? Perhaps it would be enough for us to travel to Galuf's world!
Bartz: That's as good an idea as any.
Cid: What? What are you going on about?
"Cid: Hmm, so that's your plan!"
Mid: But this piece of adamantite is too small. There's not enough power for this meteorite to get you to the other world. But maybe if all four meteorites' powers were combined...
Bartz: ...it'd be enough to warp to Galuf's world!
Cid: All right... Let's get to the next meteorite!
Mid: Yeah!
Cid: Wait right here!
Mid: Be right back!
"Lenna: They've been inside for quite some time, don't you think?"
Faris: We'd better check on them.
Cid: Help!
Mid: Yeow! Help us!!!
Bartz: Come on!
Lenna: Are you all right?
Mid: We are now!
Cid: That was close!
Cid: All right... Let's get to the next meteorite!
Mid: Yeah!
"Cid: Come on, Mid!"
Mid: Yeah!
"Cid: Gadzooks! It's a den of monsters! Er, you kids can go ahead."
"Cid: Much obliged. Now, you can leave the rest to us!"
Cid: All right... Let's get to the next meteorite!
Mid: Yeah!
Cid: Wait here!
Mid: Leave it to us!
Cid: That's that!
"Mid: Okay, let's hurry!"
Bartz: Cid! Mid! Look out!
Cid: Are you all right?
Mid: That was awesome!
"Cid: That's all four meteorites! Now, take a look at this map."
"Mid: See where the energies from all four meteorites intersect? That's the warp point. Now, get over there!"
Cid: Be careful!
"Bartz: Thanks for everything, guys."
Lenna: The light is fading...
Bartz: There's not much power left from the meteorites.
Faris: No turning back now!
"Bartz: A one-way trip, huh? You guys sure about this? We probably won't be able to come back home..."
Lenna: That doesn't matter...this is more important.
Faris: Aye. We're in this 'til the bitter end.
Bartz: All right then...let's go!
"Lenna: I suppose this is goodbye to our world... Farewell, Chancellor..."
"Faris: ...Buck up, mateys. I know you can handle the looting and pillaging without me."
"Bartz: Be good while I'm gone, Boko! Don't get into too much trouble!"
Bartz: Huh...sleeping.
Pirate: Hrn hum harr...buh?
Bartz: Wha...those look like Boko's footprints! Don't tell me he tried to go after us...
Bartz: Boko!
Boko: Kweh...
Lenna: Oh! He's been hurt!
"Doctor: Found him zonked out in the cave, so we brought him back here. But he'll be fine, now that he's in my capable hands."
"Bartz: Please, if you can help him, doc..."
Doctor: Leave everything to me!
Faris: Don't forget about me!
Faris: See ya.
"NPC: Yeah, I reckoned so. First, shut your eyes...can't have just anybody figuring out where it's at."
"NPC: All right, here we are!"
NPC: That pirate boss went upstairs.
"NPC: Why don't you have a seat, big boy? Then, just keep your eyes on me... Tee-hee-hee!"
NPC: I'm...I'm not looking at anything! ...You perv! Get yer mind out the gutter!
"NPC: Mm... For you, honey, we've got something special!"
NPC: Wooo!
"NPC: Howdy! I assume you're new to this adventuring thing, right?"
"NPC: All righty, then come on in!"
"NPC: Sorry, but we can't have pros coming round and spooking the rookies. Hi-yah!"
NPC
NPC: Two-Handed
NPC: Inside this chest is a present from me!
"NPC: A-hua-hua! Sometimes monsters hide in treasure chests. From now on, be careful!"
NPC: Welcome! One night is 10 gil. Would you like to stay?
Chancellor: Princess Lenna!
Lenna: Forgive me... I didn't mean to worry you.
"Chancellor: No need to fret about that now. But please, you must return to the palace! Our guard has been severely weakened by monster raids, but there is no way we can recover without our princess!"
Lenna: I'm sorry...I cannot stay.
"Chancellor: Princess, you have a responsibility to this kingdom!"
"Lenna: Yes...but more importantly I have a responsibility to the world. Right now, we are all in danger... What's more... Father is still alive, and I"
"Chancellor: ...I understand. Princess Lenna, we will protect the kingdom, I swear it!"
"Lenna: And I swear to return, and bring Father back. Until that time, please hold things together here."
"Chancellor: For now, will you at least stay the night?"
Lenna: Certainly.
Lenna: Faris?
"Faris: Hm? Ah, Lenna. It's late...you should be in bed."
Lenna: So should you...Sister.
Faris: ...!!!
"Lenna: I'm right, aren't I? You're my older sister..."
"Faris: Wh-what are you going on about? Me, your... That's daft!"
Lenna: But...
"Faris: Besides, a buccaneer like me, really a princeer, princess? 'Tis a bit much, that!"
Lenna: But...your pendant...
???: Bartz...Bartz!
Bartz: ... *snort* ...nhuh?
Lenna: *giggle*
"Galuf: What in tarnation are you doing, kid?"
Faris: I think he's a few men short of a full crew...
NPC: The chancellor's gone outside...he said he had something for Princess Lenna.
Jenica: I've served in this castle for quite some time. I looked after both Princess Lenna and Princess Sarisa.
Bartz: Sarisa?
"Jenica: Princess Lenna's older sister. Sarisa was sailing with her father when a storm hit, and she was lost at sea."
"Chancellor: Princess, this staff has been kept in your family for generations. Take it. I'm sure you can find it of use."
Lenna: Thank you!
King Walse: Princess... You were completely right... *cough cough*
Lenna: King Walse! Don't push yourself...
King Walse: You must hurry to Karnak. Their fire crystal is being amplified with a machine similar to ours. It seems that a meteorite has fallen outside of Karnak as well... There is no time to lose...
"NPC: I was investigating the meteorite that fell near Karnak when I was suddenly warped here... Hey- where is ""here,"" anyways? Where'd Karnak Castle go?"
"Shiva: I am Shiva, the ice goddess... If you would command me, first you must prove your worth!"
"Scholar: Hey Bartz! It's me! Look, we've got to hang out later. It'll be like old times."
"Scholar: Read or not, here I come!"
Bartz: O-ka-aaay!!!
Bartz: Hey... Somebody...anybody!
"Scholar: Heheh, ever since then you've been afraid of heights, huh? When I was a kid, everyone teased me for being dumb, but now I'm gonna be a scholar, 'coz I'm S-M-R-T smart!"
"Bard: You used to live in this house? You must have a lot of memories here. Please, take your time and look around."
Dorgann: Is he asleep?
Stella: ...You're leaving again so soon?
Dorgann: ...No. I'm not going anywhere.
"Stella: The spasms aren't as frequent anymore... I can get by on my own now. Still, it would be nice if you stayed... not to take care of me, but just so we could be together, as a family..."
"Dorgann: I know. But get some sleep. You're still sick, and you need the rest."
"Stella: I will, dear. Just let me finish this up first."
"Bartz: You're leaving again, aren't you?"
Dorgann: So you were awake.
"Bartz: Daddy, are you going to get more bad guys?"
Dorgann: That's what I do.
Bartz: I wanna come!
"Dorgann: You need to stay here and take care of your mother. Don't tell her you saw me leave, all right? It'll be our little secret."
"Bartz: Okay, Daddy."
Dorgann: Now it's time for good little boys to go to sleep. Stella! Worry about that tomorrow and come get some rest.
Dorgann: Stella?
Dorgann: STELLA!!!
"Bard: That's a beautiful melody. It brings to mind a poem... Here, this is for youand your memories."
"NPC: Bartz! For you, son, it's free. Stay and rest a spell!"
Faris: Bartz... You okay?
"Bartz: Oh, Faris..."
Bartz: Meet my mom.
Faris: Eh?
"Bartz: You know, I was born here in this village. Mom passed on when I was still young... After that I traveled with Dad for a long time. But three years ago, he got real sick..."
Bartz: That should do it...
Bartz: He always wanted to be buried here with Mom. Dad was so strong...
"Faris: A father, huh... wonder what that's like."
Bartz: Faris?
Faris: Let's head back. Lenna'll worry if she wakes and finds us gone.
VICKS:There's the town...
"WEDGE:Hard to believe an Esper's been found intact there, 1000 years after the War of the Magi..."
VICKS:Think it's still alive?
WEDGE:Probably... ...judging from the urgency of our orders.
"VICKS:And this woman, this...sorcerer. Why's she here? I heard she fried 50 of our Magitek Armored soldiers in under 3 minutes."
WEDGE:Not to worry. The Slave Crown on her head robs her of all conscious thought. She'll follow orders.
WEDGE:We'll approach from the east. Move out!
WEDGE:Let's put her on point. No sense taking any risks. Forward!
GUARD:Imperial Magitek Armor? Not even Narshe's safe anymore!
"GUARD:Machine-riding, self-important swine! Take this!"
GUARD:Narshe's freedom depends on us!
"WEDGE:According to our source, the frozen Esper was found in a new mine shaft. ...Maybe this one..."
VICKS:I'll handle this. Stand back!
"GUARD:We've got 'em trapped, now!"
GUARD:We must defend the mines!
GUARD:We won't hand over the Esper!! Whelk! Get them!
VICKS:Hold it! Think back to our briefing......
WEDGE:What about it?!
VICKS:Do you recall hearing about a monster that eats lightning......
WEDGE:......and stores the energy in its shell!
"VICKS:Right. So whatever you do, don't attack the shell!"
WEDGE:Alright already!
WEDGE:Hey! What's the matter? Do you know something we don't......?
WEDGE:Where's that light coming from?! Uwaaaaaaa!!!!
VICKS:Hey! Wedge......where are you? W......what's happening?!
Girl:...... ...... ......
GIRL:Where am I...?
OLD MAN:Whoa! And I only just removed the crown!
OLD MAN:Easy! This is a Slave Crown. The others had complete control over you while you were wearing it.
GIRL:I can't remember a thing...
"OLD MAN:Don't worry. It'll all come back to you...in time, that is."
OLD MAN:Impressive! I've never heard of anyone recovering this fast...!
SOLDIER:Open up! Give us back the girl and the Empire's Magitek Armor!!
SOLDIER:Open this door! We want that girl! She's an officer of the Empire!
TERRA:Empire...? Magitek Armor...?
"OLD MAN:Look, I have to get you out of here! I don't have time to explain!"
OLD MAN:Over here!
OLD MAN:Make your way out through the mines! I'll keep these brutes occupied!
"KEFKA:My sweet little magic user...! Uweee, he, he! With this Slave Crown I'll practically OWN you!!"
"KEFKA:Uwee, hee, hee! Good! Burn up everything!"
"GESTAHL:We stand on the brink of a major breakthrough! In the days to come, we'll witness a total revival of magic!"
"GESTAHL:It is our destiny, and ours alone, to take this mystic force and claim what is rightfully ours!"
"GESTAHL:With our new-found power, nothing can stand in our way!"
OLD MAN:Took you long enough! How goes the robbing and plundering trade?
LOCKE:I PREFER the term treasure hunting!
OLD MAN:Ha! Semantic nonsense!
LOCKE:There's a HUGE difference!
"LOCKE:Anyway, were you the one who sent for me?"
OLD MAN:Yeah. There's a girl I'd like you to meet.
"LOCKE:......!? This better not have anything to do with that Magitek-riding, imperial...witch!!!"
"OLD MAN:Imperial troops are pursuing her even as we speak. This town is no match for the Empire. Our independence can only be assured if we join forces with the Returners, an underground resistance movement. That girl wasn't responsible for her actions. We must get her to understand our dilemma!"
LOCKE:All right... I think we'd better help her...
"OLD MAN:Agreed. Make your way first to Figaro, and talk to the king."
GUARD:Now we gotcha!
LOCKE:Wonderful... There's a whole bunch of 'em...
LOCKE:Moogles...! Are you saying you want to help me?
MOOGLE:Use us to save Terra from the guards! Need more information?
"LOCKE:Thanks, Moogles! We're in your debt!"
LOCKE:I think this switch'll...
LOCKE:Eh? You back with us now?!
TERRA:You...saved me?
LOCKE:Save your thanks for the Moogles!
TERRA:Uhh...I can't remember anything...past or present...
LOCKE:You have amnesia?!
TERRA:A man said my memory would come back...
LOCKE:Give it time. You're safe with me! I give you my word!
"LOCKE:I won't leave you until your memory returns!! By the way, this secret entrance might be useful some day. Don't forget about it!"
"MAN:You mean, THIS young woman...?!"
TERRA:Who do you think you are?
MAN:How rude of me to turn my back to a lady!
"EDGAR:I am Edgar, King of Figaro.LOCKE:Surprised someone like me knows a king?"
LOCKE:Talk to you later!
"EDGAR:So...you're an Imperial soldier! No problem. Figaro and the Empire are allies! Please, relax while you're here. It's not in my blood to harm a lady."
"TERRA:Look, why are you helping me? Is it because of my...abilities?"
"EDGAR:I'll give you 3 reasons: First of all, your beauty has captivated me! Second...I'm dying to know if I'm your type..."
"TERRA:......? What's with you, anyway?"
EDGAR:Guess my technique's getting a bit rusty...
TERRA:Hmm...I suppose a normal girl would have found him dashing. But I'm hardly...normal...
MATRON:Edgar has a twin brother. He was such a nice boy...
"YOUTH:Brother, What's wrong with father? What's all this talk of his successor?"
EDGAR:Are you blind? Look how thin his face has become!
YOUTH:?......What is it?
"MATRON:Yes... His name is Sabin. Oh, he looked so like his father! When he ran away, he was a sweet little child. I wonder what he's like now?"
EDGAR:Well? How do you like my castle?
EDGAR:Probably Kefka!
KEFKA:Phooey! Emperor Gestahl's stupid orders!
"KEFKA:Edgar, you pinhead! Why do you have to live in the middle of nowhere? These recon jobs are the pits!"
KEFKA:Ahem...there's SAND on my boots!
"SOLDIERS:Yes, Sir! All set, Sir!"
KEFKA:Outta my way!
"EDGAR:What brings Kefka, humble servant of Emperor Gestahl, into our lowly presence?"
KEFKA:A girl of no importance recently escaped from us. We heard she found refuge here...
"EDGAR:Hmm...this wouldn't have anything to do with this ""witch"" everyone's been whispering about, would it?"
KEFKA:Lies! She...merely stole something of minor value. Is she here?
EDGAR:That's a tough one!
"EDGAR:You see, there're more girls here than grains of sand out there. I can't keep track of 'em all!"
"KEFKA:I'd hate to be you if we find out you're lying... Mwa, ha!"
KEFKA:I truly hope nothing happens to your precious Figaro...!
LOCKE:I'd say that guy's missing a few buttons...EDGAR:...Where's Terra?
EDGAR:Take her to her room...
"EDGAR:I'd love to chat with you, but the Chancellor and I must plan our strategy. Sometimes I hate being a king! If you'll excuse me."
LOCKE:Follow me.
LOCKE:Don't you worry 'bout a thing! I'll...
"TERRA:You're Locke, right? Edgar told me about you. Is it true you're a thief?"
LOCKE:That's TREASURE HUNTER!
"LOCKE:On the surface, Edgar pretends to support the Empire. The truth is, he's collaborating with the Returners, an organization opposed to the Empire. I am his contact with that group..."
LOCKE:The old man you met in Narshe is one of us.
TERRA:Empire...but I'm a soldier of the Empire...!
LOCKE:That's not true! They were using you! Things are different now.
TERRA:I don't understand... What should I do?
LOCKE:I can't tell you what to do. You don't have to decide right now. You'll soon find your way...
TERRA:But how will I know which way is right...
EDGAR:...? What the...?!
EDGAR:What's happening?
SOLDIER:It's the Empire! It's Kefka!
EDGAR:What are you doing?
KEFKA:Bring me the girl. Now!
EDGAR:I don't know what you're talking about!
KEFKA:Then... welcome to my barbecue!! Uwa ha ha ha!
EDGAR:Get ready...!
"SOLDIER:Yes, Sir!"
KEFKA:Changed your mind...?
EDGAR:I guess I have no choice...
EDGAR:Or maybe I do!
"KEFKA:Ackk! Shameful that a king should flee, leaving his people behind! How utterly delightful!"
EDGAR:OK! Dive now!!!
SOLDIER:Figaro Submerge Mode engaged!
CHANCELLOR:No one can touch the people of Figaro!
KEFKA:Go!! GET THEM!
"EDGAR:Bravo, Figaro!!!"
KEFKA:Son of a submariner! They'll pay for this...
LOCKE:This is great!
TERRA:Was that a bad person? I... I'm scared...
"EDGAR:Terra, there's someone I'd like you to meet...!"
LOCKE:We're members of the Returners.
"EDGAR:Our mentor, Banon, would certainly like to meet you. ""Magic"" is going to be the key to winning this war."
EDGAR:Terra has magical powers. That Esper seemed to...react to her. Can there be some connection?
TERRA:I haven't the foggiest! It just seems natural to me that I have the use of this power...
"EDGAR:But no HUMAN is born with the powers you seem to have, and..."
EDGAR:I apologize.
TERRA:What should I do...?
"EDGAR:I'm sure the Empire is going to come after you... If they get their hands on you again, the world's finished... Terra, you want to understand your own powers, right?"
EDGAR:Then I think we need to consult with Banon.
EDGAR:OK! To the south there's a cave that leads to South Figaro.
SOLDIER:King Edgar! Where are you headed?
"EDGAR:Through the cave, and eastward to South Figaro."
"EDGAR:Return to the castle, and tell the others we're safe."
"SOLDIER:Yes, Sir! Take care!"
"VARGAS:Sabin sent you, right?"
LOCKE:Who're YOU?
EDGAR:Sabin? Is he here?
"LOCKE:You were shadowing us earlier, right?"
VARGAS:And how unlucky it is that you have run into me...!
"VARGAS:Is that you, Sabin?!"
"SABIN:Vargas, why'd you do it? How could you do your own father in like that?!"
"VARGAS:Fool! He made the mistake of choosing you as his successor! He snubbed me, his only son!"
SABIN:No! You were the one he chose!
VARGAS:You're a liar!
"SABIN:Our Master wanted you to be his successor, not me. He appreciated your fine spirit......"
"VARGAS:Enough of your lies! Now, have a taste of my superior technique!"
VARGAS:Mortal Attack! Blizzard Fist!
"VARGAS:Ahh, Sabin! The master taught you well!"
SABIN:: I guess there's no avoiding this!
"VARGAS:Fate made us train together, and fate will send you to your doom!"
VARGAS:W......what the......?! He......already taught you that?!
SABIN:: If only you hadn't been in such a rush for power......
SABIN:Big brother?
LOCKE:The brothers are reunited!
"TERRA:Younger... ""brother""? At first glance I thought he was some bodybuilder who had strayed from his gym..."
SABIN:I'll...take that as a compliment...
"SABIN:Anyway, brother, what are you doing here?"
EDGAR:We're on the way to the Sabil mountains.
"SABIN:To the Returner hideout, no doubt?"
"SABIN:I've been watching from afar, hoping that the world might regain some sanity... At this rate, Figaro will be reduced to a puppet state."
EDGAR:Our time to strike back has arrived. The Empire's going to pay for what it has done...
"SABIN:Think a ""bear"" like me could help you in your fight?"
EDGAR:You'd...join us? Sabin...!!
SABIN:I think Duncan would rest easier if he knew his disciple played a part in bringing peace to the world.
LOCKE:Let's get going!
EDGAR:Banon! We brought the girl with us.
BANON:Is she the girl who can talk to Espers...?!
EDGAR:Seemed the Empire had complete control over her.
BANON:Carrier pigeons brought word that she wiped out 50 of the Empire's best soldiers in a few minutes.
TERRA:That's a lie!!!
EDGAR:Banon! She doesn't remember ANYTHING!
"BANON:Stay where you are! Perhaps you've heard this story? Once, when people were pure and innocent, there was a box they were told never to open. But one man went and opened it anyway. He unleashed all the evils of the world: envy... greed... pride... violence... control... All that was left in the box was a single ray of light: Hope."
"BANON:We now confront those evils... And you are that last ray of light, our only hope..."
BANON:I'm so tired... Let me rest a while.
LOCKE:Someone important to me was jailed by the Empire. I've hated the Empire ever since... I joined the Returners when I realized the Empire was rotten to the core. I wanted to make a difference.
"TERRA:But...I have no significant ""other"" in my life..."
"LOCKE:That's not entirely true. Besides, I'm sure there are people who feel YOU'RE important to them! They are counting on you..."
"EDGAR:It's gonna be tough to talk you into helping us... If we push you too hard, we're no different than the Empire... So we want you to make up your own mind."
"SABIN:The only thing I can add is that you can trust my brother implicitly. He's always been fair with me. You can trust him, Terra... But don't you DARE tell him I said that!"
BANON:What's going on? What happened?
TERRA:He's badly wounded!
BANON:Someone did a number on him...
BANON:They've found us... We haven't a moment to lose!
"LOCKE:I know... ""Someone"" has to sneak into South Figaro and slow the Empire down, right?"
EDGAR:This's right up your alley! Good luck!
"LOCKE:Terra... Please wait for me... And...please... ...don't let a lecherous young king, who shall remain nameless, near you!"
SABIN:Big brother... Aren't you EVER going to grow up?
BANON:What're we going to do?
"EDGAR:We'll escape down the Lete River, and make our way to Narshe. I want to see that Esper for myself..."
"BANON:Right. There's a raft by the back entrance. It's a gamble, but we're fresh out of options..."
EDGAR:You're in danger here. Come with us to Narshe. You'll probably even gain some understanding of your own abilities...
BANON:We've no time to dilly-dally. Let's make for Narshe!
SABIN:I guess we thrashed it.
EDGAR:Don't bet on it...... It's probably just hiding from us......
TERRA:Ewww!! Something's stuck to my leg!
EDGAR:Terra! Over here!
BANON:It's all right now.
SABIN:Watch out! I'm going to hit it with a Blitz!
EDGAR:No! Sabin!!
"SABIN:Don't distract me, brother!!"
EDGAR:He's always been a tad zealous......
BANON:Don't worry about him!
"EDGAR:Are you sure he's okay, Banon?"
BANON:You should know better than any of us! Any moment he'll flop right onto the raft!
SABIN:What the...?
EDGAR:Seems a little too perky...... Ha...!
EDGAR:Sabin!!!! Take care of yourself!
LOCKE:Nuts! Gotta get to Narshe on the fly...
"MERCHANT:You're that thief, Locke, aren't you?"
"LOCKE:Hey! Call me a treasure hunter, or I'll rip your lungs out!"
LOCKE:Here we go!
"LOCKE:These are a little tight, but the price was right."
LOCKE:I've seen her before... Of course! She's one of the Empire's generals!
GUARD:This's what happens to traitors!
"GUARD:So, the mighty Celes has fallen!"
CELES:How can you serve those cowards...
GUARD:Hold your tongue!
"CELES:Isn't it true Kefka's going to poison the people of Doma, to the east?"
GUARD:I'd hate to be in your shoes tomorrow!
LOCKE:I'm with the Returners. Name's Locke.
CELES:Returners!!! I used to be General Celes... Now I'm just a common traitor...
LOCKE:Let's go!
CELES:!? You'd take me along?
"CELES:Thanks, but no thanks. I can barely walk..."
"CELES:I'm grateful, but... Even if you got me out, you'd never be able to protect me. No, I think I'm better off here."
LOCKE:I'll protect you!
LOCKE:Trust me! You'll be fine!
LOCKE:Let's go!
CELES:This soldier has something important on him...
"SOLDIER:...'n some bread, too... Mumble Mumble..."
CELES:Why are you helping me?
LOCKE:You remind me of someone...
"LOCKE:But what's it matter, anyway? I just want to, okay?!"
LOCKE:What IS that noise?
CELES:Something's coming outta the wall!!
CELES:TunnelArmr!! I'll draw its magic attack. It won't hurt us.
LOCKE:Come again?!
CELES:I can simply absorb the attack with my Runic Blade.<
LOCKE:Are you sure you'll be okay?!
CELES:Just you watch!!
LOCKE:Whew!!! Looks like we're in the clear!
"TERRA:When Locke first helped me, he fiddled with something right around here."
EDGAR:Knowing him there's probably some secret switch in this rock wall...
TERRA:What's that...?
"EDGAR:I think this's a security check point. If we follow the light exactly, we'll probably be okay. If we make a mistake, the light'll surround us. To proceed safely we must ""tag"" the glimmering light."
ARVIS:Banon! King Edgar! ...and Terra!!!
BANON:Arvis! What's happening here in Narshe?
"ARVIS:The town's neutral. I've tried to get the people to side with the Returners, but... Anyway, why on earth have you come here?"
"EDGAR:First, how are your people doing?"
ARVIS:They all went...slightly berserk when the Esper was discovered.
BANON:We believe this young woman is our only hope of reaching out to that Esper.
ARVIS:My people are dying to know what the Esper looks like.
EDGAR:That Esper is either going to save us...or dig us an early grave...
"SOLDIER A:Hey, have you heard?"
"SOLDIER B:Oh, you mean..."
"SOLDIER A:Shhh! Quiet down. If Kefka catches us, we're toast."
"SOLDIER A:If he drives General Leo out of our battalion, he'll probably become the next general!"
"SOLDIER B:Don't make me laugh! If someone like him becomes a general, I'll go home!"
SOLDIER A:Shhhhh! What if he hears you? You'll be jailed!
"SOLDIER B:Alright, alright!"
"SOLDIER B:Uh, oh... Here he comes... Back to the waiting zone!"
"KEFKA:Hey, you! You keeping a sharp lookout?"
"SOLDIER A:Yes, Sir. You're Kefka, correct? How are you, Sir?"
KEFKA:Please! Save your petty small talk! Just do your job!
SOLDIER B:Phew...! Someone's gotta put that guy away! I'd like to tell him to his face he's no General Leo!
SOLDIER A:Shhhh! Do I always have to tell you to keep it down?! You're hopeless...!
"SOLDIER A:I hate that weirdo, Kefka. I don't even think he's human, not like General Leo..."
COMMANDER:You two! We're about to storm Doma Castle...
DOMA SENTRY:It's hopeless. We can't keep them out.
"DOMA SENTRY:So, it's finally happening..."
"CYAN:If we can fell their commander, they'll surely give up."
CYAN:Let us give it a try.
CYAN:Thou musn't give up the fight!
DOMA SENTRY:Sir Cyan! Let their commander have it!
"CYAN:I am Cyan, retainer to the King of Doma. I am your worst nightmare..."
TROOPER:The general's been defeated! Run!!!
"CYAN:Walled up in there, we can wait out our enemy!"
SOLDIER:General Leo. The citizens of Doma seem to be playing a waiting game...
"LEO:So, that's their strategy."
SOLDIER:General. We're ready to take the castle. Just give the order...
"LEO:Patience! If we attack now, we'll have to sacrifice too many lives."
"SOLDIER:But, General! I'm ready to lay my life down at any time for the Empire!"
"LEO:You're from Maranda, right?"
SOLDIER:Y...yes Sir. Why?
"LEO:And your family lives there? Fall in battle, and I'll have to deliver the bad news... What shall I say to them? You have a life to go back to someday. Don't throw it all away for nothing. Emperor Gestahl wouldn't want that."
"SOLDIER:Yes, Sir!"
SOLDIER:General Leo!
SOLDIER:A carrier pigeon from Emperor Gestahl.
LEO:The Emperor summons me. I must return immediately.
"SOLDIER:I understand, Sir."
LEO:Right. I'll leave Doma in your hands.
"SOLDIER:Yes, Sir."
LEO:Okay... Just don't jump the gun.Please...
"SOLDIER:Sir! Leave it to us, Sir!LEO:Right."
"KEFKA:Now that Leo's gone, I'll turn this water into a flowing river of poison!"
LEO:The Emperor has ordered me to return home. I don't want any trouble here!
KEFKA:You loser! I'll take care of this situation in no time!
"LEO:Don't be pompous! And DON'T forget that they are PEOPLE, just like you and me."
KEFKA:We need not spare those lands that gave rise to the Returners!
KEFKA:You just go and be a good little boy...!
KEFKA:Is the poison ready?
"SOLDIER:But, General Leo said..."
KEFKA:He's no longer here! I'm in charge now. Pour it!
SOLDIER:Some of our people are prisoners inside the castle! If we poison the river...
KEFKA:Do it! Take 'em all out!
"KEFKA:Unh? Silence! You're history, bub..."
SABIN:Kefka! Wait!!!
"KEFKA:""Wait,"" he says...... Do I look like a waiter?"
"KEFKA:Ha, ha, ha! ...What a toad!"
"KEFKA:Huh!? How long do you expect me to put up with you? Next time, you're a goner."
"KEFKA:Oh, gripe! Hey! If you know what's good for you..."
"KEFKA:Hee, hee! Nothing can beat the music of hundreds of voices screaming in unison! Uwa, ha, ha!"
DOMA SENTRY:Sir Cyan! The Empire's base is bustling with activity. Something must be up!
CYAN:Huh? The water looks odd...
DOMA SENTRY:Sir Cyan!
CYAN:This is... POISON!
"DOMA SENTRY:What lowdown, contemptible...!"
CYAN:Guard our liege!
"DOMA SENTRY:To the King, on the double!"
CYAN:Right! The King's room is near!
CYAN:Your Highness! Fear not!
KING DOMA:Who's there?
"CYAN:Cyan, Excellency."
KING DOMA:Indeed! My sight is going fast... Can't see a thing...
CYAN:Excellency! Hang on!
"KING DOMA:Cyan... You have defended the realm since my father's days...hack, cough... Thank you... It's over... Our kingdom is through."
"CYAN:Not yet, Highness!"
KING DOMA:I fear for your family. Uhh...chest is on f...fire...
CYAN:Save your strength! Don't talk!
KING DOMA:Go...run to your family...hack... gasp... ......
DOMA SENTRY:Sir Cyan!
CYAN:There have to be some survivors in the castle!
DOMA SENTRY:Let's split up...
CYAN:Elayne! Elayne! Wake up!
CYAN:This... This...can't be happening!
CYAN:! Owain... NOT YOU TOO! Son...you can't BOTH leave me!
CYAN:D... Dear me...
CYAN:I...impossible! Idiotic!!!
CYAN:We can't forgive this! The Empire must pay!
"WARRIOR:I am Cyan, retainer to King Doma!"
"SOLDIER:The enemy! Get ready, everyone!"
SABIN:May I give you a hand?!
CYAN:Thank you... whomever you are.
CYAN:Ohhh! This is too much!
SABIN:Let me have at it!
"CYAN:What a mess!! Be careful, Sir!!"
CYAN:Urgh!!! Who released this poison?
CYAN:The thought had occurred to me as well!
"CYAN:Thank you, kind sir!"
"SABIN:Allow me to thank you! I am Sabin, from Figaro. Now, let's scram!"
"CYAN:But what of my home, my family...my friends?"
SABIN:Look... If we stick around any longer we'll have a regiment of troops down our throats.
SOLDIER:Got 'em! Over here!
"SABIN:Hoo, boy... I have a great idea... Come over here."
CYAN:Sir Sabin! What on earth are these?
SABIN:I'll explain later! Relax. Just climb in!
CYAN:Sir Sabin! How might these abominations be manipulated?
SABIN:I'm getting sick of this! Thou art such a pain in the...! Confound it all! I'm starting to talk like you! Now listen! Just use those levers located by your hands.
CYAN:Sir Sabin!! It is I who is in your debt!
"SABIN:Forget it. Now, come on!"
SOLDIER:Hey! What are you doing?
CYAN:Aaahhh! We can't stop now!
SABIN:Then let's just bust through!
"SABIN:Can't believe we've made it this far... Say, how do we get to Narshe from here?"
"CYAN:Narshe, eh? Only one route, through the forest to the south."
SABIN:All right! It's decided. Let's get going!
CYAN:A train's there!? But I thought Doma's railway had been destroyed...?
SABIN:May be survivors inside. Let's take a look.
SABIN:Hey! We can get in right here!
CYAN:Sir Sabin!
SABIN:We can't just wander around out here! We have to go on board!
CYAN:Sir Sabin!
SABIN:Don't worry!
CYAN:Sir Sabin!
SABIN:What on earth...?
CYAN:Let me off! This train's haunted!
SABIN:I...it's moving!
CYAN:If we don't get off now...
SABIN:Won't open!
CYAN:We're too late.
SABIN:What's with this train?
CYAN:This is the Phantom Train... It carries the departed to...the other side.
SABIN:Wait a sec... I don't want to go THERE!
CYAN:We all have to go sometime...
SABIN:I have things to do HERE. We have to stop this thing. Let's make for the engine.
CYAN:I believe we're stuck!
SABIN:I know!CYAN:You have an idea?
"SABIN:Okay... The time has come to see if all my training has paid off. Come, Cyan!"
PHANTOM TRAIN:So! You've been slowing my progress!
PHANTOM TRAIN:I will let you go... <D>...but first there is something I must do...
CYAN:Gulp...where are we?
"SABIN:Hoo, boy! Finally got off..."
SABIN:We shouldn't be here. Let's go NOW!
CYAN:No!!! Elayne! Owain!!
SABIN:Cyan! Is that your wife and child?
"CYAN:Please, wait!"
SABIN:This must be Baren Falls.
CYAN:To the south is the Veldt. Dangerous creatures there.
SABIN:And the Empire's right on our tails.
"CYAN:If we can slip through the Veldt, we can reach the town of Mobliz, to the east..."
SABIN:What the......
CYAN:Thou art so......odd.
CYAN:I'm Cyan and he's Sabin.
"GAU:You Sabin...... you Cyan, me want more food!!"
SABIN:No more for you.
GAU:You go......get more for me.
SABIN:You're a regular munchkin!
GAU:And you......afraid of me!
SABIN:You wanna fight?
GAU:Me not wanna hurt you......
SABIN:Stop looking at me like that!
SABIN:Wheeze......puff......! You're pretty tough!
"GAU:Wah, ha! That fun! You strong!"
GAU:Me like dancing! You good leader!
SABIN:Shut up!!
"CYAN:Simmer down, sirs! And thou, o wild one...... who might thou be?"
GAU:Thou! Thou!
GAU:Thou! Thou!
GAU:Thou! Thou!
GAU:Thou! Thou!
GAU:You angry?
GAU:Cyan! You angry......me?
GAU:Cyan! You angry......me?
GAU:Cyan! You angry......me?
"SABIN:Listen, his family was just......"
GAU:Me understand......me sorry. Me not mean person......
"CYAN:Look! We can't have ye two prancing 'round all day! Gau, I think we're going to get on well together. Why don't you join us?"
GAU:Ah! I give you present! Gau give Cyan and Sabin nice gift in thanks for food!
SABIN:What manner of rubbish do you suppose he's gonna...?
"GAU:Gau's treasure...... shiny, shiny!! Shiny, shiny, shiny!!!"
SABIN:Can anything be THAT shiny?
GAU:Does Mr. Thou like shiny thing?
"SABIN:Mr. Thou's that one, over THERE!! A shiny thing, eh...? Think how jealous Locke's gonna be when he hears about this!"
GAU:Who be Locke? He bad man? Maybe he try steal my treasure!
"SABIN:? Well, he's...... Listen when someone's talking to you!"
CYAN:I think he's trying to tell us something!
SABIN:Urgh......all right......carry on......
"GAU:Here! Here! Shiny thing here!! Sabin, place where you buy food... it called Mobliz! Cyan, place where you stand...... river brought you there...... Now, we go Crescent Mountain! Shiny thing, there!"
"CYAN:Look, let's just go along with him to this Crescent Mountain."
"SABIN:Phew......why'd we invite him along, anyway...?"
GAU:Mr. Thou! Hurry up! We're leaving!!
"SABIN:Hey! I told you once, I'm not Mr. Thou!!!"
KAPPA:Here's how to build up Gau's skills.
SABIN:Cyan! The shiny thing Gau spoke of is in here.
"CYAN:Uh, Sir Gau, where exactly is it?"
SABIN:Shall we look around?CYAN:Indeed!
"CYAN:Is this it? Gau's ""treasure""?"
CYAN:Looks like glass...
SABIN:Looks like it just might fit...
SABIN:Hummm... Is this of any use?
SABIN:Will this really let us breathe underwater?
SABIN:Let's go!
SABIN:No kidding.
"SABIN:But unless we hop in, we won't see our friends again..."
SABIN:Let's go!
CYAN:Narshe is just a stone's throw away!
SABIN:I hope the others arrived safely!
CYAN:I'm sure they did.
"GAU:Me hope so, too..."
ELDER:I understand all of it... Except... How can WE be encouraging bloodshed?
ARVIS:I never said...that!
ELDER:Something like it.
BANON:Ha! He's right you know!
BANON:Our blood will spill because of you.
BANON:Emperor Gestahl's racing to acquire Magitek power. He's set his sights on the Esper that was found here! The increased use of magitek power'll surely lead to global destruction...
ELDER:The War of the Magi...
ELDER:People will never learn...
EDGAR:Sabin! You're all right!
EDGAR:Who's with you?
"SABIN:Oh, this is..."
"CYAN:I'm Cyan, retainer to the lord of Doma!"
SABIN:The people of Doma were wiped out by the Empire...
CYAN:Kefka poisoned...everyone...
ELDER:But...that was only because Doma was collaborating with the Returners! If we make that mistake...
LOCKE:That's nonsense!!
LOCKE:The Empire's poised to attack Narshe right now!
BANON:Locke. Where'd you hear that?
"LOCKE:Celes, here, was one of the Empire's generals..."
"CYAN:Grrr! I knew she seemed familiar. Sir Gau, out of my way!"
"CYAN:This's General Celes! She torched Maranda! She's an Imperial spy! Now, stand aside!"
"LOCKE:WAIT! Celes has joined the Returners! She's fighting with us, now!"
LOCKE:I promised I'd protect her. I WILL NOT back out on my word.
EDGAR:Locke... Are you still thinking about... that?
TERRA:I was also an Imperial soldier.
EDGAR:The Empire's evil. But not ALL of its citizens are!
"KEFKA:I don't care what you do here, JUST GET ME THAT ESPER!!"
SOLDIER:Lord Kefka! There're civilians here...!
KEFKA:Exterminate everyone!
SOLDIER:But Narshe is neutral...
KEFKA:Read my lips!! Dispose of any who oppose us! March!
ELDER:We really have no choice. Let's make ready for war!
BANON:They're after the Esper.
ELDER:We moved it into the hills.
EDGAR:Then we're going up after it!
EDGAR:Locke has a complicated past. I wouldn't go thinking he's fallen for you or something!
"CELES:I'm a soldier, not some love-starved twit!"
EDGAR:Cold as ice......
"CELES:So, you were born with the power of magic!? Isn't it a lovely gift..."
"TERRA:You...can use magic, too?"
"CELES:When I was a baby I was artificially infused with magic, and raised as a Magitek Knight."
TERRA:Have you...loved anyone?
CELES:??? What's that supposed to mean?!
CYAN:Don't think for a moment I trust you!
"CELES:Fine. Use your own eyes, then decide."
BANON:They're coming!
"KEFKA:Oho!! It's General Celes, the traitor! How delightful! This'll be fun!"
KEFKA:Go!! Get those vile insects!
KEFKA:Don't think you won! I'll be back!
KEFKA:Aack!! I won't forget this!
EDGAR:Where's the Esper?
LOCKE:Is it okay?
EDGAR:That was a close call!
CYAN:Can it still be alive?
LOCKE:Terra!! What is it!?
SABIN:Terra 'n the Esper...
EDGAR:There's...some kinda reaction!
TERRA:Huh? W......what's going on......? What!? What am I feeling?! Please......tell me! Who am I? WHO?!
CELES:An Esper......I can actually feel its mind......
EDGAR:Terra......Step away from the Esper......
CELES:You're awake?
LOCKE:... Where's Terra?!
"CELES:She changed into a...something, and...took off. She looked like..."
CELES:She looked like... an Esper...
EDGAR:Locke! You okay?
"EDGAR:Something happened to Terra... There seems to be some connection between Espers and her... Anyway, we need to find her. Witnesses saw her screaming across the sky to the west."
LOCKE:Let's go! I promised her I'd...
"EDGAR:Think, people! The Empire still wants that Esper."
"SABIN:Banon needs our help, too..."
CYAN:A former Imperial soldier... But we've no choice. We must help her!
EDGAR:Let's split up. Those who aren't searching for Terra will stay and guard Narshe. Figaro Castle can shuttle us to the western province. Then we'll make for Kohlingen or Jidoor.
"RAMUH:She's scared, you know."
RAMUH:This girl is your friend?
RAMUH:You call her Terra... ...Terra?? How odd...
"RAMUH:She is undamaged. But I fear she can't understand you. As for me, I am Ramuh. The Esper, Ramuh."
"RAMUH:That doesn't mean we don't live here, too. Espers take a variety of forms. Sometimes we live here, taking the shape of humans. You have nothing to fear from us."
RAMUH:Humans and Espers can't survive together.
"RAMUH:No, that was no fairy tale. That was true. We started out as friends. Then along came the War of the Magi..."
"RAMUH:It took place...long ago. Espers fought humans who were infused with magical power extracted from Espers... Fearing our magical powers would once again become a target, we fashioned a new realm, and moved there."
"RAMUH:Even as we speak, many of my kind are trapped in the Empire's Magitek Research Facility, being... ...drained of their powers... I fled here to avoid a similar fate."
"RAMUH:That's right, relax."
RAMUH:I sensed that Terra was in trouble. My magic...summoned her here.
"RAMUH:No, she's actually quite different."
RAMUH:Her very existence strikes fear into her own heart.
"RAMUH:When she accepts this aspect of herself, I think she'll be all right."
RAMUH:Then free those of my kind imprisoned in Gestahl's Magitek Research Facility. One of them can surely help her.
"RAMUH:Like a coward, I escaped leaving the others there. It'll be the end of them..."
RAMUH:Gestahl's methods are incorrect. You can't drain a live Esper of all its power. It is only when we are reduced to Magicite that our abilities can be transferred in total...
"RAMUH:When we transform into Magicite, our power can be relocated."
RAMUH:That's what's left of us when we...pass away.
"RAMUH:These are my comrades who fell while escaping the Empire. And I will give you my power, as well..."
EDGAR:Let's talk on the way!
EDGAR:The Empire's trying to drain magic from Espers...
SABIN:This can't be true... Celes...?
CELES:I don't remember because I was asleep when they...augmented me. But I've heard rumors to that effect.
CYAN:Then we're going in...
EDGAR:We'd best split into 2 groups. We still need to beef up our defenses in Narshe.
CELES:I'll go to the Empire. I know it well...
SABIN:But alone...?
"LOCKE:Don't worry, I'll go with her."
CYAN:You need a hand?
LOCKE:Please wait for us in Narshe. We'll find our way back safely.
CELES:So...how we gonna get there? The Empire's on the continent to the south. No boats go there...
"LOCKE:The people of Jidoor, a town to the south, can probably help us."
CELES:Why are you coming with me?
"LOCKE:Well... There're bound to be treasures there. And besides, I've always wanted an inside look at the Empire!"
CELES:Are you talking to me?
"IMPRESARIO:Sorry...my mistake. Wow, you could pass for Maria in a heartbeat! Hoo boy, now I really am in trouble..."
MASTER:He's the director of the operas here. Everyone just calls him [Impresario.] He's been in a tizzy ever since that letter arrived.
"LOCKE:Who's this ""Wandering...""? what's-his-name?"
"MASTER:You born on a farm, son?"
"CELES:If we could get that airship, we'd make the Empire in no time."
LOCKE:Let's set up a meeting...with Setzer...
IMPRESARIO:Ah! You again!
LOCKE:I read that letter. Setzer's coming to steal her...
IMPRESARIO:He'll probably appear right at the climax of Scene 1. He loves an entrance...
LOCKE:Right! If we could only grab him then...!
"IMPRESARIO:Dear me, NO! You'll ruin the performance! I'll lose my job!"
CELES:Then you're history!
IMPRESARIO:This is simply horrid! I want the performance to be a success! But I don't want Maria to be abducted...!
LOCKE:We'll let him grab her...
"LOCKE:We'll use Celes as a decoy. After she's abducted, I'll follow 'em right to his airship!"
IMPRESARIO:Are you mad?!! If something should happen to Maria...
LOCKE:That's why the decoy! We'll hide Maria somewhere safe!
IMPRESARIO:Come again?
"LOCKE:You said SHE looks like Maria, right?"
CELES:Now just a minute...
LOCKE:Celes will be our Maria! She'll lead us to the airship!
"CELES:W...wait! I'm a GENERAL, not some opera floozy!"
"LOCKE:Not bad, Celes!"
"ULTROS:Mwa, ha, ha! I'll pretend to be Setzer and foil their little plan!"
"LOCKE:Let's get ready! Celes, it's show time!"
ULTROS:D'haaaaa! Come on! Read it...!
LOCKE:Aye yai yai! Izzat...you!?
CELES:Locke. Why did you help me escape back there?
LOCKE:I...once abandoned someone when she needed me...
"CELES:Somewhere inside you were saving...her, weren't you...?"
LOCKE:That ribbon suits you.
CELES:On with the show! This is a big scene in which Maria senses that something's happened to Draco!
LOCKE:You'd better check the score one last time.
"DRACO:Come, Maria! Follow my lead..."
"DRACO:Ha, ha, ha..."
CHANCELLOR:Prince Ralse is looking for a dance partner. Leave the past behind! Our kingdom is adopting the spirit of the East...!
"LOCKE:Well done, Celes."
LOCKE:Uh oh...Better tell the Impresario!
IMPRESARIO:But how might he disrupt the opera? ...With that?!
ULTROS:Mwa ha ha! Let's see if Maria can shrug THIS off!
ULTROS:N'ghaaa! This is heavier than I thought! It'll take me 5 minutes to drop it!
LOCKE:We haven't a second to lose!
IMPRESARIO:Talk to the man in the room to the far right! He'll help you get up there!
LOCKE:It's as good as done!
STAGE MASTER:The Impresario asked me to have you press the far right switch.
ULTROS:Phew! Rats!
"IMPRESARIO:Disaster! If the two heroes are flattened, the opera's over! Then who'll win the girl?!"
LOCKE:Neither Draco nor Ralse will save Celes!
"LOCKE:I, Locke, the world's premier adventurer, will save her!"
IMPRESARIO:Aya... What awful acting!
ULTROS:Silence! You are in the presence of octopus royalty! A lowborn thug like you could never defeat me!
IMPRESARIO:Hmm... Might as well make the most of this. MUSIC!!
"SETZER:I'm a man of my word, music man!"
CELES:That's HIM...?!
"IMPRESARIO:What a reversal! Thinking she's Locke's new queen, Maria is instead nabbed by Setzer! What fate lies in store for her? Stay tuned for Part 2!"
SETZER:I'll deal with you in a minute!
LOCKE:What a performance!
CELES:Enough already!
LOCKE:But this is the tough one! Part 2 begins now!
LOCKE:... Where's Setzer?
CELES:He's coming.
SETZER:W...who're YOU? You're not Maria!
"CELES:Setzer, we need your help. We have to go to Vector. We need this ship to get there."
"SETZER:Look, if you're not Maria, I don't want you aboard."
CELES:Wait! We were told your ship is the finest vessel in the world.
LOCKE:And that you were the world's most notorious gambler...
SETZER:Come here.
SETZER:Don't misunderstand me. I'm still not sure if I'm going to help you.
SETZER:Phew... The Empire's made me a rich man.
CELES:Stop thinking of yourself. Many towns and villages have been smashed by the Empire.
LOCKE:The Empire's also totally rotten! It's using magic to enslave the world.
SETZER:The Empire ...evil...?
CELES:We all hate the Empire for the same reasons. That's why...
SETZER:You know...you're even more stunning than Maria.
"SETZER:Enough! If you... If Celes becomes my wife, I'll help. Otherwise..."
LOCKE:WHAT! Are you stupid!?
CELES:We haven't any choice.
SETZER:Yes! It's settled!
CELES:But I have conditions...
SETZER:Oho! Fine! I accept!
LOCKE:Listen to yourself! Celes...you can't become his wife! You just can't!
CYAN:That man uses people...
"CELES:I win! Now, honor your part of the bargain!"
SETZER:How...unusual! A coin with identical sides...!
"CELES:I think you've been hustled, Mr. Gambler."
"SETZER:Ha! How low can you get?! I love it! All right, I'll help you. Nothing to lose but my life..."
LOCKE:This unwieldy-looking ship really moves! Could it crash?
"SETZER:When things fall, they fall! It's all a matter of fate..."
LOCKE:This ship's going to stick out like a sore thumb. Better land some distance away.
SETZER:Right. I'll wait on board in case of an emergency.
MAN:I...I'm gonna be sick!
SOLDIER:Get outta here!
MAN:Urghh... Gonna toss it all...
"KEFKA:I'm all-powerful! Hee, hee, haw! I'm collecting Espers! I'm extracting magic! And... ... ... I'll restore the...Statues!"
KEFKA:You've been completely drained of your powers! Now you're useless to me!
KEFKA:And you! Take a hike!
"IFRIT:Hmmm...SHIVA:Well, Ramuh DID entrust them with his power."
"IFRIT:Gestahl has grabbed our friends and is trying to drain them of their power. I, too, suffered my turn in one of the glass tubes..."
"SHIVA:They drained our powers, then threw us away to... We haven't long to live..."
"ESPER:You want to help me... But... I haven't long to live. Just as Ifrit did before me, I'll give to you my power..."
CID:What are you doing there?
CID:W...what's this!?
CID:So...Esper magical power can only truly be transferred when one of them passes away...
CELES:Professor Cid.CID:General Celes! And who might these dubious characters be? Your troops?
"CELES:No... You see, ..."
"CID:Can it be true that you came here as a spy, seeking to cause an uprising?!"
LOCKE:!? Celes...?
"KEFKA:So that's it! Magicite... Cid, you miserable blockhead! Now..."
KEFKA:General Celes!! The game's over. Bring me those Magicite shards!
LOCKE:Celes! You...deceived me?!
CELES:Of course not! Have a little faith!
"KEFKA:G'hee, hee, hee! She has tricked you all! Celes, that's so...YOU!"
CELES:Locke... Please believe me...
LOCKE:I... ... ...
KEFKA:Exterminate all of them!
CELES:Locke... Let me protect you for once... Maybe now... Now you'll believe me...
KEFKA:Celes! W...what are you doing? Stop it!!!
"CID:Ooh, ooh... What happened?"
CID:This is a disaster! Your fighting has caused the capsules to rupture! Their contents are spilling out!
CID:Quick! Over here!
CID:Kefka has used me... used the Empire. What have I done...?
CID:The life-energy of those Espers...
CID:You've helped me come to a decision. I'm going to talk to the Emperor and have this stupid war stopped!
"CID:Celes... I've known her since she was a baby. I raised her as if she was my own daughter! But she was forced to become a Magitek Knight, and has done some awful things. If I could only talk to her... I'd apologize for the way her life has turned out."
CID:No! It's Kefka!
SETZER:I was starting to worry...
SETZER:? What's up with Celes?
SETZER:We'll talk later. Let's get outta here!
KEFKA:Crud! What a mess!!
KEFKA:I don't think so...! You won't get away!
LOCKE:Let's not overstay our visit. We're outta here on the double!
SETZER:Right. Speaking of which... Maybe we should be leaving.
LOCKE:I'm worried about Terra. Let's return to Zozo.
SETZER:Terra? Who's that?
LOCKE:I'll explain on the way... ...about Terra...Espers...the Returners...
TERRA:I remember it all... I was raised in the Esper's world.
"MADUIN:Listen well, and think clearly! What will you do?"
ELDER:Did I hear there was a human here?
MADUIN:Probably... ...wandered in here by mistake.
MADUIN:Did I awaken you?
GIRL:You're...an Esper? What's that pendant for?
MADUIN:It's...yours now! It helps protect the Esper World.
"GIRL:Esper World... Boy, did I take the low road or what?"
"MADUIN:The Esper folk are pretty upset, you being a human and all..."
GIRL:You the one who...saved me?
"ESPER:I am Maduin. I tired living in the human world... That world is filled with desire, greed and loathing. It's highly infectious..."
MADUIN:Are humans and Espers truly...so different?
"MADONNA:So...I'm an example of the evil in this world, huh?"
"MADUIN:No, I mean..."
MADONNA:I'll return to my world tomorrow!
MADUIN:You'll need a guide.
"YOUTH:What's wrong, Maduin?"
"MADUIN:If you don't want to return to your world, you may stay here."
MADONNA:But humans and Espers can never coexist...!
MADUIN:How do we know for sure unless we observe for ourselves? How do we know... unless we... observe for ourselves...?
MADUIN:We've given her a name...
"MADUIN:It's Terra. Not bad, huh?"
"GESTAHL:Aha! We've finally found it! Those ancient writings told us of this world, and described the awesome magical properties of these beasts!"
GESTAHL:Grab them! Riches to any man who captures an Esper! GO!
ELDER:We've no choice... We must do what we've been avoiding...
MADUIN:You mean... the magic barrier?
ELDER:Here's the plan. We'll cause a tempest that'll sweep all the nasty creatures out of our realm. Then we'll seal the gate... I am the last of our kind able to cast this magical seal.
"MADUIN:But in your state, you might just..."
ELDER:Pass away... but at least we will finally be safe.
"MADONNA:I, for one, will not miss the other side..."
ELDER:Let's do it. We have no other choice.
ESPER:This is all because of that human girl!
ESPER:I'm sure she helped the others find us!
MADUIN:Get a grip on yourself!
ESPER:No! She's one of them! Soon she'll be wearing our hide!
SOLDIER:Look what popped out!
GESTAHL:Shriek!!! Just when we were in reach of a veritable bonanza...!
MADONNA:Maduin... I'm not their friend...
MADUIN:I understand that!
MADONNA:Thank you...
MADUIN:Can you make it back here?
GESTAHL:A...human girl? Wh... Who is she?
MADONNA:Please... take care...of my baby...
"GESTAHL:YOUR girl!? Eh!? Hmmm...Then she's half human and half... How absolutely fascinating! Mwa, ha, ha... She will help us realize our dream faster than we ever imagined!"
"GESTAHL:Quiet, my dear!!"
"GESTAHL:We will own this world! Ha, ha, ha..."
TERRA:That was my father...?
TERRA:I'm the product of an Esper and a human... That's where I got my powers... Now I understand... I finally feel I can begin to control this power of mine...
EDGAR:So Gestahl must've known the secret of the Espers' power back then.
LOCKE:And those Espers at the facility were grabbed during that expedition! That means Celes's power came...... at the expense of an Esper...
SABIN:They can't get away with this! We have to strike back!
TERRA:What's happening in Narshe?
LOCKE:Hmm... Maybe we should head back that way.
SETZER:The airship's ready!
TERRA:Come on!
SETZER:By all means! Take a turn at the wheel!
"BANON:Oh, you're here! The people of Narshe have finally decided to battle the Empire. How did it go at Vector...?"
"ARVIS:I see... Your plan would combine Narshe's money with Figaro's machinery to storm the Empire... not enough manpower, though..."
BANON:We have to open the sealed gate...
TERRA:To the Esper World...?
ARVIS:We'll never beat the Empire without them.
"BANON:When the gate has been opened, the Espers can attack from the east. We'll storm in at the same time, from the north."
BANON:We MUST get the Espers to understand. We have to establish a bond of trust between humans and Espers. Only one person can do this...
TERRA:I'll do it. I'm the only one who can!
TERRA:Let's get this over with.
"KEFKA:U'hee, hee, heeee!!!! The Emperor was right! Let Terra fall into your hands, and you'd open the gate for us...!"
KEFKA:How does it feel to know you've been working for us?!
KEFKA:Now I fear you've outlived your usefulness......
KEFKA:Oh dear...... you wanna fight me?! This is just dreadful!
TERRA:Espers... Please heed my call...
KEFKA:It opened!!
"KEFKA:I, I, I, I feel so anxious."
KEFKA:Frightful energy!!
"TERRA:Look, let's return to the airship."
SETZER:We're almost at Vector.
"LOCKE:What's wrong, Terra?"
TERRA:I can feel it......It's coming closer and closer...
LOCKE:What do you mean you can feel it?
TERRA:It was......glowing!
LOCKE:What's that?
LOCKE:It can't be......! An Esper???
"LOCKE:It's coming!!! Watch out, Terra!!"
SETZER:What was that!?
"LOCKE:Setzer, get down!"
LOCKE:Where are they going?
TERRA:They were mad......
"TERRA:No......Stop...! Please, don't go!!"
LOCKE:They seemed......angry.
SETZER:Forget that...... what's with this vibration?! Is it from the Espers?
EDGAR:Um......Setzer!!!! I've lost control!!!
GESTAHL:I've lost my will to fight...
CID:The Emperor's had a change of heart...
"CID:The Espers came to save their friends. When they learned the others had perished, they went berserk, and trashed the town... Never will I forget their shrieks of rage..."
SENTRY:We're hanging up our weapons and armor for good.
GESTAHL:The power of those Espers... I had no idea...They'll shred the world...! We must get them to understand that we are no longer at war.
CID:No human's going to make them sit down and listen...
GESTAHL:But for now my friends...Let us feast and rejoice!
"CID:There're some people here who'd prefer to keep fighting. Please, before we dine, talk to as many soldiers as you can! Make them understand!"
TROOPER:Please talk to as many soldiers as you can. You have 4 minutes until dinner.
"TROOPER:This way, please."
CID:You can count me in as a Returner!
"GESTAHL:Imagine! All of us here together, sharing a meal! First we must have a toast!"
"GESTAHL:As you know, Kefka's in jail for war crimes. What shall we do with him?"
"GESTAHL:Hmm... Well, let's let him stew in his cell for a while. Then we'll decide what to do."
GESTAHL:I truly apologize about the poisoning of Doma. No one dreamed Kefka would use poison.
"GESTAHL:I'm so terribly sorry! Kefka's being severely punished, and we're cleaning up the poison."
GESTAHL:By the way... With regard to General Celes...
GESTAHL:Kefka was lying. General Celes realized the war was stupid before anyone else. That's why she joined the returners. Any other questions for me?
"GESTAHL:With your permission, I'd like to talk about the Espers..."
"GESTAHL:I assure you, I have answered your questions truthfully."
"GESTAHL:My Empire's been decimated by the Espers that emerged from the sealed gate. They're acting spiteful. Unless they're stopped, they'll rip the world asunder!"
"GESTAHL:After the Espers went on their rampage, I knew I couldn't go on with my war. I asked myself why I had started it in the first place. By the way... About those questions you asked me... which did you ask first?"
"GESTAHL:Right. Anyway, more than anything I want peace. That's my true dream. I want you to understand that!"
CID:You seem a bit tired. Care for a rest break?
GESTAHL:Is there anything you wish to hear me say?
"GESTAHL:After they devastated my Empire, the Espers headed northward, toward Crescent Island. They must be found...! We must tell them we're no longer their enemy. After all that I have put them through, it is up to me to set things right. That is why... I need to borrow Terra's power."
GESTAHL:We must make for Crescent Island aboard the freighter from Albrook.
GESTAHL:I'll have my finest warrior accompany us! General Leo!
LEO:I'm General Leo. Nice to meet you.
LEO:I'll be waiting for you in Albrook.
GESTAHL:We must find the Espers and come to terms with them! You are our last hope!
"LOCKE:If Terra goes, I'll go."
TERRA:Locke... Thank you...
LOCKE:The rest of you wait here. I smell a rat...
EDGAR:Agreed... It's hard to trust the Emperor just like that...
CYAN:We'll stay here and investigate.
LOCKE:Please do. Leave no stone unturned!
EDGAR:Right. And you be careful!
"LEO:There you are. Another of the Empire's generals, and a person I hired in town will be traveling with us."
LEO:Let me introduce... General Celes...and Shadow.
LEO:Is something wrong?
"LEO:Our departure isn't till tomorrow. I've arranged some lodging for you. Please, get some rest."
LOCKE:Come on...! Why won't you speak to me?
LOCKE:Even if it was only a little...I doubted you... But I'm still your friend...
LEO:Right...let's go.
SOLDIER:All systems A-O-K.
LEO:We should arrive tomorrow morning. Why not rest until then?
LEO:You all right?
LEO:Looks like you're feeling better...
"TERRA:Funny, isn't it... I was used by the Empire... even had my thoughts ripped from me... But here I am cooperating with the ""enemy""..."
LEO:People are people. Not all of us are like Kefka.
TERRA:What...what's with you?
"LEO:I knew you were being used as a kind of biological weapon...And because I didn't do anything about it, I'm no different than Kefka..."
TERRA:I'm the product of a human and an Esper...Will I ever be able to love someone?
LEO:Of course!
TERRA:But...I haven't felt that way yet...
LEO:You're just young. ...but I understand what you mean. I understand only too well...
TERRA:But...I want to know what love is...now!
TERRA:Who is it?
SHADOW:Thought I'd sleep out under the stars.
TERRA:Did you hear... ...what we were just talking about?
SHADOW:I didn't mean to overhear anything.
SHADOW:I can't help you. You must look within for answers.
SHADOW:In this world are many like me who've killed their emotions. Don't forget that.
LOCKE:Urgh... Uooh... Argh...
LOCKE:Ooh... Ohhhhhhh...
LOCKE:I think I'm gonna...
"LOCKE:Not a word of this to anyone else, o shrouded one..."
LOCKE:I think I'm gonna...
"LEO:We're almost at Crescent Island. When we disembark, we'll split into two groups. Celes and I will form one group. Terra, you go with Locke and Shadow. If you spot the Espers, report at once!"
LOCKE:Let's go.
"CELES:Um, I..."
LOCKE:Come on.
STRAGO:Espers? Espers...Hmm...Not really familiar with that word.
LOCKE:But you've heard it before?
"STRAGO:Nope, uhn uhn... Can't say I have. Honestly can't say I have!"
STRAGO:What in blazes... What're you doing?
"RELM:Grandpa. Who are these people? Friends? Can they use magic, too?"
STRAGO:Yaa! Hush!
RELM:What a cute doggy!
SHADOW:Get away. He bites.
STRAGO:Go to your room!
RELM:I will not! What a fussy old man!
STRAGO:Please...leave us!
RELM:Well...all right...
RELM:What a sweet puppy!
STRAGO:Hoo boy... Seems to like your dog...
STRAGO:This is terrible...
"SHADOW:No problem. The dog usually doesn't like people, though..."
STRAGO:Please excuse her. She's just young.
STRAGO:This is just a back-water village. We can tell you nothing about your Espers...
LOCKE:I see... There's something wrong here...
TERRA:Let's have a look around.
LOCKE:Thanks for your time!
STRAGO:Sorry I couldn't have been more helpful!
SHADOW:Interceptor! Come!
"RELM:Oh, all right..."
STRAGO:This is awful! Relm...she's...
TERRA:Relm's in danger?
STRAGO:Yes! She was at a neighbor's house when a fire broke out. I won't be able to stand it if something happens to her!
STRAGO:Please! Won't you help?!
SHADOW:Interceptor... <D>Where are you?!
STRAGO:Relm's inside that house!
LOCKE:What're you doing?
MAYOR:Magic is forbidden!
STRAGO:I don't care! Relm's inside!!!
MAYOR:All right. We really have no choice.
MAYOR:Stand back.
STRAGO:It's no use. The fire's too strong!
MAYOR:I think that's because they keep so many Fire Rods in here...
STRAGO:I'm going in!
TERRA:Wait...I'm going too.
"LOCKE:Count me in. You'd better stay out here, gramps."
"STRAGO:Fool! I may be old, but I'm not powerless!"
LOCKE:Try to avoid the flames.
TERRA:Easier said than done.
STRAGO:Hurry! We have to find Relm!
STRAGO:Relm!!! Where are you?!
SHADOW:Let's get outta here! <D>I'll use a Smoke Bomb!!
STRAGO:Are you okay?
"RELM:Yes. Thanks, Grandpa!"
STRAGO:Save your thanks for these people.RELM:Thank you...
STRAGO:I guess our town's little secret is out now...
LOCKE:Can everyone here use magic? What's going on here?
STRAGO:This is......the village of the Mage Warriors...
STRAGO:Long ago humans used Magicite to gain magical powers. They came to be known as Mage Warriors.
LOCKE:But I thought they perished centuries ago...
"STRAGO:After the War of the Magi, the Espers fled to their new world behind the sealed gate. They wished to live peacefully, without fear of being used by humans. They left us here to fend for ourselves But we were despised by normal people. Everyone felt we had begun that war... They sent people to hunt us down like animals. There weren't even any trials..."
TERRA:Even though the only difference was that you could use magic...?
"STRAGO:A few Mage Warriors escaped and found their way here. They were our ancestors. Our powers have weakened over time, but some of it remains."
"TERRA:Look, if you're up to it, we could use your help."
"STRAGO:So, you're after the Espers, eh...?"
"STRAGO:Well, I owe you for saving Relm. I'll help you find your Espers."
RELM:Me too!
STRAGO:I don't think so.
RELM:What a fuddy duddy...
LOCKE:But...where do we start looking?
"STRAGO:Hmm...If they're here, they must be hiding in the mountains to the west."
LOCKE:Why there?
STRAGO:Those mountains have powerful magical properties. They say the Espers were created there...
TERRA:Maybe they're drawn to that place?
LOCKE:I think it's worth a look.
SHADOW:Don't misunderstand me. I just wanted my dog back.
LOCKE:Going somewhere?
SHADOW:I'll search for the Espers in my own way.
SHADOW:Interceptor! Come!
"STRAGO:I can't believe it... The Statues...!TERRA:""The"" Statues?!"
LOCKE:Some faint letters are carved on the back of the stone figures...
"LOCKE:Say, old man, what else can you tell us about these goddesses?"
"STRAGO:They quite literally created magic, as we know it."
"LOCKE:So, they're the goddesses of magic, then?"
STRAGO:You could say that.
TERRA:I can feel their power...
"STRAGO:The Statues are the source of all magic. It's said the Espers made these images, and put them in a very special place. These represent power beyond all comprehension..."
TERRA:Our Espers no doubt came to this island to bask in all this magical power!
"LOCKE:Say, old timer, what happened to the stone goddesses?"
STRAGO:Legend has it that they're hidden somewhere beyond the reach of humans. I'd say they're beyond the sealed gate...
TERRA:I wonder if the barrier that protects that place is generated by those stone goddesses?
LOCKE:Phew...what a story.
"TERRA:If the Espers were attracted here by these statues, they must be around here somewhere!"
LOCKE:I think it's worth a look.
"ULTROS:G'heh, heh...these shiny statues are all mine! These'll get Ziegfried's attention!"
ULTROS:Oh! They're glowing!! They're...beautiful!
"LOCKE:Hey, squidball! Don't you ever learn?"
"ULTROS:Uh, well they always said I was a slow learner... but I eat FAST!!"
RELM:Grandpa! I'm here......!
STRAGO:Relm! I told you to stay at home!
RELM:I couldn't miss the chance to practice my drawing!
ULTROS:How dare you! I'm Ultros!!
LOCKE:Relm and Ultros......What ARE you doing......?
"RELM:Listen, Ulty...... Why don't you pose for me?"
ULTROS:I'm not one of your kiddy friends! Don't talk to me as if I were!! I don't want a portrait!
RELM:Forget it! I don't wanna draw it anymore!
RELM:It's okay......I'll just jump down from here.
TERRA:No!! You can't do that!!!
TERRA:How dare you bother that little girl! I'm not going to forgive you if you hurt her!!
"ULTROS:Well, whadduya want I should do?"
LOCKE:Ask her to draw your portrait. She may actually make you look pleasant!
LOCKE:Don't be so heartless!
"ULTROS:........................................................................Oh, all right, Uncle Ulty REALLY wants you to do his portrait!!!"
"RELM:Hee, hee, hee... You're gonna love it!"
"STRAGO:At any rate, come here!"
RELM:Hey! Did you see me? I was awesome! Wouldn't I be more helpful than Gramps?
TERRA:I suppose it wouldn't hurt to have you along...
STRAGO:All right all ready! If you insist...
RELM:That's better!
RELM:Are these...Espers?!
STRAGO:What about you?
TERRA:I didn't think they'd look so...
"LOCKE:Gramps, take Relm and clear outta here!"
RELM:What is it?
STRAGO:I sense some immense magical power in Terra... It...frightens me...
LOCKE:I wonder if she's gonna go ballistic again?!
YURA:You're somehow different... I sense a familiar power radiating from you...
STRAGO:You're the Espers that fled through the sealed gate?
"YURA:As a rule, we are not allowed to visit to your world. We few had gathered near the gate, and were wondering how we could save the Espers that had been kidnapped. It was just a coincidence that Terra appeared when she did..."
TERRA:I felt...your presence...through the gate.
"YURA:We bolted the moment Terra opened the gate. But once in your world, we lost control of our powers."
YURA:We completely leveled a city...and took some innocent lives...
TERRA:That's what happened to me! I lost all control of my power...
STRAGO:There must be something in your world that allows you to focus your power differently. You must use caution while in our world...
YURA:We are deeply sorry to have caused you humans such suffering and pain.
LOCKE:The past is history. The Empire seems to want to talk peace with you. Why not come with us?
YURA:They would forgive us so easily?
LOCKE:Let's go to Thamasa and talk with General Leo.
LOCKE:General Leo.
LEO:Locke...you're back! And you've made the Espers understand our desire for peace!
"LEO:I am General Leo. May I have your name, please?"
YURA:I am called Yura.
"YURA:We have done something inexcusable to your people. This probably isn't the time or place to ask for your forgiveness, but..."
LEO:Speak no further. It is we who owe you an apology. We hungered for your powerHow close we came to reenacting the War of the Magi!!!
YURA:We must put this all behind us.
"LOCKE:I believe our job is finally over! I, for one, could use some peace and quiet..."
CELES:Let's return to Vector.
"CELES:Please, not another word."
"RELM:I'm too hot, Grandpa."
"KEFKA:Hee, hee...! How 'bout a little Magitek mayhem!"
LEO:Kefka! What ARE you doing?!
"KEFKA:G'ha, ha, ha! Emperor's orders! I'm to bring the Magicite remains of these Espers to his excellency! Behold! A Magicite mother lode!!"
KEFKA:I don't care for the appearance of this pitiful little hamlet...So burn it!!
LEO:Kefka! No!
KEFKA:Shut up!
LEO:Kefka! Your behavior is dishonorable! I can't allow this!
KEFKA:Ah......Leo......always the consummate soldier......
"LEO:: Where are you, Kefka......Show yourself!!"
KEFKA:EMPEROR GESTAHL......I need you here......
LEO:: My liege!
"LEO:: But, Emperor...!"
GESTAHL:Don't say anything. I understand how you feel.
"KEFKA:Uwee, hee, hee......That's right! What we have to do now is to collect Magicite!"
LEO:: But my liege......what have I been fighting for...?
"GESTAHL:Leo, I'd like you to take a nice, long snooze...! Very long! Uwa, ha!"
"KEFKA:So......you think you hit me?! That was simply my shadow! And how did you like my Gestahl? I should've been on the stage! Well, General......"
"LEO:: Shut up, Kefka! I oughtta......"
"KEFKA:Oh! A threat...? You're such a violent little brute! I'll tell your ""liege"" I had to exterminate a traitor...!"
"KEFKA:Whoa! Yes, I feel some incredible magic power here, today! Wave after wave of pure, magical energy..."
"KEFKA:I'd say you're all charged up, boys and girls...or whatever...Say, remind me to show you my Magicite collection someday! You might see a few familiar faces!!!"
KEFKA:Now for a little Magicite hocus-pocus...!
"KEFKA:First, let's neutralize your abilities."
"KEFKA:Now, little Espers... Let's see whatcha got!"
KEFKA:Eh?! You wanna take me on? Fine. Here I am...
"KEFKA:Imagine! Thinking you could defeat ME!! This is rich! Mwa, ha, ha!"
"KEFKA:Now, my little Magicite pretties......come, and help me build the magical empire of ""Kefka""!"
"KEFKA:G'haw, haw...... Ooh! They're warm to the touch! What treasures!"
KEFKA:This is ridiculous! I had no idea you were such wimps! Time to put a stop to all of this.
"KEFKA:Phew... I think I have plenty of Magicite for the time being... that is, until I make my way through your precious sealed gate!!"
KEFKA:I dont believe this!
TERRA:General Leo...
TERRA:People only seem to want power. Do they really want to be like me?
TERRA:I...I wanted to learn so much more from you...
"LOCKE:We not only lost Leo, but Shadow, too... Curse the Empire!"
LOCKE:This'll have to do...
CELES:He was so gentle...
RELM:Ill go with you.
LOCKE:Now I'm worried about Edgar and the others...
TERRA:I wish I could say they were safe...
SETZER:We've been had!! The Emperor is a liar!
"CYAN:Thanks to Edgar, we escaped before anything bad happened..."
"LOCKE:Way to go, Edgar!"
"EDGAR:I got to know the gal who brought us tea. After a while, she just blurted out the whole crooked plan."
"SABIN:So...you finally hit pay dirt, eh?"
EDGAR:Watch your mouth! There're ladies present! I was a perfect gentleman.
LOCKE:General Leo's gone...Kefka did him in...
CYAN:Sir Leo?! Gone?! What a waste...He was their finest soldier...
EDGAR:We need to rethink our plans. Let's return to the airship.
STRAGO:May I accompany you?
EDGAR:Who're you?
LOCKE:He's one of this town's citizens.
TERRA:He's descended from the Mage Warriors of yore... I think he can be a big help.
STRAGO:We must expect the Empire to flex its new-found muscle soon.
"RELM:I'm coming along, too."
"SABIN:Yeah, right kid!"
"RELM:What? Who is this puffed up aerobics instructor, anyway?"
SABIN:Kid's got quite a lip!
RELM:Aaack! I'm gonna paint your portrait!
STRAGO:All right all ready! If you insist...
RELM:That's better!
SABIN:Lets go!
"RELM:What's wrong, lover boy?"
EDGAR:How old are you?
"RELM:I'm coming along, too."
"EDGAR:You've grown up entirely too fast! Lighten up, okay?!"
SETZER:The Empire's after the sealed gate! They're looking for some statues or something.
"GESTAHL:Oh, those silly Espers! To think they opened the gate themselves! The Statues should be just ahead. If we can just get our hands on them, we'll have everything we ever dreamed of!"
GESTAHL:Come quickly!
"CELES:What's wrong, Terra?"
TERRA:The island... The world is groaning in pain...
"GESTAHL:Fuwa, ha, ha! Now THIS is power! This, and my Magicite... now nothing can stop me!"
STRAGO:The beginning of all magic...
"STRAGO:It is said that they somehow neutralized each other's power, then sealed themselves away... the 3 statues should ever be moved out of alignment, the resulting inbalance of power would... ...rearrange the face of our planet..."
SETZER:Quick! Let's jump onto that thing!
"SHADOW:Down with the Empire! Once I outlived my usefulness, they tried to off me!"
SHADOW:Is Interceptor all right?
SHADOW:Forget about me.
SHADOW:I sold my skills to the Empire... I have no right to fight together with you.
"GESTAHL:Well, well..."
CELES:I came to stop you!
"GESTAHL:Fwa, ha, ha... Then you're just in time to perish. Behold! The Statues!!"
GESTAHL:Ooh! I've got goose bumps! What power...
"CELES:Emperor Gestahl! Please, stop this madness!"
"GESTAHL:Celes... Come to me, my pretty! You and Kefka were given life to serve me!! It is your birthright to rule the world with me!!"
KEFKA:Kill the others and we'll overlook your treachery!
KEFKA:Take this sword! Take care of them. Immediately!!
GESTAHL:Celes...together we can rule an entire world! Think of it...!
CELES:Power only breeds war... I wish I'd never been...born.
KEFKA:You...vicious brat! Grrr... Aargh... I hate hate hate hate hate hate...hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate HATE YOU! Grrr...
KEFKA:Goddesses...you were born only to fight. I implore you...show me your power!!
KEFKA:I command you! Give me your power! Arrrgh! Curses!
"KEFKA:Listen to me, or you'll regret it! Give me...POWER!"
"GESTAHL:Kefka, stop it! Revive those statues, and you'll destroy the very world we're trying to possess!"
GESTAHL:Kefka! Are you nuts?!
KEFKA:Nuts...?! Emperor! Don't disturb me! I'm showing them the meaning of power!
"GESTAHL:I don't think so, friend. Your days are now over."
GESTAHL:Now relax......I'm simply going to put you to sleep with the very power you unleashed......
GESTAHL:What's so funny?!
GESTAHL:Very well. It is only fitting that you go to sleep laughing!
GESTAHL:N......noooo!! Why isn't my magic working?!
GESTAHL:K......Kefka!!!!! H......how...?!
GESTAHL:How are you doing this?!
KEFKA:How? Simple! I'm standing within the field of the Statues! Their strong field absorbs all magic sent their way! Or didn't you notice?!
"KEFKA:And now, Statues! You've shown me a sign! It is time you show this old man your true power!"
GESTAHL:No! Kefka!! Don't do something stupid......
"KEFKA:I command you, Statues!!!"
KEFKA:You're way off!!!! Where're you aiming?!
KEFKA:Whoa! More to the right!
KEFKA:Run! Run! Or you'll be well done!
"KEFKA:Poor old......Oh well, what a worthless excuse of an Emperor!!"
GESTAHL:There'll be no one to worship us...
"CELES:Snap out of it, Kefka!"
"CELES:Oh, that's really smart, Kefka! Disturb their delicate balance, and they'll go haywire...!"
KEFKA:Who're you?!
SHADOW:Go! There are people counting on you!
SHADOW:Don't worry about me! Run!! I can't stop this chain reaction! I'll see you again. Count on it!
KEFKA:You can't escape me!!
SETZER:Hang on!
CID:Celes...at last...!
CID:You're finally awake!
CELES:I...feel like I've been sleeping for ever...
"CID:For one year, actually... I thought you were out for good."
CELES:A whole year...You've watched over me the whole time?
"CID:Yes, and I'm about out of energy."
"CID:We're on a tiny, deserted island. After the world crumbled, I awoke to find us here together with......a few strangers."
"CELES:The world...! So, it wasn't just a dream."
CELES:Where are my friends? Where's Locke...?
"CID:I don't know. I only know we're here... Maybe we're the only people left alive...Since that day, the world's continued its slide into ruin. Animals and plants are dying...The few others who washed up here with us passed away of boredom and despair."
CELES:My friends...they're probably all gone...
CID:Celes...you're the closest thing to family that I have...we could just live out our lives here peacefully...
"CELES:I suppose so, Cid...Or should I say, Granddad?! May I call you that?"
"CID:Gramps, eh? I'm overwhelmed! All of a sudden I have a granddaughter! Cough... Wheeze..."
CELES:My long-lost Granddad...
"CID:Ha, ha...hack...cough!CELES:Hey, are you hungry?"
"CID:I...haven't eaten in 3 or so days, ever since I became ill."
CELES:What would you like?
"CID:Well, unless I ask for fish, I won't get anything! That's all there is here!CELES:I'll go catch some."
"SABIN:If I move...The whole house'll collapse. First... save the child that's in there...I can't hold this up forever, so...Get out on the hum...urgh..."
SABIN:But of course! You think a minor thing like the end of the world was gonna do me in?
"SABIN:I know, I know...We smash Kefka, and deliver peace unto the world..."
GERAD:What's your problem?
"CELES:Y... you're Edgar, aren't you?!"
GERAD:Enough of this nonsense! I have things to do.
GERAD:I'll be busy getting ready for our departure to Figaro.
CELES:Don't play possum with me! Edgar? Or have you somehow lost your memory?
"GERAD:Listen, my lady, I've been ""Gerad"" all my life!"
"CELES:Only Edgar would say, ""my lady."""
"GERAD:What's all the bloomin' fuss about? The words, ""my lady"" are used the world over!"
"GERAD:Oh, yeah, you know how to get into Figaro Castle, don't you?!"
"HENCHMAN:G'ho ho, do we ever!"
"GERAD:Yeah, You lead the way since it's buried."
GERAD:Let's go help 'em... Hang on a sec... ......? Are you people STILL here?
CELES:Be polite now... Edgar!
"GERAD:Case of mistaken identity, my dear. Give it up!"
SIGFRIED:Pretty dangerous from here on. I'll go in first and clear out all the monsters. Wait here.
"GERAD:Now, where were we...?"
GERAD:Good Job! I used to have a turtle...!
GERAD:You all right? You were almost a goner.
GERAD:Here's the problem... What a mess...
GERAD:You guys get in there while I keep this thing busy!
GERAD:Get going!
"EDGAR:What're ya waiting for, Celes? Give me a hand!!"
CELES:Edgar! It IS you!
CELES:Why the stupid farce?
"EDGAR:Well, I heard that Figaro had had an accident. I wanted to help, but didn't know where to look. Then I heard that those idiots had escaped from the prison."
CELES:You needed to use them...
EDGAR:Bingo. I had to wait until they led me to their secret cave.
"CELES:Amazing, considering that you threw most of 'em in jail to begin with!"
"EDGAR:Uh, oh...! Let's hide!"
"PARTY:""You don't want that treasure back...?""EDGAR:It's completely worthless. Besides, Kefka's the one we need to worry about. Those guys haven't committed any serious crimes..."
"CELES:Come on, let's go..."
CELES:Setzer!SETZER:You're alive!?
CELES:Come along with us! We're after Kefka!
SETZER:Phew... I don't know if I have it in me anymore...
"CELES:What are you saying?!SETZER:I'm just a gambler...I just want to be left alone...This world is too chaotic for me. What's worse, I've lost my wings..."
"CELES:But before the world collapsed, you fought with all your heart! You were absolutely fearless..."
SETZER:That was then... We can never have that world back!
CELES:You want to live in this world as it is? No? Then do something about it!
SETZER:Mwa ha!All right...you win! I'm starting to feel lucky!!
"SETZER:Thanks... I needed that. Now, let's go visit Daryl's Tomb."
"SETZER:......We're gonna get us another one... Airship, that is...!"
CELES:This person...She was your friend?
SETZER:Yeah. She was a piece of work. Nothing scared her...
"SETZER:Could be anything lurking down here, so keep your eyes peeled!"
SETZER:This brings back a lot of memories.
DARYL:This experimental airship is probably a bit unstable...
SETZER:You can't be serious! What are you trying to prove?!
SETZER:Watch your step.
"DARYL:If something should happen to me, the Falcon's yours!"
SETZER:Nonsense! I'll win the Falcon from you when I whip you in a race! You'd better clear outta my way!
"DARYL:Big talk, buster!"
SETZER:There's nothing like flying!
DARYL:Come on! Stop lagging back there!
DARYL:Or do you like chewing on my wake!
SETZER:Listen to you!
DARYL:This time's for real. I'm going to break every record! I'll be known as the woman who flew closest to the stars!
SETZER:Be back before sunset! I'll be waiting for you on our hill.
"SETZER:I restored the craft, and then put it to rest down here."
EDGAR:This is THE Falcon?
SETZER:I put it in storage. I couldn't bear to look at it. But now it just may save us... The Falcon.
EDGAR:I finally think we're gonna pull this off!
CELES:We can attack Kefka's tower from the air!
EDGAR:The Falcon's going to give us one last chance at that guy...
SETZER:But first we need to find our friends!
EDGAR:Right. First things first. For once I feel hopeful!
CELES:Hey! A bird!
CELES:Setzer! Follow that bird!
SETZER:But why?
CELES:I...don't know...! Something inside just tells me it's important...
LOLA:Look! My boyfriend in Mobliz sent me all these flowers! They're all hand-made of silk. And these are letters he has written to me...
LOLA:Could you please attach this reply to a carrier pigeon?
LOLA:Thank you.
CYAN:Hey!! You're alive!?
CYAN:I shall go with you! I shan't leave the world as it is! But how did you find me? W...wait! Tell me you didn't read my letters...!!
CYAN:These... they're... um... Merely a diversion of mine...
CYAN:Mm...m...!? This is an outrage...!
"CYAN:I learned of that poor girl when I passed through Maranda. When I heard that she sent a letter each day, but never received any replies... Something inside me snapped..."
"CYAN:As I wrote to that girl, I realized I was very much like her. I was looking behind...full of despair. My eyes were closed... And then something changed..."
OWZER:P...please... Help that painting!!
OWZER:It's...there's a monster hiding in my prized painting of a goddess...
OWZER:Yes... And now it's nearly impossible to get it to show itself...
OWZER:Relm! We can't attack this masterpiece! It would be inexcusable!
"CHADARNOOK:G'fu, fu, fu... Who're these numbskulls? No one...NO ONE...is going to remove me from this fine new painting!!"
DEMON:The girl in the picture is mine! You can't have her!
RELM:Hey! Relax! The monster croaked!
OWZER:Thanks for saving the day! This picture's more precious to me than my own life!
RELM:Huh?! What are you talking about?
"OWZER:It all started when I bought a stone at the Auction House. I took one look at it and suddenly felt I needed a portrait of Starlet. I asked several artists, but none could muster enough skill. It was then that I heard about Relm's amazing ability. I brought her here, and put her to work. But while she was painting, that thing came along... It must have been enticed here by that stone."
OWZER:The stone? Over on that bookshelf.
OWZER:Phew. I don't need any more bad luck. Just take it and go!
"RELM:I have to go! But fear not, I'll be back to finish this painting!"
OWZER:I'll be waiting for you!
RELM:You!! You old fool!!! You're still standing?!
"STRAGO:Relm! Is that you, my dear? You're alive!!"
RELM:Idiot! Of course I'm all right!
STRAGO:Oh...I'm so happy...
"RELM:Did you think I was gonna check out before you, old man?! <D>Ah, ha, ha..."
"STRAGO:You're as foul-mouthed as ever, bless your heart!"
RELM:Come along now...We're all glad to see you!
"STRAGO:Whoa! Well I'll be... All right, make room for me!"
SHADOW: The only thing I know how to do is fight...
"PARTY:""Why not come with us?""SHADOW:Well..."
SHADOW:First I need to see how far I can get here...
TERRA:Oh! I'm so glad to see that you're safe! I've missed you!
TERRA:That is I... um...I can't fight any longer...
"TERRA:The very day the world fell, Kefka turned some kind of beam on this town. Almost all of the adults perished trying to save their children..."
"TERRA:There were only children here... The moment I arrived, I felt needed..."
DUANE:You can't take Terra away!
"KATARIN:Duane... Please excuse him. It's just that if Terra goes, she takes with her the very spirit of our survival..."
"TERRA:I don't know why these kids need me...But they've made me feel things I've never felt before. The moment I sensed this, I lost my will to fight."
"TERRA:I can honestly say I don't know what's going on inside of me...And the more I try to understand it, the less inclined I am to fight."
TERRA:Phunbaba's an ancient demon who was released when the world was undone.
TERRA:I've really lost it... My fighting edge...
"TERRA:I'm staying here. As you can see, I can't be of any help to you. And besides, the children really need me.PARTY:""But Terra...!"""
TERRA:Maybe after a little more time passes...I need to understand what's happening to me...
TERRA:Hey you guys!
TERRA:Katarin's having a baby.
KATARIN:I'm so happy to have had a child...But Duane seems miserable...
"DUANE:Katarin... ... I'm sorry. I didn't know how to handle this. I've been an awful husband... But I'm learning. Please, come back with me."
TERRA:I...I can fight!
"TERRA:Finally...I understand that feeling...Even though I kept it buried for so long. I'm sure it's called... ...... ...... ""Love!"" I now realize that we must fight for the future of our children."
"TERRA:Duane... Katarin needs your help... so does your new baby. Listen children, your ""Mama"" has to go away for a while. I'll return when I feel your future's guaranteed!"
TERRA:I'll be back. I promise! Till then...you behave!
TERRA:Thank you... You helped me to understand a part of myself. Now I must go to war. We must all believe we have a future. We must fight for those who aren't even born yet!
LOCKE:You're all safe! Behold...A legendary relic that can restore life...
LOCKE:Correct! Legend has it that ages ago the Phoenix was turned to stone...And many legends are based on facts...This has some major cracks in it though...I fear it may have lost its power over time...
"CELES:Locke...That's for Rachel, isn't it...?"
LOCKE:I wasn't able to save Rachel...I've lost all sense of purpose...My life will have no meaning until I can right this terrible wrong...
"PATRIARCH:If only the Magicite didn't bear those deep cracks...I think you've been wasting your time, young man!"
PATRIARCH:Uwaaaaaa! The Magicite's gonna shatter!
RACHEL:Locke...I've dreamed of seeing you.I wanted to hear your voice.
RACHEL:The Phoenix has given me so little time...I have to leave again soon...But I have something I must tell you...
"RACHEL:Locke... ... With you I was so happy...In the instant that the accident occurred, I thought only of you...And about the joy you brought me. Thank you, Locke...I'll never forget you..."
"RACHEL:I have to go now... ...I'll always love you...You must now cast off the anguish you've been harboring inside for so long... Today I set your heart free. You must learn to love yourself again, and regain your self respect....... Phoenix! Be reborn again!! And give your power...to Locke!!"
"LOCKE:Thanks, I'm okay...I feel lighter than air...From here on...I'll be all right. Let's go! We have work to do!!"
CELES:What's up?
LOCKE:The treasures of the Phoenix Cave!
"LOCKE:Right, let's move out! We have an appointment with Kefka!"
"PICKPOCKET:Eh!? What're you doing here? Doesn't matter, really... nothing left anyway...There's only one Moogle still around, and only a treasure hunter could pick that lock..."
"MOG:Kupoppo! You're alive! I thought you were all feeding the worms, kupo! Kupohoho! Let's go!"
"MOG:Say, we could use some sasquatch muscle!! Besides, he'd be helpless here without me! He's somewhere in the mines. Once we find him, I'll order him to join us!"
EDGAR:It's time to break into Kefka's domain!
SETZER:What's wrong? Celes......
CELES:The Statues give the Espers the magical energy they need to live. If we destroy the Statues...
EDGAR:What'll happen?
"CELES:I'm really not sure, but..."
"STRAGO:The Espers...and magic, too, will most definitely disappear from this world."
EDGAR:And then...
CELES:What will happen to ... Terra...?
KEFKA:I've tapped into the ultimate power. Observe...!
KEFKA:Such magnificent power! You are like insects to me!
"KEFKA:I will exterminate everyone, and everything!"
KEFKA:Then I'll destroy those too. Why do people rebuild things they know are going to be destroyed? Why do people cling to life when they know they can't live forever? Think how meaningless each of your lives is!
"KEFKA:And have you found your #joy#, in this nearly dead world of ours?"
TERRA:I know what love is...!
LOCKE:And I have learned to celebrate life...and the living.
CYAN:My family lives on inside of me.
SHADOW:I know what friendship is... and family...
"EDGAR:It is my dream to build a kingdom in which I can guarantee freedom, and dignity."
SABIN:I have come to experience anew the love of my brother!
CELES:I've met someone who can accept me for what I am.
SETZER:My friend's airship... and her love!
STRAGO:I have a special little Granddaughter!
RELM:And I have a brave Grandpa who'll stand by me through it all.
MOG:I have my friends here!
GAU:You my friends! Me uwaooo all of you!
KEFKA:This is sickening... You sound like chapters from a self-help booklet! Prepare yourselves!
"KEFKA:Now, for my next trick, I will make you all...disappear!"
KEFKA:I command the greatest power in the universe! You are all helpless before me!
KEFKA:I will destroy everything... I will create a monument to non-existence!
KEFKA:No! I will hunt them down. I will destroy it all! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy!!
"KEFKA:Hee, hee, hee!! But what fun is destruction if no #precious# lives are lost!"
KEFKA:Life... Dreams... Hope... Where'd they come from? And where are they headed...? These things... I am going to destroy!!
"CELES:Come on, everybody! We have to work together!"
CELES:Terra! What's wrong?
EDGAR:The Espers...They no longer exist...
CELES:You mean Terra too?
TERRA:Come with me. I can lead you out with my last ounce of strength.
EDGAR:Cyan! Think you can handle that switch?!
CYAN:Machines... I HATE machines!
CYAN:You just have to show technology who's boss!!
SETZER:Wait! Let's go that way!! Sometimes in life you just have to FEEL your way through a situation!
SETZER:Daryl...I'm starting to sound just like you!
MOG:Heeeeelp! Save me!
MOG:The hair!! Watch the hair!!!
CELES:It won't open!
"SABIN:I didn't turn my back on the kingdom, big brother... I knew you'd be a better king. I trained hard knowing I might have to help you one day... Now I know why I have these stupid muscles!"
CELES:Both buttons have to be pressed simultaneously...
SETZER:Gogo! Watch Celes and do exactly what she does!
GAU:Gau find short cut!
LOCKE:I will not let go... <D>...I promise!
MADUIN:Terra...we must part now. We Espers will disappear from this world...forever. But if the human part of you is very strongly attached to something or someone...You will probably be able to remain in this world as a human being...
RELM:Grandpa! Stop goofing around!!
"STRAGO:Sorry, dear...RELM:If I hear even a peep out of you, I'm gonna draw your portrait!"
STRAGO:No! Anything but that!
"RELM:... ...but you know... Just once I'd really like to do a portrait of you...on canvas, of course!"
STRAGO:Relm! How can you be thinking about pictures at a time like this?!
SHADOW:Interceptor! Get going!
SHADOW:Stay well...
SHADOW:Baram! I'm going to stop running. I'm going to begin all over again...
"STRAGO:No...NO!!!! A ""kid"" like me doesn't know the meaning of defeat!"
EDGAR:The last piece of Magicite!
CELES:Terra! It's okay! Your power! It's fading...
"CELES:Terra, your strength is going!"
"TERRA:Thank you, Setzer!"
SETZER:Didn't I say it before?! This is the world's fastest ship!
WEDGE:The Esper's gotta be in here. Move out!
LOCKE:Couldn't hold out...?! Uh oh...
"LOCKE:This is the pits. We'd better hightail it southward, to Figaro."
MATRON:Edgar's at it again!? He hits on anything that moves!
EDGAR:You've been busy down south! Looking for more cities to destroy?
TROOPER:That's for us to know!
EDGAR:I thought we were allies! What are you doing in my domain?
"CHANCELLOR:The whole business of the succession was so repugnant to Sabin, the King's brother, that...... ......he fled the castle forever. The succession was settled with a coin toss..."
"LOCKE:Edgar, What's the matter? You look positively spooked!"
EDGAR:Dddddddid you just see what I saw...?
LOCKE:Yeah......this kid seems loaded for bear......
EDGAR:She's amazing! That was magic! MAGIC!
LOCKE:M M M M M M M MAGIC?! She used magic?
EDGARLOCKE:Pswswswsw! pswswswsw!!
EDGAR:Terra......where on earth did you learn that?
TERRA:......... Sorry......I...... um......
"LOCKE:Look, I didn't mean to make such a big deal of this......"
EDGAR:Me either......it's just that I've never actually SEEN magic before! Where did you...?
"LOCKE:Edgar, Terra can use magic, and we can't. That's the only difference between us. The fact is......we could use her help!"
"TERRA:Thank you, Locke! Thank you, Edgar!"
MERCHANT:I can't take money from the King!
"EDGAR:Look, don't you have a family? Just shut up and take it."
"MERCHANT:Sir Sabin, I can't take your money!"
SABIN:Take it! Haven't you heard? My brother says I'm a notorious spendthrift!
SABIN:Master was... Vargas...
"DUNCANS WIFE:I'll never understand Vargas... Fortunately, my husband taught his most secret techniques to you."
SABIN:For 10 years you've treated me like a son. I am eternally grateful!
LOCKE:At the very least you could give me a response...
EDGAR:Stand back! He seems vaguely familiar... Wait a minute...!
EDGAR:That's Shadow...! He'd slit his mama's throat for a nickel!
"LOCKE:Better steer clear of him, I guess."
SHADOW:Leave us. The dog eats strangers...
EDGAR:Hm... What's that smell...?
EDGAR:Flowers... His favorite...
EDGAR:And this... His favorite tea...
EDGAR:These dishes! They were his favorite!
EDGAR:Sabin...he was...here?!
EDGAR:What the...
EDGAR:You know this guy?
"MAN:Of course. He left a couple of days ago after he heard Master Duncan was slain. He headed into the mountains. I heard Duncan's son, Vargas, is missing as well. I have a bad feeling about this..."
VARGAS:Time to put an end to this!
SABIN:The Master's teachings...... Must use a Blitz technique......
BANON:Who did this? Who left this piece of paper here?
BANON:Have you made a decision? Will you become our last ray of hope?
"(if answering ""no"" to Banon repeatedly)BANON:I see..."
BANON:I thought as much...
BANON:You're sure about this?
TERRA:Hope... How can anyone put their hope in me?
BANON:You will? Really!!
TERRA:But... I'm scared...
BANON:The person who possesses this relic need not fear harm.
"BANON:Please, Terra... I'd like you to take it with you."
TERRA:What is this??? <D>
BANON:A lucky charm. Take it!
BANON:I have a plan! Please get everyone together!
"BANON:We all know that the Empire is using Magitek power in battle. The point is, how has the Emperor created it?"
EDGAR:I had Locke look into the rumor that the Empire is forcing the world's finest scholars to study Espers.
"LOCKE:All the trouble in Narshe is over an Esper, too..."
TERRA:You mean there's some connection between Espers and Magitek?
BANON:I can only recall one thing linking Espers with Magitek power...
EDGAR:You don't mean...
BANON:Indeed! The ancient War of the Magi...
LOCKE:My Grandma used to tell me stories about magical machines... Could they have been true?
EDGAR:Could that ancient tragedy be playing out once again...
"BANON:It's just speculation... But historical studies have provided a number of conflicting and frightening theories... According to one theory, humans and machines were imbued with powers drained from Espers..."
TERRA:That could explain Magitek power...
EDGAR:We can only fight Magitek enemies with Magitek weapons...
"BANON:It's risky, but if we have Terra...speak with that Esper, it might just wake up..."
EDGAR:I wonder if that's wise...?
"BANON:Who can say? Regardless, we need Terra's help."
TERRA:I'll do it!
SABIN:What nonsense! You sound as if you're enjoying this!
BANON:What? What's that noise?
"LOCKE:These are a little too big, but they'll do."
"LOCKE:Ouch!! I gotta steal me some new clothes, fast!!"
DUNCANS WIFE:I'm sure there's a hidden passage under the rich man's house. Find the room that's drafty.
"MERCHANT:Look! As luck would have it, I'm fresh out of merchandise!"
"MERCHANT:Thanks to the Empire, my business is up!"
"CELES:You're awfully short for a soldier.LOCKE:Oh, I forgot I was wearing a uniform!"
CELES:What do you hope to peddle down here?LOCKE:Oops! Forgot I was wearing these clothes.
CELES:And you are...
SOLDIER:...more soup...'n...
CELES:This passage leads out.
BANON:Wait a sec!
EDGAR:Hold on. I'm King Edgar of Figaro...
BANON:Aye yai yai...
EDGAR:That kind of attitude is deadly! He won't even listen!
TERRA:It's all my fault...
AGED MAN:You the clock maker? I been waitin' for ages!
"AGED MAN:There it is, on the wall. Ain't been tickin' for 1, 5, shucks, maybe even 10 years!"
"AGED MAN:Lawnmower repairman, eh? Couldn't provide worse service! Grass's 25 feet high out back!"
AGED MAN:Got it! You're here to fix my bed! It's squeakin' like all git-out!
"AGED MAN:No more lip, repairman! Fix that stove, on the double!!!"
AGED MAN:Goodness! Then you must be... You've come to fix the door!?
"AGED MAN:Child...? Ain't no child 'round here! Bolderdash! I'm ready for you to leave! Go on, git! I'm tossin' ya out onta the Veldt!"
"MERCHANT:Howdy. I own the dry goods business out here! You're...not from these parts, huh? We'll, no matter!"
MERCHANT:Welcome! Need anything?
MERCHANT:See you around.
MERCHANT:Good day. Need anything?
"(if the player had not met Shadow in South Figaro)SABIN:You...on a journey? I got separated from my friends. Say, can you tell me how to get to Narshe?"
"MAN:The Empire has set up a base somewhere beyond the forest, and to the east."
MAN:They seem to have their sights set on Doma Castle.
"SABIN:Doma, huh? I have to reach Narshe immediately!"
"MAN:Your only chance is through Doma. I'll show you the way. Just know that I may take off at any time, if I feel like it."
SHADOW:Imperial soldiers have built a base somewhere beyond the forest.
SHADOW:They seem to have their sights set on Doma Castle.
"SABIN:So Doma's next, huh? I have to reach Narshe immediately!"
"SHADOW:Your only hope is through Doma. I'll show you the way. Just know that I may take off at any time, if I feel like it."
SHADOW:The Reaper is always just a step behind me...
SABIN:What the...? Where'd these soldiers come from?
SOLDIER:Who goes there?
SOLDIER:...??? I knew I heard something...
SOLDIER:Just a lousy cat...
DOMA SENTRY:Sir Cyan! We're through.
"CYAN:Here, too..."
"SABIN:That guy's a sitting duck! Gotta help him, fast!"
SABIN:Uwaaa! It's that poison! This isn't gonna be easy...
SABIN:Nothing but poison this way!
CYAN:Eeoooa! Be you friend or enemy?!
SABIN:Ouuuch! ...didn't MEAN to step in there...
TROOPER:This is off limits.
IMPRESARIO:I manage this train! What business have you here? Hmmm...
"IMPRESARIO:This train ferries the dear departed to the ""other side."" There they can take their eternal rest."
CYAN:Be these time schedules?
SABIN:Hmmm... They're all blank!
"IMPRESARIO:The Phantom Train guides ""the departed ones"" to the spirit world. They have no need of schedules!"
SABIN:What's this? Let me just give it a...
CYAN:Sir Sabin! Maybe we shouldn't fumble with that!
SABIN:Gave it my best shot.
CYAN:How can you...!?
CYAN:How could you...
"SABIN:Cyan... You're not...scared, are you!?"
CYAN:How dare you?! Just because I respect other beings' property doesn't mean I'm not mechanically minded!
SABIN:Cyan... You're a total klutz when it comes to machines.
CYAN:SILENCE...! H...how could you tell?
SABIN:What is it?
CYAN:Seems to want to come with us.
"SABIN:But... The greater our number, the slower we can move. Forget it!"
WAITER:Please order at the table...
WAITER:Care for something?
"WAITER:One moment, please."
SABIN:Food! Food! Bring me everything ya got!
CYAN:A...are you going to be okay if you eat THIS?
SABIN:Worried? Can't wage war on an empty stomach!
CYAN:Hummm... Sir! I won't hear any more of this kind of talk!
SABIN:Well! I've stuffed down all I can... Let's go!
SABIN:Food! Chop! Let's go slop the hogs!
CYAN:A...are you going to be okay if you eat THIS?
SHADOW:...... Interceptor...are you hungry?
VOICE:Stop where you are!
"MAN:I am Ziegfried, the world's greatest swordsman! That treasure chest is mine. If I were you, Ox, I'd grab grandpa, here, and run!"
SABIN:You look more like a manicurist. Now SCRAM!!!
ZIEGFRIED:Aha! The ox bellows! Allow me to introduce my blade!
SIGFRIED:Impossible! I...I'm the greatest... But I'll still laugh last!
"SIGFRIED:Uwa, ha, ha! This treasure is mine! Ta ta, cretins!"
IMPRESARIO:Wanna stop the train? Just use the controls in the engineer's compartment!
SHADOW:Leave 'em alone.
SHADOW:I have served my purpose...
SABIN:Thanks for your help! Let's join ranks again some time!
"INJURED LAD:I'm from Maranda. The Empire invaded, and made me join their army. I fled when I heard we were making for Doma. They caught me...and did this... Now I can't even move. I'll never see Lola again... On the desk is a letter. Will you please read it?"
GAU:Uwaou!! Waooo......ooo! You......strangers...! Go away! You scare animals!
"GAU:Ooh...I'm hungry!GAU:Uwao, aooh! I'm Gau! I'm your friend! Let's travel together!SABIN:Not over here...SABIN:Tonic...CYAN:T...this is Sir Gau's treasure?!SABIN:Hey, Gau. What's wrong?GAU:Gau!!SABIN:G'uh! My pouch! There was 500 GP in it...!SABIN:Gau...YOU!(if the player has more than 500 GP)"
"CYAN:Oh, dear. Sir Sabin, let me handle this."
SABIN:Urggggh!(if the player has less than 500 GP)
"CYAN:Sir Sabin... Recall that you had me hold onto your pouch. Here.NPC:This is Nikeah, one of the world's few port towns.NPC:We used to be a trading town, but the Empire shut us down.NPC:The land to the east, Doma, fell to the Empire.NPC:Move along, now. You're in the way!NPC:No one can reach Nikeah unless they have a ship!NPC:A rock slide has blocked the path leading north.NPC:The path leading north is now clear.NPC:The Empire has overrun our destination.NPC:Nikeah-bound ferry."
"> (Hop aboard?)NPC:There used to be ships sailing to the southern continent. Tzen, Albrook, Maranda... They've all been smashed.NPC:Ya met that odd man, lives near the Lete River? His wife bore 'im a son 13 years ago. It was a problem birth, and the woman passed away. The man totally lost it. He thought the newborn was a monster. Wonder what happened to the poor little baby?DANCER:Yoo hoo! You handsome thing. How 'bout joining me? Tee hee!CYAN:H...how dare you... you licentious howler!DANCER:Geez, don't blow an artery, baby!CYAN:B...baby?!SABIN:Cyan... Don't let it get to you."
CYAN:I'm not like that!
"SABIN:No one thinks you are. Just let it go.DANCER:Stop whispering! My ears are burnin', baby!CYAN:Enough! Have you no shame? I'll have you know...etc...etc.NPC:Goodness!NPC:You took one look at me and thought I was a loser, right? You're obligated to buy from me, now!NPC:Looks like junk, but... Have any imported goods?"
TERRA:Kefka... He stuck that crown on me?
LOCKE:Bloody Empire!! We are your worst enemy!
CELES:I'm free The Empire can't control me!
EDGAR:Kefka...grr... What's he up to...?
SABIN:Master Duncan's techniques mustn't fail me.
CYAN:I will avenge the people of Doma!!
GAU:Gau hit hard!!!
BANON:We're history if they reach me! Good luck!
BANON:Couldn't hold out!? I have a bad feeling about this...
LOCKE:I promised Terra I'd...keep her safe...
CELES:She ripped outta here! Looked just like...an Esper...
CYAN:We have to help her!
EDGAR:Find Terra!
SABIN:I'll watch over Narshe! Go quickly!
GAU:Gau...Gau do his best!
BANON:Go find Terra! She holds the future to our survival.
"ARVIS:Heard Terra turned into light and streaked away toward the west. Make your way to Figaro Castle. Maybe they can help you, there."
ELDER:I'm troubled...I want to avoid fighting...But...
SHADOW:I've worn out my welcome...
"MATRON:Sabin... Every bit an adult, now... I remember that time so vividly. I was so angry I learned something important on that day..."
"CHANCELLOR:Welcome back, King Edgar!"
CHANCELLOR:Huh!? Sabin... What a splendid young man you've become!
CHANCELLOR:Make yourselves at home here.
SHADOW:We meet again...
"SHADOW:Just need 'nough to feed my dog. Say, oh...3000 GP."
SHADOW:Leave me alone...
LOCKE:...wasn't able to... save her when she needed me...
RACHEL:Locke! What are we off to find today?
"LOCKE:Soon, you'll..."
"LOCKE:You're not going to believe what awaits us up here! Come on, it's worth a fortune!"
RACHEL:Locke! Look out!
LOCKE:Rachel! Are you awake?
RACHEL:... ......? I... I can't remember anything...
RACHEL'S DAD:Get outta here! It's your fault she's lost her memory!
"LOCKE:Wait a minute! She said ""Yes!"" We were gonna..."
"RACHEL:Go! I don't know who you are, but ever since you came here my parents have been upset!"
LOCKE:You mean those herbs have actually saved her?
LOCKE:What if there were some way to...call her back?
CYAN:Is Miss Terra okay?
CELES:Is Terra okay?
GAU:Terra...she ok?
CELES:But don't Espers live in another world?
GAU:Espers...from other world?
GAU:Why hide fact you Esper?
LOCKE:But my grandma told me that Espers and people once lived side by side! Was that just a fairy tale?
GAU:Gau hear fairy tale. People...Esper once live together peacefully...
CELES:The Magitek Research Facility...? Your people are still there?!
GAU:Magitek Research Facility...? There...your people?
CELES:Magitek Research Facility... Your people are...
SHADOW:You old fool... Why throw it all away?
CELES:Ramuh... Why...?
GAU:R.a.m.u.h... You leave...?
"CYAN:He traded his power, so that others might live..."
"CELES:He traded his power, so that others might live..."
RAMUH:We few can help save many. The War of the Magi must not be repeated...
SHADOW:There's no need for me to remain with you.
LOCKE:I'm going to the dressing room.
IMPRESARIO:Is everything okay?
EDGAR:Go right ahead.
SABIN:Uh? Why's everyone singing?
CYAN:Going somewhere? I'm going to relax!
GAU:Pretty song!
IMPRESARIO:Your friend left. Said he'd have fallen asleep in another 5 minutes...
"IMPRESARIO:Sorry, but yesterday's performance was awful! I'll give you just 3 more chances!"
IMPRESARIO:You have 2 more chances.
IMPRESARIO:You have 1 more chance.
IMPRESARIO:We're all in this together!
LOCKE:Don't make any more mistakes!
ULTROS:N'ghooo! And it only weighs 4 tons...!
"ULTROS:N'ghaa, ha, ha! Whooooopie!!"
STAGE MASTER:Off limits! Please turn around.
"EDGAR:I'm the King of Figaro. If you cooperate, you'll be well rewarded..."
"SABIN:My brother's the King of Figaro. Cooperate, and you'll be well rewarded!"
"CYAN:I'm one of Doma's Knights. Please, help us."
EDGAR:The Empire and my realm were allies... until recently.
SABIN:The Empire'll end up owning you!
CYAN:...I lost my friends... and my family.
SABIN:That coin...!? BIG BROTHER!!! Don't tell me...!
SETZER:What's going on? The Empire's becoming paranoid!
SOLDIER:Returner scum!
CYAN:See! I knew she couldn't be trusted!
CYAN:Whoa! What IS that?!
EDGAR:Something horrible's coming!!
SABIN:Uwaaoo! What in the...?
GAU:Gau! Gau go!!
ELDER:This evening is an ill omen...
ELDER:Everything all right? WHAT? The human's gone?
MADONNA:Terra's all right.
ELDER:Where are you going?! D' goh!MADUIN:Madonna's getting drawn into the next world...!
ELDER:Impossible! It's too late! I've already begun casting the barrier. There's no turning back!
MADUIN:That fool...
WOLF:Hmmm...if this is how it's gonna be then...take this!
NARSHE'S ELDER:Our battle lies before us. We must make ourselves ready.
"BANON:Get the Espers to understand, and we can bring this war to a screeching halt. Terra... I know you can do this..."
"ARVIS:The sealed gate stands at the eastern edge of the Empire. There's a base there, but somehow we'll have to slip through..."
TERRA:I can do it... But why do I feel so wretched?
LOCKE:Beyond is the Esper World...
CYAN:What an eerie place...
"EDGAR:From here on, it's all up to Terra..."
"SABIN:We're counting on you, Terra..."
SETZER:Why'd you bring me to such an awful place!?
TERRA:...the Espers... Something happened...
LOCKE:I'm sure the Espers were headed for Vector...
CYAN:I could feel the warrior spirits of those Espers!
EDGAR:Somehow we need to tap in to the power of those Espers...
SABIN:Let's see what's become of the Empire! Hurry!
"SETZER:Urghh! For the time being, I don't own the skies..."
GAU:...ooh... Gau...high place... Not good...don't like...
SETZER:I'll have to repair the air ship. Go scout around and let me know what's happening.
SETZER:Repairs aren't finished yet. You'd better take the boat from Albrook.
BANON:What ARE you talking about...?! ......!! Talking with...Espers...?
ARVIS:It was like this when we got here.
RETURNER:What on earth...
BANON:Could Gestahl have meant such a thing? Team up with the Empire to track down an Esper... Hmm...
ARVIS:Makes sense. Can't just forget about Espers...
RETURNER:The war... It's over...right?
NARSHE GUARD:We didn't have to do a thing! The Empire's troops just ran away in terror!
NARSHE GUARD:What's going on?
KEFKA:Grrr! How DARE they put me in a place like this!
KEFKA:I don't believe this!
KEFKA:What a bore.
GESTAHL:Well then... To our hometowns!
GESTAHL:Well then... To the Empire!
GESTAHL:Well then... To the Returners!
GESTAHL:My desire for power got the best of me. Now I've come to my senses.
GESTAHL:I feel we need each other's help at this time...
GESTAHL:Some of my men refuse to embrace peace. I felt they'd understand if they actually met you face to face.
CID:All will be put right if we can achieve peace...!
TROOPERS:We want to test your strength! Won't you fight with us for a couple of minutes?
TROOPER:Just as we thought...
GESTAHL:I understand. My only dream in life is...peace! Now I must ask for a favor...
GESTAHL:I understand. I've ordered this war to be over! Now I must ask for a favor...
GESTAHL:I understand. I'm truly sorry for what I've done! Now I must ask for a favor...
GESTAHL:We cannot simply ignore the Espers!! Please...come with me!
SABIN:Didn't I see you at Doma? ...I'm SURE I did... So that was General Leo...
"LEO:You! You're Cyan, liege to the king of Doma! Please forgive me for not being there to stop Kefka..."
CYAN:...... That wasn't your fault.
"CID:Wow, what a ship!"
SETZER:That landing really messed up the engine. It'll take a while to fix...
CID:I'll help. No machine can stump me!
SETZER:Don't touch anything!
CID:Go kill time in the casino! I can speed this crate up!
SETZER:...... You little...!! Get outta my sight!
CID:But I could really make this thing hum...!
"TERRA:You love this ship, more than anything, huh?"
"SETZER:Actually, when I was young there was something I was mad about..."
SETZER:In my youth I dreamed of having the world's fastest airship.
TERRA:You mean......
"SETZER:At that time there was a young girl who piloted the Falcon, the fastest vessel ever made. Sometimes we were the worst of rivals...but other times we were the best of friends. We always egged each other on to go faster and higher. When she disappeared along with her ship... I felt like I lost my spirit."
SETZER:... Poor Daryl...
SHADOW:I'm working for the Empire. But don't worry...I'm not going to garrote you!
NPC:'NPC:Stay clear of the engine room. It's dangerous.
"LEO:Terra, we'll continue yesterday's conversation later..."
"MAYOR:Welcome, welcome! Magic...? What is this ""magic""?"
MAYOR:No one is to divulge that we are able to use magic!
STRAGO:What a beautiful day.
"RELM:Interceptor, please come back again and play!"
"M.TEK TROOPER:General Leo, prepare yourself!"
LEO:No. I won't let this happen!
MAYOR:I can only take some comfort in the fact that there were so few casualties.
"GUNGHO:Is that you, Strago? Have you come back to hunt Hidon?"
"GUNGHO:He'll never change. That's who he is! When you were younger you hunted Hidon, the legendary monster. But you quit before you found it..."
"STRAGO:I didn't really quit! It's just that, well, the monster lives only on Ebot's Rock, which has been submerged for some time."
GUNGHO:You never could give me an honest answer.
GUNGHO:What a buffoon!!
TERRA:I'm all right. I'm sure peace is within our grasp!
LOCKE:I can't believe we played a major role in it all!
CYAN:The Empire deserves the worst!
EDGAR:We can't be smug. We must be thinking of our strategy.
SABIN:Let me at the Empire!
"STRAGO:In all my travels, and in all my years..."
RELM:I know. Let me draw their portraits!
"SETZER:What's the most important thing in life? Being free of obligations! Otherwise, you lose the ability to gamble..."
GAU:Gau become stronger on the Veldt.
"ULTROS:I lose AGAIN! Well, today I've brought a pal! Mr. Chupon! Come on down!"
ULTROS:Better not irritate him! He gets hungry when he's irritated...
ULTROS:Mr. Chupon's taciturn but terribly powerful!
ULTROS:I was drowsing the other day when Mr. Chupon gnawed on my head! He needed something to polish his teeth on!
SHADOW:We meet again.
"""Shadow!!""SHADOW:I'll be blown to bits before I can even collect my pay..."
"CID:I feel much better! Thanks, Celes!"
"CID:My dear, I...feel I'm not going to be around much longer..."
"CID:Celes, thanks for all you've done for me!"
CID:Hackack!! I feel a little better!
CID:Cough...wheeze...I can't bear this any longer...
CID:I...I'm not long for this cruel new world...
CID:My worst nightmare is to think of you alone here on this wretched island...hack...wheeze!!
"CID:Cough...hack...ACK!! While I can still talk, I...wheeze...pant...want to thank you...cough!"
"CELES:Granddad, here's a fish! Eat up!"
"CID:Oh! Yum... Chomp, munch, chew..."
CELES:What's up?
CID:Celes...the project that kept me going over the past year is down below. Go have a look at it!
"CELES:Granddad. You have to eat, or else... W...what's the matter?"
CELES:No...NO!! You promised you'd stay here with me!!
"CELES:Granddad, ANSWER ME! Tell me you're just joking!"
CID:Celes... You must leave this place. You have to find your friends!
CELES:I know... But I'll bring 'em all back to meet you!
"CID:That Locke fellow, too, no doubt..."
CELES:I'll make you proud of me...Granddad...
CID:Those others who were here... when they were feeling down they'd take a leap of faith from the cliffs up north...perked 'em right up!
"CELES:Everyone's gone...Even Locke, who promised to watch over me...The world's slowly ebbing away..."
CELES:Phew...Why did you nurse me back to health? Did I ever ask you to help me?!
"CELES:A bandana??? No...it can't be... Hey, you! Where'd you get this?! Is the person who healed you still alive? Answer me!"
CELES:He's alive... Locke's still alive!!!
SABIN:Hey! Celes!
CELES:Let's head in!
"SABIN:Hey! You're alive!!! Get in there, quick!"
"SABIN:I...I...I'm losing my grip...Keep up the fight, brother!"
CELES:Sabin! You're alive!
"CELES:I thought everyone was gone...I had given up all hope...But... fortunately, I was wrong! Now I know they're all alive! We need to find everyone! Then..."
"DUNCANS WIFE:No, dear! Duncan's still alive and well! He's meditating just north of Narshe."
SABIN:Don't treat us like strangers anymore!
"SABIN:There's only one little problem, eh, brother!"
CELES:Locke...He's alive!!
LOLA:I hope his reply comes soon!
LOLA:I knew that these flowers and letters weren't sent by my boyfriend. I just didn't want to admit it. I was lying to myself... But I'm all right now. As I read those letters......the pain I felt in my heart became bearable...I'm sure whoever wrote them has suffered greatly...I wish I could meet him...
CYAN:Look to the future...We have a lot of life left to live...
CYAN:No! That's mine!!!
RELM:I'm still a bit groggy...But I'm okay. Interceptor always makes me happy!
"SHADOW:No need to worry. It's just a scratch. Also, he's gonna stand guard, so you just relax."
"ULTROS:Look at me! I'm a receptionist! G'fa, ha, ha! Now, you'd better watch what ya bet, or master Chupon'll just come and take it from ya!"
SIGFRIED:Someone's been pretending to be me! Don't be fooled!
TERRA:I'm sorry...I'm staying! The children need me.
DUANE:I...don't know what to do. Katarin's pregnant...
TERRA:Please! Save this village! I simply can't fight...
DUANE:I'll keep Katarin safe.
KATARIN:I feel safe when Duane's around.
DUANE:This is our village. You can't just waltz in here and start barking out orders!
"KATARIN:Terra's helped us all to survive. Ever since she's been here, we've felt hopeful for the future."
DUANE:A new life... I've got to do my best to help make the world a safer place...
KATARIN:We'll be okay. Just make sure these kids'll have a world to grow up in!
ESPER:You HUMANS freed me from that prison of ice? You possess Magicite?! Who are you?! I sense war and destruction...Could that stupid war possibly have lasted a thousand years? I can tell that you want to put a stop to the madness...Let's see if you are worthy!
"MOG:I'm your boss, kupo! You're gonna join us, kupo!!!"
"MOG:Umaro! No slouching, now!"
"CREATURE:I am Gogo, master of the simulacrum... My miming skills will astonish you."
"GOGO:Yes...I have been idle for too long. If I deem you worthy, I'll mime your actions in battle. But first you must tell me what you're doing here."
GOGO:What an unusual tale...But I sense that you're trying to help make things right again. This should be fun. When do we leave?
WREXSOUL:I'm gonna possess your body! I'll only appear in this form again when you're about to expire!
CYAN:Thanks be to you.
CYAN:I heard my wife and children calling out to me! Their voices finally gave me the strength and courage to come to grips with my own suffering.
CYAN:No...I didn't do anything...then...and I can't now...I'm a man with no honor...
CYAN:Elayne and Owain live on in my heart. I must leave the past behind. I have much to live for...
"STAGE MASTER:Don't press the wrong switch, or..."
TERRA:Love between a human and an Esper...
MAYOR:It's only been a year since the world changed...But it feels like forever.
RELM:Yea!! We're back! It's like old times!
STRAGO:Time to relax! Home sweet home!
RELM:This is terrible! Gungho's hurt!
"STRAGO:Gungho, wake up!"
STRAGO:Who did this to you?
"GUNGHO:It was...Hidon, the beast you and I used to hunt. I almost had it..."
STRAGO:You took on Hidon...?
"GUNGHO:Oooh...cough, cough..."
GUNGHO:Strago... Please...you must avenge me...
RELM:Gramps! Why are you hesitating!
STRAGO:Well... I spent my youth chasing that creature. To do it again at this age is more than I bargained for.
"STRAGO:Gungho... rest easy, I'll do it for you!"
"RELM:Just a minute! You don't think you're going alone, do you?"
"STRAGO:I spent too many years of my life hunting that thing. It is my obsession, not yours."
"RELM:But Grandpa! This ""obsession"" of yours could easily slay you! You're my Grandfather. I can't just sit idly by and watch you go."
"STRAGO:Sorry, Relm. I'm so grateful that you care! But as its name implies, the Hidon is extremely difficult to find. Unless I go alone, it will not show itself."
"STRAGO:Next stop, Ebot's Rock."
"TREASURE:I'm hungry! Hungry hungry hungry hungry hungry hungry hungry hungry hungry hungry hungry hungry!! Feed me! Otherwise, I won't let you by!"
TREASURE:Bluuurp! Whew!
"TREASURE:Oh, yeah, you wanna pass through here, right?"
TREASURE:Eh!! What the...!
STRAGO:That's Hidon!
STRAGO:I did it! I...I...I actually beat Hidon!
STRAGO:I have to tell Gungho he is avenged!
GUNGHO:What's all the hullabaloo?!
STRAGO:Listen to me! I DEFEATED Hidon!
GUNGHO:You WHAT?! You b...beat Hidon?! You're lying! LYING!
"RELM:No, he's not! He really defeated Hidon."
"STRAGO:Ho, ho, ho! If I didn't know better, I'd say that Hidon wasn't my only enemy!"
GUNGHO:I don't believe this. This has to be a joke!
"STRAGO:Ho, ho, ho!! ...by the way, how are your wounds healing, Gungho?"
"GUNGHO:Eh? Oh, they're fine..."
"STRAGO:There I was, in a cave that seemed endless. Then, before I knew it, Hidon appeared!"
"STRAGO:I stared Hidon straight in the eye, lifted my staff, and let him have it! G'Pow!! Thwack!! Crash!!"
"STRAGO:I wanted to show my enemy the true meaning of the word, ""hero""!"
STRAGO:And then......
RELM:What happened to Grandpa?
GUNGHO:Huh? Finally! He nodded off.
"GUNGHO:However... Let's let him be! He's nice and...quiet... Now, about my ""wounds""..."
"RELM:Wait! First let me thank you. You gave Grandpa a reason to go and defeat something that had tormented him for decades! Even if YOU were faking, that creature meant business!"
GUNGHO:What a granddaughter he's raised! Amazing!
RELM:And what a terrible actor you are!
RELM:Only Strago could have been taken in by that performance!
GUNGHO:What the...!
GUNGHO:Everything okay?
GUNGHO:Hidon's appeared at Ebot's Rock again!
"CELES:The Espers, and magic, too, will cease to exist."
TERRA:Everyone's calling me.
KEFKA:Oh! But it hasn't yet begun! And I'm giving you a front-row seat!
CELES:Terra! You're back!
TERRA:Come with me!
EDGAR:Where's Sabin when you need him...?
EDGAR:Ladies first!
"SETZER:Don't fall! Remember, you promised me you'd do your #Maria# act again!"
SETZER:What a woman! Your life is hanging by a bandana!
"CELES:This is my good luck charm... <D>When I found this, my life took a turn for the better..."
CELES:Locke... Promise me someday you'll look after me again?!
RELM:I won't be done in by an older woman!
"RELM:Wait a minute, lover boy!"
RELM:You can't just throw me aside!
"RELM:How about a nice portrait for you, hmm?!"
SHADOW:My job here's over. I've earned my fee! Ta-ta......!
TERRA:General Leo... I believe I understand what you're trying to say.
"LOCKE:As long as there're people who need to be protected, I'll fight!"
CYAN:What an amazing device!
"EDGAR:If something happens to me, all the world's women will grieve!"
CELES:I'm glad I made it this far...I feel I have a lot to live for...
"STRAGO:Hey everyone! Let me see the light in your eyes! The old man, here, hasn't given up yet!"
RELM:Let's do it! Let's go get that madman!
SETZER:Something good will come of it all!
GAU:Gau become stronger on the Veldt.
"AGED MAN:Oh, hello again! Yep, you were tops!"
SABIN:That's why we...
AGED MAN:Quick! Fix that chair! Then you can use it to reach the roof.
SABIN:You don't suppose... Can this be Gau's father?
"SABIN:You don't suppose...Gau, could this be your father?"
"SABIN:Come on, Gau. It's true, right?"
SABIN:Yes. This is definitely your father.
GAU:......??? ...Gau's...father?! Oooogauooooo!
SABIN:Right!! Let's go tell your father the news! He needs to know you're his son!
SABIN:Just a minute... We can't just go there with you looking like this. I know! Let's go to Jidoor and give you a make-over!
"SABIN:No, Gau! Don't eat with your fingers!"
"SABIN:Don't say ""Yaoooo"" when you mean ""Yes!"""
TERRA:How do you like these? Wait! What about those? Hm...oh well...
TERRA:Did you say something?
CELES:Which is it gonna be? Oh! This is nice...but...Do you think it becomes Gau? Well...
CYAN:What a jaunty hat!
CYAN:Wait a minute! Where's the hat?
SABIN:This is it!
SABIN:Perfect! Functional yet sporty! Done!
"SETZER:Phew! Completely lacking in fashion... Excuse me, sir. Could you order some clothes like the ones I'm wearing?"
"EDGAR:I got it! A tuxedo, silk hat...and... ...a rose in his teeth!"
LOCKE:I think that's overdoing it just a bit... He should have a bandana on his head!
EDGAR:What's so great about a bandana? Most of the time I see 'em tied around dogs at the beach!
LOCKE:HEY! What do you mean by that?
"SABIN:Okay, Gau? Now, any father'd be glad to have a son like you!"
"SABIN:Excuse me, Sir."
AGED MAN:Who'n blazes 'r you? Oh! The repairman!
"SABIN:Sir...You...had a son, right? You with me!"
"SABIN:Right. The truth is, he's alive! Come here, Gau!"
"AGED MAN:What is this?! What's with this ""son"" business? I never had a son!"
"AGED MAN:But now that you mention it, I once had a terrible dream. In it, a demon-child was born! I grabbed the creature, and rushed off to the Veldt with itIt was crying like crazy when I arrived on the Veldt."
"SABIN:But, Sir..."
"AGED MAN:I left the child there... And without looking back, I turned and started to run."
SABIN:I'm trying to tell you...
AGED MAN:Suddenly the crying stopped. I turned around and saw a frightful monster... Hideous! Still gives me the shakes.SABIN:I give up...
"AGED MAN:But you, young man, your parents must be proud of you! I still have dreams of that demon child...Frightening..."
"SABIN:Why! You old... He's completely lost his mind! Gau, I'm gonna clobber him!!"
SABIN:I...I'm sorry...
GAU:Fffatherrr...alive...H... a... p... p... y...
"AGED MAN:Eh? Say, is everything fixed yet?"
"AGED MAN:The repairman, at last!"
AGED MAN:Map...?! Everyone's askin' 'bout that map!
"AGED MAN:Little while ago, some guy wearin' a bandana asked for the map. So I told him!"
AGED MAN:It's where the mountains form a star-shape! You should have just come out and asked me. No need to be shy!
AGED MAN:Got it?! Where the mountains form the shape of a star!
NPC: Arrrgh! I HATE it when that happens!
"NPC: Ho, ho, ho... There's nothing I can't buy!"
AUCTIONEER: Okay! Here's our next item!
"AUCTIONEER: Well, how 'bout it?"
NPC: XXXX GP!
CHILD:Papa!! I want that! Please!
"PAPA:No, you don't! Now, pipe down!"
CHILD:I want it...I want it! Buy it! Pretty please!!
AUCTIONEER: Are there any more bids?
"PAPA:Ho, ho, ho...All right! But just this once! And... ... Keep it a secret from Mama!"
"CHILD:Yahoo!!! Thanks, Papa! Yahoo!"
PAPA:500000 GP!
PAPA:1000000 GP!
"PAPA:Well, we have our treat for the day. Let's go home!"
CHILD:Yahoo! Yippy!!!!
DUNCAN:Look out! Move! Cough...wheeze... Darn this old body... Hey...you deaf?
"DUNCAN:Wa, ha, ha... Why the surprised face? Did you think I'd...gone?"
SABIN:Duncan... I'm so glad you're safe!!!
"DUNCAN:Whoa?! Sabin, this can't be... Tears??"
"DUNCAN:Wa, ha, ha... Nothing happened to me! The earth yawned right open to take me but I scrambled to safety!"
DUNCAN:Sabin!! It is now time to complete your training. Use these new skills to smash Kefka!
DUNCAN:Go! Give Kefka the boot!
DUNCAN:Cough...wheeze... Don't worry about me! Go! Destroy Kefka!
EDGAR:If only Sabin were here...
SABIN:This's like old times! I have to wander around for a while!
SABIN:Hey! Wait. I'm going too!
SABIN:Hmm... Castle hasn't changed much...
SABIN:And yet it's all different... Mom and Dad are gone... Everyone's gone... Since that day...
"SABIN:B...brother... Waa, ahhh, ahhh..."
EDGAR:So... They went and told you...
MATRON:Edgar! Here you are...
MATRON:Your father... He just uttered his last wish that Figaro be divided between you...
"SABIN:This is NONSENSE!! Everyone's saying that the Empire poisoned Dad... And the only thing on your minds is ""Who's going to be the next king?!"" You're all pathetic!"
"SABIN:No one cared when Mom passed away, either..."
MATRON:That's not...
SABIN:You were as bad as any of 'em!
SABIN:Empire of murderers... They won't get away with this!
EDGAR:Matron... Please leave us...
SABIN:I'm outta here! I'm forsaking this war-sick realm for my dignity and freedom.
"SABIN:You said you were sick of it too, right?!"
EDGAR:What'll happen to this realm if we both leave? And what would Dad say...?
"EDGAR:Sabin, let's settle this with a toss of a coin."
"EDGAR:If it's heads, you win. We'll choose whichever path we want, without any regrets. Okay?"
EDGAR:This is for Dad!
"EDGAR:And then, you opted for your freedom."
EDGAR:It's been...10 years. The little shrimp's grown into a whopping lobster!
SABIN:And you're a king crab!
EDGAR:Sabin... I often wonder if he'd be proud of me...
SABIN:Don't you ever doubt that!
EDGAR:10 years...
SABIN:Where has the time gone...?
EDGAR:Here's to a couple of confused grownups!
EDGAR:Here's to Dad...
SABIN:...to Mom... ...and to Figaro.
"BARAM:Clyde...I'm... done for... F...find me here... Please, Clyde..."
"BARAM:Yahoooo! We did it, Clyde!"
CLYDE:A million GP! What a blast! I love this!
BARAM:Guess it's time to change our name.
CLYDE:Our name?
"BARAM:We need something more...appropriate. Such as...? ... Shadow! Not bad, huh?"
CLYDE:Great train robbers of the century... Shadow...?
CLYDE:Open your eyes!
"BARAM:I'm scared...hack, cough... Is...is this MY blood...?"
CLYDE:You're gonna be okay!
BARAM:I've let you down... I'm sorry...
CLYDE:Save your strength. We're almost to a town.
BARAM:You don't have to pretend. I know. I've lost...too much blood.
BARAM:Get going! I'm gonna slow you down.
BARAM:You wanna get caught?
BARAM:Before you go... You have to use your knife...CLYDE:WHAT!!!!
BARAM:Think what they'll do to me if I get caught. I don't want to go through that. Do me this favor.
"BARAM:Are you...shaking? I can't believe it! You're acting like a coward! Come on, you weakling! Grab a knife and..."
CLYDE:I CAN'T!
CLYDE:I'm sorry...
BARAM:Clyde! How dare you!?
NPC:Hey...HEY! Stay with me now!CLYDE:Where...am...?
???: Wutai troops have hijacked Shinra Express MK93 II. The train is currently headed to Midgar Sector 8. A SOLDIER operative will be inserted to neutralize the situation. We are to proceed as scheduled. Commence mission in 3 2 1 mark. Begin mission. Operative is ready for insertion.
???: The train has been overrun by Wutai troops. Eliminate them and regain control of the train.
???: Oh yeah!
???: Get serious!
???: Zack!
"???: Zack, focus! There are no Shinra troops on this train. Understood?"
"Zack: Hello to you, too!"
Zack: Come and get it!
"Zack: SOLDIER 2nd Class Zack, on the job!"
???: Train MK 93 II re-routed to Sector 1 Station near Mako Reactor 1. Proceed to mission phase 2 and change surveillance rank...
Zack: Zack speaking.
"???(on the phone): Making progress, Zack?"
"Zack: What's going on, Angeal? Why are we fighting Shinra troops?"
"Angeal (on the phone): They're Wutai troops in disguise. Now, head to the open area above."
Zack: Towards Sector 8?
"Angeal (on the phone): Yes. But first, you have to clear a path."
Zack: Clear a path?
Angeal (on the phone): You'll see what I mean. Be careful.
Angeal (on the phone): Use some discretion.
Zack: It's showtime!
Angeal (on the phone): Not too bad.
Zack: Piece of cake! I'll make 1st in no time!
Angeal (on the phone): Go up the stairs at the end of the platform.
Zack: You got it!
???: Showing your back to the enemy... Overconfidence will destroy you.
Zack: Wh-what is this?
"Zack: Damn it, you're not the only hero!"
???: It's over.
Angeal: Impossible!
"Zack: Thanks, Angeal."
Angeal: Training's over.
Zack: Wha? Why?
Zack: You serious? I was just getting warmed up!
Angeal: Zack. Embrace your dreams.
Zack: Huh?
Angeal: If you want to be a hero you need to have dreams...and honor.
Zack: Huh.
"???: Hey Zack, you seem a little on edge."
Zack: Can you blame me? All this training and no assignments. Like they're hanging me out to dry. You must be pretty busy with everyone off base.
"???: Off-base? Wait, haven't you heard? There's been a mass desertion at SOLDIER."
"Kunsel: It appears one of the 1sts deserted. He took a bunch of 2nds and 3rds with him, too. Nobody knows why he left, or what he's up to. This mass desertion's the reason why your training's on hold."
"Kunsel: Heads up, a 1st!"
"Angeal: Zack, new assignment."
Zack: Woo! Finally! Some real action!
Angeal: This will be your show.
Zack: Yes!
Angeal: Report to Director Lazard. We'll give you the details.
"Lazard: Zack. It's good to finally meet face to face. Lazard, Director of SOLDIER."
Zack: Heya!
Zack: On to business.
"Lazard: SOLDIER 1st Class Genesis. A month ago, he went missing during a mission in Wutai. Know anything about this?"
Zack: Not a clue!
Lazard: The mission is currently stuck in limbo. That's why we've decided to send you.
"Zack: Uh, to Wutai?"
Lazard: Yes. This war has gone on long enough.
Angeal (to Zack): I've recommended you for 1st.
Zack: Angeal! I love you man! Ang--
"Angeal: Don't make me regret this, Zack."
Zack: Sir!
"Angeal: Once you're packed, you'll leave at once."
"Angeal: The operation will begin immediately upon arrival at Wutai. If you have any questions about the assignment or combat in general, you should talk to the other SOLDIER operatives."
Lazard: You will take over the assignment that was given to Genesis. Proceed to Wutai once you've made all the necessary preparations.
Kunsel: So? Did you read the mail?
"Zack: Oh, the tutorial mail..."
"Kunsel: Well, knowing you, you probably won't remember everything after one read."
Zack: That's not true...
"Kunsel: Well, read it when you need to refresh your memory. It'll come in handy, I promise. By the way, the materia you were using in training have been confiscated. Powerful materia have to be earned on your own. Those are the SOLDIER rules."
"Kunsel: The next thing you have to know about are the special tasks classified as ""missions."" Put simply, these are errands that the company assigns to SOLDIER operatives. To participate in missions, you have to register your personal information on the mission board. After you register, you can check missions on your handset. Come on, I'll show you how to register on the mission board."
Angeal: Good grief... You haven't even registered for missions? Go do that now.
SOLDIER 3rd Class: Time is of the essence. Please complete your preparations swiftly.
"Kunsel: This is the mission board. Here, try registering yourself now."
"Kunsel: Now that you're registered, you should try doing a mission."
Zack: Sounds like a good idea. I'll do that right now.
"Kunsel: The Save Point is that way. If you're unsure about combat during missions, you should read the tutorial mail I sent you."
"Angeal: You want to do a few missions for practice? Alright, hurry up, then."
Kunsel: Looks like you cleared a mission. Nice work.
"Zack: It was so easy, I could have done it blindfolded!"
"Kunsel: Ha ha ha! You're the man, Zack. I'll be waiting to hear your exploits on this Wutai assignment. Oh, I almost forgot."
"Kunsel: I never explained these supply pods to you, did I? In this supply pods are items you can use in battle. The company sends them to us periodically."
Zack: I see. They're like provisions for SOLDIER members.
Kunsel: It'd be a shame to squander the company's good will. Check it out before you go on assignment. I wonder what they gave us this time?
Angeal: Did you check the supply pods? You would be wise to take provisions when they're made available to you.
"Kunsel: All right, looks like you're ready to go. Lastly, I'll tell you about mail."
"Kunsel: Just now, I sent a mail to your handset. We can exchange information this way. You can also get messages from Director Lazard and company news via mail. Check it regularly. And who knows--maybe you'll get mail from friends you make along the way."
"Kunsel: But don't just read mail that you get from girls! Well, I guess that's everything. Looks like it's time for you to head out. You're going with Angeal, right? Good luck on the assignment!"
Zack: Yeah! Thanks for all the information!
"Kunsel: Now Zack, don't get greedy. There's a limit to how much free stuff you can get. The company isn't stupid, you know."
"Kunsel: Fine, fine, if you want items so badly, I'll give you what I got in my pod today."
Angeal: We have to leave for Wutai soon. Are you ready?
"Zack: Um, preparations...?"
Lazard: I'll be joining you as well. I'm counting on you.
Zack: Sir!
"Lazard: By the way, what is your dream? ""To become 1st""...is it?"
Zack: No... To become a hero!
"Lazard: Ah, good! Unattainable dreams are the best kind."
"Zack: Uh, thanks?"
"Angeal: Fort Tamblin is straight ahead. Let's hurry, B Unit is standing by."
Wutai Private: You two! Identify yourselves!
Zack: Just leave it to me!
"Zack: All right, next!"
"Angeal: Calm down, Zack."
Angeal: Zack... Do you know about dumbapples?
"Zack: No, what is that?"
Angeal: Unbelievable... How can you not know about dumbapples? You'll never make 1st at that rate.
"Zack: Whoa, wait! What are dumbapples!?"
"Zack: So Angeal, what's the deal with ""dumbapples""?"
"Angeal: The official name is Banora White. The trees bear fruit at random times during the year. Because of that, the townspeople affectionately call them dumbapples. The local farms had plenty of them to spare."
"Zack: Oh, really? So you stole them."
"Angeal: We were poor, Zack."
Zack: Nice excuse!
"Angeal: But even then, I had my honor. The largest Banora White tree grew on a wealthy man's estate. It was rumored that those apples tasted the best. But I never stole from that tree, because the wealthy man's son was my friend."
"Zack: If he was a friend, you should have just asked for some!"
Angeal: Honor can be quite a burden at times.
Zack: ...And what exactly does this have to do with me?
Angeal: No story is not worth hearing.
"Zack: What? That's it? Yeah, well, thanks a lot!"
Angeal: B Unit will set off an explosion. That's our cue.
Zack: The diversion will allow us to infiltrate.
"Angeal: Right. I'll set the bomb inside the fortress. You'll charge the front gate, and..."
"Zack: Uh-huh, and? And? And? And?"
Angeal: Indulge yourself.
"Zack: You got it! That's what I do best! Come on, B Unit..."
"Zack: You know, I've never actually seen you use that. Don't you think it's sort of a waste?"
Angeal: Use brings about wear...tear...and rust. And that's a real waste.
"Zack: You're serious, aren't you?"
Angeal: Yeah. I can be pretty cheap.
"Zack: Yeah, no kidding..."
Angeal: Begin mission.
Wutai Sergeant: No one passes beyond this point! The enemy is but one man! Obliterate him!
Zack: All right! Piece of cake!
Wutai Private: Enemy attack! It's SOLDIER! Don't let him get through!
Angeal (on the phone): Were you able to get inside the fortress?
Zack: Piece of cake! I could have done it blindfolded!
Angeal (on the phone): Don't get too careless. I've heard that the Wutai keep a large monster for anti-SOLDIER purposes. It should be somewhere inside Fort Tamblin.
"Zack: If I take it out, do you think I'll make 1st?"
"Angeal: It depends on the quality of work. Your main duty is to draw the Wutai troops to you by running amok. Do that well, and the director will give you a favorable evaluation."
"Zack: Oh, that'll be easy! Just leave it to me!"
Wutai Sergeant (1): To think one SOLDIER operative did this much damage to us... It seems I can no longer just sit back and watch.
Wutai Sergeant (1): Ha!
Wutai Sergeant (1): Halt!
Wutai Sergeant (2): You'll pay for what you did to my men! I'll make sure you never leave this place alive!
Wutai Sergeant (3): He's no match for three Wutai sergeants! Let's take him out!
All 3 Wutai Sergeants (in unison): We'll show you the true power of Wutai!
Lazard: We have new intel. Enemy troops have also been detected at the two towers within the fortress.
"Zack: Well, that makes sense. I just took out one of those towers."
"Lazard: You'll have to look for the other tower. Otherwise, the enemy can easily track your position."
Wutai Private: There he is!
Wutai Private: Open fire!
Wutai Sergeant (to Wutai Privates): This way! Follow me!
"Wutai Sergeant: Attack if you dare, SOLDIER scum! You will fall by our hands! Huh? Where did he go? Sneaky little pest!"
Wutai Sergeant: Ngh! What treachery!
Lazard (on the phone): This is Lazard. Enemy troops appear to be lurking in every corner. The fortress will not go down easily.
Zack: It appears that way. I was just assaulted while I was checking a revolving wall.
Lazard (on the phone): There may be similar traps set up at the other walls. Proceed with caution.
Wutai Private: There he is!
Wutai Sergeant (1): SOLDIER operative sighted! He's under the tower!
"Wutai Sergeant (2): So that's where you are! 38th Tamblin Unit, charge!"
"Wutai Sergeant: We have to make our stand here! Ready! Aim! Fire! End of the line, SOLDIER! Reinforcements are coming! You can't escape!"
Zack: What to do...
Wutai Private: Sergeant! He's coming this way!
Wutai Sergeant: Do not falter! Charge him!
Wutai Sergeant: Tch! Damn you!
Wutai Sergeant: Long live the Wutai...
Zack: Hm? I hear voices...
"Wutai Sergeant: In the name of Wutai, we must halt the enemy advance here."
Wutai Private: Sir!
"Wutai Sergeant: Fort Tamblin will not fall to a paltry force like SOLDIER. The enemy could be lurking anywhere. Keep your eyes open. SOLDIER is a formidable foe. But to protect our homeland, we must stand against our enemies, no matter how powerful they may be. Even if it means our lives. Retreat is not in the Wutai dictionary! Huh!?"
Wutai Sergeant: Retreat! Retreating is a part of military strategy!
"Lazard (on the phone): It appears, you're doing well, Zack. The enemy forces in Fort Tamblin have essentially been reduced to half. There are still some enemy units roaming about, but you can proceed to the central area if you like."
Zack: What should I do?
Lazard: Understood. Search for the remaining enemy units and eliminate them quickly.
"Lazard: Understood. Proceed further into the fortress. But be careful--the enemy is hurt, but not down."
"Lazard (on the phone): Well done, Zack. We have successfully occupied Fort Tamblin. I was really only expecting you to get their attention. Most impressive I must say. I'm very pleased with the results thus far. Proceed to the next objective."
Zack: Ah! That must be the central area!
Zack: What's this?
"Crescent Unit Captain: That is Wutai's greatest deity, Leviathan. We are the Crescent, the Wutai army's elite unit. We appease the wrath of Leviathan, and smite the enemies of Wutai. Our beloved homeland has been brutally ravaged by Shinra."
"Zack: I heard that if we could process the mako here, it would help people live better lives. But then you attacked us without even hearing us out!"
Crescent Unit Captain: What do you know of the pain we have suffered? Shinra has continually brought fear and oppression to the innocent people of Wutai!
Zack: ...
Crescent Unit Captain: I would like to ask you one last thing. Are you satisfied in using your immense power to serve an evil organization like Shinra? Does it bring you joy to torture innocent people?
Zack: That's not what I...
"Crescent Unit Captain: If there is any remorse in your heart, then atone for your actions by joining our cause!"
Zack: ...
"Crescent Unit Captain: Of course, we cannot pay you much, but you can use your power in the name of justice!"
"Zack: Justice...? Is that really the case? Is it so terrible to provide mako to people and make their lives better? I don't know... But I chose to serve Shinra. Whatever happens, I have to stand by that decision."
"Crescent Unit Captain: I was foolish to think I could reason with villains. For those of us born and raised in Wutai, losing our land is the same as losing our lives. Hence, I must eliminate you, as my last duty to the land. You will now witness the wrath of Wutai!"
Crescent Unit Captain: Why do you not finish me?
"Zack: I don't know. Not in the mood, I guess."
"Crescent Unit Captain: As long as we breathe, we will continue to target Shinra. I promise...one day, I will have your head."
"Zack: Fine, I'll be waiting."
"???: One, avoid unnecessary training! Two, protect Wutai at all costs! Three, ugly Shinra SOLDIER dudes... ...must be PUNISHED!"
Zack: Who are you?
"Yuffie: I'm Wutai's greatest warrior! If you wanna go further, you have to go through me!"
"Zack: A kid...? You shouldn't be playing here, it's dangerous! Go home to your parents."
"Yuffie: You're the one who's going home! If you insist on going any further, you'll have a fight on your hands!"
"Zack: Oh, man... What am I supposed to do here?"
"Yuffie: Whap! Pow! Bam! Take that, bad guy!"
Zack: ... Arrrgh! Nooo! You got me!
"Yuffie: There! That'll teach you to mess with me! Once again, I've brought peace to Wutai!"
"Zack: Boy oh boy... You gotta admire that energy... Well, back to work, I guess..."
Zack: You must be the anti-SOLDIER monsters I've been hearing about.
"Zack: SOLDIER 2nd Class Zack, victorious once again!"
"Angeal (on the phone): Good work. Now, get out of there quickly. There's only 5 minutes until detonation."
Zack: Understood!
"Zack: Director Lazard, are you watching? Gotta move!"
Zack: No time to play!
Zack: Not good...
Angeal: That's one more you owe me. You lost your focus.
"Zack: Uh, yeah? Oh, sorry if your sword got any wear, tear, or rust on it."
Angeal: You're a little more important than my sword. ...But just a little.
Zack: Thanks!
Lazard: Sorry to keep you waiting. I'm not used to being on site.
Angeal: You didn't have to come.
Lazard: This operation will bring an end to the war. I have to see it through personally. SOLDIER 2nd Class Zack.
Zack: Sir!
"Lazard: You performed your duties admirably at Fort Tamblin. I saw it with my own eyes. Frankly, my evaluation of you is..."
"Lazard: ... Thank goodness for you, Angeal! Were it not for your efforts, the operation would have failed. Ahh yes, how very fortunate that you were here!"
Lazard: You supported Angeal well by diverting the enemy. An acceptable level of work for a 2nd. Be ready for your next assignment.
"Angeal: Zack, do you know the difference between a 1st and a 2nd?"
Angeal: A SOLDIER 1st Class performs above and beyond the call of duty at all times. Remember that.
"Lazard: You took out a lot of enemy units for us. You exceeded my expectations. Keep up the good work, and perhaps the day you make 1st will not be far off. You were right, Angeal. He is quite a promising prospect."
Angeal: Heh... This is just the beginning.
"Lazard: I can say this now, but when you first came to me with the recommendation, I was hesitant. I thought for sure that all he was good for was doing squats."
Lazard: You are a frightening individual. Not any man could annihilate an entire enemy force by himself.
Angeal: I was taken aback myself. You really have grown into a fine warrior.
Zack: Your bravery during the Wutai war will be remembered for generations to come. It seems your dream of becoming a hero has already come true.
"Angeal: Let's not get carried away, Director. Zack still has a lot to accomplish."
"Lazard: Ha ha, I suppose you're right. Zack, I hope you'll continue to excel."
"Angeal: Now, let's hurry. Sephiroth is waiting."
Zack: Sephiroth!? The SOLDIER hero? Wow! I get to meet a hero!
Angeal: Zack! Come on!
Angeal: Take the director to a safe place.
Lazard: Then contact Sephiroth.
"Angeal: Zack is more than enough. Now, go."
"Zack: Follow me, Director."
"Infantryman: Thank goodness you're safe, Director Lazard."
"Lazard: I should be fine now, Zack. Go and assist Angeal!"
"Zack: I know, I know!"
"Zack: Okay, let's go!"
Zack: Angeal? Angeal! What? These guys aren't Wutai troops...
Zack: A summon? Who called it out?
Zack: Holy...
Sephiroth: Genesis...
Zack: The missing SOLDIER 1st Class?
Zack: They're identical!
Sephiroth: A Genesis copy...
Zack: Copy? A human copy?
Sephiroth: Where is Angeal?
Zack: I thought he was fighting around here...
"Sephiroth: Humph, so he's gone, too."
"Zack: What? Wait, what does that mean?"
Sephiroth: It means Angeal has betrayed us as well.
Zack: No way! I know what kind of guy Angeal is. And he'd never do that!
Zack: Angeal wouldn't betray us! Never!
"???: Man, what is with Angeal? How long is he gonna slack off like this? It's been a month now! Sephiroth's got it all wrong, too! Lumping Angeal together with Genesis! Genesis is a deserter who took a bunch of 2nds and 3rds with him! He used his copies to attack us! Angeal would never condone something like that! He valued his SOLDIER honor more than anyone else! Ugh! Everything's so messed up these days! Angeal! Just come back, please!"
???(on the phone): SOLDIER 2nd Class Zack?
Zack: That would be me. Who is this?
???(on the phone): Director Lazard wants to see you. Go to the briefing room.
Zack: Hey! Wait! Who was that?
Zack: Any word on Angeal?
Lazard: He hasn't contacted his family either.
"Zack: So, what's this about?"
"Lazard: A new assignment. I want you to go to the hometown of our missing SOLDIER 1st Class, Genesis."
Zack: Huh?
"Lazard: According to the parents, they've had no contact with Genesis whatsoever. But, they can't be trusted."
Zack: Why?
"Lazard: They're his family. I had already dispatched some staff, but we've lost contact. I want you to go and investigate. He will go with you."
"Tseng: Tseng, of the Turks."
Zack: This job is looking really gloomy...
Tseng: Let me know when you're ready to go.
"Zack: Oh, excuse me... Hello?"
"Kunsel (on the phone): Yeah, this is Kunsel. Did you ready my mail?"
Zack: Not yet. I'll read it later. I'm kinda in a meeting right now--
"Kunsel (on the phone): Ah, gotcha. Hey, can I talk to you after that, though?"
"Zack: Well... If you keep it short, I guess. Haven't got much time."
"Kunsel (on the phone): Yeah yeah, it'll be short. I'll be right outside the briefing room."
"SOLDIER 2nd Class: Before you go out on a mission, you should always check the supply pod. We don't get notified when it's been restocked. (Rumor has it that it's to cut costs.)"
"Kunsel: Hey, Zack. What do you say we go down to Sector 8? You can go to Sector 8 through the first floor entrance as well. Let's head over. You should always go do as much as you can before an assignment, so you have no regrets."
"Kunsel: Well, here we are in Sector 8. I guess we should split up here."
"Zack: What? You bring me out here, and now you're leaving me?"
"Kunsel: You do have an assignment waiting, don't you? Wouldn't it be quicker to go around just by yourself? The Shinra Building is straight ahead that way when you're ready to go back. So, I'll see ya, Zack. I'll send you another mail when I find the time."
"Man: This is Sector 8. Lots of entertainment around here. You're in the fountain plaza. Beyond the clock tower is LOVELESS Avenue. You can climb up the stairs to go to the Sector 1 station. From the station, you can get on the train to go to the Sector 5 slums."
"Infantryman: Lately, we're seeing more and more reporters sniffing around for a scoop on Shinra. I was chasing after one who had snuck into the building, but I seem to have lost sight of him. We can't allow confidential company information to leak out. I'll catch him no matter what it takes!"
"Angeal Fan: Pardon me, but are you a SOLDIER operative?"
Zack: I sure am. Zack's the name. Nice to meet you!
Sephiroth Fan: Zack? Never heard of you. You must be a SOLDIER second-rate.
Angeal Fan: We were just talking about who the greatest SOLDIER operative might be. I think it's Angeal. That air of solemnity about him... And he's thrifty to boot! He's absolutely charming.
"Sephiroth Fan: If we're talking about the greatest in SOLDIER, I can't think of anyone greater than Sephiroth. Just imagining him stripped to the waist makes me dizzy."
Genesis Fan: Both of you! What are you talking about? It's got to be Genesis! There's no one greater in SOLDIER!
Zack: I never knew SOLDIER 1st Classes had so many female fans...
"Genesis Fan: What makes Genesis's fan club so special is that we're well-funded compared to other fan clubs. We have a huge sponsor behind us. And we sell lots of merchandise, too. So what do you think? Would you like to become a member of Red Leather?"
"Zack: Genesis's fan club, huh?"
Genesis Fan: New members are automatically entered into a chance to win a replica of Genesis's rapier. I think you just got your first mail from the club.
"Genesis Fan: We're now in an era where one's sense of style is becoming ever more important--even for SOLDIER. That's why Genesis, with his red leather coat and impeccable style, is leading Shinra into the future! As fans of Genesis, we should always strive to make our activities classy, streamlined, and stylish!"
"Angeal Fan: Say, how would you like to join Keepers of Honor, Angeal's fan club? If you join now, you'll get our recent newsletters that include bits of Angeal's official profile!"
"Zack: Angeal's fan club, eh?"
Angeal Fan: Congratulations! Welcome to the Keepers of Honor. And there you go. You just got your first newsletter.
"Angeal Fan: We'll be focusing more on our activities. We don't want to lose to the Genesis or Sephiroth fans. Our activities shall be steadfast and honorable, just like Angeal himself!"
"Sephiroth Fan: The most popular figure in SOLDIER is the hero, Sephiroth. Which explains why he has so many fan clubs, from big to small, from the casual to the devoted. The key is to look for the one that suits you."
"Son: Angeal, Shmangeal! Mom's become a full-fledged groupie. She won't do anything around the house! ...C'mon, Mom. Grow up."
Woman: I'm sorry. I'm not interested in a SOLDIER guy.
"Man: Judging from your looks...you're a SOLDIER guy from Shinra, aren't you? I hate Shinra with all my heart. Don't talk to me like you know me."
"Zack: Ahh, thanks for patrolling Midgar, my man."
Captain: I don't recognize you from SOLDIER. What business do you have here?
"Zack: Huh? Well, no business, actually..."
Captain: It is the duty of the 18th Squad in Shinra's Security Department to patrol the streets of Sector 8. Anyone who disturbs the peace will not be forgiven--not even SOLDIER.
"Zack: Whoa, whoa, take it easy there."
Captain: This is the perfect opportunity for me to tell you something. Midgar does not need SOLDIER.
Zack: What?
"Captain: Whose job is it to take lost children to their mothers? Whose job is it to catch the petty crooks who steal small change from vending machines? Whose job is it to scold the young girls who talk too loud on the trains? They are all ours. In other words, Midgar needs nobody but us--Shinra's Security Department."
"Zack: And I can see that you're, uh, doing fine work."
Captain: Hmph. That's as cocky as you're going to be. We'll be holding a joint training session soon. Security versus SOLDIER. We'll see who the true combat elites are.
Captain: Hmph. The days of SOLDIER and the Turks getting all the attention are over. Our joint training will let you see the true powers we possess in the Security Department.
"Man: This is LOVELESS Avenue, the busiest part of Sector 8. LOVELESS is a literary masterpiece. They've even made it into a play."
"Employee: Oh, hello, Mister SOLDIER. Sorry, but I'm not interested. I already have someone in my heart."
"Genesis Fan: LOVELESS... A tale of doomed love and friendship... It's a fascinating tale that's even been made into a successful stage production every year. I'm a member of the Study Group, one of the Genesis fan clubs. We study LOVELESS in order to gain deeper insight into the work that Genesis loves so much. Our members used to be in Red Leather, the other Genesis fan club. But we grew tired of how shallow they were, so we decided to spin off and form the Study Group. Would you like to join the Study Group and learn how truly wonderful LOVELESS is?"
Zack: The LOVELESS Study Group?
Genesis Fan: Congratulations! You have now been accepted as a fellow worshipper of LOVELESS. Oh! I think you just got a mail. Why don't you take a look at it?
"Genesis Fan: LOVELESS has five acts, but the final act has been lost and nobody knows its contents. Acts 2 and 3, though, have practically become classics. They've made it onto the stage, after all. In certain circles, our dear Genesis is famous as a devotee to LOVELESS."
"Man: This little puppy can hit 140MPH, y'know. The engine's great, of course, but the secret's in the tires."
Man: S-S-SOLDIER!? N-n-nothing. It's nothing! I-I-I'm a civi-civi-civilian! And I'm very busy! Don't talk to me!
Girl: I came here to watch the Shinra trains with my brother. I hope it comes soon! Hee-hee!
"Boy: Shinra's new locomotive is pulling in soon! It's called the MK93 II. Oooh, I can't wait to see it! He-hee!"
Employeee: I've been waiting for the train to come for a long time now. The delays have become frequent of late.
"Employee: You can use the train to go to the slums market in Sector 5. Once the train comes, that is. Hmmm, I hope it comes soon..."
"Employee: We currently have a special on potions. There is a fee for the general public, but they are free to SOLDIER members and Shinra troops. Would you like to try a bottle, sir?"
"Zack: A potion, eh?"
Man: I was worried when my son wandered off and got lost inside the building. Thank goodness the young lady at the Information Center was able to help me. You can count on the Shinra Company to offer service with a smile!
Man: I brought my boy here for a tour inside. It's important to provide children with opportunities to see the world. And I'm glad to see that he's enjoying himself.
Boy: Wow! The Shinra Building! It's my first time here.
Boy: I can't believe how huge it is! Do you ever get lost in this place?
"Receptionist: Oh, hello. Let me know if you need anything. (Hey, he's pretty cute...)"
"Receptionist: So you're a SOLDIER operative, huh? It must be exciting, going on all those missions. (Oh my. He can't stop coming up to me to chat.) (Oh, well. I can't help it if I'm such a stud magnet.)"
"Receptionist: Good day, sir. Welcome to the Shinra Building Information Center. Please come see me anytime you have questions concerning the Shinra Building."
"Zack: Hmmm, what do I need to know?"
"Receptionist: Zack Fair, SOLDIER. One moment, please. ... You have a meeting scheduled with Mr. Tseng in the Briefing Room."
"Receptionist: The Shinra Building is a secure area. Access to all areas is controlled by employee ID. Members of SOLDIER have access to the elevator, the Exhibit Room, and the SOLDIER floor. Please be aware that the Exhibit Room and this entrance area are open to the public."
"Receptionist: Exiting the building takes you to Sector 8. You may find it refreshing to venture out to Sector 8 while on standby. Also, there is a train station in Sector 1, where you may board the train to go to the slums in Sector 5."
"Infantryman: Sir! I am a newly recruited infantryman, sir! I am committed to giving everything I have for the Shinra Company, sir!"
"Infantryman: You can go to Sector 8 by exiting the building, sir! It is our duty to maintain the peace, not only in the Shinra Building, but throughout the city of Midgar, sir!"
"Employee: Blast it. I'm on the wrong floor again. Could the Shinra Company have possibly built a more convoluted building? I mean, how could a building as giant as this only have two elevators? It's ridiculous."
Sign: Shinra #26 Rocket
"Employee: This is a conceptual model of the Shinra No. 26 rocket. Shinra has concentrated all its science into the Space Development Department for this project. Once it's completed, all that would be left is to launch it into outer space."
Sign: Shinra Model sA-37
Sign: Airship Highwind
Man: I came as soon as I heard the Exhibit Room was open to the public. Being in this room gives you a sense of the Shinra Company's achievements.
Sign: Hardy-Daytona
Man: What can I do to make her realize my feelings for... Ah!? I-I-I didn't say anything!
"Man: Her dark, lovely eyes... Her soft, shiny hair... Oh, gods. Just give me the strength to talk to her..."
Sign: Shinra Model pA-86
Employee: The Exhibit Room is open to the public. You are asked to refrain any conduct that would inconvenience our visitors.
Employee: That gentleman over there has been staring in my direction for a while now. Do you think he's...all right? This is starting to get creepy.
"Kunsel: Hey, Zack. Finally made it back, did you? Weren't you in the middle of an assignment? You should get going. The Turks guy is waiting for you in the briefing room."
"Zack: Oh yeah, the assignment!"
"Kunsel: Are you kidding me...? The briefing room... Is right there, you can see it from here. Are you feeling all right? Just hurry up and go, Zack. Good luck on the assignment. I'll send you a mail again when I have the time."
Kunsel: Good luck on the assignment. I'll send you a mail again when I have the time.
"SOLDIER 3rd Class: First Genesis, and now even Angeal's gone... A lot's gone down in SOLDIER of late."
"SOLDIER 3rd Class: But don't let those things get to you, Zack. I'm sure Angeal will come back to us soon."
"SOLDIER 2nd Class: If you take that elevator, you can go down to the entrance nd the Exhibit Room. One of the girls at the Information Center is pretty cute, you know."
SOLDIER 2nd Class: You can also take the elevator up to the SOLDIER director's office. It's more like Director Lazard's personal office. You can't go up there unless you've got real business.
"SOLDIER 3rd Class: Have you noticed all the rooms on this floor? We have the Briefing Room, the Materia Room, and the Training Room. All these facilities provided by Shinra, just for us. It's good to be in SOLDIER!"
SOLDIER 3rd Class: The Materia Room is for conducting research and development on materia. Have you been there yet?
"SOLDIER 2nd Class: Hey, Zack. I hear you were quite the hero in the Wutai operation. They say you must have taken out a thousand Wutai soldiers in Fort Tamblin. But I'm next in line to become 1st Class! Don't you forget it."
"SOLDIER 2nd Class: With Genesis and Angeal missing, there's a spot for a 1st to be filled. Looks like my time has come. But keep quiet about it. It's not the type of thing to spread around."
"Researcher (1): Materia is the concentrated essence of mako energy. But natural materia is practically nonexistent. That's because special conditions must be met, in addition to the long years it takes to form. Most of the materia out there was generated by either us or the Arms Development Department."
"Researcher (2): Naturally-formed materia are extremely rare, but ""mako stones"" are relatively easy to obtain. A mako stone is crystallized materia made of concentrated mako energy. By itself, it doesn't have the same effect as materia, but we can process it into materia. SOLDIER members occasionally go out excavating for them. Maybe you should, too."
"Researcher (2): SOLDIER members occasionally go out excavating for them. Maybe you should, too. If you bring your mako stone in, we can make it into materia for you."
"Researcher (2): Wait! What do you have there? Is that a sample of XXX Mako Stone!? If you'd hand that over to us, we can generate materia out of it!"
"Researcher (2): If you'd like, you're welcome to stay and watch us generate materia."
Researcher (2): Commencing materia generation! All hands! Confirm status!
"Researcher (3): Ready, sir!"
Researcher (1): Main engine on standby! Ready when you are!
"Researcher (2): Main engine, start! Report mako energy concentration rate!"
"Researcher (3): Concentration rate at 20...30...40... Steady at 50%, sir!"
Researcher (2): Increase main engine output! The first 30 seconds into concentration is crucial!
"Researcher (1): Aye-aye, sir! Output, 80% and rising!"
"Researcher (3): Concentration rate isn't budging, sir!"
Researcher (2): Grrr! Ready cooling system! Increase mako energy output to maximum!
Researcher (1): Output at 120%! 1 minute left till we reach the critical point!
Researcher (3): Mako energy concentration rate is rising! 70...80...90% and still going up!
"Researcher (2): All right! Hang on, we're almost there!"
"Researcher (3): Concentration rate, 100%!"
Researcher (2): Stop main engine!
"Researcher (1): Main engine stop confirmed! Gentlemen, we have our materia!!!"
"Researcher (2): Here's the materia. And none too shabby! It was made from your mako stone, so this materia is yours. It's actually been a while since we made any materia here in the Materia Room. We have our share of problems, too."
"Researcher (2): What? You don't get why we were so on edge during the generation process? Well, we have to get psyched up! Materia generation does take quite a bit of mental concentration."
"Researcher (2): Thanks to you, we had the opportunity to make a new materia. Your name was... Zack, right? We'll remember you."
"Researcher (2): Zack, we hope to see you again."
"Researcher (2): You're Zack, right? I remember you. You're someone we've come to depend on. But we have to let you know that we may never be able to work again..."
Researcher (2): Discussions are taking place about closing down our Materia Room. The sad truth is that our materia quality hasn't been very good. *sigh* What am I going to do when I'm let go? Who would hire someone like me?
"Researcher (3): I used to be in the Science Department. I was transferred here around the time Director Lazard came to head SOLDIER. Actually, I guess you could say that I was headhunted from the Science Department."
"Researcher: Taking physical fitness tests is an important duty for a SOLDIER operative. Since all SOLDIER members are infused with mako, we need to manage their health with extreme care."
"Researcher: Professor Hojo of the Science Department drops by this room now and then. After all, he's the one who operates on guys like you to become SOLDIER members. To be honest, though...I wish he wouldn't come."
"Researcher: This is the Training Room, where we gauge the physical fitness of SOLDIER members. You're Zack, SOLDIER 2nd Class, right? Yes, we'll be testing your physical fitness someday. I hope to see you then."
Tseng: Ready to go on the assignment?
Tseng: Hurry up.
"Tseng: Very good, then."
Tseng: Ready to go?
"Zack: A routine job, right? No sweat!"
"Tseng: I wonder... Originally, Sephiroth was assigned to this mission. That means it's a top-priority matter. Be alert, or you'll fail."
Zack: And Sephiroth?
"Tseng: Refusing to go, apparently."
"Zack: Oh, what is that? They spoil him too much!"
Tseng: Why don't you say that to his face?
"Zack: Uh, no thanks!"
Zack: Weird-looking trees.
Tseng: These are Banora White trees. AKA dumbapples.
"Zack: Wait, that means we're in Banora? Angeal's hometown?"
Tseng: That is correct. Genesis and Angeal have known each other for a long time.
"Zack: These guys! I saw them in Wutai, too!"
"Tseng: So they are here. We haven't seen any of the townspeople. They may have taken control of the entire town. When Genesis deserted, he took a large arsenal of weapons with him. The president's orders are to retrieve or destroy these weapons immediately upon discovery."
Zack: Leave it to me.
Zack: The president won't be disappointed!
Zack: A Genesis copy...
Tseng: Where did you hear that?
Zack: Sephiroth said it.
Tseng: The technology was stolen from our scientists. It apparently allows Genesis's abilities and traits to be transplanted...to SOLDIER members...and monsters.
Zack: SOLDIER and monsters...we're the same?
"Zack: It's not gonna start moving again, is it?"
"Tseng: Zack, stop playing around. We have to hurry."
"Zack: ""Smooth and refreshing! Banora White Juice - 120 gil,"" eh? That sounds pretty tasty... Hm? ""The apple factory is just through the housing community up ahead."""
Tseng: Internal issues like these must be dealt with before the public finds out. Still no sign of townspeople. Let's check the houses.
Tseng: This is Genesis's home. His parents are wealthy landowners.
"Angeal (voice flashback): But I never stole from that tree, because the wealthy man's son was my friend."
"Tseng: They weren't mere acquaintances. They grew up together, and were best friends."
Zack: So Genesis deserts and gets his best friend Angeal to join him... Is that it?
"Tseng: Sephiroth believes that's the case. There. A gravestone. Still very new. Zack, go find Angeal's house. I'll check the grave."
"Zack: Ugh, so Turks always do this stuff?"
Tseng: Someone has to do it.
Zack: Must be rough...
Tseng: Don't worry. We're paid much better than you are.
Zack: No way!
"Tseng: Zack, go and check Angeal's house. It should be in the group of houses over there. Be careful, the area may already be under the enemy's control."
Tseng: I'll check the grave. You go and check Angeal's house. Or do you need to hear the explanation again?
Tseng: Angeal's house is most likely in the residential area over there.
"Zack: Let's see, Angeal's house is... I have no idea! I'll just have to check each house..."
Zack: I see something! Maybe now's not the best time. I'll check it out later.
Zack: Hello! Is anyone home?
"Zack: Hello! Is anyone home? Door's locked, and it doesn't look like anyone's inside."
"Zack: This looks awfully suspicious, but it might take a while to investigate. I should go to Angeal's house first."
???: Can I help you?
"Zack: Uh, greetings, ma'am! Are you Angeal's mother? My name is Zack."
"???: Are you Zack, the puppy?"
Zack: Excuse me?
"Angeal's Mother: My son wrote to me once about you. Zero attention span, restless as a little puppy."
"Zack: Thanks, Angeal..."
"Angeal's Mother: You're not...here together with Genesis, are you?"
"Zack: No, I'm not. Don't worry."
Angeal's Mother: What is happening with my son?
Zack: I'm not really sure.
"Angeal's Mother: Genesis came back here, a month ago, with an army of cohorts. And they proceeded to take the lives of many townspeople. Genesis...he used to be such a good boy..."
Zack: Is Angeal...?
"Angeal's Mother: He came here. But, he left his sword and went off somewhere. That sword represents our family's honor."
"Zack: I see...no wonder... He never uses this sword, really ever. I'll take care of Angeal. You should go and hide somewhere."
Angeal's Mother: Don't be concerned. Genesis...cannot harm me.
Angeal's Mother: Please be a good friend to my son...
"Zack: Oh, a picture of Angeal! Wow, he's young! Must have been taken when he first joined SOLDIER. And there's that Buster Sword... Here's a family picture. Look at Angeal, showing off that Buster Sword again. This must be Angeal's father. He looks as serious as I imagined him. Baby picture! This is Angeal!? Aww, how adorable... Now, these two little runts must be Angeal and...Genesis..."
"Zack: Baby Angeal, Angeal and Genesis as kids, family picture, and Angeal's proudest day... He's always holding that Buster Sword with such pride and care. Looking at these pictures, I'm starting to understand how he became the man that he is. He and Genesis have been friends for most of their lives. That's a pretty long time, longer than..."
"Angeal's Mother: When Angeal joined Shinra... My husband had that sword made for him, in the hopes that he would become an honorable warrior. We had to borrow a lot of money to have it made, and then... While fervently trying to return all the money, my husband succumbed to fatigue."
Zack: Angeal... Where did you go? What!? Genesis copies!
Tseng: There's a factory on the outskirts of town. I saw a Genesis copy go inside.
Zack: You think that's their headquarters?
Tseng: Most likely. I'm currently on a cliff overlooking the factory. A frontal attack is inadvisable. We'll go in from above. Come to the clifftop immediately.
"Tseng: I said to come to the clifftop. Weren't you listening? A frontal assault is too dangerous. Remember, this is a reconnaissance mission."
Tseng: Genesis's parents were in that grave.
"Zack: Wait, he...his own family?"
Tseng: We can't expect reason from him. What about Angeal?
"Zack: He wasn't at the house. But please, give me time! If I find Angeal, I can talk to him. If I can convince Angeal, maybe Genesis will come back, too."
Tseng: I understand now why Sephiroth chose you.
Zack: Huh?
Tseng: Genesis and Angeal. Those two were Sephiroth's only friends. He didn't want to fight them. That's why he refused the mission.
"Zack: Well, Angeal is my friend, too!"
Tseng: He's counting on you to bring them both back. Time is short. Let's go.
Zack: Infiltration successful!
Zack (to Tseng): Go on ahead. I'll take care of things here.
"Tseng: Zack, this way. Keep an eye out for enemies."
"Tseng: Zack, this way."
Tseng: Looks like the copies are being made here. Check the second floor. Genesis may be there.
Genesis: Settle down... Zack the Puppy.
Tseng: The grave at the house... We found the remains of our people there as well.
Genesis: It didn't take much to have them send false reports. Just some mild threats...
Zack: They would have done that anyway. At least your parents would have.
"Genesis: My ""parents"" betrayed me. They had always betrayed me, from the very beginning. What do you know? Shinra lapdogs!"
"Genesis: Welcome, partner. I see...you've finally made your decision. I'll respect your wishes, old friend. However... Can you really live on that side?"
Zack: Angeal!
Zack: Damn! Where did he go? Did he leave the factory?
Tseng: There's no time. We have to leave now.
Zack: We're not gonna go look for those two?
Tseng: All evidence of misconduct must be erased. Company rules. An airstrike will neutralize this town.
Tseng: Are you sure that nobody is at Angeal's house?
Zack: ...
Tseng: Hurry!
Tseng (on the phone): Genesis and his men have begun bombarding the town.
Zack: Are you serious!? What do we do now?
Tseng (on the phone): Press
Zack: What!?
Tseng (on the phone): Your timing can't be too fast or too slow. You have to focus. Can you do it?
Zack: I have to do it!
"Tseng (on the phone): Pay attention to the sound of the fuse, and the color of the shells."
Zack: The sound of the fuse?
"Tseng (on the phone): It sounds like this. Keep your ears open. Attack with the sound's timing, but keep the shell's color in mind, too. I'm counting on you."
Zack: The fuse sound and the shell's color... I have to get to her before the airstrike!
Tseng (on the phone): The attacks have stopped.
Tseng (on the phone): Looks like you fended off some of the attacks...
Tseng (on the phone): Looks like you fended off a good number of attacks.
Tseng (on the phone): Looks like you fended off most of the attacks.
Tseng (on the phone): I just received word that the airstrike is about to commence. You have to hurry.
Zack: I hope Angeal's mom is all right... I have to hurry!
Zack: I'll check out what I got later.
Tseng (on the phone): I explained our situation and had them briefly delay the airstrike... That will buy you some time.
"Zack: Thanks, Tseng!"
Tseng: Those cannon shells were Shinra-made as well. You'll be rewarded for destroying evidence of the company's involvement in this matter.
Zack: I have to get to Angeal's house...
"Zack: What the hell did you do, Angeal!? Is that...is that your idea of honor!?"
Angeal: My mother...could not continue to live. And neither can the son.
Zack: What are you talking about! What's going on here?
Genesis: I told you. You can't live on that side anymore.
Zack: Angeal! Angeal!
Zack: Shut up!
Genesis:All that awaits you is a somber morrow
"Zack: Shut up, I'm warning you!"
"Genesis:No matter, where the winds may blow"
"Genesis: I don't see Sephiroth today, but...are you game?"
"Zack: A summon!? So that's how it is, huh!"
Zack: Summons aren't meant to be used like this! What happened to dreams and honors?
Genesis: We are...monsters.
Genesis: We have neither dreams nor honor.
Genesis: SOLDIER...doesn't mean monster.
Zack: Angeal...
"Zack: Angeal, the war is over. Everyone's real happy. As for me..."
Angeal's Mother (flashback): That sword represents our family's honor.
Angeal (flashback): You're a little more important than my sword. ...But just a little.
Zack: Where did you go...?
Zack: Zack here.
"Sephiroth (on the phone): It's been a while, Zack."
Zack: Sephiroth?
Sephiroth (on the phone): Come to Lazard's room.
Zack: Alright.
"SOLDIER 2nd Class: There's a large anti-Shinra organization wreaking havoc all over the world. They're called ""AVALANCHE."" I heard they're avid students of planet life."
"SOLDIER 2nd Class: Apparently, the Turks have been called in to bring AVALANCHE under control. What a bummer. If I had gotten that job, it would have made me 1st in no time."
"SOLDIER 2nd Class: I heard that Angeal's mother used to work for Shinra. For the Science Department, I believe. From all accounts, she was quite the hottie."
"SOLDIER 2nd Class: Wait, wait. Don't get me wrong! I'm not going for Angeal's mom, no matter how hot she is! I'm not into the ""mature"" thing, if you know what I mean."
SOLDIER 3rd Class: I remember Angeal would always talk proudly about growing up poor. And Genesis would always read me a quote from LOVELESS. ...I wish they would come back soon. I miss them.
"SOLDIER 3rd Class: Officially, Angeal and Genesis have been killed in action. I guess I can understand that. I know SOLDIER can't publicly announce desertions, but a cover-up still doesn't feel right."
SOLDIER 3rd Class: You know Angeal and Genesis are both from the village of Banora? I found out something else by accident while looking at SOLDIER's investment report... Did you know that Banora's budget was being paid for by Shinra?
"SOLDIER 3rd Class: I wonder what the Shinra Company has to do with Banora? Come to think of it, it's a weird coincidence for two 1sts to both be from Banora."
"Infantryman: The training room is currently under use by the Science Department for a top-secret experiment. Hence, it is off limits to all other personnel. That applies to you as well, Mr. SOLDIER. But I, being the coward that I am, cannot muster the courage to enforce this prohibition upon you. Hence, I must call upon you conscience to decide whether you will enter or not."
"Infantryman: I have the utmost faith in you, Mr. SOLDIER."
"Researcher: Every materia is filled with knowledge of the Ancients, a race that has lived on this planet for a long time. It's said the Ancients held the power to converse with the planet. They knew how to control the planet's power. This knowledge is what ties us to the planet, creating magic. By the way, it's presumed that the Ancients have been extinct for some time now."
Researcher: This isn't something to discuss publicly... But the Science Department was researching about making copies of SOLDIER operatives. Do you remember Angeal? I think his mother was assisting the research at the time.
"SOLDIER 2nd Class: Ever since the war with Wutai was declared over, Director Lazard's been holed up in his office. I don't know what would keep him so busy after a war. You can use the elevator to go to the SOLDIER Director's Office."
SOLDIER 2nd Class: And you call yourself a member of SOLDIER!?
SOLDIER 2nd Class: And you call yourself a member of SOLDIER!?
"SOLDIER 3rd Class Lv. 1: ...I'm sorry, sir..."
SOLDIER 2nd Class: I don't think you understand the most important thing about being a SOLDIER operative. You'd better start thinking about it now.
Zack: What's going on? You don't look very familiar. You must be a new 3rd Class. I'm Zack. Nice to meet you!
"SOLDIER 3rd Class Lv. 1: Yes, sir. I joined SOLDIER just last month. But I can't seem to get anything right. I'm only getting in other people's way. That's why he was yelling at me..."
Zack: You're gonna let a few mistakes get to you? Stay strong. You're in SOLDIER!
"SOLDIER 3rd Class Lv. 1: But he said he was gonna fire me if I screw up my next mission... Aw, I'm so done for..."
"Zack: Aw, come on! Don't be such a wuss! Buck up!"
"SOLDIER 3rd Class Lv. 1: I know, but..."
Zack: You're a bundle of nerves. Tell you what--I'll go on your next mission for you!
SOLDIER 3rd Class Lv. 1: What!? You'd do that for me?
Zack: Just don't tell anyone! And be sure to watch and learn. You got it?
SOLDIER 3rd Class Lv. 1: Yes...I'll try...
SOLDIER 3rd Class Lv. 1: I'm sorry to lay this on you. I'll forward you the next mission I receive. And I won't tell anyone if you won't.
Researcher (1): Professor Hojo is here today. *sigh* Just hearing him cackle is enough to give me a migraine.
Researcher (1): I used to work in the Science Department as an assistant to Professor Hojo... And I hated it. That's the whole reason I asked to be transferred here!
"Researcher (2): The Science Department is conducting combat tests here today. I don't mean to be rude, but if you're not here for the tests, I have to ask you to leave."
"Hojo: Ahh, there you are. Let us begin the experiment."
Zack: Experiment? What experiment?
Hojo: Never mind. Just go in the Training Room.
Zack: I can't go in without knowing what for!
"Hojo: Explaining my experiment would be a waste of time since you wouldn't understand its brilliance, but... I want you to verify the virtual data I extracted from a certain SOLDIER operative's combat results. You are going to help me validate my data by participating in simulated combat."
Zack: Validate Hojo's data?
Hojo: Hm... You must be an outsider. Get out. I have work to do.
"Hojo: Now, do you feel like validating my data?"
"Hojo: Now, my precious data. Destroy this study sample and prove my greatness. Hehehe..."
Zack: ...Did you say something?
Hojo: Nothing at all. Let us begin.
Hojo: Well... That looked rather convincing for a fluke. Did I get the data settings wrong?
Zack: That wasn't a fluke! That was all me!
"Hojo: A sample needn't be so assertive. Whatever your claim is, you need to back it up with data. So here's your chance to prove your abilities. Go and fight the next monster."
Zack: Prove my abilities?
Hojo: Hm... You must be an outsider. Get out. I have work to do.
Hojo: Do you feel like proving your abilities?
Hojo: Hehehe... These settings should do the trick...
Zack: ...What did you say?
Hojo: Nothing. Let us begin.
Hojo: What in the name of... Were the settings off again?
Zack: That was nothing for a SOLDIER operative!
"Hojo: SOLDIER? Oh, I see... You're a member of SOLDIER... Then give the next program a try. This one shouldn't be a problem for someone in SOLDIER."
Zack: Fight another one?
Hojo: Hm... You must be an outsider. Get out. I have work to do.
Hojo: Someone in SOLDIER should have no problem defeating this next one as well. Go on in.
"Hojo: Hmph, I didn't notice you were SOLDIER. The world is full of useless classifications."
Zack: Did I hear you say something?
Hojo: You heard nothing. Let us begin.
"Hojo: Hm, impressive... I think you have what it takes to be a study sample."
"Zack: Whatever that is, I don't think I want it."
Hojo: You should be proud of yourself. It's only once every couple of years that we get someone like you.
"Zack: Gee, I'm glad to have beaten THOSE odds..."
"Hojo: While we're here, how would you like to have a go against an extra-special program?"
Zack: An extra-special program?
Hojo: It's a powerful program that I directly modified myself.
"Researcher (2): Professor Hojo! You're not pitting a human against that program, are you!?"
Researcher (1): Not THAT one! Please say you're not serious!
Hojo: It would be a great match for a wonderful study sample such as yourself... Hehehe...
Zack: An extra-special program?
Hojo: Hm... You must be an outsider. Get out. I have work to do.
Hojo: So are you interested in fighting against my extra-special program?
Researcher (2): You have to listen to me. That program is no joke. Do not go in there!
Researcher (1): It may just cost your life! This program is not safe by ANY means!
Zack: Maybe this isn't such a good idea...
Hojo: Hm... You must be an outsider. Get out. I have work to do.
Hojo: So are you interested in fighting against my extra-special program?
"Hojo: Hehehe...Hahahahaaa! You are a worthy study sample, indeed! You need not worry. Your remains shall become a valuable contribution to science. Now, my precious program, show him why I am great! All shall bow down powerless in your presence..."
"Infantryman: Ohh, Mr. SOLDIER... My faith in you has been crushed..."
"Kunsel: Hey, Zack. So, the war's over..."
Zack: Yeah. Did you hear about all I did?
"Kunsel: The company reports don't mention you at all. And the TV news only talks about ""Sephiroth's remarkable bravery."""
Zack: But Sephiroth was with B Unit...
"Kunsel: Heroes are chosen by the media, that's just how it is."
Zack: Thanks for crushing my dreams...
"Kunsel: Oh, come on! Cheer up, will ya?"
"Man: I thought it would be good for him to see inside the Shinra Building, but... He keeps asking me all these questions! I should have done my homework... *sigh*"
"Boy: Dad, look at this! What's that inside? Do you know?"
"Man: Hm? Well, Son, that's, uhh... You know... ... That's Shinra technology at its finest, that's what!"
"Boy: Wow, so THIS is what technology looks like!"
"Infantryman: If you ever get lost inside the Shinra Building, you should go to the Information Center, sir! The ladies at the Information Center can help you with anything you need to know, sir!"
"Receptionist: Oh, hello. You're Zack, SOLDIER 2nd Class, right? (If I'm going to have an office romance, my man has to be an executive or better.) (Sorry, but 2nd Class isn't gonna cut it.)"
"Receptionist: Good day, sir. Welcome to the Shinra Building Information Center. Please come see me anytime you have questions concerning the Shinra Building."
"Zack: Hmmm, what do I need to know?"
"Receptionist: Zack Fair, SOLDIER. One moment, please. ... You have a meeting scheduled with Director Lazard in the SOLDIER Director's Office."
"Employee: The astronaut is going to be Cid Highwind, the legendary pilot who the airship is named after."
"Boy: Whoa! A Hardy-Daytona! This is beyond awesome! When I grow up, I'm gonna own the highway on this thing!"
"Employee (to the man): This is the Highwind, the high-speed airship, developed with generous funding from the Shinra Company. It was named after the captain, Cid Highwind. It's still in its testing phase, but we expect it to soon become a Shinra symbol--just like Midgar."
"Employee (to Zack): Ah, Mister SOLDIER. I was just talking to his gentleman about this particular exhibit."
Man (to the employee): Wow! This airship looks incredible! I'm amazed that Shinra can make something like this fly through the skies!
"Man (to Zack): Wha!? No, I didn't ask her to tell me about the exhibit just so I could get close to her! No way! Well, I just, you know, have a genuine interest in the Shinra Company's mastery of science..."
Infantryman: I'm in the middle of a pursuit! Please don't talk to me right now!
"Genesis Fan: There's just no way... I don't believe it... Our dear Genesis, killed in action!? It has to be a lie...or some kind of mistake... Oooh! I just can't stand still! Ah!? A mail from headquarters!"
Genesis Fan: One last...farewell...? For Genesis? No! I'm not ready to accept that yet! I...I...I just can't stand still! I've gotta run!
"Angeal Fan: ...How could our dear Angeal be killed in action? I still can't believe it... We'll never see his handsome smile again... But this isn't the end for us. We, the fans, have to carry on. Huh? A mail from headquarters? Wh-what is this!?"
Angeal Fan: Angeal's unofficial profile! This is priceless. Pretty snazzy of headquarters to be sending out stuff like this in our time of grief... Angeal must be watching over us from up above. Let us keep our honor in our activities!
"Sephiroth Fan: Shinra News is reporting that two 1st Classes, Angeal and Genesis, have been killed in action. That goes to show that Sephiroth is SOLDIER's greatest. He's going to be more popular than ever."
"Son: Angeal's been killed in action, right? I saw it on Shinra News. I thought the news would make Mom snap out of it, but it looks like she still wants to be a groupie..."
"Woman: What is it? Are you trying to pick me up, too? (SOLDIER... I hope he goes away soon...)"
"Man: Judging from your looks...you're a SOLDIER guy from Shinra, aren't you?"
"Zack: Yeah, I'm in SOLDIER. Zack's the name."
"Man: Hmph. I don't know where you Shinra people get off, being so arrogant... So what do you think is up with the herds of monsters roaming around Midgar and Kalm?"
Zack: Around Midgar?
"Man: What? Don't tell me you didn't know about this. Didn't you say you were in SOLDIER? Then here's something else you should know. The study of planet life tells of the legend of ""Weapons,"" guardians of the planet. When they sense the planet's danger, they are roused to destroy ""that which ills the planet."""
Zack: So? What does that have to do with the monsters?
"Man: ""That which ills the planet."" Sounds like the Shinra Company to me."
"Zack: Hahaha. You've got a wild imagination, buddy. So you're saying these legendary ""Weapons"" are out to get Shinra? Please. They're just monsters!"
Man: Hmph. Laugh it up while you can.
"Man: I studied planet life in Cosmo Canyon. Shinra is doing all sorts of things in all parts of the world. You might not know them, but I do."
"Employee: Let me ask you something, Mister SOLDIER. Do you know a dandy gentleman on a black chocobo?"
Zack: A gentleman on a black chocobo?
"Employee: You don't know him, huh? I guess he's not famous..."
"Employee: No way! You know him too? He looks so suave in his ten-gallon hat. And he's such a nice guy, too!"
"Employee: Just the other day, on my way to Kalm, I was attacked by monsters. You've heard about them roaming around Midgar and Kalm, haven't you? Well, that's when he saved me. The dashing man on the jet-black chocobo... I'd rather trust my life to him than any average SOLDIER guy."
"Employee: Let me ask you something, Mister SOLDIER. Do you know a dandy gentleman on a black chocobo? I wonder where he is now. My prince... I mean, the chocobo-riding prince..."
"Genesis Fan: I can't believe that Genesis has been killed in action... Please rest in peace, dear Genesis... Your search for truth in LOVELESS will be carried on by the Study Group."
Genesis Fan: LOVELESS is an old epic poem whose final act has been scattered and lost. So experts always get into heated debates about their interpretations of the final act. I was deeply affected by Genesis's interpretations. It was thanks to Genesis that I became so engrossed in LOVELESS.

Security Officer (1): Halt!
Security Officer (2): Who goes there!?
Barret: You're up.
Security Officer (1): You're coming with us.
Security Officer (2): Nice and easy!
Cloud: Don't think so.
Security Officer: Who in the hell!?
Security Officer: Hands where I can see 'em!
Jessie: Have fun!
Security Officer (3): Freeze!

Biggs: You got this!
"Wedge: Yeah, what he said!"
Security Officer: You're coming with us!
Cloud: Can't get surrounded.
"Jessie: So what's SOLDIER boy's deal? Is he one of us now? He's got balls, this, uh... Uh...what was his name again?"
Biggs: Cloud. Cloud Strife.
Jessie: Right.
"Biggs: And he isn't a SOLDIER anymore. Still, he's a professionalunlike the rest of us. I'm glad to have him."
"Cloud: This is a onetime gig. When it's done, we're done."
Biggs: Real joy to work with though.
Jessie: Real joy to look at too.
Biggs: Here we go...
Jessie: Looks are what people notice first.
"Biggs: Guess I'm not on the same page as ""people."""
Jessie: I'd say you're not even reading the same book.
Biggs: Enough. We're done here.
Jessie: Or even the same
Biggs: Give it a rest.

Cloud: Not interested.
Barret: Wedge!

Security Officer: Hey!

"Barret: SOLDIERs may attack on command, but I hear they make good guard dogs too. Bet you've seen a few reactors. So how do we get to the bridge above mako storage?"
"Barret: Ain't holding out on me, are you? Stamp scared to bite the hand that fed him? Or is he a loyal little doggie!?"
"Barret: Have it your way, mutt. We can do thiswithyou, or we can do thiswithoutyou."
"Cloud: Different reactor, different layout. Depends when it was built. Never seen one like this, but I'll manage."
Jessie: Don't you worry. Biggs'll have the door open soon.
Barret: I'm watching you.
"Biggs: In three, two... Damn, I'm good!"
Security Officer (1): Who's there!? Door!
Barret: W-wait!
Security Officer (2): It's over!
Cloud: That's my line.
Security Officer (1): He's alone! We can take him!
Security Officer (2): Make it rain!
Jessie: We're back!
Cloud: Then let's move.
Jessie: He always knows just what to say!
Barret: Cut it out!
"Barret: Simmer down, hotshot."
"Jessie: It's a good thing I know someone who can get us the passcodes. Pity no one else at command will talk to us, but what can you do? And we're good!"
Biggs: Careful in there.
"Biggs: Well, what're you waiting for?"
Biggs: I got this place covered.
"Barret: Security's only gonna get tighter, so be ready. We can't afford any mistakes."
Jessie: Looks like the elevator's on another floor. Mind pushing that button?
"Jessie: So...you know Tifa, right? It's not really my business, but are you guysclose?"
Tifa: Cloud! Are you ignoring me!?
Cloud: Tifa and I...
"Heidegger: These sewer rats appear to call themselves Avalanche, sir. We are currently investigating whether they belong to the same group that made the attempt on your life. Rest assured, our inquiries will not take much longer."
"Barret: This pump's sole purpose is to drain the planet dry. While you sleep, while you eat, while you shitit's here, sucking up mako. It doesn't rest and it doesn't care! You do realize what mako is, don't you?"
"Barret: Mako is the lifeblood of our world. The planet bleeds green like you and me bleed red. The hell you think's gonna happen when it's all gone, huh!? Answer me!"
Barret: You gonna stand there and pretend you can't hear the planet crying out in pain? I know you can!
Cloud: You really hear that?
Barret: Damn straight I do!
Cloud: Get help.
Barret: Say that again!
Cloud: I'd worry less about the planet and more about the next five seconds. Save the screaming for later.

"Barret: Our lives are on the line now. You listening, merc? One false move... And that happens!"
"Jessie: Well, so much for having Cloud do all the fighting. There are some places a sword just can't reach... Just...bear with him for me, would you?"
Cloud: Should've asked for more money.
Barret: Gonna throw your sword at 'em? Let the man with the gun go to work! These tin cans ain't got nothing on me!
Barret: Now for the real show!
"Barret: Do your job, merc!"
Cloud: Shut up and move over.
Cloud: Don't forget to aim.
Barret: Oh yeah? How about I aim for your head!?
Jessie: Look what we have here.
Cloud: A laser security system... Great.
Jessie: Those things'll hurt more than your pride if you're careless. They'll cut you down to size and then some. ...But I'm guessing you've done this kind of thing before.
Cloud: Yeah. Figure out the timing of the lasers. Then make a move when they cycle off.
Jessie: Exactly! I'll go first. Nothing like a little danger to get the blood pumping.
Cloud: Hey!
Jessie: Just keep those baby blues of yours on me!
Jessie: Huh. He's a natural!
Jessie: Not too shabby.
"Jessie: You're doing good, SOLDIER!"
"Jessie: Okay, let's see what's up next!"
"Jessie: ...And it's more of the same. Come on, then."
"Jessie: Pretty easy, right?"
"Jessie: Nice job, Cloud!"
"Jessie: Like a walk in the park, huh?"
Jessie: Not a scratch! Now onto the objective!
"Jessie: Well, I'm glad that's over with. And we're almost at our objective."
Jessie: Look. They don't call those things sweepers for nothing. They can wipe out a whole squad in seconds.
Cloud: Not if you wipe the floor with them first.
Barret: Hah! We can take this hunk of junk!
"Cloud: That ""hunk of junk"" is a heavy weapons platform. If we rush in...we die."
Barret: Is that right?
Cloud: Need to hit it with magic. That should give us an opening.
Barret: Hey! It stopped moving!
Cloud: Let's pin it down! Give it all you've got!
"Barret: Of course, it just had to get back up."
Cloud: So we knock it down again. No time to complain.
Cloud: Now's our chance! Go!
Barret: Don't need to tell me twice! I'm gonna enjoy this!
Jessie: And that's that!
"Barret: What are you, twenty-something?"
Cloud: First.
Barret: Huh?
Cloud: SOLDIER: First Class. Doesn't go into the twenties.
"Barret: The hell you talking about? I mean your age, not your goddamn rank!"
"Cloud: I, uh..."
"Barret: Though, for all I know, a SOLDIER's rank could be the same as his age... Mm-hmm. Guess that'd make you a one-year-old, huh? Live and learn!"
Jessie: That's our target. The reactor core. Gotta set the bomb at the bottom.
Jessie: Let's get down there.
Barret: Goddamn... I can practicallytastethe mako in here... Hurry it up!
Barret: My heart's pounding like a jackhammer!
"Cloud: Scared, huh?"
Barret: Hah! More like excited. I've been dreaming about this for years!
"Jessie: Heads up, boysthe end's in sight. I leave the rest in your capable hands. Good luck!"
"Jessie: Not that way! Down the ladder, dummy!"
"Barret: You think, if we fell in, we'd sink right down to the bottom? To the planet's core?"
"Cloud: No, the pump would suck us back up."
Barret: How comforting.

Barret: All right. Let's see if little Stamp reallycanbite the hand that feeds...
Barret: Go on. Do the honors. Prove to me you're the man Tifa says you are. That you're one of us.
Cloud: Never said I was. I'm just here for the paycheck.
Barret: Then do the damn job!
Barret: What's wrong?
Cloud: I'm fine. What about the timer?
"Barret: Your call, merc."
On-screen: Set the timer:
"Barret: Pretty cocky, ain'tcha?"
Barret: Hah! That long enough for you?
Barret: You double-crossing
Cloud: Heads up!
Barret: What in the hell!?
Barret: Hey! How the hell do we fight this thing?
Cloud: It's got reinforced armor platingbut the internals can be overloaded. Lightning magic.
"Barret: No other option, huh."
Cloud: Can't see an opening... Impressive...
"Barret: Damn, this thing is tough!"
Cloud: Wouldn't be much of a weapon if it went down easy.
Barret: Don't compliment the giant scorpion!
Cloud: Gotta heal up.
Barret: Sure could use a break...
Cloud: Damnit. Need to heal up soon...
Cloud: Gotta memorize the attack patterns...
Cloud: Gotta time our attacks just right! Hold out until you spot an opening!
Barret: Hell yeah! You see the damage that did!?
Cloud: Keep it up!
Barret: We barely scratched the damn thing!
Cloud: Didn't I tell you to use magic!?
Barret: Thought you were full of shit.
Cloud: Think whatever you wantjust do it!
Barret: Damn pain in the ass...
Barret: Got anything you wanna say?
Barret: Funny way to ask for help.
Barret: Shit. Was just about to get you out.
Cloud: Wasn't expecting you to do jack...
Barret: Pretty quick for a heap of scrap!
Barret: The hell is that!?
Cloud: A barrier? Never seen this defense system before...
Barret: Thought you were the expert!
"Cloud: So what's your brilliant plan, genius?"
Cloud: There! Attack it from the rear!
"Barret: Aight, SOLDIER boy! Show me what you got!"
Cloud: Bingo. Focus on that core!
"Barret: Oh,nowhe remembers. Don't keep me waiting in suspense next time!"
Barret: Huh!? It didn't work!?
Barret: Dammit! Gotta do something about that barrier first!
"Barret: Damn, this thing is tough!"
Cloud: Wouldn't be much of a weapon if it went down easy.
Barret: Don't compliment the giant scorpion!
Barret: (chuckles) It's my time to shine!
Cloud: Or go down in flames...
Cloud: Another barrier!?
Barret: Enough with the barriers!
Cloud: Watch the tail! You don't want to get hit by that laser!
"Barret: Huh!? So, whadda we do!?"
Cloud: Don't get hit! Take cover behind that debris.
Cloud: Now! Go!
Barret: Now! Get in there and do some damage!
Barret: It's wide open! Gonna light it up!
Cloud: Heads uptail laser!
Barret: I see it!
Cloud: Then take cover already!
Cloud: Incomingtake cover!
Barret: There really no other option?
Cloud: Wanna get shot? Be my guest!
"Barret: Hey, it's doing that thing again!"
Cloud: Find cover and hunker down!
Barret: Again and again and again!
Cloud: Now! Go!
"Barret: Aw, hell, what's it doing now!?"
Cloud: An auto-repair unit? Dammitwe gotta take it out quick or we're screwed!
"Barret: Oh, I am way ahead of you, merc!"
"Barret: When I get my chance, I'm gonna blow this bastard the hell up! And that's a promise!"
Cloud: Gotta time our attacks just right! Hold out until you spot an opening!
Cloud: It's down! Rain hell on it!
Barret: Ain't gotta tell me twice!
Cloud: There goes another! Now's our chance to do some real damage!
Barret: Shit! The bomb!
Announcement: Twenty minutes until detonation.
Announcement: Thirty minutes until detonation.
"Barret: Hah, you hear that? Damn thing showed you how it's done!"
"Cloud: Come on, we've gotta move."
"Barret: Wedge should be covering our way out! Go, go, go!"
Cloud: You okay?
"Jessie: Do I look okay!? Help a girl out, would ya!?"
Jessie: My hero!
Barret: Hey! We'll link up over there! Look after Jessie!
Jessie: Come this way! This route should lead us straight to Barret! Probably!
Jessie: I think I see an exit. Come on!
"Jessie: Don't look back! Let's go, let's go, let's go!"
Jessie: We're running out of time!
Cloud: Shut up and climb. You're not helping.
"Jessie: Sorry, it just It keeps me focused! I'll freak out if I don't talk!"
Cloud: Have it your way.
Jessie: Barret
Barret: I've got you covered. Find us a way outta here!
Jessie: But then
"Barret: Don't worry, I'll be fine. I've got SOLDIER boy with me!"
Cloud: Ex-SOLDIER boy.
Security Officer (1): They're here!
Security Officer (2): Take 'em down!
Barret: We don't have time for this shit! The clock's ticking!
Cloud: Cool it. Five seconds is all we need.
Barret: You don't look so good. Take care of those wounds before you bleed out.
Barret: Let's go! The others are waiting! Gotta get the hell outta here ASAP...
Barret: Ugh! This is all we need!
Cloud: You got that right.
Barret: Heads up! We got a whole lotta company!
Cloud: No shit.
Barret: Whoa! Ain't you a feisty one!
Cloud: Like a rook seeing his first action...
Heidegger: Sir.
"Barret: Come on...come on, come on, come on!"
Jessie: Door's open!
Barret: Bada-bing bada-boombam!
"Jessie: We don't have a lot of time here! Pick up the pace, people!"
Wedge: Over here! This way!
Cloud: Can you walk?
"Jessie: If I couldn't, believe me, you'd be the first to know."
Cloud: I'll take that as a yes.
Jessie: Cloud!
"Jessie: Okay,thatwas pretty cool."
Jessie: All right. Come on!
Barret: Looks like we made it. And with nothing but a few scratches to show
Barret: Think you might've overdone it?
Jessie: I followed the instructions to the letter. Maybe it triggered a reaction with the mako?
"Barret: Well, let's hope this city's still in one piece."
"Biggs: But the planet's what matters, right?"
Biggs: I mean...this must've helpedsome.
"Jessie: After all that, it better have. Anyway, let's get going. We in Sector 8?"
Wedge: That'd be just down there!
"Barret: All right, then. Lead the way."
Wedge: You got it!
Wedge: Watch out for live wires. They're everywhere.
"Biggs: Ugh, the air in here reeks. Can't wait to get out in the open!"
"Biggs: (sniffs) Man, whatisthat? I've never smelled anything so foul. (sniffs) Aw, it's me. Gotta do something about that, and soon."
Wedge: I felt that one in my guts...
Biggs: They just keep on coming.
Barret: We need to get out of this place.
Jessie: Was it the mako density? The primary explosive? The blasting agent?
"Biggs: Hey, we can figure that out later."
Wedge: Ugh. I'm running on empty here...
Barret: You can refuel at the base.
"Wedge: Next time, I'll have to bring a little pick-me-up."
Jessie: How much farther do we have to go?
Wedge: Not far!
Wedge: That's about as good a place as any.
Jessie: Stand back then. I'll set the bomb.
"Barret: Can't wait to see you, Marlene."
Biggs: Can't wait to take a hot shower.
Jessie: She's good to go.
Jessie: Fire in the hole!
Biggs: You sure told those doors.
Jessie: Let that be a lesson to anything that gets in my way!
On-screen: Sector 8 Business District
"Announcement: Attention all citizens. Attention all citizens. This is an alert from the Shinra Emergency Operations Center. Unidentified intruders have detonated a bomb inside Mako Reactor 1. Multiple explosions have been confirmed, as well as ongoing fires. In response, a disaster warning has been issued in Sectors 1 and 8. Structures in the area are at high risk of collapse, rendering the entire sector hazardous."
Jessie: No... No way.
Biggs: This couldn't have been us...could it?
Wedge: But what if it was...?
Cloud: What's done is done.
"Barret: Merc's right. It ain't pretty, but we can't stop now. This was just the first reactor. And the planet won't be safe till we get the rest."
Biggs: Yeah... We always knew this was gonna get messy.
Wedge: And this is only the beginning...
"Barret: Y'all gotta look at the bigger picture here. Nothing worth fighting for was ever won without sacrifice. Though you may not be crying out, I know you're in painjust like the planet. But it's okay, 'cause I'm here for you! To help take the load off your shoulders!"
"Barret: Your fears... Your worries... Your concerns... And yes, your fees... Whatever your problem, I got you."
"Biggs: So, what's our next move, boss?"
Barret: That's easy enough! We get our asses home!
Barret: We'll split up and shoot for the last train home. Regroup in the freight car. Got it?
Wedge: Later then!
Cloud: Hey. I'd like my money now.
Barret: You can have itonce we'reback at base.
Jessie: Yoo-hoo.
"Jessie: I don't need to tell you what this is, right?"
Cloud: Of course not. It's healing materia.
Jessie: You can have it. For saving my life.
Cloud: Just doing my job. Nothing more.
"Jessie: Yeah, yeah... Fact is, I'm lucky you were there."
Cloud: Survival can be a matter of luck or skill. And you can't rely on luck.
Jessie: Words to live by!
"Cloud: Yeah, well...thanks."
"Jessie: You do know how to use it, right?"
"Cloud: You do know what I was, right?"
Jessie: Okay! I was only trying to help.
"Jessie: Ohbefore I forget, here's a little something extra, for being so brave. That really was the ride of a lifetime... Well, see you on the train!"
Jessie: Cloud! Up here! Look up! I said lookup!
Jessie: I said lookup!
"Jessie: I give up. If you ever get up here, just be careful you don't fall, okay?"
"Jessie: Careful up here! This could collapse at any moment! If you want up, you'll have to use those stairs!"
Cloud: Station's intact.
Cloud: What the...?
Cloud: How...!?
Cloud: He couldn't be... But then...
Cloud: The hell...?
Cloud: Wait...
Cloud: You're not real... You're... ...dead!
Sephiroth: I am?
Cloud: I killed you with my own
"Sephiroth: Oh, you need not remind me. It was the crowning moment of our time together. But that was then, and this is now. I have a favor to ask."
Sephiroth: Our beloved planet is dying. Slowly. Silently. Painfully. Can you bear to see the planet suffer... Cloud?
Cloud: Mom... Mom...
"Sephiroth: Were the planet to die, so many things would be lost. Your hometown that burns so bright... The sound of her voice pleading for me to spare you. The shiver of her flesh yielding to cold steel."
Sephiroth: That which binds us together would be no more. And I would be loath to live in such a world. Which is why I must ask you this one favor. Don't worry. It's a simple thing.
"Sephiroth: Run, Cloud... Run away. You have to leave... You have to live."
Cloud: You bastard!
"Cloud: I'm seeing things. Fumes from all the mako, maybe. All right. You got this."
Topside Resident (1): Shooting for the station? Take the alley and climb up to the roof of that building at the end and you're practically there.
Topside Resident (2): If you make it that far...
"Topside Resident (2): Sure, we could try the alley, but is getting to the station really worth breaking our necks over?"
"Topside Resident (1): Yes, because we won't."
Cloud: Man... What a mess.
On-screen: Loveless Street
Security Officer: Don't let the intruder escape!
Cloud: Security's everywhere...
Security Officer: He must be close.
Cloud: No need to make it harder for yourself.
Sephiroth: You are too weak to save anyone. Not even yourself.
Flower Peddler: Hey... Are you okay?
Cloud: I'm fine.
Flower Peddler: Here. This is for you.
Cloud: A flower?
"Flower Peddler: That's right. It's a gift. You know, for scaring those things away."
Cloud: What things?
Flower Peddler: Never mind. Think of it as a memento.
Cloud: Just my luck...
"Flower Peddler: I heard that, you know."
On-screen: Here. This is for you.
Cloud: How much?
"Flower Peddler: Well, that depends on the customer. In your case... It's on the house."
Cloud: I'm good.
"Flower Peddler: Oh, don't be like that. I know you want one. When was the last time you saw a real flower, huh? Plus, it'll make your girlfriend's day. I guarantee it."
Cloud: How much?
"Flower Peddler: Well, that depends on the customer. In your case... It's on the house."
Cloud: Enough already. I'll give you two gil for it.
Flower Peddler:Two measly gil!? For a real flower? Come on.
"Cloud: Five then.Flower Peddler:Please, that's not nearly enough. Besides, I clearly said it was on the"
"Flower Peddler: You're trying to get rid of me! For five lousy gil! Sorry, but your plan won't work."
Flower Peddler: Lovers used to give these when they were reunited...
"Cloud: Look, I'm involved in things. Dangerous things."
"Flower Peddler: Oh, I'm sure you are. So?"
Cloud: So keep your distance.
Flower Peddler: Waityou think someone's out to get you? Is that what you're all worked up about? Relax. No one's going to attack you. I promise.
"Cloud: Hey, a mako reactor just blew. You shouldn't be out here trying to sell fl"
Flower Peddler: Help me!
Flower Peddler: What are they?
Security Officer: Drop your weapon!
Cloud: Are you blind...?
Flower Peddler: You knowyou're right!
Cloud: WhaWait!
Flower Peddler: Nice meeting you!
Security Officer: Sword on the ground! Right now!
Captain: That bastard couldn't have gotten far. Stay alert!
Cloud: Don't wanna stick around here.
Captain: Arrestanyonewho looks suspicious!
Cloud: Gonna have to find a way around.
Captain: The suspect is armed and dangerous. Be on your guard!
Cloud: So much for the direct route.
Security Officer: Hey! You there!
Security Officer (1): You!
Security Officer (1): There he is! You're not going anywhere!
"Security Officer (2): HQ, this is Sector 8 Unit 4. We have eyes on the target! We need backup! I repeat: this is 8-4 requesting immediate backup!"
Security Officer: All clear.
Security Officer (1): Just give it up!
Security Officer (2): Don't run!
Security Officer (1): Sic 'em!
Security Officer (3): Box him in! Box him in!
Security Officer (4): There's nowhere to run!
"Shinra Helicopter: Target sighted. I repeat, target sighted."
"Shinra Helicopter: Shock troopers, prep for immediate deployment!"
Shinra Helicopter: Troopers on standby!
Shinra Helicopter: You are clear to engage!
Shinra Helicopter: Be advisedtarget is headed for the station!
Shinra Helicopter: Enemy combatantyou are surrounded! Lay down your weapon and surrender!
Security Officer (5): Don't let him escape!
Security Officer (6): Give up!
Shinra Helicopter: Ground forces engaging target in fountain plaza! All nearby units converge and provide immediate support!
Security Officer (7): There's no way out.
Security Officer (8): Move in!
Shinra Helicopter: Requesting immediate reinforcements at fountain plaza!
"Shinra Helicopter: Target still mobile! Support, proceed to rally point at the station."
"Cloud: So much for the direct route. Find another way... Use the rooftops, maybe..."
"Security Officer: Don't let him get away, no matter what!"
Cloud: ...But the rooftops look clear.
Security Officer (1): Over there!
Security Officer (2): Open fire! Shoot to kill!
Cloud: Close call.
Shinra Helicopter: Be advisedtarget approaching residential area. Seal all access immediately!
Security Officer: Target sighted! Get him!
Cloud: It's all or nothing now...
On-screen: Sector 8 Residential Area
Security Officer: Don't underestimate him!
Security Officer: I see him!
Shinra Helicopter: Confirmedtarget has entered residential area!
Shinra Helicopter: Full lockdown is in effect! All units
Security Officer (1): I have eyes on the target.
Security Officer (2): You're mine now.
Security Officer: Target spotted! Moving to intercept!
Security Officer: He's here!
Shinra Helicopter: Enemy combatantyou have been warned! Surrender yourself to Public Security immediately!
Security Officer: Not so fast!
Shinra Helicopter: You have nowhere to run!
"Security Officer (1): End of the line, punk!"
Security Officer (2): I'm gonna enjoy this!
Security Officer (1): Move in!
Security Officer (2): Don't let him escape!
"Security Officer (3): HQ, this is Sector 8 Unit 2. Target is surrounded. Moving to secure."
Security Officer (4): Wait! I know that
Wedge: Guess Cloud won't be joining us after all...
"Biggs: No need to assume the worst. I'm sure he's fine. You saw him in action, didn't you? Guy's a SOLDIER. Goddamn one-man army."
"Jessie': Mmm, you think he's a keeper?"
Barret: On my go.
"Barret: Ugh, you had me worried for a minute..."
Barret: What the hell you been up to? Huh!?
"Cloud: Giving Public Security the runaround, that's what. Had to draw them away from the station somehow."
Jessie: Nicely done.
Cloud: Wait. Got a question for you all.
Barret: What?
Cloud: Ever been attacked by an invisible enemy?
Cloud: Wearing robes. Came and went like the wind.
Biggs: Thought they were invisible.
Cloud: They wereat first. Only saw them after she grabbed me...
"Jessie: A new Shinra weapon, maybe?"
Barret: Hah! More like a panic-induced hallucination!
Cloud: Never mind. Forget I said anything.
"Barret: Suit yourself. C'mon, let's move up."
Wedge: Lotta people here.
"Jessie: And in the freight car, too..."
"Biggs: 'Cause of the evacuation order, maybe?"
Barret: Lucky us. We've got a crowd to hide in. Head for the front of the train and hold there.
"Announcer: Due to an explosion at Mako Reactor 1, an emergency schedule is now in effect. Your understanding and cooperation is appreciated."
"Wedge: Ugh, so cramped..."
"Wedge: Man, everyone's on edge."
Cloud: Of course they are.
"Wedge: Hey, Cloud, I...um..."
"Cloud: If you're about to ""unburden"" yourselfdon't."
Wedge: Yeesh... You don't make it easy...
"Biggs: Hey, got a sec?"
"Biggs: You're uh...holding up pretty well, huh? Even after what we saw at the station and all over Sector 8?"
Cloud: I'm a SOLDIER.
Biggs: Well...my hands are still shaking.
Cloud: You get used to it.
Biggs: Something to look forward to... Or maybe not.
"Jessie: Little help, Cloud? Please?"
Jessie: I can't stop thinking about it. The bomb I made shouldn't have produced an explosion that big. It doesn't make any sense...
Cloud: The explosion triggered a reaction with the mako. You said so yourself.
"Jessie: That was my first guessbut shouldn't a reactor have failsafes to prevent that kinda thing? You mentioned ""invisible enemies"" back there, right?"
Cloud: Right.
"Jessie: Hmm... No. I'm just looking for excuses for something that was clearly my own fault. Gotta own up to it if I'm gonna learn from this and move on. Thanks, Cloud. You're a good listener."
Shinra Employee (1): What kind of maniacs would go so far as to bomb a reactor?
"Shinra Employee (2): They've yet to announce it publicly, but I heard it was Avalanche's doing."
Shinra Employee (1): Really? Aren't they the terrorists who tried to kill the president?
Shinra Employee (3): Is there nothing they won't do?
Barret: Hey! Quit talking out your ass. Everyone knows Avalanche only cares about saving the planet.
Shinra Middle Manager: J-just who do you think you are?
Barret: A law-abiding concerned citizen.
"Shinra Employee (1): ""Law-abiding""? Really?"
Shinra Employee (2): Don't antagonize him!
"Barret: In my humble opinion, that explosion was a messagea message to the bastards bleeding our planet dry. Think they got it? Heard it loud and clear? Y'all's masters?"
Shinra Middle Manager: We will not submit to intimidation or violence! But work together for peace and prosperity! That is how civilized people change the world!
Shinra Employee (1): That's right!
Shinra Employee (2): That is the Shinra creed!
Barret: Hmph. Them's fighting words.
"Shinra Middle Manager: It's what we believe. We all have to follow our conscience, don't we?"
Shinra Employee (3): We should go.
Wedge:You got somewhere you need to be?
"Biggs:Don't wander off, huh?"
Barret:Quit acting like a damn kid. I ain't in the mood.
Jessie:Cloud! Over here.
"Jessie: Let's get this out of the way... Personally, I find visual aids make the dull stuff a lot more bearable. If it helps, think of it as an initiation rite."
Cloud: How many times do I have to tell you people. I'm not
Jessie: Shh. There's such a thing as playing too hard to get.
"Jessie: So, here we've got a wireframe model of the great city of Midgar. Complete with massive steel plates suspended three hundred meters above ground level... Atop which stands a shining beacon of civilization. The whole system is sustained by the mako reactors, which feed the insatiable appetites of the public."
Announcement: The train will be passing through an ID checkpoint shortly.
"Jessie: This here is the train's route. As you can see, it'll take us around this main pillar. Lookwe're about halfway through it now. They've set up a checkpoint here to scan the IDs of all passengers heading in and out. Date of birth, residential status, criminal history... All that and more is automatically cross-referenced in their databases. Public Security wouldn't have it any other way. Heads up."
Jessie: Don't worry. Our IDs are impeccable.
Jessie: What'd I tell you? Have a little faith.
Jessie: Won't be long till we reach the bottom. Relax.
"Barret: Take a good look. It's because of that great big pizza in the sky that people down there gotta struggle to survive. Shinra sucks up mako while the soil turns to dust, the air fills with smog, and the flowers die."
Cloud: Then leave and don't look back. That's what's always worked for me.
"Barret: Hmph! Well, that's all well and good if you're only out for yourself. But the folks down there don't have the luxury of choice, you know?"
"Cloud: Like this train, I suppose... There's only one way it can go..."
"Barret: Hot damn, we are good!"
Jessie: Woohoo!
Biggs: Yes!
Wedge: Bombs detonated: one. Members lost: zero!
Biggs: And one step closer to a brighter future!
Jessie: Hell yeah!
"Barret: Guys! Lower your voices, huh? People are listening."
"Barret: Now get some R&R. You've earned it. Just be ready for the next mission, alright?"
"Barret: See you soon. At Seventh Heaven? You know, where Tifa works? Don't keep her waiting. She'll worry."
On-screen: Sector 7 Undercity Station
"Barret: Not long now, honey! (laughs) Daddy's almost home!"
"Undercity Resident: Hah. ""Mako is the lifeblood of the planet""? The hell it is. Goddamn eco-warriors with their dumbass posters. I tear 'em down and they're back up inside of an hour. Like I've got nothing better to do..."
"Undercity Resident: I mean, look at all that steelwork... You're trying to tell me that's not progress?"
"Undercity Resident: What theYou okay, buddy?"
"Undercity Resident: Mako junkie, huh? Figures..."
Cloud: You again...
Biggs: That hot shower can't come soon enough. I can barely tell my skin from all the ash and sweat.
"Wedge: When I get back, it's refuelin' time."
"Biggs: And you, Jessie?"
Jessie: I dunno. Figure out how I screwed up?
Biggs: Hah! You're such a kidder.
"New Recruit: Um, excuse me. Due to an emergency, entry into this area is prohibited. Sorry for the inconvenience."
Senior Officer: You call that a warning!?
"New Recruit: No, sir!"
"New Recruit: In accordance with emergency regulations, entry into this area is prohibited. Please, leave at once!"
Senior Officer: Still too nice!
"New Recruit: This area's off-limits! Turn around and leave at once! If you don't, I'll have no choice but to use force!"
Senior Officer:Nowyou're gettin' the hang of it!
On-screen: Sector 7 Slums
"Announcer: Once again, relief supplies are currently being distributed in the lobby of the Shinra Building. Doctors are also stationed at the building's disaster relief center. If you are unable to reach the building on your own, please contact the nearest Shinra employee for assistance. Mayor Domino, in conjunction with President Shinra, has declared a state of emergency in Midgar. The administration have issued assurances that they are doing everything they can that they are doing everything in their power to provide aid to those most in need. As yet, no group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but security services are doing everything they can to identify those involved. If you have any information pertaining to the identity of the perpetrators, please contact your nearest Public Security officer or Security Headquarters."
Tifa: Marlene!
Marlene: Daddy! You're home!
"Barret: That's right angel, I am! (laughs)"
Tifa: Welcome back!
Barret: Have you been a good girl?
"Marlene: Yeah, I've been helping Tifa."
"Barret: Oh you did, did you? Well, well...(laughs)"
Tifa: You made it.
Tifa: Where'd you get that? I can't remember the last time I saw a real one.
Tifa: How sweet. When didyouget so thoughtful?
Cloud: A guy can change.Hasbeen five years.
Tifa: Huh?
Cloud: I need to talk to Barret.
Tifa: Right. Come on in.
"Marlene: Daddy, the mako place blew up. Everyone on TV's talking about it."
"Barret: Don't you worry about all that silliness. Daddy's here, and he's not going anywhere tonight. Now turn that thing off and let's get you to bed, huh?"
Tifa: Do you mind keeping Marlene company until I'm done with this?
Cloud: Me?
"Tifa: Yeah, you."
"Barret: Yeah, yeah, your money. Ask Tifa. She takes care of all that."
Barret: Hey! The hell you think you're doing scaring my daughter like that!?
Marlene: Daddy says never talk to strangers.
"Barret: That's right, honey, I do say that. What a good girl you are, remembering Daddy's lessons. You know what else good girls do? They go to bed on time. C'mon."
"Marlene: But I'm not tired! I wanna talk some more, Daddy..."
Barret: Mmm...Alrightbut just this once!
"Tifa: So, then! What can I get you?"
Cloud: My money. I'm still waiting on it.
Tifa: Ah... Right... About that... We should talk. Outside.
"Marlene: Um, Daddy...did the people who died all return to the planet?"
Barret: Of course.
Barret: Let that be a lesson to you.
"Barret: When you wanna talk to a little kid, don't go giving her the professional-killer eyes."
"Tifa: Before we get onto money... There's an empty apartment in a place just down the road. It's nothing fancy, but... I was thinking you could stay there for now. The landlady's a big friend of the cause, so you wouldn't even have to pay rent! Sound good?"
Cloud: Sure does. Thanks.
Tifa: Follow me then!
Tifa: How was it up on the plate?
Cloud: It was...chaotic.
Tifa: Sorry for dragging you into all this. It was wrong of me to put you in danger like that. I promise I won't do it again.
Cloud: Danger's part of the job. Don't worry about me.
Tifa: I'll try not to.
Cloud: Always happy to help stick it to Shinra.
"Tifa: So, you make nice with everyone?"
"Cloud: Much as I could, all things considered. Maybe not enough for them."
Tifa: Good. You had me worried. You're not exactly a people person.
Cloud: I'll give you that.
Tifa: I saw Sector 8 on the news... It was like a war zone...
Cloud: The news is just another Shinra mouthpiece. They'll spread whatever lies Shinra tells 'em to.
Tifa: So...it wasn't that bad?
Cloud: ...It was.
Tifa: Oh. Right.
Tifa: And here we are. Good ol' Stargazer Heights. You're on the second floor.
"Tifa: Room 201 here is where I sleep. Don't have time for much else, what with Seventh Heaven and all. Not even time to decorate."
"Tifa: Here's your room202. Don't worry, I already told the landlady about you."
Cloud: You did?
"Tifa: Yes? Ohhh, I mean I told her I had a friend looking for a place to stay. Was that too much?"
Cloud: No. It's fine. And this?
"Tifa: That one's, uh... Know what, it's getting late. I'll introduce you tomorrow."
Cloud: Wait a minute. That's Tifa's room. Don't be weird.
Cloud: What are you doing? You've never even meet this person.
"Tifa: It's a little bare, but should be enough to get you through the night. If you want anything else, we can always get it"
"Cloud: There is one thing. My money. You guys owe me two thousand, remember?"
"Tifa: I do, and we'd love to settle up, especially since this was your first job for us, but..."
Cloud: That's it?
"Tifa: Sorry. We spent the rest preparing for the mission. That really is it. But not for long! I'm collecting money for filters tomorrow, so I can pay you after."
Cloud: (sighs) And you're sure about that?
"Tifa: Of course...as long as you help, that is. Wait... Then I'd have to pay you for that too. Never mind."
"Cloud: No, two thousand's enough. That's what we agreed on, so that'll be the price. With what you gave me, that leaves fifteen hundred."
"Tifa: You're the best! I'll see you bright and early at the bar, then. Thanks again for everything. Sleep tight!"
Cloud: Guess it's time for introductions.
"Cloud: What, you gonna wake her up?"
Cloud: Hey. You okay in there?
Cloud: Coming in.
Tifa: Cloud! Stop!
Cloud: Get back inside!
Cloud: Get off me!
???: Reunion... Reunion...
"Tifa: What are you doing to Marco? This is his apartment. He's got a few problems, but he's not a bad guy. The landlady asked me to check on him now and then to make sure he's okay. Can I ask you to do the same?"
Cloud: Sure...
"Marle: Well, now. You must be Cloud. I'm Marle, your landlady. So how'd you like the place? You from up on high?"
Cloud: I've been around.
"Marle: I'll bet. No matter. All kinds come through with all kinds of reasons. If you ever need an ear to bend, I'll lend you mine. Can be about anythingeven Tifa."
Cloud: What's she to you?
"Marle: The granddaughter I never had. And if you hurt her, I'll take it out of your hide. You hear me?"
Cloud: Loud and clear.
Marle: Good! Now you'd best get a move on to Seventh Heaven! She's got a head start on you and then some.
Tifa: Morning!
Cloud: Hey.
"Tifa: Just so you know, Marlene's still asleep."
"Tifa: Let's get down to business, shall we? These water filters won't replace themselves. Although, the next batch probablycould, if Jessie put her mind to it. Most every home in the area has one. Folks love 'em 'cause they practically eliminate the rotten-egg smell. Honestly, they make us more money than this place. And it's easy money too. We bring new filters, collect the old ones, and get paid."
Tifa: What?
Cloud: Gimme a break. I'm not a salesman. I'm a SOLDIER.
Tifa: Which is why no one will refuse to pay. What do you say? Please?
Cloud: Let's get this over with.
"Tifa: Great. And while we're at it, I'll give you the grand tour."
"Tifa: Go ahead and keep whatever we collect. Seeing as you didn't bring any luggage, I'm guessing there's stuff you need to buy."
Cloud: Thanks.
Tifa: And don't worry. We'll pay you the difference after. Barret's out making his rounds too.
Cloud: As long as I get it all today.
"Tifa: Hey, there. Here to change out your water filter."
"Item Store Owner: Tifa baby, how you doing? Been waiting for you toWait. Who's he?"
Tifa: Cloud's in charge of collections. He'll take your money.
"Item Store Owner: Sounds like a pretty sweet gig! If you ever need someone to fill in, I'm your man."
"Cloud: In your dreams, maybe."
Item Store Owner: Huh?
"Tifa: Cloud! Uh...since we're here, maybe we should do a little shopping?"
Cloud: Suppose I could take a look.
"Item Store Owner: Thanks! If you're ever in the market for anything else, drop on by. Especially if Tifa's with you."
"Tifa: We'll see you around, okay? And let us know when your filter next needs changing!"
Tifa: He's a regular. Stock up here and he might throw in a freebie or two.
Cloud: Foryoumaybe...
Tifa: Well... You could try being a little nicer.
Cloud: To get free shit? Not my style.
Tifa: (chuckles) Our next stop is Stargazer Heights. Landlady's a client.
Cloud: Just met her.
"Tifa: Then you know what to expect. Remember: she's a good friend of Avalanche, so be nice. Please."
"Tifa: Hey, Marle! Got some filters for you."
"Marle: Tifa! My dear, dear girl! ...Oh. What's he doing here?"
Cloud: Working.
Tifa: Be nice! Cloud's helping me with collections.
Marle: You'd better take care of her!
"Tifa: I'm pretty good at taking care of myself, you know."
"Marle: That I do. Still, better him than you. No charm, no wit. Big sword...but no skills."
Cloud: I've got skills.
Tifa: Be nice!
Cloud: I'm doing my best...
"Marle: You're looking awfully glum. Are you getting enough sleep? A good long rest'll cure anything, I tell you."
"Tifa: A tried-and-true lesson for life on the ground floor, am I right?"
Marle: That you are. Nowyour money.
"Tifa: Thanks, Marle. You take care of yourself."
Marle: Don't do anything I wouldn't do!
Tifa: Marle's great. She helped get me set up back in the day.
Cloud: You...been here a while now?
"Tifa: Five years, give or take... But never mind that! We've gotta get you your money! Last stop is the weapon store."
Weapons Vendor: Hey! That last filter didn't do shit!
Tifa: We're so sorry about that. Hopefully this one will work better...
Weapons Vendor: Save your excuses and get out!
"Tifa: All right. If you could just settle your bill, we'll be on our way."
Weapons Vendor: The hell? You charging me for your busted-ass goods?
Tifa: My associate handles payment disputes...
Weapons Vendor: Think you can mosey up in here and have it your way?
Cloud: Pretty please.
Tifa: Thank you very much!
"Tifa: Seeing as we're done with our rounds, and you've got a small fortune now, why not take a gander at the weapons?"
Cloud: Well...when will Barret be back with the rest?
"Tifa: Before we open up tonight. It'll be a while yet, so...what do you wanna do?"
Cloud: Don't really know...
"Tifa: In that case, I've got a suggestion. Wanna hear it? If you're serious about becoming a merc, then you're going to need to start making connections. ""It's not what you know, but who you know,"" y'know?"
Cloud: Hmph. Another lesson for life on the ground floor?
"Tifa: Yep. Connections get you jobs, jobs build your rep, and more rep gets you better connections..."
Cloud: How do I start?
"Tifa: Hmm...why not help out the neighborhood watch? They're mostly volunteers, but you'll get to know people."
"Cloud: Yeah, okay."
"Tifa: Didn't see anybody at the office, so let's head up top."
Weapons Vendor: Huh? I ain't got nothing for a punk-ass bitch like you! Get on outta here!
"Tifa: Huh, didn't know you were holding down the fort."
"Wedge: Oh, hey, Cloud. Looking to join the neighborhood watch?"
Cloud: That depends. What does this neighborhood watch do?
"Biggs: Umm...lots of stuff, really. But our top priority is taking care of any beasts that wander into town. That, and teaching the locals how to defend themselves."
"Wedge: Like they say: ""The only one who'll look out for you is you."""
"Tifa: Cloud's a great fighter, but only we know that. If no one knows him, no one'll hire him. Thought if he joined the watch, he could get his name out there."
Wedge: That would work for everybody!
"Biggs: Truth be told, we could really use your help. We can't pay you in girl, but we'll work something out. For example... Aha, what about your sword? I could mod it for you."
Cloud: No thanks. It's fine just the way it is.
Biggs: You some kind of a purist? I knowI'dnever pass up a chance to improve my gear. C'mon...at least let me show you how it's done.
"Biggs: All set? Needless to say, you'll have to try it out to appreciate the difference."
Cloud: Thanks.
Biggs: We'll do you one betterspread the word to everyone who'll listen about the new merc in town.
"Tifa: Between him and Wedge, there isn't anyone they don't know."
Wedge: I'll march through the streets singing your praiseseven on an empty stomach!
Cloud: So...where are these monsters?
Biggs: Scrap Boulevard. Good hunting.
"Tifa: Hey, Cloud. I'll come with."
"Cloud: No, I've got this."
"Tifa: But...you don't know the way, do you?"
Cloud: Lead on.
Tifa: (chuckles) Sure thing. I know these streets better than anyone.
"Tifa: Scrap Boulevard is out west. Past the barricades supposed to keep the monsters out. Anyway, we should prepare, just in case."
On-screen: Scrap Boulevard
Tifa: Here's Scrap Boulevard.
Cloud: I can see why monsters'd feel right at home.
"Tifa: Hm. And the more we pile up, the more they show up."
"Tifa: And there's our first challenger! Show me what you got, Cloud!"
Tifa: Wow... So that's what a SOLDIER looks line in action.
Cloud: This was just a warm-up.
Tifa: (chuckles) I'll bet. Let's keep at it!
Tifa: You're good at this! Charging in like it was nothing...
Cloud: You too. It's a little surprising.
"Tifa: Well, I've been here five years now. ""If you don't look out for yourself, no one else will."" By the waythat one's gonna be on the test."
Cloud: This a lesson?
"Tifa: Gotta learn if you're gonna stick around. Okay, let's wrap this up..."
Tifa: Alright. I think that might be the last of them.
Cloud: They won't stay gone for long...
"Tifa: Of course not. Even so, folks'll be grateful for the peace and quiet in the meantime. A win's a win, you know?"
Cloud: True.
"Tifa: Trust meit'll do wonders for your rep. Right, let's go check in with Biggs and Wedge."
"Katie: It's you! You're the merc everybody's talking about, am I right?"
Cloud: Yeah.
"Katie: Iknewit! So, the board here tracks how many monsters folks've taken down, right? A bigger number means a safer townand who wouldn't want that? Just between you and me, thoughthey're pretty much allyourkills. Cool, huh? Anyway, keep up the good work! We'll try to make it worth your while."
Katie: C'mon you guys! Let's get these numbers up!
"Katie: Whoa, check it out! I don't think the number's ever gone that high before! At this rate, we won't have to worry about monsters ever again! What a thing to be able to say..."
"Katie: Thank you so, so much! We'll never forget how many bloodthirsty beasts you kept off our streets! Ahhh, smell that fresh air! That's the smell of a safe and happy townone you can be proud to call home!"
"Katie: Hey there, how's it going? I don't think anyone's ever gonna beat that record of yours! It's incredible!"
Biggs: Back already?
Tifa: Got every last one too. Now the slums should be safe.
Wedge: You guys are machines!
"Biggs: Good job. Meanwhile, we told everyone we could about you."
Cloud: So I heard. I've gotta ask though.Whatdid you tell them?
"Tifa: It's alright. All you gotta do is keep up the good work. It'll pay off soon enough, I promise."
"Biggs: How's the sword, by the way?"
Cloud: Good.
Biggs: Glad to hear it. Seems like the perfect fit for you.
Cloud: Yeah. We've been through a lot
Tifa: You okay?
Cloud: I'm fine.
Tifa: Been meaning to ask... After you left the village...
Cloud: It's a long story.
Tifa: I've got time! Why don't you tell me all about it while we try to rustle up some more work for you?
Wedge: That sounds great! I'll come too!
"Biggs: Oh, no you won't. Run along now, you two. Go on."
Tifa: Sorry. Maybe next time.
Wedge: No fair!
Biggs: Think about it for a second. They haven't seen each other in years. You'd be a third wheel!
"Tifa: Hey, before we get back to it, why don't you check out the weapons?"
Cloud: No need.
"Tifa: C'mon, the dealer's probably heard all about you by now. Might treat you better."
Cloud: I dunno about that...
Weapons Vendor: Hold up. Heard there's a merc that'll take on any monster. You the man?
Tifa: Word spreads fast around here.
Cloud: What if I am?
"Weapons Vendor: Sorry 'bout before. I get antsy when business is slow. Man in your line of work needs weapons, no? Why not try that one on for size? Yours on the house. Badass like you rocking my weapons is good advertising. Think about it."
Cloud: Fine.
Weapons Vendor: Or if you wanna take a look at something else...
Cloud: Just a look.
Weapons Vendor: Don't be a stranger.
"Tifa: Since you've got yourself a new weapon, let's see if we can't put it to good use. Come on. Let's go chat up Wymer."
Cloud: Who?
Tifa: The guy who tracks all the requests that come to the watch. You never knowcould toss some work your way.
Cloud: Where's he at?
"Tifa: Oh, he should be back at the office by now."
"Wymer: Hey there, Tifa! You need a helping hand?"
"Tifa: Actually, I wanted to introduce you to an old friend of mine. This is Cloud. He's a merc."
"Wymer: Hah, you don't say! Well, we're always on the lookout for experienced fighters to help us deal with the bigger critters."
"Cloud: I'll take on anything. For the right price, that is."
"Wymer: Experiencedandcocky, huh? If it's a challenge you want, I might have a few good ones. Your clients can fill you in on the details. Prove yourself with these jobs, and I'll see if I can't find you some more."
Cloud: Thanks.
"DJ: Hey man, check it out! This song's pretty sweet, ain't it? You like it? Have a copy!"
Tifa: Something's wrong. Let's check it out.
Tifa: That went well. Could be you've found your calling.
Cloud: Eh. Was alright I guess.
"Tifa: Think of each job as an opportunitynot to make money, but to build connections."
"Cloud: ""It's not what you know, but who."""
Tifa: (chuckles) You remembered.
Cloud: Had a patient teacher.
Tifa: Maybe not so patient next time.
Cloud: Hoo boy.
"Tifa: Oh, Barret should've finished collecting his share of the money by now, so what do you wanna do? Head back to the bar?"
"Tifa: I'll be a lot of people are talking about you right now. ""There's this amazing merc who can handle anything!"""
Cloud: Nothing I've done around here has been all that special though.
"Tifa: Oh, so you want more of a challenge, huh?"
Tifa: Okay then! That's another solid gig in the books! You know the whole town is really impressed with what you've done. Keep it up and you'll have enough work to keep you fed for a lifetime!
Cloud: All thanks to you.
Tifa: And don't you forget it!
Cloud: So where do we get paid? The shop or something?
"Tifa: Yeah, but why don't we head back to the apartments first? Take a quick breather."
Cloud: Which lesson was that again...?
"Tifa: Lesson one. Got it? Anyway, let's go!"
"Chadley: Candidate detected. Performing physical analysis... Sizable weapon, excellent cardiovascular health and impressive lung capacity. Perfectly balanced muscle and bone structure... An optimal candidate!"
Chadley: My name is Chadley. I'm an intern for Shinra's Research and Development Division. I hope you'll be interested in helping me with my research. Please accept this as a down payment.
Chadley: I would like you to set that Assess materia in your equipment and use it to gather intelligence in battle. This data will help me to develop new types of materia.
Cloud: I'm not interested in working for Shinra.
"Chadley: You should know that I work actively to undermine Shinra's efforts. I'm sure you of all people can appreciate the tremendous power of materiaas well as how it might be wielded against your corporate enemies. And if you later decide that I am not worthy of your trust, you can do what you do best."
Cloud: I will hold you to that.
"Chadley: Excellent! Then we shall work together so long as you deem fit. Once you've completed your task, please return and report to me."
"Chadley: Please set the orb of Assess materia to your equipment, and use it to whether battle intel."
Cloud: There. That should be enough intel for the kid.
On-screen: Return to Chadley?
Chadley: Cloud. You were the first to gather the data I requested. Here is the rest of your payment. I have developed new materia. Would you like to see it?
"Chadley: I plan to develop more materia in the future. Together, we can harness enough power to take down Shinra. I'll be preparing more battle intel reports, which I hope you will assist me in completing."
"Chadley: Cloud, I've come up with the most fascinating theory. Perhaps you can lend me your assistance in gathering data to test it?"
"Item Store Owner: Hey there, Tifa, welcome back! And you. The new merc in town looking for work, right?"
Cloud: Yeah.
"Item Store Owner: In that case, maybe you could do something about the doomrats? Them and their wererat buddies have been tearing up town, looking for food and whatnot. Got into the store and made one hell of a mess, let me tell you."
"Item Store Owner: Oh, you think that's funny, do you? Don't lie. I saw you crack a smile. Well, do the job and you can laugh it up for all I care. Anyway...they're probably nesting in the outskirts. Now I've heard a wererat in pain'll call its friends for help. And the whole rat pack'll come running, just like that."
"Undercity Resident: The leader of the rat pack is the worst of 'em all. The loudest, most obnoxious squeaking... Johnny liked to mimic it until we told him to cut that shit out."
"Cloud: I don't see any ""doomrats"" around..."
"Tifa: Hmm, what do you think? Should we wait? You know, this might be a waste of time. Let's head back to the store and touch base for now."
"Item Store Owner: Well? Rats too much to handle? I'm just messing with youheard you took out some wererats, which is nice and all, but the job was to wipe out the doomrats. No biggieget back out there and finish the job and we're good."
Item Store Owner: Don't look so glum. It's only a matter of time till they show. You'll get 'em this time for sure!
On-screen: Return to the item store?
"Item Store Owner: Finally managed to get those doomrats, huh? Thanks guysyou're the greatest! Was so dead in here I thought I might have to close up shop for good."
Item Store Owner: Heygot an idea. Hear me out. If the guy who took care of the town's rat problem told everybody where he liked to shop... Well? Whaddya say?
"Item Store Owner: I'll make it worth your while, of course. Give you some incentive. Talk you up to Wymer and my customers and anybody else who'll listen. You'll be swimming in work before you know it!"
"Cloud: Yeah, sure."
"Item Store Owner: (laughs) Okay then! That's what I like to hear! Seventh Heaven, the new merc in town, and my little store! I can see it now! We're gonna clean up!"
"Item Store Owner: Keepin' your nose to the grindstone, huh? I've got just the thing for a go-getter like you!"
Item Store Owner: Pleasure as always. Say hi to Wymer for me!
"Undercity Resident: I'm guessing you're the merc who dealt with those damn rats? That wasn't me who put in the request, but as a resident of Culvert Street, I appreciate what you did."
"Junk Dealer: Hello, hello! Oho, what do we have here? I'm guessing you're that merc I've heard so much about. You're not here to shop, are you? People were right. You look like you can handle yourself."
"Junk Dealer: So some drakes've made themselves at home in the abandoned Talagger factory. Can't have that kind of trouble around here. My regulars will do anything to get their hands on the scrap in there, and if they run into those drakes, they could get hurt."
Cloud: I'll handle it.
"Junk Dealer: Much obliged, sir! Head on over to the old Talagger factory and talk to Narjin. He's the watchman guarding the entrance. Good luck! I'm counting on ya, my friend!"
Junk Dealer: Narjin's the one with all the details. You'll found him outside the old Talagger factory. Don't forget to stock up before you go!
Narjin: Step back.
Narjin: Factory's off-limits. Drakes have been spotted inside.
"Narjin: Huh? Wait a minute. Tifa? Don't tell me you're here to take care of those things. Are you? In that case, be my guest! We believe there's at least two groups lurking somewhere inside the factory. Find and cull 'em all."
(Upon talking to him again.)Narjin: Reports said the drakes looked like they were nesting. Need you to clear 'em out before they breed.
On-screen: Abandoned Talagger Factory
On-screen: Return to the scrap dealer?
"Junk Dealer: Got rid of those drakes in the factory, did ya? What a relief! I can't wait to give my regulars the good news!"
"Junk Dealer: You're the real deal all right. Keep it up, and I can see you going far as a merc in this town. I've worked with my fair share over the years, so believe me when I say that I know what I'm talking about."
"Junk Dealer: Anywayyou're needed over at the pillar. Apparently another flying bastard's stirring up trouble. Bet you can't get enough of this, eh?"
Cloud: Well...
"Junk Dealer: No, I get it. If you're good at something, might as well make it your living. May not know you, but I know a man who's found his calling when I see one. Keep at it! I switch out my stock every so often, so drop by when you're in the neighborhood, huh?"
"Junk Dealer: Always a pleasure. Ohyou look into that other gig yet? If you're planning to, might wanna buy some extra supplies first."
Betty: Hey...where'd you guys go?
"Betty: Oh, hey there! Uhh, is Marlene with you?"
Tifa: No.
"Betty: Oh, okay. I was kinda hoping she could help me find my friends."
Tifa: I know someone who can help you. This guy right here.
"Betty: Really!? Okay! Lemme tell you all about them. They have long arms and legs. And they're a little skinny. They like places where there's food. And nice people who give them treats when they ask! And small spaces! Oh yeah, and they're all cats!"
Cloud: I'm looking for cats?
"Betty: They're friendly, so if you call them, they'll come running. All three of them! Find my friends. Please!"
"Undercity Resident: Hey, what are you doing in there? Come on out."
Undercity Resident: I'm trying to get a cat to come out. It snatched one of my pastries and scurried in there. Will you be a dear and lend me a hand?
Cloud: This sucks.
"Undercity Resident: Oh, for the love of... I am sick and tired of chasing this little guy around!\"
"Cloud: Ugh, screw this."
On-screen: Return to Betty?
Betty: What? They ran away? So...I'm never gonna see them again?
Betty: You guys! You came back! They said that a scary man was chasing them! Thank you!
"Wymer: Hey, I got another job for you, merc."
"Wymer: A certain shopkeeper told me you paid him a visit. Thanks for helping him out. Just so happens there's another job I'd like to offer you, now that I know you can handle yourself in a fight."
"Wymer: We've got a real killer on the loose, you see. A rabid catch dog. Maybe you heard people talking about it? Shinra mutt gone feral. Last sighting was in Scrap Boulevard. Think you're up to it?"
Cloud: I'll handle it.
"Wymer: You're a lifesaver! Doubt anyone else around here stands a chance! Go get 'em, bud."
"Wymer: Hey! Over here! Tifa! Hey, Cloud!"
"Wymer: I drove the hound into the area up ahead. He's pissed, so make sure you're ready."
On-screen: Return to Wymer?
"Wymer: Took care of the dog, did ya? Phew! We owe you one."
"Cloud: Gotta say, I've never seen a Shinra breed like that before. Out of curiosity, when exactly did it show up?"
"Wymer: Oh, today. The first reports came in just this morning. Uh...why do you ask?"
Wymer: Wait a minute... There's this crazy story about a Shinra research lab hidden right beneath our feetunder the slums.
Cloud: Huh. Really...? That's news to me.
"Wymer: (laughs) And here I thought you might know something I don't! Well, I guess not."
Cloud: It's a big organization. I'm sure there's lots of secrets I don't know.
"Wymer: Yeah, fair enough. You got the bastard. That's good enough for me."
Gwen: Seriously!?
"New Recruit: I'm sorry, but it's outside our jurisdiction!"
Senior Officer: Show some spine!
"New Recruit: Y-yessir! Ma'am, if you don't leave at once, I will be forced to arrest you!"
Gwen: Oh yeah? Go ahead!
"Gwen: Tifa! You won't believe this! A cerulean drake flew in from the train graveyard, but these two clowns refuse to get off their butts and do anything about it!"
"Gwen: Hey... Is that...? It is you! The new merc! Then maybe you can help us out? The drake is in the old Talagger factory over there, but to reach it you'll need to get ahold of a watch security key. You should be able to find one inside one of the cratesI forget which. Just smash 'em all."
New Recruit: This really isn't a good time...
Senior Officer: What was that!? Do your job!
New Recruit: Y-yessir!
New Recruit: I'm on duty...
Senior Officer: Don't fraternize with civilians!
"New Recruit: Y-yessir! You will r-respect my authority, or else I'll...I'll give you what for!"
New Recruit: I'm on duty...
Senior Officer: Don't fraternize with civilians!
"New Recruit: Y-yessir! You will r-respect my authority, or else I'll...I'll give you what for!"
Narjin: If it ain't the merc himself.
Tifa: That the key?
Cloud: Yeah.
On-screen: Return to Gwen?
"Gwen: And there he is! I knew you were the right man for the job! There's no denying you're the real deal! Not like these idiots, with their excuses. Rather have one of you than twenty of them!"
Cloud: They're just doing their jobs. Can't expect them to be at your beck and call.
"Gwen: What exactly is it you're trying to say, merc?"
Cloud: You need people who can follow orders too.
"Gwen: I see now. Heard you were ex-Shinra. Guess I shouldn't be surprised you'd go to bat for your old buddies. Me, I'm just looking out for my people. All there is to it."
Gwen: Hell with you. We can take care of this town ourselves! No more mercs or Shinrawe'll build up the watch and kick you all out!
"(Upon talking to Gwen after completing the quest.)Gwen: We don't want your so-called ""protection""! We'll take care of ourselves!"
New Recruit: But...we're only here to...
Senior Officer: Recruit!
"New Recruit: Y-yessir! Leave now, otherwise I'll be forced to arrest you!"
"Gwen: C'mon then, tough guy, do it!"
Marle: Huh? Someone's back awful early. Not that I mind! Would you two be dears and swap your filters out for me? I left them in your rooms.
Tifa: Sure thing!
"Marle: Not so fast, you. Do me a favor. She needs a frienda real friend."
Cloud: ...We're already friends.
"Marle: So when she talks, are you really listening? Thinking about her and her feelings? Or are you just going through the motions? Go on."
"Tifa: Let's take care of this real quick, okay?"
Cloud: Sure.
Tifa: Come over when you're done.
On-screen: You changed the filter.
Tifa: Gimme one sec. I'll be done in a bit.
Tifa: Finally!
Tifa: So. After you left the village.
Cloud: Hm?
Tifa: I let you off the hook before. Back at the hall. But not this time.
"Cloud: Well, when we were kids...everybody wanted to be a SOLDIER, right?"
"Tifa: Yeah, I remember they were on the news every day during the war."
"Cloud: Thing is, by the time I finally made it in, they didn't need heroes anymore. It was nothing like what we'd dreamt of. It was just...working for Shinra. Just..."
Tifa: I'm sorry. I know it's a touchy subject.
Cloud: Not exactly small talk. Especially with someone you haven't seen in a while.
"Tifa: I get it. Still, it's kinda funny. Us going our separate ways, thinking that must be it... that we'd never meet againand then here of all places we do."
Tifa: You know what? We should totally celebrate! Let's dress up and hit the town!
Cloud: Really?
"Tifa: I mean, why not? It'll be fun!"
Cloud: Do you even have fancy clothes?
"Tifa: Not likefancyfancy, but I'll figure something out! What do you think would suit me, huh?"
On-screen: I wonder what would suit me.
Cloud: Something refined.
"Tifa: Yeah, I guess we're not kids anymore."
Cloud: Something...sporty?
Tifa: I don't think that'd be so different from my usual.
Cloud: Something exotic?
"Tifa: Uhhh...really? Then again, if we're making an effort..."
"Tifa: Be sure to pick an outfit that goes with mine, okay?"
Cloud: Will do.
"Tifa: (chuckles) This is gonna be so much fun, you'll see!"
Cloud: Yeah...maybe.
"Tifa: And on that happy note, I think it's time we headed back to the bar. C'mon!"
"Cloud: Uh, you don't need a break?"
"Tifa: Honestly, I'm feeling pretty good. Marle isn't always right you know."
"Tifa: Hey, Marle. We took care of the filters, so we're gonna head back to the bar now."
Marle: Take care you two! ...Oh? You're looking pretty chipper!
Tifa: Uh...I don't feel that different.
"Marle: Must be my imagination then. (chuckles) Anyway! Keep your wits about you, merc! A token of my appreciation. Be good to her."
Johnny: Stay away from me!
"Johnny: Get off me, assholes! I didn't do shit!"
"Security Officer: Shut it, punk!"
Johnny: Or what!? Screw you!
Tifa: What's going on?
"Undercity Resident (1): ""Somebody"" went and stole some blasting agent from a Shinra warehouse. So Public Security started asking questions, and you know how Johnny gets..."
"Undercity Resident (2): It's because of the reactor bombing, I bet. I could be wrong... But something tells me they're not gonna settle for just roughing him up this time."
"Tifa: We've gotta save him, Cloud!"
Cloud: Is he Avalanche?
Tifa: No. He doesn't really know what we do...but he has his suspicions. And... He's a talker.
"Tifa: Actually, you know what...maybe I should go alone."
Cloud: I'm coming.
Tifa: Uh...are you sure?
Cloud: It's the least I can do. Lead on.
Tifa: Thanks. Come on!
"Johnny: (screams) What the hell, man!? You trying to break my arm!? Dragging me through the street like this isowcruel and unusual punishment!"
Security Officer: Shut your mouth and keep walking! Or else!
"Johnny: Come on, guys! Is this any way to treat a model citizen of Midgar?"
Tifa: Come on. Let's get a closer look.
Security Officer: Model citizens don't steal blasting agent! So why don't you tell me why your ID popped when we were going over the warehouse logs!?
Johnny: Huh? You've got it all wrong! I've never gone anywhere near a Shinra warehouse! Unless it was Jessie... She jacked my ID!
"Security Officer: Your ID was never logged, dumbass. It would've never gotten you inside a Shinra installation in the first place! But don't you worrywe'll take all the time we need to help you get your story straight."
"Johnny: What!? That's bullshit! Cheap bullshit! Entrapment! Yeah, yeah! I know my rights!"
"Tifa: I swear, all he had to do was keep his mouth shut."
Cloud: Yep.
"Tifa: Anyway, you distract the officers, and I'll...figure something out."
Cloud: Let him go.
Security Officer: Who're you? The cavalry?
"Johnny: Is thatis that who I think it is!? Aw, hell yeah! You guys really came to save me! Ava"
Security Officer: Hey! The hell you think you're doing!?
Tifa: Here we go...
"Johnny: Uh...so...is it over? Yo, anybody there? If you're there, then help me!"
Tifa: Grab Johnny so we can get outta here.
Cloud: Alright.
Tifa: Whwhat now?
Cloud: He's a talker.
Tifa: No!
"Johnny: Huh!? You're not gonna... Hold up! Wait! Don'tdon't do it, man!"
"Cloud: You wanna live, then get the hell out of town."
"Johnny: Y-y-you got it, boss! You ain't never gonna see my face again, I swear!"
Cloud: Are you sure about this? It's a big risk.
"Tifa: I know, but...it's fine."
Cloud: And them?
Tifa: No more... Cloud... You're scaring me.
Tifa: We need to go before they wake up.
Tifa: I...I'm worried about Johnny.
"Cloud: I'm more worried about us. We gotta go, right?"
Tifa: Right...
Cloud: What?
Tifa: It's just...you've really changed.
Cloud: How?
Tifa: I suppose it's...yeah. Your eyes. They used to be less...
"Cloud: It's the mako. SOLDIER, remember?"
"Tifa: ...I remember. So, what do you wanna do now? Head back to the bar? Or do you wanna tackle another job or two?"
Tifa: And here we are. You must be tired.
"Cloud: Same as you, I guess."
"Tifa: Could use a little something to take the edge off, right? How about a refreshing cocktail made by yours truly that you can sit back and savor?"
Cloud: Tifa...
"Tifa: Yeah, I'm feeling it a bit too. Hey... Do you think you'll stick around a little longer?"
"Cloud: Maybe. Work for a minute, build up some savings..."
"Tifa: I see. In that case, wanna head back out and look for more gigs?"
On-screen: Head back out into town?
"Cloud: Yeah, why not."
Tifa: Well? You wanna head inside?
On-screen: Head into Seventh Heaven?
Tifa: We're back.
Marlene: Did you...have fun?
Tifa: Lotsa fun.
Barret: Heyneed y'all downstairs.
Tifa: Uh...right now? Then the plan is...?
"Barret: Marlene, wanna go wait for Jessie out front?"
Marlene: Okay!
"Tifa: Looks like we're officially on for tomorrow night, then. Gotta go over the details with the others."
"Cloud: Before you do, about my pay"
"Barret: You'll get your money! So sit down and shut up until we're finished. Double time, Tifa."
Tifa: I'm really sorry...but it shouldn't take much longer. In the meantime... Grab a seat.
Tifa: What'll it be?
On-screen: What'll it be?
Cloud: I dunno...something hard and bitter.
Cloud: Not really in the mood right now.
"Tifa: But if you were, then maybe..."
Tifa: Well? Most people would say something sweet right about now.
Cloud: I'm sure they would.
"Tifa: Ahh, but you're a more discerning customer, aren't you? In which case..."
Tifa: Our house special: the Cosmo Canyon.
Cloud: Beautiful.
Tifa: I gotta go. Enjoy.
"Jessie: Hey! You see the news? ""The reactor bombing was the work of the eco-extremist group 'Avalanche.'"" Public enemy number one! Gets your heart racing, doesn't it? They don't know our faces, so we're in the clear for now, but we'll wanna capitalize on this momentum. Speaking of which, you coming on the next one?"
Cloud: For the right price.
"Jessie: Oh, you can bet I'll be pushing hard for a raise!"
"Jessie: Tifa'll be joining us too, but I dunno... Even a blind man can see her heart's not in it. She was never on board with the bombings, so if it comes down to do or die... If I've got to put my life in someone else's hands... Then...I'd rather that someone was a professional. Like you."
Cloud: Could still kill some time.
Cloud: What was up with that girl anyway?
On-screen: Play some darts?
Cloud: Maybe just chill a bit.
On-screen: Wait at the counter for Tifa?
Cloud: I heard you're having second thoughts.
Tifa: I know we have to think big if we're going to make a difference. But not like this. I just... I feel trapped.
"Cloud: If it feels wrong, don't do it."
"Tifa: Guess that's that, then."
"Cloud: What, they kick you out?"
Tifa: We agreed to disagree. Soyou want another drink?
Barret: Tifa! Time to celebrate! Break out all the good stuff!
Tifa: Oh. Sure.
Barret: We won't be needing you for this next job. Feel free to look for work elsewhere.
"Cloud: Fine by me. That's how I like it. No contract, no obligation."
"Barret: Figured you'd say that. Herethe rest of your payment, along with a little extra for your exemplary service. And thus concludes our business. Gonna have to ask you to leave now. This here's a private affair."
"Jessie: Sorry, I tried. We talked it over, but...in the end... We didn't want to put so much on you. This is our fight."
"Biggs: Jessie, what's the holdup?"
Jessie: Be right there!
"Jessie: No hard feelings, huh?"
Cloud: It's fine.
"Jessie: Let's talk more after I'm done here, okay?"
"Cloud: Really, it's fine."
"Wedge: C'mon, Jessie! I'm dying here!"
Jessie: I'll catch you later.
Jessie: Sorry to keep you thirsty boys waiting!
Everyone: Avalanche!
"Biggs: Glug, glug, glug, glug... Ahhh! That hit the spot!"
"Jessie: Damn, Biggs, slow down!"
Barret: Keep it tight! Ain't no room for error come tomorrow!
Wedge: More reason to live it up now!
Biggs: Yep! Best way to clear your head so. you can focus when it counts!
Tifa: It's been too long since we did this.
Wedge: Not since we went on that all-night bender after HQ gave us the boot.
"Jessie: They did not ""give us the boot""!"
"Barret: It was an ""amicable separation."""
Jessie: Just thinking about it's making me mad again.
Tifa: Can't believe it's already been a year. I don't know how we managed.
"Barret: Well, I do. It was you guys going above and beyond. Thank you."
"Biggs: No need for that, boss. We all knew what we were signing up for."
"Barret: Yeah, but when shit hits the fan, it's good to know you're in my corner. End of the day...you're all I got!"
"Biggs: Happy to look out for you, like I know you'll look out for me."
Wedge: So long as someone looks out for my stomach!
Jessie: Tifa's got you covered there.
"Barret: As a friend, or as a cook?"
Jessie: As if you've really gotta ask!
Wedge: That tickled!
Tifa: I guess it is kinda obvious!
"Wedge: You know, it'd be really cool if we could do this again tomorrow night."
Barret: Oh we will. Avalanche!
Everyone: Avalanche!
Tifa: You guys...
Cloud: What's up with them?
"Hoodlum (1): So what, we just hang around here till he shows up? Big guy with a gun for an arm?"
Hoodlum (2): Word is he lives in this town. Just shut up and wait. We'll find him soon enough.
Hoodlum (3): Man! Seems like the boss always gives us the most shit-tastic assignments.
Hoodlum (2): Guess that's why we're paid so damn much.
Hoodlum (1): What're you looking at?
Hoodlum (3): We got a problem?
Hoodlum (2): What?
Hoodlum: Hey brother! You from around the way?
Cloud: I guess.
Hoodlum: Know a big man with a big gun strapped to his right arm? Heard he's set up shop somewhere in the neighborhood.
Cloud: That depends...
"Hoodlum: Clever. Smell an opportunity to make some scratch, do ya?"
Cloud: Five hundred.
Hoodlum: Two hundred.
"Cloud: Mm, three."
"Hoodlum: Whatever, man. Let's fin somewhere quiet to talk. Walk with me."
Hoodlum (1): Got something to say!?
Hoodlum (2): You lookin' at me?
Hoodlum (1): Move it! I saidmove!
Hoodlum (2): Look at all these assholes starin' at us.
Hoodlum (3): This shithole's got nothing on Wall Marketam I right?
"Hoodlum (2): Word of advice, blondie. Don't piss off my friend here, or you'll be real sorry. Unless you've got some kinda death withthen be my guest. (laughs)"
"Hoodlum (1): After you, brother... And don't worryI ain't the backstabbin' typemostdays..."
"Hoodlum: Spill it. You know where the bastard's hiding, don't you?"
Cloud: I told you before... That depends.
Hoodlum: Oh yeah? You wasting my time!?
"Cloud: Shinra's time, you mean?"
Hoodlum: Hah. Shinra knows better than to stick its nose inmyboss's business.
Cloud: Like I give a shit.
"Cloud: Big man with a big gun for an arm, right!?"
Hoodlum: Uh... Hey...it's...
Cloud: Why do you want him?
"Hoodlum: Just a grunt following orders, you know? Nobody tells me shit. Lemme walk away. Please!"
"Cloud: So, if they weren't Shinra, then..."
Cloud: Not my problem. Lesson one for life on the ground floor... Get some rest.
"Jessie: Welcome home, honey! Took your sweet time."
Jessie: Psych.
Jessie: Are you gonna let me in so we can talk in private?
"Jessie: Guess I'll get right to the point, then."
Cloud: What've you got there?
Jessie: An apology. For not getting you on the mission. Or not. What doyouthink it is?
Cloud: A proposition.
"Jessie: Nailed it in one. Gonna have to ask you to keep all this a secret from the others, though. It's a personal mattersomething I need to sort out tonight."
Cloud: Tonight?
"Jessie: Tonight. You and me, together. I want you to come with me to the Sector 7 plate. I'll give you the details on the way."
Cloud: That's fine by me... But don't you have a pretty big day ahead of you?
"Jessie: I do, but... If I don't deal with this now, it's only gonna get harder... Anyway... I can count on you, can't I?"
Jessie: A down payment.
Jessie: Doubt we'll be back before morning'case you were planning on traveling light. Make sure you've got everything you need before we leave. I'll wait here.
Jessie: You all set?
On-screen: Ready to go?
"(Upon selecting ""No."".)Jessie: Take all the time you need. Nothing a woman likes more than being kept waiting. But seriously, get your ass in gear already!"
Jessie: Awesome. Meet me at the station before dark. Don't be late!
Cloud: It's...just another job...
Biggs: Tough break. They changed the times. Last train's already left. Which is why we borrowed these bikes. Need a lift to the plate?
Jessie: How did you guess...?
"Wedge: Easy. You've been acting weird. Like, talking about one thing when you're obviously thinking about something else."
"Biggs: Yeah, and don't get me started on all that pep."
"Jessie: All right, I'll give you thatbut how did you know I wanted to head topside? Was I talking in my sleep? What else did I say!?"
Wedge: No. We just figured you wanted to see your parents. That's all.
"Biggs: Nailed it, huh?"
Jessie: Yup. Right on the head.
"Biggs: Soseeing as we don't have any family of our own... How about you let us be a part of yours for a bit? You know, spread the wealth."
Jessie: Are your parents still around?
Cloud: No.
"Jessie: Okay, then. Guess you're all invited! Here's to awkward family reunions!"
Biggs & Wedge: Yeah!
Jessie: I take it you boys have your brand-spanking-new IDs?
"Biggs & Wedge: Yes, ma'am!"
Jessie: Then let's lay down some rubber!
Biggs: Crank that throttle!
"Wedge: Okay, you got it!"
On-screen: Corkscrew Tunnel
Jessie: You hear me?
Cloud: Yeah.
"Jessie: Just so you know, I'm not going plateside for the reason they think I am. Lookyou saw the way the reactor went up. It was huge, right?"
Cloud: Because of all the mako. Isn't that what you said?
"Jessie: Yeah...that was wishful thinking. Deep down, I know it was my fault. I used a more powerful blasting agent than the directions called for. It had nothing to do with the mako."
Cloud: Let's say you're right. So what?
"Jessie: I'm planning on using a weaker blasting agent this time. But...since I can't get in touch with my supplier, our only option is to loot a warehouse owned by Shinra."
Cloud: Shinra? Good luck with that.
"Jessie: With your help, we won't need luck."
Jessie: ID scan! Ready!?
Biggs: So far so good!
"Jessie: Alright, here comes the hard part!"
Biggs: And that is?
"Jessie: The fake IDs may have held up, but from this point on, if we get pinged by a scan..."
Cloud: They'll come for us.
"Jessie: Yeah, what he said."
"Biggs: Oh, man!"
Wedge: Just like that!?
"Jessie: No need to worry. We've got Cloud, remember?"
"Jessie: Hey, you do know how to drive, right?"
Cloud: SOLDIERs get mandatory training.
Jessie: Well then! You gonna take my breath away? Make my head spin with your amazing skills?
Cloud: Don't blame me if ya get sick.
Jessie: Right...
Jessie: That some super-secret technique? You got a fancy name for it?
Cloud: Of course not.
Jessie: We've got company!
Cloud: Someone's having fun.
"Jessie: How could I not!? ""Pursued by villains, a young couple thrust together by fate race through the neon-streaked night..."""
Cloud: Get off!
Jessie: Oh! My hero!
Biggs: Straight to lethal force!?
"Jessie: What, so you'd just pull over if they asked nicely?"
Biggs: Eh... You've got a point.
Jessie: See!? So don't go holding back now!
"Jessie: ""Had the cold-eyed mercenary's heart suddenly begun to melt?"""
Cloud: Nope.
"Jessie: I won't forget that. (laughs) Wait, is it just me or did we slow down?"
Cloud: Just you.
Biggs: More of 'em!?
Jessie: Think we've bitten off more than we can chew! Whadda we do!?
Cloud: Shut up!
Mobile Unit Officer: Targets sighted. Moving to intercept.
Biggs: Got more company!
Cloud: A-team's here.
"Jessie: Uhh, I don't like the sound of that!"
"Wedge: We're not screwed, are we!?"
Jessie: Head's updrones!
"Biggs: One thing after another... C'mon Wedge, gun it!"
Wedge: Iamgunning it!
Cloud: We're good.
Biggs: Nothing about this is good!
Cloud: You got me.
"Biggs: Fair enough! Alright then, do your thing!"
Mobile Unit Officer (1): SOLDIER en route. HQ's saying he's less than a few minutes out.
Mobile Unit Officer (2): Copy.
"Mobile Unit Officer (1): You think it's ""him""?"
Mobile Unit Officer (2): Probably. All the more reason to finish this quick. Don't need that kind of trouble.
"Biggs: That's an ex-SOLDIER for ya. Next to him, we look like kids on trikes."
Jessie: You're damn right you do!
"Biggs: You're part of that ""we"" too, you know."
Wedge: We made it!
Biggs: Woo-hoo! Topside!
Cloud: Keep going till we hit the station?
"Jessie: No, head straight for the warehouse. Awww... Our magical ride is almost at an end..."
Biggs: Why ya talking like we're not here?
Jessie: Because you're not!
Biggs: Clearly we are!
Biggs: Not over yet! Cloud! Little help!?
Mobile Unit Officer (1): Time's up. Break off before he shows!
Mobile Unit Officer (2): Copy!
Jessie: What's going on?
Jessie: Who's that?
Cloud: A SOLDIER.
"Roche: Well, hello!"
Biggs: Who's this!?
"Roche: ""Too quick for the eye, you cross him, you die!"" Now... Mind if I cut in? Woo! Splendid! I've been looking for a new dance partner!"
"Roche: Private party, huh? That's fine. I'll settle for a race then. Just one."
Cloud: You talking to me?
Roche: I most certainly am.
Cloud: Then no!
"Roche: Ah, so terribly sorry! Your words fail to reach my ears, sluggish and slow as they are!"
Jessie: What's this guy's deal!?
"Roche: The lady's curiosity has been piqued! My name is Roche, but you may address me by the more accurate appellation: Speed Demon!"
"Jessie: Heardthat, huh!?"
Roche: My ears are attuned to the feminine voice!
Jessie: This guy is the worst.
Roche: Yes. Yes! This is the contest I've been waiting for!
Roche: Fascinating...
Jessie: What is he up to now?
Cloud: Same shit. Being a dumbass.
"Roche: Not bad. You have promise, and an abiding affection for your mount. But! One cannot simply ride one's bike! Nay! One must unlock its true potentialbecome one with the machine! Like this!"
Cloud: Had enough?
Roche: Don't be absurd. As if I could ever grow tired of your company!
"Roche: Naughty, naughty! Until one of our flames is forever extinguished, our dance will never end! (laughs) Burn for me!"
Roche: Come on! Let's push it past the redline!
"Cloud: Jessie, take over."
"Roche: Well, well, well! I do believe this round is yours. (chuckles) Maybe next time we can keep it just between the two of us."
Cloud: Maybe.
"Roche: (laughs) Until we meet again, my friend!"
Biggs: We did it!
Wedge: Go team!
Jessie: Don't get too excited. Reinforcements are hot on our trail.
Jessie: You failed the test.
Cloud: What test?
Jessie: Driving.
Cloud: I'm great at driving.
"Jessie: Hah! Great at scaring your passengers, more like..."
Cloud: Not used to having any.
Jessie: Maybe you should just letmedrive.
Cloud: Nope.
Jessie: Gues I'll take one for the team and be your back warmer again.
Jessie: You passed the test!
Cloud: What test?
Jessie: Driving.
Cloud: Did more than just passs.
"Jessie: Not really. You made it by the skin of your teeth, if we're being honest."
Cloud: Whatever.
Jessie: I bet you held back because I was with you.
Cloud: Didn't want you to fall.
Jessie: So now I'm too weak to stay on a bike? Huh? Huh?
"Cloud: Just hold on tight, will you?"
Cloud: What?
Jessie: I might...be falling after all.
Jessie: Psych!
Jessie: You passed the test!
Cloud: What test?
Jessie: Driving.
Cloud: Been driving for years.
Jessie: So you don't need a reward?
Cloud: No.
"Jessie: Well, you got one anyway."
Jessie: You can thank me later. I'll wait.
Jessie: Giving me the cold shoulder?
"Jessie: Aw, would you look at that... It's the end of the ride."
Jessie: We'll go on foot from here. Don't wanna draw too much attention to ourselves.
"Wedge: Hey, did these things leave a mark?"
Biggs: (laughs) They got you pretty good.
Wedge: Aw...andI'm running on fumes...
"Jessie: Don't worry, we'll top you up soon enough. Now let's roll."
Jessie: Hey! Focus!
Jessie: The residential area's just beyond this gate. Mind doing the honors?
Jessie: You've got an arm on ya!
On-screen: Sector 7 Employee Housing Area
"Jessie: Here we arethe employee housing district. Where they put you when your parents work for Shinra. While their reactors were slowly killing the planet, we were living the good life..."
"Wedge: C'mere... Aw, no dice... Someone's playing hard to get."
Biggs: Folks here must be living off three or four times what I do.
Jessie: Figures. Still leaves the lights on every night for the girl who only comes home once every other blue moon. Mom's an old-fashioned type like that.
"Wedge: Think she'll make us pizza? Her ""Midgar Special""?"
Biggs: She's quite the cook. Quick to whip up finger-lickin' food even if you drop by in the dead of night.
Jessie: And she loves guests who ask for seconds or thirds.
"Jessie: Okay, let's head in. Cloudyou know what to do. Why don't you wait around the corner over there?"
Cloud: Ah. Okay.
Wedge: It's a shame you won't get to try the Midgar Special. You would've really liked it.
"Jessie (in Cloud's memory): With your help, we won't need luck. You'll take on just about any job, right? Well, I need you to rob my house. Think you can do that for me?"
Jessie (in Cloud's memory): Go in through the back door when the coast is clear. The signal will be obvious.
"Cloud: Once the lights come on, it's go time."
Cloud: Time to go.
"Jessie (in Cloud's memory): Inside, you'll find a room with two doors. Don't take the one in front of you. You want the room on the right. That's where you'll find it."
Jessie: Sorry about dropping in like this again.
Jessie's Mom: This will always be your home. Sohow's practice going?
"Jessie (in Cloud's memory): We'll be chatting Mom up in the kitchen, so don't even bother being quiet. There's no way she'll ever hear you. Dad'll be in there, but it's okay."
"Jessie (in Cloud's memory): I need you to grab his Shinra ID card. And yeah, I know I should do it myself, but... (chuckles) but I honestly don't think I'm up to it. Just do this for me, okay?"
Jessie: Now thisthis is what I've been waiting for!
"Biggs: Yeah, like a dog!"
Wedge: Don't mind if I do!
Biggs: This is amazing!
"Jessie: Alright, here comes a Midgar Special!"
Jessie's Mom: Eat as much as you like!
"Wedge: I'll take another one, please!"
"Biggs: You've still got room, Wedge?!"
"Jessie: Dang, Mom, how'd you get even better at this?"
"Jessie's Mom: Please, take more!"
"Wedge: So, got more pizza in the oven?"
"Jessie's Mom: Careful, it's hot!"
"Biggs: Aw, thank you!"
"Jessie: Wedge, don't hurt yourself!"
Biggs: Now that is a damn good pie.
Wedge: I'm not full yet!
Cloud: This isn't it.
Cloud: Jessie...
Cloud: What's this?
"Jessie (in letter): ""Dear Mom and Dad"", Sorry for not getting in touch sooner, but... I'm working at the Gold Saucer as an actress now. It wasn't easy, and I had a lot of help from people along the way... but I managed to land a starring role. Enclosed are two tickets to my play. Looking forward to seeing you both there."""
Cloud: Jessie Rasberry as...the Princess?
Jessie (in Cloud's memory): My dadhe was a maintenance supervisor at the reactor.
Cloud: Thanks.
Cloud: Time to go.
Cloud: Need to hurry up.
Cloud: Mission accomplished.
Jessie's Mom: When are you going to give up on the Gold Saucer? How long as it been since you even performed?
Wedge: A lot of people really rely on Jessie.
"Jessie's Mom: As a stagehand though, right? You can be one of those anywhere. So why not come home and get a job at the Sector 8 theater?"
"Jessie: Uhhh, I'll think about it. You know, I'd really love to stay and chat, but we gotta go."
Jessie's Mom: So soon!?
"Jessie: Yeah, well, we hadn't even planned on dropping by. But Wedge wanted some of your famous pizza."
Wedge: So good!
Jessie's Mom: Sure I can't tempt you with some more?
"Wedge: Maybe just a couple slices, Missus R."
Biggs & Jessie: Wedge!
Wedge: Hey! I'm...I'm doing it for you guys! You don't want me going to work on an empty stomach.
"Jessie (in Cloud's memory): I'm planning on using a weaker blasting agent this time. Since I can't in touch with my supplier, our only option is to loot a warehouse owned by Shinra."
Jessie: Hey there.
Cloud: This it?
Jessie: Now comes the hard part. I'm gonna use this to sneak into the 7-6 Annex.
"Biggs: All right, let's get to it."
"Jessie: Sorry, but you're staying outside. Only I know what to steal from where, so it's gotta be me who goes in."
Biggs: So...we came all this way just to eat pizza!?
"Jessie: (chuckles) You think I'd let you off that easy? You're gonna earn every slice helping Cloud. Just do the thing where you draw everyone's attention away, like you did at my parents'. What's the word again? Maybe I'm more nervous than I thought."
Cloud: Diversion.
"Jessie: Yeah, that! Nice one, military man."
"Wedge: So what, does this mean we're gonna ask some Shinra folks out to dinner?"
"Biggs: You know damn well what she means. While you're inside, we make sure the guards are focused on the outside. Yeah?"
"Jessie: Exactly. Couldn't've put it any better. When you see a flare go up, that's your cue. Rush the front gates and make for the warehouse plaza. The more hell you raise, the more time you buy me."
"Biggs: You're gonna run this guy into the ground, aren'tcha?"
Cloud: How much time do you think you'll need?
Jessie: Not too much. I'll be in and out. I'll send up another flare when I'm done. We rendezvous in the vacant lot up ahead.
Biggs: Hold on. How are we supposed to get back to the slums? Wait for the first train?
"Jessie: No, I wanna be back before that. Don't worry, I have something worked out. Now, let's get this done."
"Biggs: Well, that diversion's not gonna create itself."
"Biggs: Jessie's dad was in there, right?"
Cloud: Yeah.
"Biggs: Mako poisoning. Happened while Jessie was doing a show at the Gold Saucer Ah, but what do you care?"
"Cloud: No, I wanna hear it."
Biggs: Jessie always wanted to be an actress. Worked her ass off for years until finally she caught a break. Top billing. Parents were thrilled. And then...right before opening night...
Wedge: Her dad had an accident.
"Biggs: Collapsed from overwork...and in the worst possible place. Mako storage. Lay there half a day before someone found him. Been like that ever since. No change whatsoever. That's what got her into planetology, and led her to seek out Avalanche. How far we've come..."
Wedge: Jessie's got a theory about it. Thinks her dad's spirit is stuck nowbetween his body and the heart of the planet. So if we don't shut down the reactors soon...
Biggs: He'll get caught up in the flow and...poof.
Biggs: What's so funny?
Cloud: Just that I understand how you feel. Unlike most of the time.
Biggs: I see...
Biggs: Mako's the essence of life itself. Of memory and hope. It's not something you burn in a reactor just to keep the lights on. Hell no.
"Biggs: Ohdon't tell Jessie about this little chat, okay? When she gets pissed, she gets punchy."
Cloud: Well... No promises.
"Wedge: He's serious, Cloud! She'll beat the shit out of us!"
Cloud: Not my problem.
Biggs: This guy!
Wedge: Hey! It's the lot Jessie was talking about. We rendezvous here when we've got what we came for.
Biggs: Gotta stay hiddenwait for the signal.
Wedge: It's so quiet...
Biggs: Just need to get past this gate.
Cloud: Wait. Where are the guards?
Biggs: Looks like someone beat us here.
Wedge: And I don't think it was Jessie.
Biggs: This had better not get in the way of our plans...
Cloud: It won't.
On-screen: S7-6 Annex
Biggs: Don't see anyone. What the hell happened?
"Wedge: Hey, man, the plaza's that way. Warehouses are further in. Jessie's supposed to be circling around from the back, right...?"
Biggs: No need for us to rush. Let's scout it out first.
Cloud: I can handle this solo.
"Biggs: What, you're trying to keep us out of it now? Don't be a jackass."
Wedge: We're in this together!
Cloud: Don't expect me to save you.
"Biggs: If you need to check your gear, now's the time. Give the word when you're good to go."
Wedge: You can use that vending machine over there to stock up!
Biggs: Guess there's a training center too. Could go a few rounds before the main event.
On-screen: Commence battle training?
"Biggs: Remind meyou've got summoning materia, don't you? There's no better way to deal with big groups. You'd be crazy not to equip it."
On-screen: You all set?
Biggs: Okay. Let's go over the plan one last time. You start things off by cutting loose where everyone can see you.
Wedge: And us?
"Biggs: We're the backup. First, we climb high enough to get a vantage pointthen we go to town on 'em."
Tifa: Heya. So...what did you wanna talk about?
"Cloud (in flashback): When spring comes, I'm leaving town and going to Midgar."
Tifa: Should've figured. All the guys are leaving.
Cloud (in flashback): B-but I'm not like them. I'm not going just to look for work. I'm gonna be a SOLDIER. The best of the best. Like Sephiroth.
"Tifa: The great war hero, huh? Mm... Isn't it pretty hard to become a SOLDIER?"
Cloud (in flashback): Yeah. So I won't be back for a long time.
Tifa: Guess not. Think you'll be in the papers?
Cloud (in flashback): I'll try.
"Tifa: Just...promise me one thing. When we're older, and you're a famous SOLDIER...if I'm ever trapped or in trouble... Promise you'll come and save me."
Cloud (in flashback): Huh?
Tifa: That's what heroes do. They save people. Please? Just once.
Cloud (in flashback): Uhh...
"Tifa: Come on, promise me!"
Cloud (in flashback): Fine. I promise.
Cloud (in flashback): I heard you're having second thoughts.
Tifa: I know we have to think big if we're going to make a difference...but not like this. I just... I feel trapped.
Wedge: That's the signal!
Biggs: All according to plan.
Cloud: Let's go.
Biggs: Right!
Wedge: Yeah!
Security Officer: I don't see any intruders. Maybe they went home.
Security Officer: Hey! Over there!
Security Officer: T-target sighted!
Security Officer: Light him up!
Cloud: Give up?
Security Officer: K-kill the bastard!
Security Officer: They're up there too!
Security Officer: We've spotted more intruders. Send backup.
Security Officer: They have a sniper. Get him first!
"Security Officer: Focus on the other one! Quickly, before we're surrounded!"
Security Officer: You're gonna pay!
"Biggs: Oh, you gotta be shitting me."
Biggs: Gimme a bit more time and I got you.
Security Officer: Give it up!
"Security Officer: Puttin' up a fight, huh!?"
Biggs: Goodbye! And good riddance.
Elite Shock Trooper: Don't let them escape!
Wedge: And down she goes!
Biggs: Look at us amateurs putting in the work.
Wedge: Don't worryI've got this!
Wedge: (screams) Catch me if you caaan! (screams)
Wedge: Tasty treats! Come and get 'em!
Wedge: Don't eat me! Please don't eat me!
"Wedge: Midgar Special, don't fail me now!"
Wedge: Think I ran off the pizza...
"Biggs: (laughs) Helluva show, man! If only the ladies loved you that much!"
Wedge: I'm glad someone's enjoying themselves...
Biggs: Of course they store mechs here...
Cloud: You ready?
Biggs: Hell yeah!
Wedge: More than you know! Look what I found. Let's give these jerks a taste of their own medicine!
Wedge: Hurry! Lead the sweepers toward the mines!
Wedge: Now that's what I call teamwork!
Security Officer: Stay where you are!
"Biggs: Well, shit."
"Security Officer: All right, assholes! Show me your hands!"
"Roche: (laughs) Well, aren't we having a wonderful time kicking the hornet's nest!"
Roche: You know what I want. A second dancejust the two of us.
Roche: You turned the key... The engine roars with excitement... It hungers to be set free!
Cloud: Fall back.
Biggs: Right. C'mon!
Roche: It's been a long time since I fought a duel out of the saddle. But...for all the miles on the clock...
Roche: I'm just as fast as I ever was!
"Roche: At last, our long-awaited dance begins! Here's to a fair fight, my friend!"
Roche: I told you we were gonna push it past the redline!
Cloud: Satisfied?
Roche: (laughs) With such fleeting pleasure? Hardly. There are higher heights to which you and I can still soar...
"Security Officer: Okay, boys! Give 'em everything you've got! But kill the swordsman first!"
"Roche: We really must do this again. Until then...try not to die. I'll see you on the road, my friend."
Cloud: Goddammit!
Cloud: Let's go!
Biggs: Right!
Cloud: Wedge!
Wedge: Run! Run while you can!
Trooper: Friendly! Friendly! Stand down!
Trooper: Your team shouldn't be here.
Wedge: Glad yours is...
Biggs: C'mere.
Biggs: Wedge'll be fine. But you won't be if they start asking questions.
"Cloud: And who are ""they""?"
Biggs: First guests to the party. Another Avalanche cell. Our holier-than-thou friends from the old guard... It's always their way or the highway. Lately they've been a real pain in the ass... Till now.
Cloud: So then why are they here?
"Biggs: Beats me. We've been on the outs ever since our cell got labeled too extreme... though they're the ones running around with mil-spec gear. Word is they've cut a deal with Wutai... Promised 'em all the materia in Midgar, apparently. Think there's any truth to that?"
Cloud: You tell me.
Biggs: Sometimes I think we're the only ones who've realized the war is over.
Biggs: Okaymission complete. Let's make our way back to the lot.
Cloud: Right.
Biggs: Looking a lot more crowded now.
Cloud: Security's out in force.
Biggs: Just what we need.
"Cloud: So, are we not gonna wait for Wedge?"
"Biggs: If we stuck around or went back, he'd only get upset."
Cloud: Why's that?
"Biggs: Guess a SOLDIER wouldn't understand... I'll tell him you were worried about him, though. Who knowsmight just make his day."
Security Officer: ...And many of our citizens have already been disturbed by the alarms. Squad A will set up here and search for suspects. B will establish a perimeterroadblocks included. Contain the situation! Rumors of violence against Public Security will only serve to frighten the people. You will tell any concerned citizens that this was a false alarm!
Jessie: You made it! Over here!
"Jessie: Could you have been any louder? I mean, it made my job a lot easier, but Wait, where's Wedge?"
Jessie: Wedge!? That was close...
Cloud: We'll go get him.
"Biggs: Hey, buddy. How you doing?"
Biggs: C'mon...
Wedge: Not my finest hour...
Biggs: You get hit?
"Wedge: Just winged, I think... Or shot!"
Biggs: Really? Let me see...
Jessie: Are we seriously doing this here? That's...wow.
Wedge: You guys are the worst...
"Jessie: Your ass is fine. Maybe singed, but the only casualty is your underwear. This is like a bruise or a mild burn at worst!"
Wedge: Nowthatwas a gunshot.
Jessie: Is that a smile I spy?
Cloud: It's not safe here. We should go.
"Biggs, Jessie, & Wedge: Copy that!"
Wedge: So how do we get back to the slums?
Jessie: With a little trick I've been dying to try out...
"Biggs: Man, can't believe HQ was running an op tonight of all nights."
Cloud: Coincidence?
"Biggs: That or a bad omen. If they're ramping up for something, could get messy. Add it to the pile of complications to think about."
"Jessie: Right, this is it! Through here and we're home free."
Wedge: Where exactly are we going?
"Jessie: When we get there, you'll know! Now that I've got my blasting agent, we should have everything we need for our next mission!"
Biggs: Sure hope so.
Cloud: Yeah...m-me too. For your dad's sake.
"Biggs: Hey! What the hell, man!?"
Jessie: Huh?
Wedge: UhCloud was just saying how he hopes to come back and try the Midgar Special next time!
"Jessie: Really, huh?Cloudsaid that?"
"Biggs: Sure did! Wants a whole pie to himself, isn't that right?"
Cloud: That's...that's right...
"Jessie: Really...? Well, okay then! Maybe I'll lend Mom a hand next time too!"
Wedge: That'd be awesome!
Biggs: Super-duper awesome!
On-screen: Sector 7 Plate Edge
"Jessie: Should be somewhere around here... Bingo! I half figured my dad got it wrong, but nope! They're here just like he said!"
Biggs: Parachutes?
"Wedge: Huh? Whaddya mean ""half figured""!?"
"Jessie: Fifty-fifty is pretty good odds, if you ask me! This is gonna be fun!"
"Jessie: Thanks guys. I really appreciate you coming all this way with me. And like I said before, I'd be grateful if you kept this between us until after the mission. I don't wanna...complicate things."
"Biggs: Sure. Okay, who's ready to fly!?"
Jessie: Me! Me!
"Biggs: Hey Cloudyou let him down gently, alright?"
Cloud: Yep.
"Jessie: Wait, I almost forgot! One more thing!"
Biggs: S-stop it! What in the hell are you trying to
Jessie: Easy! You'll make us fall!
Biggs: Not if you do first!
"Jessie: Swing by my place afterso I can ""pay you in full."""
Biggs: Huh!? Now!? (screams)
Wedge: Wait! Gimme a minute!
Cloud: No.
"Wedge: Why do you have to be such a hard-ass, bro?"
Cloud: I ain't your bro.
Wedge: I wish I could've done more... Just got hurt
Cloud: You did enough. You took one for the team. Be proud.
Wedge: Yeah...? Yeah...
Biggs: Feels like we're flying high these days!
Jessie: (chuckles) Now more than ever!
Biggs: He's a keeper all right.
Jessie: Yeah! Together we can take on the world!
On-screen: Sector 7 Slums
"Wedge: I'll head home on my own. After all, I'm only a little sore..."
"Cloud: It's cool, we'll go together."
"Wedge: Aw, thanks, bro!"
Cloud: Cut that out.
Wedge: This way!
Wedge: Think Jessie and Biggs made it back safe?
Cloud: I guess.
Wedge: Cool if we check on them? We'll pass by their places anyway.
Cloud: Sure.
"Wedge: Well, this is Biggs's place. I guess he hasn't made it home yet."
Cloud: Guess not.
"Wedge: Hope he isn't ""worst case-ing"" it again. He's got a habit of overthinking things. Worrying about all the possible outcomes till his head hurts."
Cloud: Wouldn't've guessed.
"Wedge: And when he worries, I worry. Anyway, let's head on over to Jessie's!"
Wedge: This is where Jessie lives. Men are not allowed inside.
Cloud: Hmm...
Wedge: Lots of pretty girls trying to make it big onstage live here. So don't hang around or they might get the wrong idea.
Cloud: Huh.
"Wedge: I'm telling you this for your own good, Cloud! People around here love to gossip."
Cloud: They know about Jessie and Avalanche?
"Wedge: Nah, it's all good. They think she's an actress. Oh...and one more thing, bro. It's all a game to her. Don't fall for it!"
Cloud: You lost me.
Wedge: (laughs) Life's a stage and love's the play!
"Wedge: Guys aren't allowed, remember!?"
"Wedge: Hey there, Biggums, Reggie, Smalls... Brought a new friend to meet you! These little guys are on guard duty today."
Cloud: Okay...
Wedge: Thanks for seeing me home!
Cloud: Really sorry about your ass.
"Wedge: S'all good, bro!"
Cloud: It's kinda weird when you call me th
"Wedge: Hey, don't be scared! Deep down, he's a big softie."
Cloud: Hell with it...
"Wedge: Hey, bro! Wanna chill with me and the gang for a bit?"
"Cloud: Uh, who's the gang?"
"Wedge: The cats, dummy. Who else? Biggumus Rex, Reginaldo, Mister Smalls..."
Cloud: Right...
"Wedge: Mind checking on the others again for me? Thanks! Oh, and have a good night!"
"Jessie: Well, if it isn't Cloud Strife! Was wondering when you'd show up. Without further ado... Here you are. Thanks for stepping up, ""merc."" And now for the cherry on top."
"Cloud: Okay, I get it. Mind letting me breathe?"
Jessie: Depends. Mind coming over tomorrow night? My roommates should all be out for a while.
Cloud: Are you seriously that desperate? Just let go already.
Jessie: Only if you promise to come back tomorrow night. Deal?
On-screen: Will you come back tomorrow night?
"Cloud: No promises, but I'll think it over."
"Jessie: Really? You will!? I make a mean pizza, I'll have you know! Marche, luche, black milly, red shellyI use only the best ingredients! Sound good?"
Cloud: Never heard of any of that stuff.
"Jessie: Awww, you aresoadorable, you know that!? You just leave everything to meit'll be great!"
Cloud: Not happening.
"Jessie: Ah, sorry... Little too in-your-face? I'll just have to change it up then."
Jessie: (laughs) Nighty night!
Jessie: Psych!
Cloud: Bad idea...
"Biggs: Oh, hey, Cloud! Survived the jump? How's Wedge?"
Cloud: He's fine.
"Biggs: Well, that's good to hear. Tomorrow's a really big day for all of us. When Wedge said he'd been shot, I was afraid we'd have to call off the whole damn thing. Heading topside in secret... Don't think I could've faced Barret if something had happened. But Jessie'd been acting weird and I knew I couldn't just ignore her."
Cloud: Biggs.
Biggs: She must be prepping the bomb right now. But will she be able to finish before morning? I should go and see if she needs any
Cloud: Biggs!
Biggs: Huh? Sorry. Our chute was blown pretty far off course. It...felt like a bad omen or something...so...
Cloud: Get some rest. You need it.
Biggs: Roger.
Cloud: Night.
Biggs: Night. And thanks. Really.
Cloud: She's probably asleep.
On-screen: Go to sleep?
Tifa: Cloud?
Cloud: Yeah.
Tifa: You were out for a while.
Cloud: Just walking.
"Tifa: I ran into Johnny, by the way. Said not to worry, he was getting out of town."
"Cloud: Oh, that guy."
"Tifa: You...weren't thinking of leaving Midgar anytime soon, were you?"
"Cloud: Well, seems this old friend of mine's in a tight spot... Long time ago I said I'd be there for her. Made a promise, so..."
Tifa: Can't say this is quite what I had in mind when I put that on you way back when.
"Cloud: If you wanna talk, I'm listening."
Tifa: Huh? What's with you all of a sudden?
Cloud: With me?
Tifa: Like you're losing that hard edge.
Cloud: That bad?
Tifa: Not at allI like it. Maybe Marlene won't be so scared of you next time...
"Tifa: (chuckles) I'm really glad to have you back, Cloud. Really glad."
"Tifa: It's pretty late, huh? I'd like to catch up more, but we should probably both get some sleep, yeah?"
Cloud: Yeah.
Tifa: Good night then.
"Cloud: Good night, Tifa..."
Tifa: Cloud!
Cloud: What's wrong?
Tifa: Come with me! Quickly!
Tifa: We were getting ready to set out when those things showed up and came after us!
Cloud: The others?
"Tifa: Barret and Jessie are holding their ground, but for how long I don't know..."
Cloud: Let's go.
Tifa: Right.
Cloud: Ready?
Tifa: You know it!
Cloud: Let's head for the bar.
Tifa: Okay!
Cloud: Is this even working?
Cloud: We kill it?
Cloud: There's no end to this.
Tifa: What are these things?
Cloud: No idea. Pretty sure you can't even see them unless they make physical contact first...
Tifa: And that's all you can tell me?
Cloud: I can tell you they're not invincible.
Tifa: I guess that's something.
Tifa: More of them!? We're running out of time.
Cloud: Any other way?
Tifa: Yeahover here!
Cloud: Again?
Tifa: Are they trying to stop us from reaching the others?
Tifa: Cloud. This way.
"Tifa: Oh, you gotta be kidding me. It's like trying to fight a hurricane."
Cloud: Stay on your feet.
Tifa: You don't have to tell me that.
Jessie: Barret!
Barret: Gimme a break!
Tifa: Jessie! Barret!
Barret: Where you been!?
Jessie: They just keep coming! We've gotta do something!
Tifa: Hang on!
Cloud: Tifa!
Tifa: Cloud!
Cloud: I'm coming!
Cloud: Move!
On-screen: The enigmatic spectre is vulnerable.
Tifa: What is it doing now?
Cloud: Be careful.
"Tifa: So this thing's not gonna give up without a fight, huh?"
Barret: How's your ammo?
Jessie: Running low
Jessie: Shit!
Tifa: Jessie!
Barret: Dammit!
Tifa: Huh?
Cloud: The hell...?
Barret: Jessie!
Tifa: You okay?
Jessie: Me and my two left feet...
Tifa: Easy now!
Barret: We ain't putting on a damn show!
"Barret: The hell were those things? Some kind of...I dunno! Guess I shouldn't be surprised, though. Nevercantell what weird shit'll come crawling out of the scrap down here. It's those reactors, I'm telling you..."
Cloud: It hurt?
"Jessie: Wish I could say it didn't, but yeah... (chuckles)"
"Jessie: God, this is so embarrassing... Hate playing the damsel in distress..."
Cloud: It happens.
Wedge: What did you do to your leg!? D-does it hurt?
Jessie: Not nearly as much as the fuss everyone's making.
"Tifa: Still, I think you ought to avoid putting any"
Jessie: I'm fine!
"Barret: That's enough! You're out, Jessie."
"Jessie: Huh? What about the mission? We already sent Biggs in, remember? Don't tell me you're thinking of calling it off!?"
"Barret: Nah, we got this..."
Jessie: The hell you do!
"Wedge: If you need someone to step up, I'm your man! (coughs)"
Barret: Okay... So here's the thing...
Cloud: I'm gonna need a raise.
Barret: Consider it done!
"Barret: Aight, everyoneCloud's in. The mission is on!"
"Jessie: Go and raise some hell for me, okay?"
"Barret: Listen, WedgeI need you to hang back and guard the home front."
Wedge: But I'm in perfect health!
Barret: Which makes you the perfect choice to look after Jessie and Marlene.
"Barret: Let's get this show on the road... to Mako Reactor 5! Once you've got your gear in order, head to the station for the meet. Got it?"
"Barret: This'll help you get squared away. Don't tell me I never did nothing for ya. I'm counting on you, SOLDIER boy..."
"Wedge: Ah, forgot to give this to you, bro. Your prize for taking the top spot on the darts leaderboard. You earned it. After you guys come back from the plate, maybe we can play a round together?"
Jessie: Relegated to stagehand once again. I'm starting to think I'll never have a starring role...
Cloud: There's always next time.
"Jessie: What's this? Words of encouragement? (chuckles) Thanks, I need them."
"(Upon talking to Jessie again if the player selected ""No promises"" in response to her on the previous day. After this, her usual lines will repeat.)Jessie: Hurry back now. You don't want my home-cooked pizza to get cold."
"Tifa: Alright, let's get going."
Cloud: Sure...afteryou take a deep breath.
Tifa: Huh?
Cloud: I can tell you're nervous.
"Tifa: That obvious, huh?"
Tifa: Okay. I'm ready now.
New Recruit: Sir... I got my hands on tickets for theLovelessmusical. Would you like to go with me?
"Senior Officer: You do realize, we're on duty. The slums are Avalanche territory. Stay sharp."
"New Recruit: Right. Sorry, sir! It's just that...never mind."
"New Recruit: I heard they've deployed SOLDIER operatives, too. It's been a while since they'd done that. I wanted to be a SOLDIER, but as you can see"
Senior Officer: Cut the chatter. We're working!
"New Recruit: Right! Sorry, sir."
"Senior Officer: You're not Avalanche, are you?"
New Recruit: Oh man... A bomb threat? I'm not ready for this...
Senior Officer: Seen anything suspicious?
New Recruit: I don't know who's scarierAvalanche or my superior.
Chadley: Cloud. You have exceeded my expectations.
"Barret: Alright, people. Mission starts the moment we board that train. You sure you ready for this?"
On-screen: Get on the train?
"Barret: Well then, what're you waiting for!? Finish up so we can get going."
Tifa: Do you think Biggs is...on schedule?
Barret: All we can do is hope...
"Cloud: Today really gotta be the day, huh?"
"Barret: Ain't no stopping this train we're on, son. A lotta people risked their lives to get it rolling... Already put the word out more's coming, too... ""Shut them all down by today, or we shut another down for you."" Ain't on us. Not us..."
Barret: Play it cool.
"Announcement: This is an announcement from the Shinra Electric Power Company. The terrorist group ""Avalanche"" has issued another bomb threat. In response, we have raised the threat level and entered a state of heightened alert. All lines are currently experiencing delays. We anticipate that our arrival at Sector 4 will be later than scheduled."
"Barret: The target's Mako Reactor 5. From the station, we take the backstreets. Once we're inside the facility, it's the same deal as last time."
Cloud: Head for mako storage.
Barret: And thenblowit all to hell.
Barret: Let's do this one for Jessie and Wedge. They deserve it.
Tifa: Yeah.
Cloud: Sure.
Tifa: I didn't think word would spread this fast. There's barely anyone on this train. And none of them look happy to be here.
Barret: Might stand out as a group. You two stay here.
Tifa: Cloud.
Announcement: The train will be passing an ID checkpoint shortly.
Tifa: Here comes the first hurdle...
Cloud: Not much of one.
"Tifa: I know, I know. But that doesn't mean I don't have butterflies in my stomach."
"Tifa: Hey, would you mind keeping an eye on things the next car over? I'm worried there might be trouble."
Cloud: Why's that?
"Tifa: Barret's always on edge before missions, but you know he's a good guy underneath it all. The people on this train don't."
Cloud: He'll be fine.
Tifa: Maybe...but I won't be until I know for sure.
Cloud: (sighs) Be right back.
Tifa: Thanks.
"Shinra Middle Manager: So do youstillsupport those terrorists? Avalanche is a blight on Midgar. Their bomb threat has thrown our offices into chaos, let alone the reactor itself. It's total insanity! But we won't lose heart! No! Everyone at Shinra agrees. The reactor will stay online!"
Barret: Heh. Is that right?
Shinra Middle Manager: What? You got a problem with that?
"Barret: Do I have aproblemwith that? Oh, you can bet"
Cloud: He doesn't.
Barret: Hmph. Asshole...
Cloud: You know you're better than that.
"Barret: (hums ""Victory Fanfare"")"
Announcement: Emergency ID scan in progress.
Tifa: No way!
"Announcemnet: Unauthorized IDs detected. Threat level: critical. Inspection and containment sweep initiated, commencing at the rear of the train."
Tifa: Not good!
Barret: Get over here! Now!
Passenger: What the hell!?
"Tifa: Take care of them, Cloud!"
Cloud: On it.
Annoincement: Lockdown protocol initiated. This train car will enter lockdown in three minutes.
Tifa: You have to get to the next car!
"Barret: Keep moving, people!"
NPC: Whadda we do!?
Barret: Get to car two!
NPC: I...I can't...
Barret: You wanna survive this? Then move!
NPC: Y-y-yessir!
Tifa: Cloud!
Barret: Move it!
Announcement: Lockdown protocol initiated. This train will enter lockdown shortly.
Announcement: Lockdown complete. One unauthorized passenger detained. Inspection will continue until all unauthorized passengers are detained.
Cloud: Dammit.
Tifa: Just go! How many are there!?
Announcement: Three unauthorized passengers successfully contained. Neutralizing threat.
Barret: We gotta jump...
On-screen: Corkscrew Tunnel
Cloud: Tifa... Barret...
Tifa: Please! You have to get out of here!
Shinra Middle Manager: Whwhat are you doing!?
Tifa: Trying to keep you alive.
Shinra Middle Manager: But I work for Shinra. I'm the enemy.
Tifa: I don't care. I don't want anyone to die. Please!
Shinra Middle Manager: I'll look after the others.
Tifa: My turn!
Cloud: There's no end to them...
Announcement: Three unauthorized passengers successfully contained. Neutralizing threat.
"Barret: Looks like you're right, SOLDIER boy."
Cloud: Screw this.
Barret: Huh?
Cloud: The station will be crawling with security. We gotta jump.
Barret: Screwthat!
Cloud: Need to slow the train down.
Barret: Sounds like a Biggs plan E.
"Barret: Okay, y'all watch and learn. I'm gonna jump. Gonna do it. Gonna show you how it's done!"
Cloud: Tifa!
On-screen: Corkscrew Tunnel.
Cloud: You okay?
Tifa: Yeah...
"Cloud: Alright, you ready?"
Tifa: Ready.
Barret (in the distance): Ha ha ha!
Tifa: That's gotta be him!
"Tifa: Hey, thanks. For when we jumped from the train, I mean."
"Cloud: No biggie. You're pretty light, you know."
Tifa: You always know what to say.
Barret (in the distance): Ha ha ha!
Cloud: Where are they?
Cloud: Tifa!
Tifa: They just won't quit!
Barret (in the distance): Ha ha ha!
Tifa: Whew! Thanks for the assist!
Cloud: Glad to see you're okay. Sowhere's Barret?
"Tifa: Somewhere over there, I think."
"Tifa: After Barret jumped, I knew I had to go right after, but..."
Cloud: Don't worry about it.
"Tifa: Cool as ever, I see."
"Cloud: If I wasn't, they would've never made me a SOLDIER."
Tifa: Good point.
"Heidegger: (laughs) Well done, well done! I felt sure we had them, didn't you?"
Subordinate: Sir!
"Heidegger: Born survivors, these sewer rats. Speaking of which, where's the third?"
"Subordinate: In custody, sir."
Heidegger: Return it to the wild.
Subordinate: Yessir! Right away!
On-screen: Corkscrew Tunnel - Section C
Security Officer: It's them! We have a visual on the targets! Requesting immediate assistance!
Tifa: He's close! Come on!
Tifa: There! Barret!
Barret: Tifa! Could use some help here!
Tifa: We're coming!
Barret: Make it quick! Should be some stairs over there!
Tifa: We'd better hurry.
Cloud: Yeah.
Barret: I've had it up to here with you damn robo-bugs! I'm gonna rip off those spindly legs of yours one by one!
Barret: I ain't going down without a fight!
Tifa: That doesn't sound good!
Cloud: Let's go.
Tifa: Barret!
Barret: Great! Gimme a hand!
Grenadier: Confirmed! It's the three who jumped from the train! Don't let any of them escape!
"Barret: This calls for a song! Duhn-duhn-duhn-duhn, duhn duhn,duhn-da-duhn!"
Tifa: That's gotta be the last of them...right?
"Barret: Aw, who cares? We can take 'em! Now let's confirm our position and get back on mission! That reactor's waiting!"
Barret: Looks like it's gonna be plan E.
Cloud: Go on.
"Barret: Plan A was if everything went off without a stitch. From the station, it would've been a straight shot to the reactor. Didn't work out, but we knew going in we had to have alternatives. Backup plans, 'case we had to get off early."
"Barret: From closer in to further outB, C, D, and so on."
Cloud: Up to what?
Tifa: ... To E.
Cloud: Lucky us...
Barret: (laughs) You're damn right!
"Tifa: Anyway, we were riding the train between Sector 4 and the main pillar when we had to bail out. And we ended up on the adjacent line, which should take us to Reactor 5."
"Barret: That's right. So for now we follow the tracks. Not too far, though. Need to switch to a different route before we hit the station. 'Cause you can bet your ass it's gonna be crawling with securityall on high alert."
Tifa: Let's move.
"Barret: Our friends in Sector 5 marked the route, so don't worry about getting lost. It's a straight shot to victory, people! All we gotta do...istakeit!"
"Heidegger: You have nothing to worry about, sir. Preparations for the grand finale are proceeding without incident. I have the utmost confidence that everything will play out as you intended..."
"Heidegger: Yes, of course. I will not fail you, sir."
"Subordinate: Sir. Analytics reports that the results fall within the admissible range. However, the casualty rate significantly exceeds previous proje"
Heidegger: (groans) Remind me what your job is. Is it to question the wisdom of your superiors and bemoan your personal hardships?
Subordinate: Sir?
"Heidegger: Casualty rate? You think I care about the casualty rate? They are pawns in a greater game. If your stock runs low, then go round up more for Sector 3 or wherever else. Use your head and bring me solutions instead of problems for a change, yes?"
Subordinate: Sir!
Heidegger: It is so hard to find good help these days. Which is why the president ought to count his blessings. What would he do without me? (laughs)
On-screen: Corkscrew Tunnel - Section C
Tifa: The reactor's the other way.
Barret: You got any sense of direction at all?
"Barret: You wanna keep going this way, you best explain yourself."
Tifa: I think the reactor's in the other direction.
"Barret: When the time comes, remember: we just gotta follow the nose."
Cloud: What?
Tifa: Stamp's nose.
"Barret: We look for graffiti, then head in whichever direction its nose points. But pay attention to railway signals too. You see blue lights, you're going the right way."
Barret: Follow the blue lights and we'll reach the reactor.
"Barret: You gotta check the signals, son. The signals!"
"Barret: Biggs is way ahead of us. Jessie was gonna back him up, so it wouldn't surprise me if he needs our help. So let's not keep him waiting."
Tifa: Right.
Elite Grenadier: You're not going anywhere!
Barret: There's one.
Barret: The hell you off to?
Barret: In nose we trust.
"Tifa: Good things our colleagues put up all that Stamp graffiti. Without it, we'd be lost for sure."
Tifa: What's that?
Barret: Nothing good.
Tifa: Guys...I think it might be a nest!
"Barret: All kinds of creepy-crawlies make themselves at home in the plate, then get messed up even more by the mako."
Tifa: Mako did this?
Barret: No. Not mako. Shinra.
Barret: What?
Cloud: That black-and-white world of yours.
"Barret: Ya like it, huh? You know there's room for one more."
Cloud: I'll think about it.
Barret: That's disgusting!
Tifa: More of 'em!?
Barret: What is this? A science experiment!?
Barret: What now!?
Tifa: It's huge!
"Barret: So you must be the queen, huh!?"
Barret: I ain't no exterminator. Why I gotta kill all these nasty-ass bugs?
Tifa: Those things really creep me out.
Barret: A train's gonna get derailed by 'em one of these days.
Tifa: Shinra should do something.
Barret: After an accident they will.
Tifa: When it's too late then.
Barret: There's good ol' Stamp. Check his nose.
"Tifa: This isn't bad, y'know..."
"Barret: Yeah, they really captured the essence of corporate propaganda."
Tifa: Check it out. I guess Shinra's doing something about those monsters after all.
Barret: Doing a half-assed job looks like.
"Security Officer: Man, how'd we get such a shit detail?"
Flametrooper: Screw it. Let's just give it a quick once-over and call it a day.
Security Officer: How did you get in here!?
Security Officer: It's those three terrorists from the train!
Barret: Alright. Let's figure out where the hell we are.
Barret: Where you going!?
Barret: There's an old rail yard not far from here. What we're looking for's somewhere inside.
Cloud: And that is...?
Barret: A secret passageway.
Subordinate: We've compiled our report on Avalanche's combat capabilities and are
"Heidegger: Report, report, report! What good do you think a damn report will do anyone!?"
Subordinate: I don't...
"Heidegger: Have you already forgotten the war with Wutai? An enemy spared is an enemy who will repay your ""kindness"" with blood. We must crush themthoroughly and completely, without hesitation or mercy! Shinra cannot and will not settle for anything less. Will you!?"
Subordinate: But...but sir
Heidegger: If so...I can only assume that you and your men no longer wish to serve in your current positions. Is that correct?
"Subordinate: We'll prepare the prototype in Section E for immediate deployment. Right now, dammit!"
"Heidegger: Another day, another victory! How do I do it!? (laughs)"
On-screen: Corkscrew Tunnel - Section E
Barret: Gotta love the irony of Shinra's smarmy lapdog leading the way to its master's destruction.
Security Officer: Intruders!
"Barret: We're going to the rail yard, remember?"
"Tifa: Just so you know, this way leads to the station, not the rail yard."
Barret: I told you this ain't the right way!
"Tifa: You really don't like Stamp, do you, Barret?"
Barret: It's not that I hate him. I hate the fact Shinra took a loyal animal like that and co-opted it for their own self-serving agenda.
Tifa: Poor old Stamp.
Barret: Starting to remind me of one Marlene's picture books. The one that's full of nothing but mazes...
Tifa: Think you're making progress and then you hit a wall.
Cloud: Knock it down.
Tifa: You're starting to sound like Barret.
Cloud: Never mind.
Barret: It's a good plan!
On-screen: Corkscrew Tunnel - Rail Yard
Barret: Hey! Hold up! This way.
Tifa: Security is a lot tighter than I thought it would be.
"Barret: If they wanna stand between us and the rail yard, that's their choice."
Flametrooper: Get 'em!
Flametrooper: You bastards aren't going to get away this time!
Barret: No getting through that gate! Let's take the stairs.
"Barret: We should be reaching that secret passage real soon. I knew plan E wouldn't fail us. Shoulda called it ""plan excellent""! Whatcha think, Mister Ex-SOLDIER?"
"Cloud: Biggs made the plan, right?"
Barret: I provided some input.
Cloud: Hope not too much.
Barret: What's that s'posed to mean?
Tifa: Thought this place was abandoned.
Barret: Guess not.
"Elite Security Officer: Give it up, assholes, or we'll blow you to hell!"
Elite Security Officer: Surrender!
Tifa: So many guards.
Barret: Too many...
Barret: Keep looking for faithful little Stamp. He'll lead us to the passageway.
Cloud: This it?
Cloud: Get back!
Tifa: What the!?
Barret: That all you got!?
Cloud: Someone's mad.
"Barret: Take your best shot, asshole!"
Cloud: Huh. Looks like an old model.
Barret: So it's an antique.
"Cloud: Don't underestimate it. It's slow, but it hits hard."
Barret: The hell!? Tough bastard.
Tifa: What do we do?
Cloud: Aim for its legs. Bring it down.
"Barret: I think you've got its attention, Cloud!"
Cloud: I'll draw its fire. You two stay on the offensive.
Tifa: I think it hates me.
"Barret: Hah, look at that! It's tough being Mr. Popular."
Tifa: Not again!
Right Front Leg: You crippled the right front leg.
Right Rear Leg: You crippled the right rear leg.
Left Front Leg: You crippled the left front leg.
Left Rear Leg: You crippled the left rear leg.
"Tifa: Hey, see that?"
Cloud: That's its hearta mako generator.
Barret: I'm guessin' we aim for that!
Tifa: What are those?
Cloud: More drones.
Tifa: Get out of our way!
Cloud: Bastards.
Barret: Damn! Think we gotta take these down first.
Barret: This is where I shine!
Barret: That it!?
Tifa: Now what?
Cloud: Could be a system error.
Barret: Thing's probably busted!
Barret: What's it doing now?
Tifa: I think
Cloud: Get away from the tracks!
Cloud: It can electrify the tracks.
Cloud: Watch out for the surge!
Barret: Shit! It's still going!
Tifa: Now what?
Cloud: Destroy the pilot! That'll expose the generator!
Cloud: All clear.
Barret: And stay down!
Cloud: Let's go.
Tifa: Sure.
"Barret: Alright, this way."
Heidegger: This won't do.
"Subordinate: Sir, Analytics reports that the feed went down...after an anomaly was registered during the test."
"Heidegger: An ""anomaly""? Or an excuse for your failure to properly prepare the armor?"
Subordinate: N-no sir! All modules were confirmed fully operational! It's far more likelygiven the circumstancesthat the sensors were overloaded.
Heidegger: Is that so?
Subordinate: All the sensors in Section E are...inoperable.
Subordinate: The president.
"Heidegger: Yes... Yes... Everything is fine, sir. Better, eventhere's been a development."
"Heidegger: Yes... Understood, sir."
"Heidegger: We know exactly where they were headed. If the armor is intact, then you'd best determine the nature of this anomaly soon. Should you fail to do so... You will deal with our intruders. Personally."
Subordinate: ...Y-yessir.
Heidegger: Don't worry. I treat my people more than fairly. So don't disappoint me.
Barret: The passage is beyond these shipping containers. Let's slip through 'em.
Barret: Talk about a tight squeeze...
Tifa: You okay?
Barret: Yeah...
"Tifa: So, you bump into any giant robots like that in Reactor 1?"
"Barret: Yeah, except the bastard looked like a scorpion! Speaking of which...what would you say that last one looked like?"
Tifa: Huh? Uh... Well...
Cloud: Looks dead now.
On-screen: Service Tunnel
Barret: Lo and behold.
Barret: All aboard...
Barret: Just so you know...it's not gonna get any easier.
Cloud: When did it ever?
Barret: Through here and straight on to Reactor 5.
Tifa: You make it sound so simple...
Barret: Only 'cause it is. That there's the reactor support pillar.
Cloud: So what's the plan?
"Barret: After plan E comes F, G, and then H!"
Cloud: Thought E was the last.
Tifa: This here is Section F.
Barret: We cut through Section G and head for H.
Tifa: A cargo platform in H will get us closer to the reactor. Biggs should be somewhere over there.
Tifa: Looks like the sun's going down on Midgar...
Barret: Right. Double time! We got a date with a reactor.
On-screen: Sector 4 Plate
Barret: Nothing but air below us.
Cloud: Shut up and move.
"Tifa: Just don't look down, okay?"
Barret: Easy for you to say.
"Barret: Section G's through here, huh?"
Cloud: This a switch for the lamp?
Tifa: This oughta open it.
Tifa: No good?
"Cloud: Needs power, I think."
Barret: That looks more like what we need...
Cloud: Control room.
Tifa: Let's check it out.
Barret: Hey. You see something over there?
Tifa: Maybe the gate didn't budge because there's not enough power to spare?
Barret: Gotta figure this out.
Tifa: Maybe no one uses that entrance.
Barret: I'm getting the feeling no one's come down here for a long time.
"Tifa: No ""plate inspectors,"" huh."
Announcement: Error. Insufficient power.
Cloud: Of course.
"Tifa: Hey guys, look at this. Instructions for dealing with a power shortage."
"Cloud: Kill the lights, and we free up power for the gate and other stuff."
"Tifa: ""Sun lamps""... You think these are the plate suns? The closest thing we have to the real thing."
"Barret: Gotta put out a sun just to open a gate, huh?"
"Tifa: But if we go through with it, the grounders in Sector 4 will suffer..."
Barret: Now or latersun's going out for good once we blow the reactor.
Tifa: That's true.
Cloud: Let's go.
Tifa: All these lamps... You'd think they'd be able to balance the load by now though.
Barret: Maybe. If the maintenance guys or whoever weren't playing hooky.
"Tifa: The lamps are important, but when you think about how much mako it must take to keep them running..."
"Tifa: That's gotta be one. Man, look at the size of it."
"Barret: That a console I see near the top of that ladder? A, uh, pretty tall ladder too."
Cloud: I'll go.
Tifa: Okay. We'll wait down here.
Console: Emergency power supply confirmed. Disengaging locking mechanisms.
Barret: Okay! That's that.
"Tifa: Great job, Cloud!"
Barret: Next stop: Section G!
"Tifa: Yep! And after that, Reactor 5!"
Tifa: Not again...
"Barret: Great. I'm sure those things'll welcome us just as warmly as before. Tell you what, the rot runs deep in this damn pizza."
On-screen: Section G - Middle Level
"Barret: Don't mind us, y'alljust passing through!"
Cloud: If only.
Cloud: No way to cross that.
Tifa: Gotta go where the catwalks take us.
Tifa: They busted?
"Cloud: Powered down, is my guess."
"Barret: Lucky us, am I right? One less thing for us to worry about."
Barret: Filling the air that we gotta breathe with their shit.
Tifa: Monsters sure seem to like it. What's up with that?
Barret: It's like in the tunnels. They get twisted by the mako. But it all goes back to Shinra.
On-screen: Section G - Lower Level
Barret: You know the best way to not get lost is to believe that you're not. Mind over matter.
Tifa: Isn't that from one of Marlene's books?
"Barret: Yup, one of her favorites! Loves it when I read it to her before bedtime, doing all the voices."
"Tifa: ""Life in the Endless Maze,"" am I right? (chuckles) I remember."
Tifa: You okay?
Cloud: Yeah.
"Barret: Hah. Going for that materia, weren't you?"
"Tifa: So close, and yet so far. This path's no good now."
Barret: I'm sure there's another way to get there.
Tifa: Hm... Nothing we can do but search.
"Barret: And when we find it, we can finally snag that materia."
On-screen: Section G - Upper Level
"Tifa: Hey, let's take a moment to get our bearings."
"Barret: We're still in G, right?"
"Tifa: Yeah. And to reach Mako Reactor 5, we need to go through Section H."
Cloud: Okay.
"Tifa: Unfortunately, I didn't spot a connecting catwalk to Section H. Did you?"
"Barret: Well, we can always do another lap."
"Cloud: Go for ten, why don'tcha."
Tifa: The only other route that I can think of would be...
Cloud: Along the wall.
"Tifa: Up for giving it a try? It might not work out, but it's the only idea I've got."
Cloud: It's not a bad one.
Barret: So we're shooting for those giant fans over there? Okay. At least we've got a clear landmark to guide us.
Tifa: Those ventilation fans?
Barret: Keeping the plate's air clean by pushing the smog into the slums. Whole system's designed to make shit roll downhill faster.
Tifa: You lost?
"Tifa: Hey, look! I think we can climb onto that pipe!"
Cloud: Sure seems that way.
Barret: Dammit.
"Barret: I feel no fear...yeah, no fear...no fear...no fear...no fear...no fearlittle fear!"
"Barret: Hey guys, uh...you know, these fans are really loud and..."
Cloud: You chickening out?
Barret: Hell no! I'm just worried that your bony ass is gonna get blown off the side and shit!
Tifa: Enough. We gotta keep moving.
Barret: O-okay then! Follow me!
"Barret: No worse than a windy day, huh?"
Tifa: One with a tornado warning maybe. Don't look at the fan! Whatever you do!
Barret: Right.
Tifa: Made it through in one piece.
"Barret: Think that took a couple years off my life. II mean, uh, not really! Couple seconds maybe. Three tops!"
"Tifa: Section H is just up ahead! Slow and steady, guys."
Cloud: And that's our objective?
"Tifa: The cargo platform? Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's the one."
"Tifa: Hey, what's that behind the fan over there?"
Cloud: Isn't that
Barret: Hey! Don't be a dumbass! Tifa told you not to look at the fan!
On-screen: Section H - Sun Lamp 1
Barret: This is it. The cargo platform Biggs was talking about. Let's not keep him waiting.
Announcement: Error. Insufficient power.
Barret: You're kidding me.
"Cloud: Needs three light's worth, looks like."
"Tifa: But that's... That's all of them, isn't it?"
Barret: All or nothing...
Tifa: Let's regroup here if we get lost. Remember the H-01 sign.
Cloud: Right.
Barret: Lessee now... Closest light oughta be...
Cloud: That one.
"Tifa: ""By the light of these magnificent lamps... we shall lead our brothers and sisters of the undercity to a brighter future."""
Barret: Say what?
Tifa: It's from a speech President Shinra gave talking about the importance of the sun lamps.
"Barret: Brighter future, my ass. Shinra's leading us down a one-way path to darkness and death."
Announcement: Error. Insufficient power.
Cloud: Gotta power down a sun lamp first.
Tifa: Look! There's the switch.
Barret: Let's flip it and go.
Announcement: Rerouting power. Please wait.
Tifa: That's one down.
Barret: Only two more lights to go.
Announcement: Reinitializing intrusion prevention system.
"Tifa: ""Intrusion prevention""?"
Cloud: Back online 'cause of us.
"Barret: No need to fret, y'all. A few rusted mechs ain't gonna keep us from reaching the reactor."
Announcement: Intruders detected. Engaging countermeasures.
"Cloud: Mid-range turrets, huh?"
"Barret: Hey, Cloud! Hang back while I deal with these pests."
Tifa: Just made our lives a lot harder.
"Cloud: We restored power to more than just security, remember?"
Tifa: We can move this catwalk!
Barret: Think back. Anybody see a connecting catwalk?
On-screen: Section H - Sun Lamp 2
Barret: Which way to the next light?
Tifa: If we can't make sense of this place we're gonna get lost.
Barret: Well at least we know where the big-ass things are.
Barret: And that makes two lights down.
Tifa: Meaning we've only got one left.
"Barret: The end's in sight, y'all!"
Cloud: Should be able to climb down from here.
"Barret: This'll hold, right?"
Cloud: That the Sector 4 slums down there?
Tifa: Huh? You wanna check them out sometime? I can show you around.
Barret: We'll check them out now if we fall!
Tifa: You think they'll miss those three plate suns?
Barret: I say the real sun's the only one we need! To hell with Shinra and their night-lights.
Tifa: We're right back where we started. Hmm... Where was that last light again?
On-screen: Section H - Sun Lamp 3
Tifa: Almost done. It's a shame we had to wander around so much.
Barret: Well. No Stamps here to guide us. No Jessie or Wedge to back us up neither.
"Tifa: Yeah... Speaking of which, what should we tell Biggs? I don't want him to worry."
"Barret: Uhh, you takin' a detour? Well, aight then."
"Barret: If there's no viable path, we'll just have to make one."
Tifa: And that makes three. Enough to finally get our cargo platform moving.
Cloud: Better be.
Barret: Okay! Let's head on back to the H-01 sign.
Tifa: I hope that Jessie's injury isn't anything serious.
Barret: The best thing you can do to speed her recovery is to kick Shinra ass in her stead.
Tifa: I know. I know. And Cloud's gotta cover for Wedge too.
Cloud: When do we link up with Biggs?
"Barret: Soon enough, don't you worry."
"Tifa: He knew we might be late, so he came up with a few ways to kill time."
Barret: Oughta reach him long before he dies of boredom.
Tifa: And we're back at the cargo platform.
"Barret: Get ready, Mako Reactor 5. We're coming."
Announcement: Auxiliary power supply confirmed. Reactivating cargo platform.
Announcement: Cargo platform activated. Awaiting input.
"Barret: So long, underplate. I hate you too."
Announcement: Error. Insufficient power.
Tifa: We need to disable a lamp first.
Barret: Where could they be going...? Embarking on an adventure to find some treasure!?
Announcement: Ventilation system service mode active. Access maintenance terminal to complete procedure.
Cloud: Does this control the fans?
Tifa: We stop it?
Announcement: Switching ventilation system to maintenance mode. Please complete the maintenance access procedure within the designated time limit.
"Barret: Man, what are we even doing?"
Announcement: Error. Error. Maintenance access procedure not completed within time limit. Reactivating ventilation system.
Announcement: Access denied. Ventilation system is currently active.
Announcement: Access granted. Disengaging time lock.
Cloud: Okay.
Barret: What?
Barret: This is summoning materia!
Tifa: Wow...
Barret: What kind of badass will pop outta this one?
Cloud: We'll see.
Tifa: Wonder what the reactor's like.
Barret: Dark. Dismal. A slaughterhouse where they butcher the planet. Then there's the smell. The mako. Be ready for it.
Tifa: Right...
"Barret: Hear that, guys? It's the reactor calling us. Beckoning us, saying ""Bring it on, Avalanche."""
"Tifa: Even after all that fighting, no one's coming for us?"
Cloud: No need. This is Shinra's city. They probably have cameras everywhere.
Tifa: Why didn't you say something sooner?
Cloud: Way too late to bail now.
"Barret: It's like walking a tightrope. When you're on it, only two ways off."
Tifa: Better keep my balance.
Cloud: You'd be good at it.
Tifa: I wonder.
On-screen: Interplate Utility Access
Cloud: Tifa?
Tifa: It's nothing. Just thinking about the next step. Didn't think I'd be this nervous.
Barret: Some things you never get used to.
Tifa: Yeah.
Biggs: Mercy!
Biggs: Wait... Cloud? Where's Jessie and Wedge?
Barret: Report.
"Biggs: Topside's going nuts after some terrorists jumped off a train. Nice and quiet here, though. So quiet I had no trouble securing your route into the reactor."
"Barret: You magnificent son of a bitch, bring it in!"
Biggs: Sowhere are the others?
Tifa: Jessie got hurt and couldn't make it.
Biggs: Bad?
Barret: Not so bad she couldn't rope in this guy.
Biggs: Thanks for stepping up.
Cloud: It's a jump.
"Biggs: Worked out pretty good, you picking that train you did. While Shinra scours Sector 4... You can waltz right on into Sector 5. It's a bit of a squeeze, but it ought to get you where you need to go."
Barret: Little dark and foreboding for my taste...
"Biggs: Beggars can't be choosers. Ohand you'll be needing your grappling guns, of course. All set?"
Barret: Ready to take on the world and then some!
"Tifa: Make sure everyone gets clear, okay?"
Biggs: Will do!
"Barret: Okay, y'all. Keep these grappling guns close. Secure 'em to your belt or whatever so you don't lose 'em. When we're done, we'll be using these babies to get down safe. All of us."
Cloud: Got it.
Security Officer: More to the left. Left! Hurry it up!
Security Officer: Fix those lights!
"NPC: Excuse me, sir. Your tie?"
Heidegger: Quickly now. Quickly!
On-screen: Mako Reactor 5 - Interior
Barret: That's it. That's the smell. This place reeks of mako.
Tifa: Looks like we made it.
Barret: Layout's the same as Reactor 1?
Cloud: Yeah. We're near mako storage.
Barret: Let's move.
Barret: I'm not seeing a way down...
Tifa: Here maybe?
Barret: Well now! That could work.
Barret: I'm next.
"Tifa: Kinda scary, huh?"
Cloud: S'all in the mind.
"Barret: Hey! Check it out. They sic this big boy on us, we'd be screwed six ways from Sunday."
"Cloud: Mechanized units like these were designed to take out giant monsters. Probably a new prototype. If they do decide to deploy it, then our best bet would be to run like hell."
Barret: Then let's hope he sleeps through the explosion.
Tifa: Where is everybody?
"Barret: You mean Shinra? Got spooked and cleared out, is my guess."
Tifa: Almost there...
Tifa: The smell... It takes me back...
Tifa: Guys!
"Barret: Well, well! What we got here!?"
Cloud: Turrets up top.
Barret: I can deal with those things!
Tifa: So...it was like this last time?
Barret: Little more chaoticain't that right?
Cloud: Yeah.
On-screen: Sector 5 Reactor - Core
Tifa (in flashback): Sephiroth... SOLDIERs... Mako... Shinra...
Tifa (in flashback): I'm sick of this! I'm sick of all of this!
Barret: Hey! SOLDIER boy!
Cloud: Tifa
Tifa: What?
Cloud: How much time we need?
Barret: Got all the time in the world. This one comes with a remote detonator.
Tifa: Courtesy of Jessie.
Barret: We withdraw to a safe distancethen...kaboom!
"Cloud: ""Safe"" distance?"
Barret: What? No such thing?
Barret: We get out the same way we got in. Let's double back.
Barret: What theWhere you goin'!?
Cloud: Weirdly perfect timing.
Tifa: Wait a minute. Is someone watching us?
"Heidegger: (laughs) Greetings, my dear sewer rats! As architect of our populace engagement campaign, I, Heidegger, head of Public Security... bid you welcome."
Barret: The chief warmonger.
"Heidegger: You should be flattered. Right now, you command the undivided attention of every soul in Midgar."
Tifa: What is this!?
"Announcer: Breaking news from Mako Reactor 5. Shinra has confirmed the reactor to be the target of the bomb threat issued by the terrorist group Avalanche. Members of the group were observed entering the facility, and security is currently sweeping it for explosive devices. We now go live to the scene..."
Reporter: I'm here in the Sector 5 undercity. Having confirmed the terrorists' target... the Shinra Emergency Operations Center has issued an evacuation advisory. Residents are outraged that the tragedy of Mako Reactor 1 was only the first attack... in a campaign of violence.
NPC: No more bombings! No more bombings!
Announcer: President Shinra has issued a statement providing assurances that the terrorists will soon be brought to justice.
"Heidegger: And so, to a people beset by chaos and uncertainty, we will offer the finest comfort: bread and circus!"
Barret: The big boy!
Heidegger: I give you Shinra's latest triumph of technology! The airbuster! Your executioner! (laughs)
"Subordinate: Engineering on the line. Currently, the airbuster is only sixty percent operational. The estimates were optimistic..."
Heidegger: I'm on air!
Heidegger: To the imbecile in charge down thereyou are hereby ordered to seize those intruders and bring them to me!
Elite Shock Trooper: Come quietly or there'll be trouble!
Barret: Shhh.
Heidegger: Attention all security forces! I repeatyou are to bring the insurgents to the command center without further delay. What's Engineering's progress on getting that airbuster operational?
"Heidegger: ...Still only sixty percent!? Bullshit! I swear, if you fail me, I'll throw you off the plate myself! So get it done already!"
Barret: Shut the hell up!
Tifa: I don't believe it... We played right into Shinra's hands!
Barret: Yeah. And their bullshit news is already peddling their false narrative.
Tifa: So we're screwed.
Barret: No no no no no! Hell no! Listen! They wanna turn this into a spectacle? Then I say let's give 'em one! Let's take down Shinra's big-ass mech in front of everybody!
Cloud: Okay. I'm sold.
On-screen: Mako Reactor 5 - Assembly Plant
Security Officer (1): You heard the man! Get these components prepped for the airbuster ASAP!
"Security Officer (2): It's ready, sir!"
Security Officer (1): Component outbound from B8.
"Engineering Officer: Copy, B8."
Security Officer (1): Intruders!
Security Officer (2): Take 'em out!
Barret: All clear! Now let's see what these bastards were up to...
"Tifa: Barret, Cloud! Over here!"
Barret: Huh? Find something?
Cloud: Keycard. Might come in handy.
Barret: You think!? Nice work!
"Tifa: You really that impatient, Cloud?"
Tifa: It looks like a few of its components are still in transit...
Barret: (chuckles) We'll see about that.
Cloud: Could tamper a little with its loadout...
Tifa: And give ourselves an edge?
Cloud: There should be a console somewhere...
Barret: This the console you talking about?
Barret: Think you can get it to work?
Cloud: Needs a keycard.
"Barret: Well, let's find it then!"
Barret: Try that keycard of yours.
Tifa: You find it?
Cloud: Yeah.
"Barret: Good job! Now, let's check out that console."
"Tifa: ""M units,"" huh? I'm guessing that's some sort of component?"
Cloud: Yep. An enhancement powered by liquefied materia.
Barret: Sounds bad.
Cloud: Pretty sure I can divert this unit for disposal.
On-screen: Dispose of an M-unit? (Cost: 1 Keycard)
Barret: What the hell? You got a better plan or something?
Console: M unit flagged for disposal.
Tifa: So far so good.
Barret: Right. Let's move!
Tifa: You think they're watching us? Even now?
Cloud: Yep. Probably got a live feed.
Barret: Nothing we can do about it...'cept smile for the folks at home.
Security Officer: Component outbound from B7.
Engineering Officer: Copy. We've lost contact with B8. Send some men to check it out. We've got a schedule to keep!
"Security Officer: Intruders, size them!"
"Security Officer: Engineering, this is B7! We've got hostiles! Requesting backup!"
"Engineering Officer: Negative B7, airbuster prep is priority. You're on your own!"
Security Officer: Then we'll deal with you ourselves!
Tifa: Looks like there's two consoles this time.
Barret: Hah! Double the sabotage!
Cloud:Ifwe can find the keycards.
Tifa: Any cards?
Cloud: Just the one.
"Tifa: Two choices, and only one single-use card... It's up to you, Cloud."
Barret: Console talks about big bomber shells. You acquainted?
Cloud: We called 'em BBs. One's enough to blow you to hell and back.
Barret: Could divert them and give it a couple less shots to take out.
On-screen: Dispose of a big bomber shell? (Cost: 1 Keycard)
Console: Big bomber shell flagged for disposal.
"Tifa: What does an ""AI programming core"" do?"
Cloud: Increases processing power dedicated to motor function computation. Makes it move real quick.
"Tifa: A ""real quick"" giant robot, huh? That doesn't sound good. Anyway, we should weigh our options carefully."
On-screen: Dispose of a programming core? (Cost: 1 Keycard)
Console: Programming core flagged for disposal.
"Tifa: So, where did we send the discarded stuff?"
"Cloud: To a storeroom for defective equipment, I'm guessing."
Barret: That so... You think these defective shells and programming cores might be valuable enough to warrant a little...detour?
Cloud: Maybe.
Barret: I say we grab 'em.
Cloud: Hmph. If we get that far.
"Barret: Okay! Listen up, y'all! Everything Shinra has told you is a goddamn lie! Mako is the lifeblood of our planet! Those greedy bastards are bleeding it dry! Y'all gotta rise up"
Tifa: Barret!? Who are you talking to?
"Barret: The people! Put me on TV, I'mma drop some truth!"
Cloud: Thousand gil says they cut the sound.
Security Officer: Good to go?
Security Officer: Locked and loaded!
Security Officer: Heads up! We got company!
Security Officer: Take 'em down!
"Security Officer: Engineering, this is B6enemy contact! Enemy contact!"
Engineering Officer: Shit! We can't afford any more delays. You need to keep those components comingdo whatever it takes!
Security Officer: Solid copy. B6 will hold the line!
Barret: Piece o' cake!
Tifa: Find any cards?
Cloud: Only one. And this time we've got three choices...
Tifa: Take your pick.
Barret: Hell is this?
Cloud: M unit. Another type of enhancement.
Barret: Your call if you wanna nix it.
"Barret: I tell you what, I ain't never looked forward to an execution more in my entire life!"
Tifa: You don't say.
Barret: We're about to make fools outta Shinra while the whole damn city's watching! (chuckles) Times like these you gotta savor!
"Tifa: Oh noif you're about to ask me to dance, then don't."
"Barret: C'mon, don't be shy! How 'bout you, Cloud?"
Cloud: I don't dance.
"Engineering Officer: B5, this is Engineering. You need to pick up the pacewe're running dangerously low on components because of those terrorists!"
Security Officer: Copy!
Security Officer: They're here!
"Barret: Buncha pushovers. C'mon, y'all. Let's see what kinda mischief they were getting up to."
Cloud: Four consoles. And never enough keycards...
Tifa: Think we've done enough to weaken the robot?
"Cloud: All that we can, at least."
Barret: It's all good. The stage is setall that's left is to hijack Heidegger's show!
Barret: We're coming up on the exit. Tifadetonator still in range?
Tifa: We should be good.
"Barret: The moment big boy goes down, you hit that switch."
Tifa: Right.
Barret: Can't say we didn't prepare. Now we just gotta get it done!
Engineering Officer: Status report!
"Security Officer: We're short on XXX, but tracking down replacements!"
Engineering Officer: Work faster! Or you'll hear it from the brass!
Barret: Look! They're still preppin' it!
Engineering Officer: They're here! Hold 'em back! Buy us every second you can!
Heidegger: What is the status of my airbuster? Report!
"Engineering Officer: I'm sorry, sir. We're going to need more time! The terrorists have breached the room and are engaging our forces. At this rate, there's no telling when we'll have it fully operational!"
Heidegger: (laughs) As expected. Deploy it at once!
"Engineering Officer: But sir, it's not ready yet!"
Heidegger: That was an order!
Engineering Officer: Understood. Prepare the airbuster for immediate deployment!
Barret: Shit! We too late?
"Engineering Officer: That's far enough, you bastards! I'm taking you down!"
Barret: Y'all never had a chance!
"Tifa: Hey, guys."
"Tifa: Looks like a performance assessment, don't you think?"
Tifa: Reduced response time... Should work in our favor.
"Cloud: We'll figure out its weaknesses as we fight it. As long as we stay focused, we'll be fine. We can do this."
"Barret: For real, though, we need to talk victory poses. Something coordinated for the live, on-camera finish! Could blow up bigstart a new trend!"
Cloud: Veto.
Barret: Huh. No way up?
Barret: Damn near gave me a heart attack!
Barret: Bastard cleared the way for us.
Cloud: Real subtle invitation.
Barret: We were gonna spring the trap anyway!
Barret: Big boy's going to an execution all right. We're gonna put him out of his misery while the whole damn city watches!
Tifa: We give it our all and we'll win!
Barret: We're gonna get through this. We're gonna make it home. All of us. No exceptions.
Tifa: Right. We don't wanna disappoint Marlene.
"Tifa: That goes for you too, Cloud. Right?"
Barret: You'd better give her a big ol' smile this time.
Cloud: If the price is right.
Barret: What? Open it already!
Cloud: It's locked down.
Tifa: Is there any way we can get it open?
Cloud: Yeah. From that room over there.
Barret: Why does everything have to be so damn complicated...?
"Cloud: You know, the faulty equipment storeroom's that way too."
Tifa: Do you think we'll find the components we diverted there?
"Barret: It's like a treasure vault! Hoo, I like the sound of that!"
Tifa: So how do we do this?
"Cloud: It's simple, really. We move the levers at the same time."
Tifa: Got these ones.
"Barret: I'll take left. Which just leaves right, SOLDIER boy."
Announcement: Emergency lockdown is currently in effect.
Tifa: So we need to synchronize our movements?
"Barret: In that case, follow my lead."
Cloud: NahTifa's.
Barret: Fine! Have it your way!
"Tifa: Okay, pay attention, you two..."
"Tifa: Three, two, one..."
"Barret: I'm, uh, still getting warmed up!"
Barret: Shit!
Tifa: No good. Let's try again.
Tifa: Don't rush it!
Tifa: Um... Breathe when I breathe!
Barret: No need to grip it so hard!
Barret: Got an idea! Seventh seventh heaven heaven hoo-ah! Seventh seventh heaven heaven hoo-ah!
Cloud: Hell no.
Barret: How 'bout this then? Seveeenth heaven! Heaven! Heaven!
"Tifa: We're doing it my way! Three, two, one..."
"Barret: Hey, are you even trying? How 'bout a chant to help us time it right? Aaa-vaaa-lanche!"
Tifa: This is exhausting!
"Barret: Hey, I think I should lead after all. Five...four...three-two-one-go!"
Cloud: Much better.
"Tifa: We got this. Three, two, one..."
"Tifa: Shake it off. Three, two, one..."
"Tifa: Focus! Three, two, one..."
"Tifa: Let's just get through this. Three, two, one..."
Announcement: Emergency lockdowndisengaged.
Tifa: Thank god...
"Barret: How the hell we made it through with dumbass here, I'll never know."
Cloud: We really are in sync. Took the words right outta my mouth.
Barret: What did you say!?
"Tifa: Okay, that's it. Let's go."
Barret: Gotcha!
Tifa: Now that is what I call teamwork!
Cloud: Go team.
Barret: Hell yeah! (laughs)
Tifa: We really did it! Great timingright on the money!
Cloud: Yeah...
"Barret: Whatcha'll got tucked away in that vault, huh?"
Barret: This would be the treasure vault?
Cloud: That's right.
Tifa: What's the catch?
Cloud: Need to bypass a high-level security lock.
Barret: Different from the other one?
"Cloud: Same deal, but we gotta do it several times."
Barret: Hah. Not a problem!
"Tifa: Yeah, let's try!"
Announcement: Delta-level security lockdown is currently in effect.
"Tifa: Okay, guys. You know what we have to do."
Barret: Copy me?
"Cloud: No, Tifa leads."
"Barret: Oh, fine! After you, girl."
"Tifa: Gotta get past level one first, right? Three, two, one..."
Announcement: Alpha-level securitydisengaged.
"Tifa: That was great, you guys! Let's keep it up!"
Announcement: Beta-level securitydisengaged.
Tifa: Wow! Think we've got this?
"Barret: Hell yeah, bring it on! Ain't nothing I love more than sticking it to Shinra!"
"Tifa: Halfway there. Steady, guys. Three, two, one..."
Announcement: Gamma-level securitydisengaged.
Tifa: No way! You guys are naturals!
"Tifa: Okay, final round. Don't lose focus. Three, two, one..."
Announcement: Delta-level securitydisengaged. Disposal room now accessible.
Tifa: Finally. I was beginning to think it'd never end.
"Barret: Ayo, Cloud, what's the deal? You really a bona fire SOLDIER?"
Cloud: We didn't train for this stuff.
Barret: All that marching with no rhythm? How did you SOLDIER on?
"Tifa: Okay, that's enough of that. Let's see what's inside."
"Barret: Take that, Shinra? Makin' us jump through hoops to steal your shit..."
Tifa: Didn't take as long as I expected! Good work guys!
Cloud: Likewise. You made it easy.
Tifa: (chuckles) I put my heart and soul into those countdowns...
Barret: Boo-yah! Bet all the Shinra suits watching enjoyed that!
Tifa: You guys were great!
"Tifa: I swear, your timing was perfect. It's almost like...you could read my mind. SOLDIERs can't do that, can they?"
Cloud: I can'tyet.
Tifa: Thank god.
"Barret: C'mon, you two, let's see what we got."
Tifa: Score! It's just like Cloud said!
Barret: They say a job well done's its own reward... I say take everything that ain't nailed down!
"Barret: All right, time to go!"
Tifa: Look!
Barret: President Shinra?
President Shinra: Oho. The eyes of one who has bathed in mako... Which would make you...a SOLDIER?
Cloud: Ex-SOLDIER.
"President Shinra: Once a SOLDIER, always a SOLDIER. Though not, alas, for very long. Accelerated cellular degradation being the most common cause of death by far. This is classified, of course, but every SOLDIER knows the truth."
Cloud: ...That's right.
Barret: Think you forgettin' someone!?
President Shinra: Would that I could. You strike me as the type to go on without end.
Barret: Ain't enough hours in the day to hold you to account for all your crimes!
President Shinra: And what a wasteful indulgence it would be even if there were.
"Barret: Oh, okay then... Let's talk about wasteful indulgences. What is mako? The lifestream! The lifeblood of the planetour planet! But Shinra keeps on slurping it up like a thirsty dog! Whadda you think's gonna happen if you don't stop, huh!?"
"President Shinra: We do indeed keep on ""slurping it up,"" as you say... But...for whose benefit, I wonder. The true nature of mako is known to one and all, yet the people willfully turn a blind eye to the cost. As you must surely be aware?"
Barret: Don't you dare try to put this on us! If anyone's going along with your plans... it's 'cause you brainwashed 'em!
"President Shinra: Such methods are beneath me. As are you, my faithful sewer rats. Henceforth allies of wicked Wutai, our sworn enemy. Thank you for stoking our people's patriotic fever."
Barret: Wutai? The hell we are?
Heidegger: (laughs) You still don't understand your role in this.
Barret: What are they doin'!?
Heidegger: Don't you see? You fools were never in control. Never anything but pawns in our plans to sell great and glorious war to the people! And your instruments of insurrection will detonatewhen we so choose!
Barret: Goddammit!
"Heidegger: Now let us raise the curtain on our main event! The trial of the eco-extremist group ""Avalanche""! Terrorists who conspired with Wutai against Midgar! Your guilt is undeniable! Your punishment: death!"
Tifa: I'm sick of this. I'm sick of all of this!
Cloud (in his memory):It's just like...like when I failed you.
"Barret: Cloud! Get your head in the game! We're counting on you, man."
"Heidegger: (laughs) Sewer rats of Avalanche, pawns of Wutai! The people of Midgar will now see you for the cowards you are!"
"Tifa: Cloud, are you all right?"
"Cloud: I'm fine, You guys good to go?"
Barret: As good as I'll ever be!
Tifa: Cloud? What'd it do to you?
Barret: Dammit! Big boy means business!
Heidegger: Commencing phase two of the combat trial. You've seen but a fraction of this machine's true capabilities!
"Heidegger: Tankbuster ready to fire! Now, show me how fast you can run!"
"Barret: Damn, that thing's powerful!"
Tifa: That was too close...
Cloud: We need to come up with a plan.
Heidegger: Your efforts are futile. It'll chase you to the edge of the world if need be.
Tifa: I hate when they do that!
Cloud: Let's take care of them first.
Heidegger: Hmph! I hope this isn't the end for you three. I was looking forward to a battle against worthy opponents.
Cloud: Now we can finally take it down!
Heidegger: Behold the full potential of the airbuster!
Heidegger: Time to carry out your executions!
"Cloud: Damn, all those drones. Time to do your thing, big man."
"Barret: Watch and learn! Just make sure you got my back, all right?"
Cloud: Now! Get in there!
Tifa: Yep! I hear you loud and clear!
Barret: Let me show ya how it's done!
Cloud: Yeah. Light 'em up!
Cloud: Now!
Tifa: Right! Give it all you've got!
Heidegger: And now for the grand finale! The tankbuster is ready to be deployed!
Cloud: It's coming. Move!
"Heidegger: My dearest Avalanche. My apologies, but it is time that we part ways. This footage will prove invaluable in raising the morale of our Shinra rank and file. (laughs)"
"Cloud: We almost got this. Come on, guys!"
Tifa: Bring it on!
Barret: Let's show 'em what we're made of!
Tifa: Again!?
Cloud: This ends right here!
Barret: We don't have long to get clear!
"Cloud: Take Tifa, and get outta here!"
Barret: I...I was wrong aboutchya
Cloud: This ain't the end of the line for youorme!
Tifa: Cloud!
Barret: C'mon!
"Cloud (in his mind):Hey, buddy. You okay?"
Cloud: Yeah.
Cloud (in his mind):Made it through with just a couple of scraped knees back then...
"Cloud: ""Back then""?"
Cloud (in his mind):Whaddya say? We doing this?
Cloud: Have we
"Cloud (in his mind):Never mind about that. Right now, you need to focus on yourself. Move something, anything."
Cloud: Why not...
Cloud (in his mind):Good. Easy does it. Slow...and steady...
"Cloud: Yeah, yeah..."
Flower Peddler: Hello?
"Cloud: Hey, uh... Who are you? Who are you!?"
Sephiroth: I am...your everything.
Flower Peddler: Hello in there!
"Sephiroth: Oh, Cloud. There's still so much to be done."
On-screen: Sector 5 Slums - Church
Flower Peddler: Maybe you'renotokay...
"Flower Peddler: Ah, he lives! Finally awake, are we?"
Cloud: You're...
Aerith: Aerith. It's Aerith. And you are...?
Cloud: Cloud.
Aerith: Nice to meet you again.
"Cloud: ""Again,"" huh?"
Aerith: What? You don't remember? What about...the flowers?
Cloud: Ohhh... The flower girl. And this is...?
"Aerith: An old church in the Sector 5 slums. You came crashing through the roof without so much as a ""look out below."" Fell right into my flower bed. Lucky for you. Like, really."
"Cloud: S-sorry, I-I didn't mean to"
Aerith: Don't worry about it. They're a lot tougher than they look. This place... It has a kind of power.
Aerith: Before I forgetyou dropped this when you landed.
Cloud: Thanks.
Aerith: I've got one too.
Cloud: You and everybody and their mother.
"Aerith: Not like mine, no. It's special. Mine's not good for anything at all."
Cloud: Bet you just don't know how to use it.
"Aerith: Could be. Though, I really don't mind. Just having it is enough. It was a gift from my mother."
"Aerith: Pretty crazy, huh? Us meeting again like this. You should stay awhile."
"Aerith: And just when I had finished tending the flowers here... Gotta start over... Just me, myself, and I..."
Reno: Hang back. We're not in any hurry.
Cloud: I could stick around a bit.
Aerith: Really!? You will!? In that case...
"Reno: I'll see myself in, thanks. And who are you?"
"Aerith: He's my bodyguard. And a SOLDIER. Pretty cool, huh?"
Reno: A SOLDIER?
Cloud: Ex-SOLDIER.
"Reno: Well whaddya know, you've got the eyes at least."
"Aerith: You don't mind, do you? Bodyguard work's not too different from merc stuff, right?"
"Aerith: Uh... I guessed! From the sword! Just do this for me, okay?"
"Cloud: Fine, but it'll cost you. A lot."
"Aerith: Alot, huh? One date ought to do it."
"Reno: Well, you're weird enough to be one... What class?"
Cloud: First.
"Reno: (laughs) If you're gonna bullshit me, at least try to make it believable..."
Reno: Ooh!
Aerith: Hey! Watch the flowers!
Cloud: I'll make this quick.
Aerith: You better!
"Reno: Bodyguard, huh? You know I'm hers too, right?"
Aerith: Really? Since when? This is the first I've heard of it.
"Reno: 'Cause it was a classified op, princess."
Aerith: I don't think that counts then.
"Reno: Ugh... Hey! Little help in here, guys?"
Reno: Good ol' what's-his-face. Hardly knew ya.
"Reno: Hate doing cleanup, but... I'm damn good at it!"
"Aerith: Cloud, be careful!"
"Reno: Whatcha waiting for, bodyguard? I'm right here!"
"Reno: C'mere, SOLDIER boy. I won't bite."
"Reno: Gonna make me work for it, huh? Well, lucky for youtough guy... I'm a consummate professional!"
Reno: Figured this dance of ours could use a spark!
"Reno: Oooh. Feeling all right there, mister bodyguard?"
"Reno: Not so tough now, are you!"
Reno: Yoo-hoo! SOLDIER boy!
Reno: Don't tell me you're trying to cut and run.
Reno: Heads up!
"Reno: You've got it all wrong, man. I just wanted to"
Aerith: Cloud! No!
Security Officer: Huh?
Security Officer: Were they
Security Officer: Sir! Are you hurt!?
Reno: I'm fine! Go get the girl.
Security Officer: Sir!
Cloud: The hell?
Aerith: Weird. They're not attacking.
Security Officer: Hey! Open up!
Cloud: C'mon.
Aerith: Over here!
Security Officer: Hey! Open up in there!
Aerith: Nowhere to go but up...
Cloud: Huh?
Aerith: Are they trying to stop us?
Cloud: What do they want?
Aerith: Do they want us to go upstairs?
Cloud: Could be a trap.
Aerith: They're...trying to show us the way.
Cloud: I don't like it.
"Aerith: Um, we should run."
Security Officer: What's going on!?
Aerith: Through the atticmaybe we can get out that way!
Cloud: Right. Through that hole.
Aerith: Huh? They saved me...
Cloud: C'mon.
(Upon trying to cross the ladder without Aerith.)Cloud: Can't leave now. She needs help.
Security Officer: Break it down!
Cloud: I'll go first.
Cloud: Come on.
Security Officer: Nothing!
Security Officer: Up there!
Reno: Hey! No shooting!
"Aerith: Aw, man..."
"Cloud: Hey, you okay?"
Aerith: Probably! ...Or maybe not.
Reno: If there's so much as a scratch on her...you're done.
Security Officer: Sir!
Reno: We bring her in in one piece.
Security Officer: Huh?
Reno: What now?
Cloud: Run!
Security Officer: Move and I'll shoot!
"Reno: Oh no, you won't!"
"Security Officer: But, sir!"
Cloud: Could drop that.
Cloud: Can't leave now. She needs help.
Cloud: Okay.
Reno: What's the holdup!?
Security Officer: I can't get to her!
Reno: Huh. Some kind of magic trick?
Cloud: Run!
Aerith: 'Kay!
Reno: Stop her!
Security Officer: Over there!
Aerith: Cloud! Over here!
Aerith: Thank you!
Cloud: Let's move.
"Aerith: Cloud, gimme a hand!"
Security Officer: They're in the attic. Should we pursue?
Reno: Nah. Leave 'em be.
"Security Officer: But, sir!"
Reno: Partner's got it. We. Are. Out. Beginner's luck.
Cloud: More of those things.
Aerith: It's like they're...guiding us.
Cloud: Stay close.
Aerith: So cool.
Aerith: There!
Cloud: Need to stay ahead of 'em.
Security Officer: Prep for exfil.
Cloud: Or not...?
Cloud: They gone?
Aerith: Yeah. Think so.
Cloud: What are they?
Aerith: I think... Actually...I don't know. Let's just go.
Aerith: Okay. Up for crossing the rooftops? See that pillar over there? There's a station right by it. Shall we mosey on over?
Cloud: Let's.
Aerith: So...what's next for you?
Cloud: A little bit of bodyguard work.
Aerith: Right.
"Cloud: After that, it's back to the Sector 7 slums."
Aerith: You...know how to get there?
Cloud: Yup.
Aerith: 'Course you do...
Cloud: That suit from earlier. He was one of Shinra's Turks. What's a Turk want with you?
Aerith: Dunno...
"Aerith: Hey, don't Turks keep an eye out for potential SOLDIERs and stuff?"
Cloud: They do more than just scout for candidates. Turks get called in to handle all kinds of situations. With extreme prejudice.
Aerith: Professional bad guys. Gotta love 'em.
Cloud: Back to my question. So what's he to you? Looked like you knew each other.
Aerith: Maybe he thought I could be the greatest SOLDIER yet!
Cloud: Forget it.
Aerith: Hmm? You mad?
Aerith: I...actually...haven't traveled by rooftop before.
Cloud: Be surprised if you had.
Aerith: It's honestly...kind of exciting.
Cloud: Well... First time and all.
Aerith: Wait! Give me a moment!
Aerith: Don't just...run off on your own...
Cloud: Those the words of a SOLDIER candidate?
Aerith: So petty.
"Cloud: So, does no one live in these buildings?"
Aerith: Nope. No one to get mad if we make noise.
Aerith: Looks kinda...rusty.
Cloud: I'll go first.
Cloud: It's pretty old. Be careful.
Aerith: Okay...
Cloud: Easy now.
Aerith: You worry too much. I'm not some princess who needs to be coddled.
Aerith: Shit.
Aerith: Cloud!
"Aerith: Whew, that was unexpected! Thank you, Cloud."
"Aerith: Ah, there it is. The wall."
"Aerith: You know, I thought about leaving once... But...in the end, I couldn't."
Cloud: Too dangerous?
"Aerith: Too much. A whole world, bursting with life. Maybe more than I can handle, I think sometimes... Even now. People hate the steel sky, the slums...but I don't. How could I? All that passion, all those dreams... Flowing and blending together into something greater..."
"Aerith: This time I'll go first. After all, I can't count on you to wait."
Cloud: Sure about this?
Aerith: See for yourself!
Aerith: Hmm... Maybe I'll go on ahead and leave you all by your lonesome! Just
Cloud: Maybe you shouldn't talk.
Aerith: Then you talk. Tell me a story.
Cloud: Not for free.
Aerith: Cheapskate. You're(screams)
Aerith: Gotcha.
Cloud: You're killing me here.
Aerith: Here goes nothing!
Cloud: You good?
Aerith: Of course!
Aerith: My hero!
Cloud: Never a dull moment with you.
Aerith: That a compliment?
Cloud: Not really.
Aerith: Thanks anyway!
"Aerith: We're getting closer to the station. Even so, we'll probably run into a few monsters on the way."
"Aerith: Heh... There's a face that screams ""so what?"""
Cloud: Eh. I've fought scarier things in my sleep.
"Aerith: Where are you going, Cloud?"
"Aerith: Look out, Cloud!"
Aerith: Someone looks like they're in their element.
"Aerith: So Cloud...you don't know the slums that well, do you?"
"Cloud: Compared to you? No. Training grounds, barracks, battlefieldsthat's the world I know."
"Aerith: Heh, you sound proud of that."
Aerith: Station's there.
Cloud: I can see that.
Aerith: Oh? Thought the world you knew didn't include stations.
Cloud: Hah hah...
On-screen: Sector 5 Slums - Station
"Undercity Resident (1): We poured so much of our blood and sweat into building that reactor, and now..."
Undercity Resident (2): I can't believe this is happening...
Station Worker: If you would all just please calm down...
"Undercity Resident (3): Hey, what the hell's going on!?"
"Girl: Check it out, Mom!"
"Undercity Resident (4): Come on, there's no need to shout..."
Cloud: Popular place.
"Aerith: Yeah, well, it's got a good view of the reactor."
Undercity Resident (5): It's on fire!
Cloud: Ain't a show.
Aerith: They know that. They're worried.
Undercity Resident: Oh! Didn't expect to see you here.
Aerith: Huh? Um... Yeah...
"Undercity Resident: Oh, on your way home from the church?"
Aerith: That's...right.
"Undercity Resident: Well, I'm glad you're okay. Did any debris hit the church?"
"Aerith: Not debris, no..."
"Undercity Resident: That's something, at leastbut you may not be so lucky next time!"
Aerith: OhCloud! Wait!
Topside Resident: Hey. You know a way to get topside other than the train?
"Aerith: Sorry, can't say I do..."
Topside Resident: Figured as much. What a goddamn pain in the ass...
Cloud: Wait.
Security Officer (1): Deck is all clear!
Security Officer (2): Rope's good! Go!
Security Officer (3): Form up!
Security Officer (1): Let's go!
Cloud: Another Turk.
Aerith: A real man on a mission.
"Cloud: On the hunt, more like."
Aerith: For me? Or you?
Cloud: Don't know. Don't care.
Aerith: Then...let's stick to the backstreets? Ah. There will be monsters.
Cloud: Better than Shinra.
On-screen: Sector 5 Slums - Scrapyard
Aerith: There's a Shinra dump site up ahead. Not the kind of place anyone would ever choose to hang around in.
Cloud: But a great place to lay low.
Cloud: They've got the run of it.
Aerith: No telling where they'll come from...
Cloud: Monsters instinctively target weaker prey.
"Aerith: Hmm... You'd better watch out then, Cloud."
"Aerith: That way's a dead end. They were doing some construction, but quit halfway."
Aerith: Over here.
Aerith: That didn't work. Maybe it's broken?
"Aerith: Pretty sure this path we're on loops around, too, so..."
"Aerith: Hmm, wonder if we can move this."
"Aerith: Ah, I knew it!"
Aerith: Must've been a new breed.
Cloud: How do you figure?
Aerith: 'Cause they went for the stronger prey.
Aerith: Therecheck it out! The heart of the slums.
Cloud: Still a fair ways off...
"Aerith: Well, we did take a detour. Getting tired?"
Cloud: Nah.
"Aerith: Me, I'm feeling a bit hungry. How about you?"
Cloud: Amazed...
Aerith: You're in for a treat when we make it back.
Cloud: Don't have time for that.
Aerith: You'll wanna make time for my mom's cooking! And that's the final word on it! We'll get home quick and eat ourselves stupid!
Aerith: (screams) It's awake!
Cloud: Gonna wish it kept sleeping.
"Aerith: Don't think it'll open. What to do... That gate just doesn't want to open, does it? Maybe there's a way to get over it? For you, at least."
Aerith: No good. That sucks. Ah! Try moving that container to make a path.
Aerith: Yeah! That should do the trick!
"Aerith: Thanks, Cloud. I knew you'd find a way."
Aerith: Guess we're home free.
Cloud: No need for thanks. I'd rather get paid.
Aerith: Hm? You're getting paid right now.
Cloud: Hm?
Aerith: Huh?
Cloud: Oh...
Aerith: Should be able to relax a little now...
Cloud: Don't forget about the Turks.
Aerith: Ah!
Cloud: Could come at us anytime. Keep an eye out.
Aerith: Uhhh... That's the station.
Aerith: Somewhere else you'd rather be?
On-screen: Sector 5 Slums - Center District
Aerith: What're they watching?
Cloud: Hey!
"Reporter: I'm standing inside the gutted shell of Mako Reactor 5. As you can see, there's still a lot of smoke rising from the rubble. While fallen beams and other debris continue to hinder rescue efforts, the fires appear to have been mostly extinguished."
"Reporter: Ah, over there! That's the director of Shinra's Advanced Weaponry Division, isn't it? Excuse me, ma'am, but would you mind answering a few questions?"
Scarlet: Move.
Reporter: Can you give us any updates on the status of the reactor? What kind of damage did it suffer in the explosion? Are we in any danger?
"Scarlet: Mako Reactor 5 has been temporarily shut down, and all fires have been successfully extinguished. The situation is under control, and the people of our fair city need not worry about any additional complications. We are in the process of conducting a full forensic investigation. But we suspect the device used was similar to that employed in the attack on Mako Reactor 1."
Scarlet: The perpetrators of that atrocity were filmed making their escape. These agents of the eco-terrorist group Avalanche are currently believed to be hiding somewhere in Midgar...
Reporter: And...given that this group has now attacked two reactors in quick succession...can they really be stopped before they strike again?
Scarlet: What doyouthink?
"Reporter: Well, I"
Scarlet: Have no fear. Shinrawillkeep Midgar safe.
"Security Officer: Okay, time's up!"
Aerith: Alright...let's go.
"Aerith:Hey, my house is this way."
"Restaurant Owner: Aw, what timing. Mind lending me a hand?"
"Aerith: The place is really hopping, huh?"
"Restaurant Owner: Nice side effect of the train situation! So, whaddya say?"
"Aerith: I'd love to, but..."
Aerith: I help out every now and then. It's fun.
Oates: Aerith!
"Aerith: Well, well, what are you doing all the way up there?"
Oates: Was trying to get a look at the reactor. Who's this guy?
Aerith: This is Cloud. He's a mercenary...and currently my bodyguard. That's Oates.
Oates: See you.
Aerith: Two peas in a pod.
Boy: Aerith!
"Aerith: So, what are you guys up to?"
Girl: We all went to see the reactor.
"Boy: Oh, that's right. You're supposed to come by the House."
Aerith: What for?
Girl: I dunno. You're just supposed to.
"Aerith: Well, guess we have a new destination."
Aerith: I should probably explain. The Leaf House is the local orphanage. That's where all these kids live.
"Girl: Hey Aerith, where'd you go?"
Boy: The church again?
"Girl: Next time, we should all go together!"
"Doctor: Why hello, Aerith. As popular as ever, I see."
Aerith: Apparently. But they sure keep me on my toes!
Doctor: (laughs) Better than being bedridden!
Doctor: Thanks again for all those herbs. You've helped a lot of people.
Aerith: No problem. Anytime.
"Doctor: How'd you manage to find so many, anyway?"
"Aerith: (chuckles) Oh, I have my ways."
Doctor: And him?
Aerith: He's my bodyguard. Just until I get home.
Doctor: And you're sure he's up to it?
Aerith: Hmmm... Maybe?
"Aerith: Since I'm so generous, I gather medicinal herbs for his patients sometimes."
Aerith: Here's the Leaf House.
Housemother: There you are.
Boy: We're back! And we brought Aerith with us!
Housemother: Sorry to make you come out here.
Aerith: Don't be. It's on my way home.
"Housemother: Well then, I hope you won't mind me asking for some flowers."
Aerith: No problem! How many?
"Housemother: All you can carry. What with all the doom and gloom we've been hearing on the news recently, I thought some flowers might help cheer everyone up."
"Aerith: I'm sure they will, and I'd love to help."
Housemother: Let's all wash up before our meal.
"Aerith: So, Cloud, what's your favorite flower?"
Cloud: They're all the same to me.
Aerith: (chuckles) You sure you wanna say that to a florist?
Cloud: Better than lying.
"Aerith: Okay, then what'd you do with the flower I gave you?"
"Cloud: I, uh..."
Aerith: You give it away?
Cloud: I did.
Aerith: Ooh! To who? Tell me!
Cloud: Don't recall.
Aerith: Hmmm?
Cloud: What?
Aerith: Thought you didn't like lying.
"Aerith: Well, anyway..."
"Aerith: My house is just up this path. Mom should be home by now, so I'll introduce you."
Aerith: There you go. That's my house.
Cloud: It's amazing.
Aerith: Come on.
Aerith: I'm home!
Elmyra: Hey baby. Been up to no good? Rude came by
"Aerith: So, this is my mom, Elmyra. And this is Cloud. My bodyguard."
Cloud: Uh...hi.
Elmyra: Take good care of her?
Cloud: That's my job. Orwasmy job.
"Aerith: Yep. Thanks. So, Cloud, you gonna head back to Sector 7?"
Cloud: Yeah.
Aerith: Then I'll show you the way.
Cloud: Then why'd you have me bring you here? What if the Turks show up again?
"Aerith: It'd suck, but I've dealt with them before. Honestly, I'm much more worried about you. What if you get lost, huh? You'd be too embarrassed to admit it, so you'd just and so you'd just keep on going."
Cloud: Quit acting like you know me.
"Aerith: Hey, Mom? I'm gonna go take Cloud over to Sector 7, okay?"
"Elmyra: Okay... But why not wait until tomorrow? If you head out now, it'll be dark when you get back. Better to rest up here and make the trip first thing in the morning. When you'll have daylight to spare."
"Aerith: That's true. She's got a point, Cloud."
Cloud: Hold up.
"Aerith: Oh, yeah! I still need to deliver some flowers to the Leaf House. Since we have a little time before dinner... You should come with."
Cloud: That wasn't the deal.
Aerith: You mean you want more? Even though you've got apricelessreward coming your way? Do you know what I promised him?
Cloud: I'll do it!
Aerith: I'll go grab the baskets. Be right back!
"Elmyra: That Aerith... She's a handful, isn't she?"
"Elmyra: It must be tough No, never mind."
Elmyra: Hmph.
Aerith: That's weird. Could've sworn I put them here...
Cloud: Huh.
Aerith: Found 'em!
Aerith: You take this one. Take it.
Aerith: Right. Off we go!
"Aerith: And these, right here, are my babies."
Aerith: Hmm... Which ones do you think we should pick?
Cloud: Any of them.
"Aerith: Aw, don't be like that. I know you have an eye for this kind of thing."
Aerith: That's the one I gave you.
Cloud: Huh. It is?
"Aerith: Nice try, mister. You can't fool me."
"Aerith: Whoa, foxtails, huh? I gotta hand it to you, I never would've thought of that. It'll definitely take them by surprise."
"Aerith: Good eye. People used to give these to declare their loyalty to one another. Interesting, right?"
Aerith: I think we still need a few more. What should we pick next?
"Aerith: She said ""as many as you can carry,"" so maybe a few more?"
Aerith: I think we're good now. Whaddya say? Shall we go?
Aerith: No need to hurry. We're not under the gun or anything.
Cloud: I'm not cut out for this crap.
"Aerith: Sure you are. And when you're done, you'll be drowning in job offers."
"Aerith: So, how do you think they'll arrange these flowers?"
Cloud: Dunno.
"Aerith: Well, we'll soon find out."
Cloud: I'll wait out here.
"Aerith: Oh, okay. But I might be a while. Why not check out the town?"
"Cloud: Nah, can't leave without telling her."
"Chadley: Cloud, I have the most amazing news! I believe I might know how to develop summoning materia, something heretofore thought impossible. Scientists say that this materia can only be found in nature, but I may just be able to prove otherwise! And so, Cloud, I turn to you. I would like to test this theory by way of my combat simulatorto wit, I want you to fight and defeat summon data in VR. I sense that you find my phrasing to be somewhat...obtuse."
Chadley: Then I invite you to ready your portable battle simulator.
"Chadley: What a shame. It was a close match. However, I did manage to obtain valuable data. Analyze and learn from your mistakes, so that you can claim victory next time."
"Chadley: Outstanding. The Shiva summoning materia is complete. And now it's yours. Use it as you see fit. The lady of frost is the perfect companion for a man like you, Cloud. She will prove most useful when the time comes to destroy Shinra."
Materia Vendor: I've got the finest collection of materia you'll find anywhere.
Materia Vendor: I knew you had a keen eye.
Weapon Vendor: What'll it be for you today?
Weapon Vendor: Got what you need to stay safe?
Boy: Nuh-uh! No grown-ups allowed!
Oates: Ah!
Cloud: I remember you...
Oates: Where's Aerith?
Cloud: The Leaf House.
Cloud: Is something wrong?
Aerith: You could say that. Sounds like someone spooked the kids.
"Oates: Yeah, two of 'em disappeared. They ran away after this creepy guy wearing black clothes showed up."
Cloud: A Turk?
"Aerith: That's what I thought, but no."
"Oates: It's this guy who's always stumbling around town in a dirty robe full of holes. They say he's sick or something. Oh, and he had some kind of number tattooed on his arm."
Aerith: I don't like the sound of this. I'm gonna check it out.
Cloud: I know someone who fits that description. I'll come with.
Aerith: 'Kay.
Oates: C'mon.
"Chadley: Cloud! I understand you must be busy, but I hope you haven't forgotten about my research."
"Chadley: Oh, hello. Cloud has been assisting me with my research and development."
"Aerith: Ooh, that sounds fun. Count me in."
Chadley: One moment while I run diagnostics. Huh... How very strange... You don't appear to be in my database...
Aerith: And that's bad?
"Chadley: There must have been some sort of server error. Oh well, any friend of Cloud's is sure to be of great help."
Oates: C'mon.
"Aerith: I know this place is off-limits to grown-ups, but if we want to rescue them...well... We gotta break the rules."
Boy (1): Oates!
Boy (2): You're back!
Oates: Aerith's come to help.
"Aerith: Yeah, leave it to us. We'll take care of it from here."
Boy (1): But there are monsters out there!
Aerith: Don't worry. I've brought a superstrong friend along with me.
Cloud: I used to be a SOLDIER. So where's the guy?
Oates: I dunno. He disappeared and we can't find him.
"Aerith: Right now, let's worry about the kids."
Oates: C'mon.
Oates: They ran off this way. Be careful.
On-screen: Sector 5 Slums - Undeveloped Area
Aerith: Where do you think they went?
Cloud: Who knows. They're kids. Nothing to do but look all over.
Aerith: I just hope we find them in time.
Aerith: There they are!
Cloud: And they're not alone.
Aerith: Quickly! We gotta save them!
Cloud: Alright.
Boy: Aerith!
"Girl: Hey, Aerith!"
Aerith: Hold on!
Boy: Stay back!
Cloud: Careful.
Girl: Watch out! The ground's really shaky!
Boy: It's 'cause of the reactor. You can't trust your feet.
Cloud: I'll go.
Cloud: C'mon.
Boy: Thank you.
Girl: That was cool...
Aerith: Okay. Let's head back.
Boy: That'ssocool!
Girl: How did you get to be so strong!?
"Aerith: Well you see, Cloud here used to be a SOLDIER!"
Boy: He was?
Girl: Did you go fight in the war?
Cloud: I might've.
Boy: I'm gonna grow up to be a SOLDIERlike you.
Girl: You can't just grow up to be a SOLDIER. You gotta work at it.
Boy: Cloud thinks I'm good enough to be one. Right?
"Aerith: Look at you, Mr. Popular."
"Boy: That was so cool, you guys! Especially that, ""Hah! Yah!"""
"Girl: Yeah, it was really cool when you went like, ""Hah! Yah!"""
Boy: You've got it all wrong. (imitates fight noises) Likethat.
Girl: No way! It was way faster than that! (imitates fight noises) Likethat.
"Boy: Fine, then how about(imitates fight noises) Yeah?"
Girl: Yeah! (imitates fight noises) Like that.
"Boy: Isn't that right, Cloud?"
"Girl: Isn't that right, Cloud?"
"Boy (in Cloud's memory): Tifa, wait!"
Boy (in Cloud's memory): Tifa!
Cloud: Tifa...
Aerith: Tifa?
Aerith: What's wrong?
Cloud: Nothing.
"Aerith: Is Tifa, like...your girlfriend?"
Cloud: No.
Aerith: But she's someone special.
Cloud: It's not like that. More like... I don't know how to explain...
Aerith: I see...
Oates: Thank you.
"Aerith: From now on, if you run into trouble, promise me you'll find an adult, okay?"
"Oates: Okay, I will. And here. Since you're so cool. You guys are both grown-ups, but you're also one of us now. You can come and play here whenever you want."
Aerith: Don't worry. It'll be okay.
Cloud: Wait.
"Cloud: Hm. Not him, but looks pretty damn similar."
"Aerith: Huh? There's the number...but why ""2""?"
Cloud: Who knows. Come to think
Sephiroth: The reunion...is nothing to fear.
Aerith: Cloud? Get it together. Come on.
Cloud: You don't know who Sephiroth is...do you?
"Aerith: Sephiroth, the war hero? I know he died in an accident five years ago. They said so on the news."
Cloud: Maybe they did. But I've got a feeling he's still alive.
"Aerith: Oh...right. C'mon, let's go."
"Boy 1: My dad told me that that man, he used to be a SOLDIER when he was younger."
Boy 2: I heard he came back because he got sick or something. Isn't that kinda weird? Can SOLDIERs even get sick?
"Oates: Hey, Cloud. I know a lot of people around here need help. When I'm out on patrol, a lot of them tell me about their problems. Do you think you might be interested in helping out?"
"Aerith: Well, I'm all for it! We still have plenty of time."
Cloud: I'm on the clock.
Aerith: Don't worry. I give you permission!
Oates: I always have the latest information. Come find me if you wanna know.
"Oates: The monsters out there are getting stronger and stronger. But that's no problem for you, though, right? ...Be careful anyway."
"Aerith: I see you're working hard, mister merc."
Cloud: Yep.
Aerith: So whaddya gonna do next?
Cloud: Keep on working hard.
"Aerith: As you always do, I'm sure."
"Cloud: You know, thisishow I earn a living."
Aerith: Huh? Really!? I thought you were just doing it for fun!
Cloud: I suppose some people do.
Aerith: Hello! I'm some people. Nice to meet you!
Weapons Vendor: People are talking about you. You've got one helluva reputation.
"Aerith: It feels good to help people out, doesn't it?"
Cloud: Eh.
Aerith: You having fun yet?
Cloud: Heaps.
"Aerith: Then you can't be afraid to show it more. Don't forget, it's all about service and salesmanship."
Cloud: I'll leave that to you.
"Aerith: All right, but don't think you can rely on me forever, mister."
Cloud: Wasn't planning to.
Aerith: That's good. 'Cause I demand a very good salary.
Aerith: We probably oughta call it a day.
"Cloud: Getting late, huh?"
"Aerith: You've been working so hard, you lost track of time."
Cloud: Had to. The pay sucked.
Aerith: 'Cause they didn't know if you were worth it yet. But now they do. C'mon. Let's go home.
"Housemother: Aerith, you're back. Come, look what we've done with the flowers. Lovely, don't you think?"
Aerith: Great job. It's wonderful.
Housemother: Isn't it?
"Housemother: Oh, I nearly forgot. I saw some Shinra suit walking towards your house a little while ago. He was dressed all in black. A little scary looking."
Housemother: You alright?
"Rude: Hello, Aerith."
Aerith: What do you want?
Rude: Haven't seen him before. He your new boy toy?
"Aerith: He's mybodyguard, if you must know."
Rude: Wait a minute... Those eyes... Is he the one who beat up Reno?
Cloud: And what if I am?
"Rude: Need to cross my T's, dot my I's. That's all."
"Aerith: Cloud, leave him be. Rude's not a bad person. Really."
"Rude: No, I'm not bad. But like it or not... I sometimes have to do bad things. Don't take it personal."
Cloud: You Turks are all the same. All bark...no bite.
Rude: You're one to talk!
Aerith: No need to get rough!
Cloud & Rude: Stay back.
Aerith: Can't you leave us alone?
Rude: No.
Rude: Gotta get a little payback for my partner.
Cloud: Come on then.
Rude: Hmph. SOLDIER huh?
Cloud: First Class.
Rude: Okay then.
"Aerith: So, you had enough yet?"
"Rude: No, I don't believe that I have."
Aerith: Just stop it.
Rude: Can't. It's my job.
"Aerith: Cloud's pretty strong, isn't he?"
Rude: I've seen his type before.
Cloud: How's that payback working out for ya?
"Rude: Oh, better than expected."
Rude: I thought you didn't wanna get rough.
Aerith: No...but this is self-defense!
Aerith: Please. Just leave us alone.
Rude: You know I can't do that.
"Reno (on phone): Hey there, partner. I'm sure you're having the time of your life, but we're needed on standby for a job. Something about Sector 7. So get your ass back here now."
Rude: Understood.
Aerith: Got somewhere else to be?
Rude: ...Apparently so.
Rude: Go home and stay there.
Aerith: You know I can't do that!
Rude: Huh?
Aerith: You're heading in already?
On-screen: Return to Aerith's house?
Cloud: Yeah. That's enough for one day.
Cloud: Nah. Not quite yet.
Aerith: Oh my! Is that a moogle!?
"Moggie: You can see me, kupo? Then you two must be very, very special people. In that case... Welcome to the Moogle Emporium! I'm the ownerMoggie!"
"Aerith: You must not be familiar with ""Mog the Moogle."" It's a pretty famous fairy tale. Mog wanted to bring happiness to all the moogles of the forest, so he decided to open a shop of wonders."
"Moggie: That's right, kupo! I opened a store to bring happiness to the slumslike Mog! And you know, only people with the purest of hearts can even see moogles!"
Cloud: Uh...you talking 'bout me?
"Moggie: Well...moogle magic isn't perfect, kupo. Anyway, we've collected all kinds of rare and wonderous goods! They can be yours if you've got enough moogle medals. But you'll need to buy a membership first!"
"Moggie: If you find any moogle medals, you can spend them here, kupo!"
"Aerith: So, Moggie, what do you do with the medals we give you?"
"Moggie: Oh, you know what! I use them to make everyone happy! That's the duty of every moogle!"
Aerith: Of course. Just like Mog the Moogle.
"Moggie: You guys are great! Thanks to you, I've got a ton of medals, kupo! Which means I can bring happiness to a ton of people!"
Cloud: Good for you.
"Aerith: Hey, Cloud...maybe say it like you mean it?"
Cloud: Not until I'm happy. Go on. Work your magic. Make me smile. From ear to ear.
"Moggie: I'll need a lot more medals, kupo!"
"Aerith: Well, that won't do! C'mon Cloudlet's go get more!"
"Moggie: Good luck, guys!"
"Moggie: A pleasure as always, kupo."
"Ms. Folia: Oh... You're that former SOLDIER, aren't you? Cloud, was it?"
"Aerith: Former SOLDIER turned problem solver. Are you okay, Ms. Folia? You look upset."
"Ms. Folia: Yeah! I am pretty upset. The kids are still off doing patrols, even though it's now time for their lessons. Not a single one of them has come back yet!"
Aerith: Patrols? Is that a Leaf House thing? Something they do to help out?
"Ms. Folia: That's right. In return for the donations we receive, the kids go around town picking up litter, running errandsthat kind of thing. I don't suppose you've seen any of them, have you? You see, I have some important plans this evening, and I really need to go and get ready."
Aerith: Would you like us to go round them up?
"Ms. Folia: That would be wonderful! There are five of them out on patrol right now. They all wear homemade swords on their back, so they should be easy to spot."
"Girl: Wow, you're that SOLDIER, right? Can I ask you a super important question? I heard bad people broke the mako reactor and there's gonna be another war 'cause of it. Is that true?"
"Cloud: Who knows, but isn't there something else you should be worrying about right now?"
Girl: I forgot about Ms. Folia's lesson! I gotta head back to the House.
Boy: Cloud!?
Aerith: Hey there. How goes the patrol?
Boy: There's a lot more people on the streets than usual. Maybe because the reactor blew up?
"Aerith: Well, you've been keeping a very sharp lookout. But don't you think you're forgetting something important?"
"Boy: Oh, Ms. Folia's lessons! I gotta get back to the House!"
Aerith: Hey there. How goes the patrol?
"Girl: Great! I've been picking up garbage and giving people directions! Plus, I helped an old lady cross the street!"
Aerith: You've been busy.
Girl: It's a normal day for me. Gotta work hardthe House depends on people's donations!
"Girl: Oh no, I'm late! Did you see Ms. Folia? Is she mad? I gotta go! I'm sorry!"
Boy: You scared me!
Aerith: Hey there. How goes the patrol?
Boy: I've been watching them really close. I'm trying to learn all about the business.
Aerith: You wanna open up a shop of your own someday?
"Boy: Yeah, so I can earn lots of money and use it to help the House. The teachers don't like to talk about it, but we know the donations aren't enough to keep things running. ...But that's a secret, okay? I'm not supposed to tell anyone! Anyway, I gotta go study!"
"Boy: Hello, CloudSir! It's a real honor to meet you! I think you SOLDIER guys are awesome! I wanna be strong and tough when I grow up too!"
Aerith: You sound very determined.
"Boy: These are dangerous times! A reactor blew up, and a bunch of kids lost their friends and families. Who knows what might blow up next?"
Aerith: I guess that means more children might be coming to the House soon.
Boy: Then I think the teachers are gonna have a whole lot more work to do.
"Cloud: Speaking of teachers, Ms. Folia is looking for you."
"Boy: Oh man, I completely forgot! I have to get back right now!"
Aerith: That's everyone. Let's go back to the House.
"Ms. Folia: The children finally came backthanks to you two. You've been a great help. Okay, everyone! Come insideit's time to hit the books!"
"Boy (1): You guys, the toad king's back! I saw him near the hideout!"
Boy (2): We gotta do something about him.
"Aerith: The toad ""king""?"
"Boy (2): A weird, creepy monster we've seen near the hideout lately."
"Girl (1): He wears a crown and walks around like he owns the place. If he's not a king, he's gotta be monster royalty at least. I bet a SOLDIER could beat him up easy!"
"Cloud: Oh, yeah. Real easy. But here's the thing...I don't work for freeor cheap."
Girl (1): But we don't have any money!
Girl (2): The watch wouldn't ask for money.
"Boy (1): But if we ask any other grown-ups for help, they'll find out about the hideout, and that'll be it!"
"Girl (2): We really don't wanna lose the hideout. C'mon, help us! Ohand we'll give you some cool treasure if you do!"
"Boy (3): And if that's not enough, I'll pay the rest of your fee once I open my shop!"
"Boy (4): Well! If you won't help, then we'll just have to kill it ourselves!"
Cloud: I'll do it for three gil. I'm offering a special discount right now on toad king jobs. Looks like it's your lucky day.
Boy (2): Awesome! Now that's my kind of bargain!
"Boy: The toad king wants to take over our hideout. He's mean and angry, and smells bad too, so be careful!"
(Upon defeating the Hedgehog Pie King.)On-screen: Return to the Leaf House?
Boy: Did you defeat the toad king!?
Cloud: Yup. Kicked his butt real good.
Boy: Awesome! I knew you could do it!
Boy: Now we don't have to worry about the king and his smelly friends!
Girl: Thank you so much! Herethis is for youthe treasure we promised. It's definitely worth at least three gil.
"Ms. Folia: Okay, kids, playtime's over for now! I've prepared a special assignment for everyone. One that I expect you to finish today. Understood?"
"Boy: Yes! Yes, Ms. Folia!"
"Ms. Folia: I appreciate you getting rid of the toad king, by the way."
"Aerith: Wow, Ms. Folia. You must know all their secrets."
"Ms. Folia: Oh, if only. Easier said than done. They're always on the move, looking for new adventures, chasing new dreams, all while trying to make the lives of everyone around them just a little better. I try to make sure they don't stumble and fall, and when they finally do, I help them back up."
Cloud: Sounds exhausting.
"Ms. Folia: Sometimes it is. But I want the children to know that until they can stand on their own two feet that I'm here to support them, care for them, love themthat even if we're not actually related, we're still a familya real family, in all the ways that matter. If I can do that for them, then well...then maybe I'm making this world a better place."
Aerith: I know you are.
"Ms. Folia: My predecessor taught me everything I know. I just took up his torch and ran with it, I guess. Not that I'm anything close to what he was. Biggs is one of a kind."
Ms. Folia: Oh no! I've completely lost track of time!
Aerith: Do you have somewhere you need to be?
Ms. Folia: More like a dream I need to fulfill! Thank you again for your help!
Aerith: I wonder what kind of dream she's chasing tonight.
Cloud: No idea.
"Boy: Thanks again for saving our hideout from the king. In return, I let everyone know you guys can join the ""game""as special guests. If you wanna know more, then come to the hideout!"
"Oates: Now that things are starting to settle down a bit, we can finally play Whack-a-Box again! It's all thanks to you!"
"Oates: Oh, yeah, I forgot. There's this tired-looking guy out by the community center...and I heard he was looking for some help."
"Scared Man: Shinra weapons are on the rampage. Five of 'em, like floatin' eyeballs! I saw them wander off into the scrap, but if they come back into town, it'd be a disaster. We need someone who's willing and able to fight..."
Cloud: I'll handle it.
"Scared Man: You will!? Aw man, you're the best! I could hear them shouting ""intruder detected"" or some other nonsense when they floated off. Be careful. They looked dangerous!"
On-screen: Return to the scared man?
"Scared Man: I heard, I heard! You got 'em all, right? Robots from the reactor getting lost in the slums... Must be because of the explosion up top, huh? They must've thought they were protecting the reactor, and figured I was trespassin' on their turf or something."
Cloud: Maybe.
"Scared Man: Almost feel sorry for 'em, getting all lost and confused like that."
"Scared Man: Ah, what am I sayin'? Man or machine... Shinra bitches get what they deserve."
Cloud: Now hold on
"Aerith: Anyway, I think it's safe to say our work here is finished! If you're ever in the market for a merc again, remember: you can count on Cloud!"
"Scared Man: Uh, sure. And sorry about putting this on you all of a sudden. I'm really glad you were willing to help out, though! Thanks again."
"Scared Man: Actually, while you're here, I've got another favor to ask. There's this old guy who hangs out in front of the weapons shop. I think he might need your help. Would you mind talking to him?"
"Scared Man: I'd appreciate it if you could talk to that old guy. He helped me out a while back, and I'd like to return the favor."
"Sarah: Oh hey, Cloud! You're just in time for our favorite gameWhack-a-Box! You want in? It's super fun! The rules are easy. The person who whacks the most boxes is crowned champion of the hideout! We usually don't let adults play, but since you're cool, we're gonna make a special exception just for you."
On-screen: Play a game of Whack-a-Box?
"Sarah: See? Pretty fun, right? Play with us again, 'kay!"
Sarah: Holy cow! You crushed it!
Sarah: Wanna play some Whack-a-Box?
"Damon: Ah, you wouldn't happen to be a certain merc that's become the talk of the town?"
Cloud: Yup.
Damon: I'm Damon. Little more than a humble reporter with the Daily Buzz.
"Aerith: Ugh, that rag? The one that's always printing awful rumors about the slums?"
"Damon: On the contrary, my dear! We strive to raise awareness of the plight of our undercity brethren. We seek a better future for everyone, rich and poor."
"Damon: Now then, my friends. I find myself in need of your exceptional services for a trifling matter. Are you familiar with the mysteriousand notoriousbandit known as the ""Angel of the Slums""? She delivers written declarations to her victimsusually Shinra associatesbefore divesting them of their valuables."
"Aerith: Everyone knows her. Everything she steals, she gives to the poor and needy."
"Damon: Yes. She's got a knack for public relations. Very popular down here as a result. Nevertheless, she is a criminal and a threat to the public order! I've made it my mission to unmask the villain, but the locals have been uncooperative and uncommunicative, to put it mildly. And now that my identity as a reporter has been exposed, my sources have all deserted me! Which brings me to youthe merc of the hour, and the man who will serve up my scoop!"
Damon: I'll welcome any and all information pertaining to the so-called Angel of the Slums.
"Undercity Resident (1): Why, hello! What is it? The Guardian Angel of the Slums? Such a mysterious figure. Always talked about, but neverseenby anyone! The Angel gets in and out without being noticed and always leaves a calling card. Maybe a magician!? No, no, it's no magic trickit's genuine magic! Rumor has it that the Angel is a witch."
"Undercity Resident (2): If we're going by rumors, then I've heard that it's actually a monster in disguise."
"Undercity Resident (1): Well, I could talk all day about thedozensof storiesI'veheard!"
"Aerith: Good to see you again, Mireille."
"Mireille: Good to see you too, Aerith. I'd heard you found yourself a funny new friend."
"Aerith: Cloud, meet Mireille. She knows everything there is to know about the slums. Mireille, meet Cloud. He's a former SOLDIER, and super strong."
Mireille: He looks useful enough. The kids have been talking about you. The defender of the secret hideout. And now the Hero of the Leaf House is helping the Daily Buzz look for the Angel of the Slums.
Cloud: I am?
"Mireille: (chuckles) I'm a lover of the whispered word. Not that it's any real secret, considering how chatty that Shinra mutt's been."
Cloud: Not looking into it for the reporter. I'm doing it for myself. Call it curiosity...or whatever.
Mireille: Or could it be you've fallen under the Angel's spell like so many others? Anywayit so happens that I have some information for you. But I'll need a moment before I can give it to you. Why don't you wait with that reporter of yours?
Mireille: Just wait outside with the reporter. I'll be along soon.
Damon: So! Any news?
Aerith: Have you tried talking to Mireille at all? She told us that she had some information to share.
"Damon: Mireille as intheMireille? The town gossip? I chased her for days, begging for info, but she wouldn't give up a single scrap! So how'dyouget the old bird to talk?"
"Mireille: This old bird had a change of heart, that's all."
"Damon: Then quickly, before you have another, tell us: what do you know about the notorious Angel of the Slums? Has she struck again? Is that it!?"
Mireille: I don't know anything about that. But I do know where her hideout is.
Damon: Her base of operations? Now that's a scoop! Where is it!? Tell me!
Mireille: Deep in the scrapat Lookout Point. Hardly anyone goes out there these days. It's the perfect place for a criminal to hole up.
Damon: Lookout Pointgot it! I'll check it out right now!
"Mireille: But before you go, I should warn you about this rumor I heardabout a terrible fiend that's claimed the Angel's hideout as its lair. Quite large, lots of teeth, always hungry. I don't know about you, but I'd not go anywhere near that thing."
"Damon: Er, well, uh... Well! A good reporter knows never to take foolish risks. ""Plan first, then act."" That's every respectable journalist's motto!"
"Mireille: If it's a ""plan"" you're looking for, I'd say you have one right here. Wouldn't you?"
"Damon: So, my good mercenary. If I might impose upon you again, it would be lovely if you investigated Lookout Point for me."
Cloud: Okay then. Guess we should look around.
"Cloud: ""The Guardian Angel of the Slums will collect your offering on behalf of the poor."""
Aerith: This must be one of her calling cards!
Cloud: I don't see anything else interesting. Let's head back and tell them what we found.
On-screen: Return to the reporter?
"Damon: I can't believe it! You found one of her calling cards! This is the genuine article, I'm sure of it! Penned by the Angel herself!"
Mireille: Hmm... So this is one of her famous warnings.
Damon: It's an incredible find! Ohwas that all?
"Mireille: Hold on. Looks like there's something elsea message. ""To the nosy Shinra reporter sniffing around... I was planning to teach you a lesson you would never forget. However, by the grace of your mercenary friend, you were spared that lesson. But next time he might not be around to save you. You would be wise to watch your step."""
Damon: Not just a message from the Angel... A warning!
"Mireille: If the merc here hadn't bailed you out, that fiend in the scrap would've ripped you to shreds. Sorry about that, friend. Here I was just trying to help you out, but instead my kindness almost got you violently killed."
"Damon: Now, now. No harm, no foul...right? In any case, I hope this narrowly averted tragedy won't discourage you from sharing information with me in the future."
"Undercity Resident (1): Hey, everybody! The Angel left another calling card! She's gonna rip off Don Corneo!"
Undercity Resident (2): It's about damn time!
Undercity Resident (3): Don Corneo's no easy mark. I can't wait to see how this goes down!
Damon: Excuse me! I'm a reporter for the Daily Buzz and
Cloud: So much for my reward.
"Mireille: Here. Why don't you take this? Oh, and no need to thank me. Let's just say it slipped out of that reporter's pocket. (laughs) Can't call it theft if you're just claiming what you're owedam I right? Well done, mister merc. You certainly lived up to your reputation."
"Old Man: Oh, I know you. You must be that mercenary. I have a problem. It's the anniversary of my wife's death, and I wanted to visit her grave. But I can't because some creatures have turned the graveyard into their nest. Could you do me a favor and go there in my stead? She shouldn't be alone today."
Cloud: It'll cost you.
"Old Man: That's fine, that's fine. The graveyard's right by the head of the river. But I heard they put a new gate in recently to replace the old broken one. Now that those creatures have moved in, I'm sure it's locked up tight."
Aerith: Didn't we buy a graveyard key off Moggie? I think we did.
Old Man: You'll find my wife's grave with all the others out by the river's head. But I suspect you're going to need a key to get past the new gate they put in.
Aerith: This must be it.
Aeroth: Hey. You wanna say a prayer too?
Cloud: No thanks. I think you've got it covered.
On-screen: Return to the old man?
"Scared Man: I'm really grateful for what you did. Here's your reward. I owe him a lotmaybe more than I can ever repay. And now I owe you a lot too. I know it's not much, but I hope it makes up for it a little bit."
Aerith: We paid our respects to your wifeand we took care of those creatures.
"Old Man: Oh, that's such a relief to hear. I can't tell you how much it was weighing on my mind. I was beginning to think I might never be able to visit her grave again. With my bad back and my legsmy whole body's a mess, franklyI...I didn't think I could make it past the creatures. But I was prepared to die trying. And then you two came along."
"Old Man: Still, I've got to face facts. Creatures or no, I can't keep making these trips..."
Scared Man: Don't say that.
Cloud: This is the graveyard key. Run it back to Moggie.
Old Man: But...I just told you about my legs...
Scared Man: Why don't you just give it back?
Cloud: Okay. It'll cost you five thousand gil though.
Scared Man: Fivethousand!
Old Man: It's always money with you people! Hmph. Fine! I won't ask you for anything else! I'll take your damned key and give it to the boy!
Old Man: It's downright depressing. What is the world coming to these days...
Aerith: Wait a sec.
Aerith: So...you coming?
Cloud: You talking to the...
Aerith: Shh. So yeah... It was that kind of day.
Aerith: Let's go. Shouldn't keep Mom waiting.
Cloud: Hey... What'd they say?
"Aerith: ""Good work today, guys."""
Aerith: Kidding. They didn't say a word. But you know... Ah...never mind. It's not like you'd believe me after all.
Cloud: ...Probably not.
Cloud: Tell me anyway.
Aerith: Really?
Cloud: Yeah.
"Aerith: It won't be much longer now. The flowers, they...they have something important to tell us. Something they...need to share with us. At least, that's the feeling I get. But...before they can...there's a final step that has to be taken. Otherwise...we won't hear them. Maybe I should just give up. Honestly, it's what I do best."
"Cloud: Could've fooled me. From what I've seen, you're no quitter."
Aerith: Well today's special! That's why I've been working my butt off.
Cloud: Uh...What's so special about it?
"Aerith: (laughs) Okay, time to go!"
Cloud: Learn to talk to her.
Aerith: Did the flowers say anything?
"Cloud: Uh... ""Good work today, guys""?"
Aerith: (chuckles) That's the spirit!
Elmyra: Where have you two been? I've been worried sick.
Aerith: Sorry. We got a little sidetracked.
"Elmyra: Dinner's ready, in case you're wondering."
"Aerith: Ah, great!"
Elmyra: But before we sit downI want you to make up the guest room.
"Aerith: Gotcha! Take a load off, okay?"
"Elmyra: Judging by those eyes, I'm guessing you're a SOLDIER?"
Cloud: Ex-SOLDIER.
Elmyra: I hate to ask...but would you leave here tonight? Without any fussno questions? You boys made a tradea normal life for power. You can't have it both ways.
Aerith: I'm back!
Elmyra: Good. NowI hope you're hungry.
Aerith: Starving. Right?
Claudia: I've never been so proud. The man you've become... Women must be hounding you day and night.
Cloud: Not really.
"Claudia: You know, there's all kinds of temptations in the big city. I'd feel a lot better if I knew you'd found a good girlone who'd make sure you didn't get into trouble."
Cloud: I can take care of myself.
"Claudia: An older, more mature girl that could keep you on the straight and narrowand tell you when you're being a silly goose. That's the perfect type for you, I'd say."
Cloud: Don't want to overstay my welcome.
Aerith: What're you doing?
Cloud: ...Nothing.
Aerith: Did you have a bad dream? Don't worry. You'll feel much better in the morning. And I promise to take you straight home.
Cloud: Uh... Okay.
Cloud: Please don't let her hear me again.
Aerith: You jerk! I thought I told you not to leave your room. Now get back in there!
Cloud: Okay...
Aerith: No. More. Games.
Elmyra: You're leaving.
"Cloud: So, how do I get to Sector 7?"
"Elmyra: It's simple enough. Just cut through Sector 6. It isn't exactly safe, but you should be okay, seeing as you're a SOLDIER."
Cloud: Was one.
Elmyra: Promise me. You'll never talk to Aerith again. Please.
Cloud: You got it.
Elmyra: Thank you.
Elmyra: I'm sorry.
"Housemother: If it isn't the new florist! I appreciate you helping the kids out today. Thank you. They won't stop talking about the SOLDIER who ""saved the day."" And make sure to give my thanks to Aerith too."
Cloud: Sure.
"Aerith: Well, look who it is. Talk about a coincidence."
Cloud: What're you doing here?
Aerith: Waiting.
Cloud: Why?
Aerith: Because I'm not sick of you yet.
"Cloud: Lead on, then."
Aerith: With pleasure. (hums)
Aerith: Cloud? Is something wrong?
Cloud: It's nothing.
Cloud: You can see the sky.
"Aerith: They're still working on the new plate. I don't like this part of Midgar. Back when they were still building Midgar, there was an accident, and the plate fell. People had only just started moving in, so there weren't a lot living there at the time, but..."
Cloud: And that's...?
"Aerith: The underside of Sector 6. ""Wall Market."" A realspecialplace. But...I'm sure you already knew that, right?"
"Cloud: I didn't tell you? I enlisted pretty much right after I left home. Dunno much about this place, or any of the slums."
"Aerith: Well, it took a lot of people to build Midgar. And they all needed to blow off steam. So some traders built an entertainment district. Inns, shops, bars, the works. Folks started pouring in from all over. Business was booming, money was flowing... Which attracted the attention of some guys who...didn't much care for the law."
Cloud: And now there isn't any.
"Aerith: Right. But instead of trying to solve the problem, the government decided to just wall it in. And that's how Wall Market began. ""Out of sight, out of mind,"" as the old saying goes. For the folks in charge, there's no better way to deal with it."
Cloud: So it's like a giant veil.
Aerith: Yeah. Wanna see what's behind it?
Cloud: Not really.
"Aerith: That's good'cause I know a better way to get to Sector 7. One thattragicallydoesn't go through Wall Market. And it's just through this tunnel here. At least it was, back when I was a kid."
On-screen: Sector 6 Slums - Collapsed Expressway
"Aerith: It's been like this, you know. Ever since the plate fell."
Cloud: And there's no other way?
Aerith: It'll be an adventure.
Cloud: What's that?
"Aerith: A big arm. Kinda cute, don't you think?"
"Aerith: Oh, great. Someone's pulled up the ladder."
Aerith: I wonder if we can use this.
"Aerith: Here's an idea. I'll hop on, and you give me a ride."
Cloud: You serious?
Aerith: Absolutely! I'll throw down the ladder for you to climb up after.
Aerith: Piece of cake! Gimme a sec.
Aerith: And here comes the ladder.
Aerith: Well? What did I tell ya?
Aerith: You did it!
Cloud: Yeah...
Aerith: Hm?
"Aerith: Alright, good enough. Let's keep on truckin'!"
Cloud: Stop.
Aerith: Did we wake it up?
"Aerith: Huh, that's weird. Used to be a way through here."
Aerith: I wonder if someone blocked it off because of all the monsters that kept showing up.
Cloud: Pretty dangerous place for kids to play.
"Aerith: Raised in the slums, remember?"
Cloud: You're tough.
"Aerith: Hmm, that supposed to be a compliment?"
Aerith: Looks like a dead end.
"Aerith: Hey, I bet you can grab that container with the arm."
"Aerith: Not half bad! So, do you moonlight as a crane operator or something?"
Aerith: Yeah?
Aerith: Uhhh...
"Aerith: Aw, no. Look. Why's it always gotta be so tough? Lucky for me, you'll make this easier."
"Cloud: Yes, ma'am."
"Aerith: Well then, I'm gonna head down."
"Aerith: Okay, Cloud! Ready!"
Aerith: Hold on a second.
Aerith: Gotcha!
"Aerith: Okay, right there! Hold on while I drop the ladder!"
"Aerith: Cloud, over here!"
"Aerith: Whoa. Not too fast, okay?"
Cloud: Got it.
"Aerith: Well, jumping's not an option, that's for sure."
Cloud: Look.
Aerith: Someone made a campfire.
"Cloud: If they found a way down, so can we."
Aerith: Anybody around?
Aerith: Guess it's just us.
Cloud: It's still warm.
Aerith: Should we relight it? Have our own campfire?
Cloud: I need to get back. Besides
"Beck: Lookie here, boys! Caught us some burglars!"
Burke: Comin' into our homes and stealing out shitdoin' crimes!
"Beck: I'd say we're owed ""compensatory damages""!"
"Butch: (laughs) Yeah! Complementaryuh, composite Uh, I don't get it."
"Beck: How stupid can you be? It's crazy simple! Compensatory damages is like, uh... It's like...compensation... For damages!"
"Burke: Oh yeah! (laughs) That's what you get when you...no, when somebody else! Uh..."
Cloud: We haven't done anything wrong.
Aerith: Yeah. We were just passing through.
Burke: Ohhh? A likely story.
"Aerith: Okay, what do you want?"
Beck: Nothing but our due recompensethat's all!
Burke: Due recompense! Due recompense!
Butch: Wait...what? Due wreck-em-pants!?
"Beck: No, shit-for-brains! ""Due recompense""! It's like...uh... It's like...uh... Compensatory damages!"
Butch: Oh! So damage is recompense! I get it!
Beck: Simple as that!
Aerith: I think we've heard enough.
"Beck: Okay, guys. Whatever you do...don't move..."
Burke: Don't look... Just don't look...
Butch: I'm dead... I'm super dead...
Beck: Shit! Let's get the hell outta here!
"Butch: Wait, you guys! Don't leave me! I'm coming!"
"Aerith: Random question, but...why did you quit being a SOLDIER?"
Cloud: That is random.
Aerith: You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.
"Aerith: Um, did you have any SOLDIER friends? Any war buddies?"
Cloud: No...not really.
"Aerith: Oh, okay."
Bandit (1): Huh!? What we got here?
"Bandit (2): Fresh meat to test our new toy on, that's what!"
"Aerith: Stupid ladders. Always out of reach... Okay Cloud, heading down. You're in charge of the arm, got it?"
Aerith: Gotcha.
Aerith: Cloud?!
Aerith: That went pretty well.
Cloud: Sure did.
"Aerith: Hm? Wait a minute, did you just...?"
Cloud: Nope.
"Aerith: Don't worry, we'll be on the same page next time."
Cloud: What are you talking about?
"Aerith: I'm sorry, okay!"
"Bandit (1): Hold it right there, lovebirds!"
"Bandit (2): You wanna pass through our territory, then you gotta pay the toll!"
Aerith: We made it! Smell the fresh air?
Aerith: Cloud. Up top.
On-screen: Sector 6 Slums - Evergreen Park.
"Aerith: Alright, there it is. The gate to Sector 7."
Cloud: Looks shut. How do we open it?
"Aerith: More importantly, how about we take a break? Sound good?"
Cloud: No. I don't have time for
Aerith: Up there looks nice.
Aerith: C'mon!
"Aerith: You know, a long time ago, I used to sell flowers here."
Cloud: Oh yeah?
"Aerith: So, Cloud... You were a SOLDIER: First Class, right?"
Cloud: Yeah.
Aerith: Weird.
Cloud: Really? What's weird about it?
Aerith: Nothing. Just that you were the same rank.
Cloud: As who?
Aerith: The first guy I ever loved.
Cloud: What's his name? I probably know him.
Aerith: Are you okay?
Aerith: Wow... Your eyes.
Cloud': Oh. It's 'cause of the mako. All SOLDIERs have 'em.
"Aerith: Yeah... I know. Sorry, I'm bumming you out. We should go."
"Aerith: Gotta look forward, not back."
Aerith: Here. This won't take long.
Aerith: Ready! Wanna get to Sector 7 in style? This is the passageway for you.
Cloud & Aerith: So...
Aerith: (chuckles) Go ahead.
Cloud: You gonna be okay getting home?
Aerith: And if I said I wasn't?
Cloud: I'll go with you.
Aerith: Thought you needed to get back? (chuckles) Don't worry. I have a backup route for emergencies. And it's safer too.
"Aerith: Guess this is it, then. Ready?"
On-screen: Head to the Sector 7 slums?
Cloud: Yeah.
Cloud: No.
"Aerith: Aww, you big softie. Gonna miss me?"
Aerith: Shall we?
Cloud: Yeah.
Cloud: No...
Aerith: Nothing wrong with taking a little break.
Cloud: Tifa!?
Tifa: Cloud! You're alive! I thought we'd lost you!
Cloud: What's going on?
"Tifa: Shh. I'll explain everything later. But now, I'm on my way to see Don Corneo. You should head back to Seventh Heaven, meet up with the gang."
Cloud: But
Tifa: I'll be fine. You've seen how much ass I can kick.
Cloud: I have...
Aerith: Oh no you don't. You're going after her.
Cloud: She's a big girl. She can handle the likes of him. And worse.
Aerith: Uh-uh. You don't know Corneo. It doesn't matter how strong or smart you think you are. He'll find a way to turn it against you. And where's she going to meet him? A mansion filled with his goons. Come on. Aren't you worried what might happen in there? You have to help her!
Aerith: Come on!
Cloud: 'Kay.
"Aerith: Come on, Cloud. We gotta hurry!"
Stablehand: Hey there! Where you headed?
Aerith: You gave a ride to a girl earlier. Do you have any idea where she went?
"Stablehand: No, and if you don't need a ride, then get the hell outta here. Can't you see I'm trying to work?"
"Cloud: Can't say I can, no."
"Stablehand: What'd you say to me, you little"
Sam: What's all the ruckus out here? Hmm... I don't know you. What's your story?
Aerith: We're looking for a girl who took one of your carriages. Can you help us find her?
Sam: Depends. What d'you want with this girl of yours?
Cloud: Guess. We want to save
Aerith: Save her from a life without this handsome guy!
"Sam: So that's how it is, huh? Well, I get a lotta customers. Hard to keep track of 'em all. This girl, what's she look like?"
Cloud: Well...
On-screen: The girl we're looking for...
Cloud: She's in great shape.
Aerith: Is that really important?
Cloud: Um...she's a great fighter.
Aerith: I'm not sure that helps.
Cloud: She's...great at handling the books.
"Aerith: Cloud, I really don't think that'll help."
"Sam: Wait a minute, you talking about Tifa?"
Cloud: That's her.
"Sam: Oho, looks like someone's got a bit of a crush! Hate to break your heart, kid, but it's gonna be a long while before she sees the light of day again."
Cloud: What do you mean?
"Sam: She's a real pretty girl. Corneo's hosting another audition, and Tifa was chosen as a candidate."
Aerith: An audition for what?
"Sam: For the title of the next Mrs. Corneo. She's what he likes, all rolled into one sweet package. Having scouted girls for so long, I know his tastes better than my own. And considering those tastes, I can guarantee you this: she won't be walking out of that mansion anytime soon...if at all."
Cloud: So where can we find this Don Corneo?
"Sam: What're you asking for? Thinking of raising holy hell or something? Do what you gotta, but leave me out of it. I told you what you wanna knownow take a walk."
Aerith: And there goes our best lead yet. Maybe we'll have better luck in town. Let's check it out.
On-screen: Wall Market
"Barker: Welcome to Wall Market, the pleasure capital of Midgar that's got everything for everybody! Couple, huh? S'all good! Play together, do your own thingearn a little scratch on the side, evenwhatever you're into, we got you. Got a special onetime limited offer"
"Aerith: No, thank you! Come on, Cloudlet's go!"
"Barker: You two! Yes, you! Do you have a place to stay this enchanted evening? We have the perfect room for a sweet-looking couple like you!"
On-screen: Stay the night?
Cloud: ...No thanks.
"Aerith: But you thought about it, didn't you?"
Cloud: How much?
Aerith: Cloud!
Cloud: Back off.
Aerith: Sorry. We're in a rush.
Barker: (laughs) Just give me a holler when you change your mind.
Innkeeper: Welcome. Are you in need of accommodations?
On-screen: Stay the night?
Innkeeper: Have a safe trip.
Aerith: Maybe it's broken?
"Pharmacist: Hey there. We're a pharmacy, but we stock other stuff too."
Pharmacist: Thanks a bunch.
"Restaurant Owner: Hey there, friend! Grab a seat, any that's open."
"Restaurant Owner: So, what will it be?"
Materia Vendor: See the sign out front? All I got is materia.
"Materia Vendor: Thanks, buddy."
"Chadley: Cloud! I will go wherever my research leads me, but the success of my endeavors rests entirely upon you. Your assistance would be much appreciated."
"Chadley: Cloud, I've registered a new summons battle intel request. Please take a look. I need you to defeat the summoned entity so I can complete the materia."
"Chadley: Truly amazing work, Cloud! This is incontrovertible proof that the universe has a sense of humor. Now that you have a fun new partner in Fat Chocobo, you can work together to squash Shinra like a bug."
"Cowgirl: I can't believe I bought the same disc twice. Excuse me, sir. If you like, you can have it."
"Cowgirl: Even if you love the artist, you don't need more than one copy."
Ms. Folia: ...What?
Cloud: Aren't you that Leaf House
"Ms. Folia: Hey! What the hell, merc!? Digging into people's personal affairs in this town is a huge no-no!"
Cloud: What are you doing here?
"Ms. Folia: Well, if you must know...I've wanted to be a dancer ever since I was a little girl. I come here at night to live the dream. I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell the children, okay?"
"Honeygirl: Um are you a customer? In case you can't tell, I'm on a break. If you're looking for a good time, I'm sure you can find it inside."
"Honeygirl: Sorry, buddy, but I'm on a break right now."
Undercity Resident (1): Hey. You hear 'bout that real narrow street just over there...?
"Undercity Resident (2): You're not still wasting your gil at the Honeybee Inn, are ya?"
"Undercity Resident (1): You bet I am. Found me a secret route in, one nobody don't know about. Only trouble is, it's filled with drunks 'n' garbage!"
"Man in Line: Shit! These are high stakes, man!"
Patient: I feel like shit.
"Singer: Thank you. I signed with Shinra Records a while back, but I'm still looking for my first big hit. It's been seven years now. Not easy, but you gotta do what you loveand I love to sing. This is a new song of mine. Maybe it'll be that number one."
Clothing Store Owner: Dig a hole and throw me in. I'm already dead.
Weapons Vendor: Welcome to Wall Market's premier weapons shop!
Aerith: Check it out! I think we might've found our man...and he's a gaudy one.
Cloud: Yeah...
"Leslie: Not so fast, buddy. Back it up. Got no need for pretty boys here."
Cloud: We're looking for someone.
Leslie: Lemme guess. First time in Wall Market.
"Cloud: Yeah, so?"
Leslie: So people can't just walk through the don's front door. Especially men.
"Aerith: How 'bout me, then? Can I go inside?"
"Leslie: Maybe, but you're gonna wish you didn't."
"Corneo Lackey (1): Y'know, Leslie, she's kinda cute. Homely, but cute."
Aerith: Excuse you?
"Leslie: ""Kinda cute"" is not gonna cut it."
"Aerith: Come on, can't you help us out?"
Leslie: Do you have any idea what you're getting yourself into?
Cloud: Aerith.
"Corneo Lackey (2): Seriously, Les, she's not half bad! With a little work, I bet she'd clean up real nice."
Aerith: Cloud...requesting permission to kill.
Cloud: Denied.
"Leslie: If you're really sure you wanna join an audition, then you're gonna need to get official approval."
Aerith: And who can give us that?
"Leslie: The Triothe only ones in town who're considered authorities on Corneo's particular tastes. First, there's Chocobo Sam. And then there's Madam M, over at the massage parlor. Last but not least, there's the Honeybee Inn's Andrea Rhodea. They're an eccentric bunch, to put it mildly, and you should know they don't recommend just any girl stupid enough to come knocking."
"Aerith: Hmm, duly noted. Thanks for the info. We'll be back soon."
"Leslie: If you're hell-bent on getting in, then go bother the Trio."
"Johnny: Warmth, relaxation, the sweet embrace of pretty ladies! That's what I need!"
"Johnny: To enter, or not to enter.Thatis the question. Wherefore does this philosophical quandary torment me!? You totally get where I'm coming from, right?"
On-screen: Agree with Johnny?
"Johnny: Hah! Iknewit! Let me guessafter you've had your fun, you fall into a spiral of shame and self-loathing. But it only lasts a moment, doesn't it? Next thing you know, you're right back here again... Huh? Gotta question for me?"
"Johnny: Yeah, I should've figured. You're not the philosophical introspective type like me. That soft, naive face. I know your kind well, bro. You're just another musclehead who uses violence to work through your inner demons. It's sad, really. Huh? Yeah, what's up?"
Cloud: Seen Tifa around?
"Johnny: Tifa? My love, my light!? Who are you, and how do you know her!? No, shut up. I don't care! Tifa's here? Why!? Tell me why! Oh god, no. I did this to her, didn't I. She came looking for me, to beg me not to leave her! Snap out of it, Johnny. Your Tifa needs you! TifaI'm coming, baby!"
Aerith: Who was that...?
Cloud: Nobody you want or need to know.
Cloud: Aerith. You sure about this?
Aerith: If you've got any better ideas...
Cloud: Not really.
"Johnny: So that's the way it is, hmmm? Tifa's been invited invited into the don's estate..."
Aerith: Huh?
"Johnny: But! To earn such a privilege, you must first win the approval of one of the Trio. Right? Meaning! I now know what I must do to save her! Stay strong, Tifa! Help is on the way! Johnny's comin', baby!"
"Aerith: Not the sharpest tool in the shed, is he?"
Cloud: Nope.
"Johnny: What were you thinking!? Stupid, stupid, stupid! Crawl into a hole and die!"
"Sam: Not you two again. Told you once, I'll tell you a thousand timesgot nothin' for you. Now scram."
"Aerith: Wait, hear us out. You're one of the Trio, right? I want you to get me into the audition."
Sam: Huh?
Aerith: Pretty please?
Sam: Why not.
Aerith: Really!?
"Sam: Sure. Next time an audition comes round, I'll put your name in the hat."
Aerith: Next time will be too late. Can't you get me into this one?
"Sam: You want in now? No can do, sweetheart. I already recommended Tifa, and she's got this in the bag."
Aerith: How can you be so sure Corneo will pick Tifa? You never know. He might pick me.
"Sam: Damn, you really do want in, don't you?"
Aerith: Sure do!
"Sam: Then how's about we play for it? Call it, missy. Heads or tails. Guess right, and I'll grant you your wish. Guess wrong, and you'll leave me in peace."
On-screen: Heads or tails?
Cloud: Heads.
Sam: Tails. You lose.
Cloud: Tails.
Sam: Heads. You lose.
Cloud: No thanks.
"Sam: Oh? Not a gambler, huh?"
Aerith: I am! Heads!
Sam: Tails. You lose.
"Sam: Hey, don't look so glum. You're a pretty enough gal, just...not quite Corneo's cup of tea. But if only the don will do, try convincing one of the other two. That's why it's a Trio, and not just the me-oh. Now skedaddle."
Cloud: Wait. Mind if I see that coin of yours?
Cloud: Trick coin. I had a hunch.
Aerith: That's cheating!
Cloud: And that's the Wall Market way. Lesson learned.
Aerith: Still cheating.
"Johnny: Damn, man... It wasn't supposed to go down like this. I-I just wanted to see Andrea. Curse my weak will... But... It was like whoa..."
Cloud: This the place?
Aerith: Think so.
"Cloud: Lemme handle this. You wait out here, okay?"
"Aerith: And why would I do that? No, I'm coming with."
Cloud: I'm not really sure that
"Aerith: You're a man of many talents, but ""talking"" isn't one of them."
"Johnny: I mean, shit..."
Aerith: Whoa... (chuckles)
Receptionist: Good evening.
Aerith: Heya.
Receptionist: Welcome to the heart and soul of Wall Marketthe Honeybee Inn. Is there a honeyboy or girl whose company you desire?
Cloud: We're here to see Andrea Rhodea.
"Receptionist: Ahhh, the shining star of the Honeybee Inn. Now, are you the one who made the appointment, sir? Can I have your name?"
"Cloud: Oh, we don't have an appointment."
"Receptionist: I see...I'm terribly sorry, sir. An appointment is required, and the earliest available slot is three years from now."
Aerith: Three years!?
Cloud: All we want is five minutes. He can spare that.
Aerith: I need his help for the Corneo audition.
"Receptionist: Yes, well, regardless of the circumstances, you cannot meet him without an appointment."
Aerith: Is there really no other way?
"Receptionist: It is rare, but Mr. Rhodea does occasionally extend invitations to individuals who catch his eye. Otherwise, I'm sorry, but there really is nothing that can be done."
"Aerith: I guess that's that, then. Ah well. Let's try someone else."
Receptionist: I'm sorry that I couldn't be of more help to you.
Aerith: I guess they're closed right now?
Johnny: The hell is this bullshit? I ain't payin' that much!
"Madam M: Well this ain't a charityso if you don't have the gil to pay, then get the hell out!"
"Madam M: Welcome, welcome. Just the two of you? Step right up. Now then, what manner of massage do you desire?"
Aerith: Say what?
"Madam M: This your first time in our establishment? We are a hand-massage parlor. An excess of fatigue and tension can make even the simplest task a terrible strain. It is our pleasure to relieve our patrons of that tension. (chuckles) And what better way to seek relief than through the skilled ministrations of a professional? So now that we understand each other, what manner of massage do you desire?"
Cloud: We're not customers.
Madam M: Then you are...?
Aerith: Hoping you can help us get an invite to an audition with Don C
Madam M: Oh for the love of Say another word and I'll shove this fan right down your throat!
"Madam M: This is the last thing I need. You're young and stupid, and I suppose that means you think I'll let you off easy. So you want what? A favor? Well, here's the thing... This is a massage parlora respectable establishment. But if you don't require our services... Then tell me! Is there any reason I shouldn't have you dragged outside and shot for wasting my valuable time!? Well!?"
Madam M: Hm. Name?
Cloud: ...Cloud Strife.
Madam M: Hand.
Cloud: Huh?
Madam M: Give it to me!
"Madam M: The strong, firm hands of a fighter...yet they possess a certain elegance and grace. Okay, Cloud. Let's see what you're made of. After that...we'll talk."
Madam M: So. Which course will it be?
On-screen: Choose which course?
"Madam M: Hmph! If you're not a customer, then get out."
"Madam M: Ready to take the plunge, are we."
Madam M: Hey! You don't have enough for that. Why don't you choose a course you can actually afford?
Madam M: (chuckles) Then make your way to the room in the back...and wait.
Aerith: Cloud...
Madam M: This exclusive treatment is reserved for our most well-to-do patrons... First...the hand cream... A generous coating for each and every one of your richly deserving fingers...
Madam M: Let's start...with the tips... That's it. Relax. I'm only here to help.
Madam M: Oh? Did that hurt?
Cloud: No...
Madam M: Then I'll move on...to the base of the fingers... Let's see if we can't improve your circulation. Get that blood flowing.
"Madam M: No, don't fight it. Stress is poison to the body. And finally...some gentle simulation for the palm. No more than a touch. Just like this."
Madam M: Oh? What was that? A cry of pleasure? Is this how you like it? How about this? Or maybe this?
"Madam M: If that was to your liking, do come again."
Cloud: Right.
Madam M: Well then. It should go without saying that you get what you pay for. All four fingers at once. Quick and to the point.
Cloud: Little rough.
Madam M: Hm? I can stop at any time if it's too much to handle.
Madam M: Try flexing the muscles. You'll feel the difference.
Madam M: Loose and limber. Am I right?
Cloud: Actually... Yeah...
Madam M: I should warn you. This technique has certain risks. It's somewhat...experimental. You may find it extremely pleasurable and rewarding. Or the opposite.
Cloud: Wait!
"Madam M: Absolutely not. You asked for this, now take it like a man!"
Cloud: Everything...hurts...
Aerith: How was it?
Cloud: Huh?
Aerith: You okay?
Cloud: Yeah...
"Aerith: You're acting weird, Cloud."
Cloud: I am?
Aerith: Really weird.
"Cloud: S'alright, I guess."
Aerith: What are you doing?
Cloud: Flexing.
Aerith: Flex-ing...?
Cloud: Uh... Never mind.
Cloud: Not now. Maybe not ever.
Aerith: Did something happen to you in there?
Cloud: Just...just give me a sec.
Aerith: Just one?
Cloud: Maybe a few minutes.
Madam M: Think you'll make a habit of it?
Madam M: All right then. I think I've seen everything I need to see.
Aerith: So...
Madam M: Tell me what you want and we'll take it from there.
"Aerith: You're one of the Trio, right? I want to get into Corneo's next audition."
Madam M: And why in the world would you want to do that? Hmmm... Okay.
Aerith: Really!?
Madam M: But. You cannot go dressed like that.
Aerith: Huh?
Madam M: I could never send Corneo a candidate wearing such a plain-looking getup. Doing so would call my position as one of the Trio into question.
Aerith: Is something wrong with my outfit?
On-screen: How is Aerith's outfit?
"Cloud: It's alright, I guess."
"Aerith: (chuckles) Oh, you."
"Cloud: It's comfortable, isn't it?"
"Aerith: Cloud, the fashion critic."
Cloud: It matter what I think?
Aerith: Well I think it's pretty cool.
"Madam M: Look, just...take it outside the parlor, would you?"
"Aerith: Sorry, we'll stop. So...what should I do about the outfit?"
"Madam M: You just leave that to me. I'll put you in a dress so fabulous, you'll look like a million gil. So long as you can afford it."
Cloud: How much?
"Madam M: What I said. But don't worry. It's obvious you can't afford a dress with that kind of price tag. So listen. I have an idea. There's an underground colosseum in this town. Up for a fight, Cloud? Good, because I'm getting you into that arena. If you win the tournament, I'll transform Aerith into a drop-dead gorgeous beauty."
Cloud: There any prize money?
Madam M: Yesfor the person who got you in. So? What do you say?
Cloud: All right.
"Madam M: That's what I like to hear. You'll need this. They're already letting fighters inside. You should hurry, run along."
Madam M: Remember: you are going to win me that money.
Aerith: What have we gotten ourselves into?
Cloud: Nothing good. I wouldn't expect a fair fight in this town...
Aerith: Think we can win it all?
Cloud: That's one thing I'm definitely sure of.
"Aerith: I appreciate the confidence, just...don't get too cocky, okay?"
"Staff: Spectators, please enter from the right, and contenders from the left."
"Johnny's Father: Wall Market really is one helluva town, isn't it? I'm sure my son Johnny learned a lot of lessons about life right here. The hard way, of course. Oh, my beautiful boy! As your father, and as someone who's been where you are, I look forward to seeing the man you become."
"Johnny's Father: I heard there was some sort of tournament going on. That must be why it's so crowded. It almost made me miss a chance to get a ticket to my favorite place. What's that? Oh, I could never tell!"
Staff: What's this? You're here to compete? I hope you know you're cutting it really close. Sothe two of you are a team?
"Cloud: Team? No, it's just me"
Aerith: Yes! The two of us are a team!
"Aerith: I need to get into that audition, but I won't let anyone else fight my battles for me. That includes you, mister."
"Staff: All right, team it is. Head to the waiting area down below."
Staff: You need to take the elevator down. Don't keep 'em waiting.
"Aerith: Down, down, down we go."
"Aerith: So how deep does this thing go, you think?"
Aerith: I wonder how many people are fighting.
"Aerith: Hey, you're not nervous, are you?"
Cloud: Nope.
Aerith: Really? You're even more quiet than usual.
Cloud: Just trying to focus. Like you should.
"Staff: Hey, lovebirds! Over here!"
Scotch: In the city that never sleeps!
Kotch: In the paradise of debauchery and sinof pain and pleasure!

Staff: You twowait here until it's time.
"Gatekeeper: Uh, it's not your turn yet. Your names will be announced over the speaker. Just wait until then."
Johnny: Oh... You again.
Aerith: Ouch! What happened to your face?
"Johnny: I just needed a little scratch, you know? So I signed up for the preliminaries, and well... I hope you guys realize what you're getting into. I don't wanna scare you but if you can make a run for it, you should."
Announcer: Cloud and Aerith. Your match will begin shortly. Please make your way to the gate.
Aerith: We're in way too deep to back out now.
Johnny: Never been more scared in my entire life.
"Johnny: It's a gift from Don Corneo. Drink it, and they say you'll be raring to go for hours on end. If I had, maybe things would've gone differently for me. Maybe you should. It's yours if you want."
On-screen: Taste mystery drink?
Aerith: How is it?
Cloud: It's thick...
"Aerith: But you...like it so much you couldn't possibly share, right?"
Gatekeeper: You two ready?
On-screen: Participate in the first round?
Gatekeeper: Come on! Hurry it up!
Gatekeeper: Try not to get yourselves killed.
"Scotch: For our next match, we welcome two fightersa young couple, no less!"
Kotch: Talk about a bad date!
Scotch: This is their first tournmanet!
Kotch: A bad first date!
"Scotch: And most likely their last, inexperienced as they areor are they!? Give it up for Cloud and Aerith!"
Kotch: Booo! Get lost! Go home! You suck!
"Spectator (1): ""Couple""!? Get outta here with that lovey-dovey bullshit!"
"Spectator (2): 'Sup with the pole!? Gonna do a little dance for us, baby girl?"
Aerith: Okay. Now I'm mad.
"Kotch: Their opponentone of Wall Market's own, a renowned master of beasts! Will his pets make a meal of our two challenges before our very eyes?"
Scotch: They've already been given their appetizer!
"Kotch: Their hunger for flesh and fear is unquenchablethe demon dogs of hell, the Sanguine Stalkers!"
"Staff: No, please!"
Beastmaster: Feast!
Aerith: You brought animals?
"Beastmaster: Oh? First-timers, huh? There's no rule that says you gotta fight man-to-man."
"Scotch: We're in for a treat, ladies and gentlemen! Who will prevail in this brutal contest between man and beast!? This could be over in an instant, so don't even blink! Without further ado, the fourth match of the first round...begins now!"
Scotch: Can you believe it!? I don't think anyone saw this coming!
Kotch: What a completely unexpected turn of events!
Scotch: And the winners of our match are...Cloud and Aerith!
"Announcer: Contenders, please return to your waiting room."
Aerith: Well that's one win down. Go team!
Aerith: What's wrong?
Cloud: The rules don't make sense.
"Aerith: Yeah, true. But maybe it'll be better in the next match?"
"Cloud: Nah, wouldn't bet on it. Better to expect the worst."
Announcer: Cloud and Aerith. Your match will begin shortly. Please make your way to the gate.
Gatekeeper: That's what they call beginner's luck. But the next match won't be so easy. Ready to rock?

"Scotch: For the second match in our spectacular semifinals... Fresh from their first date with death, I present...the lucky couple!"
"Kotch: More like ""unlucky"" for the rest of us!"
Scotch: Give it up once again for Cloud and Aerith!
"Spectator (1): ""Couple"" my ass! The hell you two tryin' to pull!?"
Spectator (2): You assholes cost me a fortune!
"Kotch: Their opponentsreavers of the scrapyard, thieves and killers through and through! Too criminal for common criminalsthe worst of the worst!"
"Scotch: Ladies and gentlemen, check your pockets, because they may have already robbed you blind!"
Kotch: The most contemptible sons of bitches this side of Wall MarketBeck's Badasses!
"Aerith: Hey, it's those guys."
Burke: Hey... It's those guys!
"Beck: Well, hot damn! Been fixin' to feed you two your just desserts! So open wide, 'cause we're gonna serve up a heapin' helpin'!"
"Butch: Hey, what do ""just desserts"" taste like?"
Beck: Likejustice! Likepayback!
Aerith: Huh? More of 'em?
Scotch: And who are these unscrupulous-looking gentlemen?
Kotch: It would seem that there are actually eight members of Beck's Badasses!
Aerith: Hey! That's cheating!
"Beck: The only rule here is that there are no rules! If Corneo says it's okay, then you gotta suck it up!"
Kotch: The don has granted his approval!
Aerith: This is ridiculous!
Kotch: The odds are overwhelmingly stacked against them!
"Scotch: This could be a real bloodbath! So I implore you, ladies and gentlemendon't look away, or you may miss the best part!"
Kotch: The second match of the Corneo Cup's semifinals...begins now!
Kotch: Un-freaking-believable! What the hell did I just see!?
"Scotch: It was two against, uh, I don't remember who many exactly, but a lot! But somehow, the winners of our match are... Once again! Cloud and Aerith!"
Sam: That kid's really something.
"Madam M: Well, of course he is. I did give him a massage you know. His palm told quite the tale. He's cheated death more than a few times..."
"Sam: So have half the people in this town. Anyway, we're both still alive. Call it?"
"Madam M: There you go again. One of these days your ""luck"" is going to run out."
"Sam: When I fall from grace, maybe I'll land in your parlor once more."
Madam M: That is one mistake I willneverrepeat.
"Honeygirl: You gotta admit, Andithe way he moves istotally amazing!"
Honeygirls: Andi!
Aerith: Next up: the big finale.
Cloud: Yeah.
Aerith: I thought you'd be happier.
Cloud: Just thinking about what we might face next.
"Aerith: But you know, we've made it this far. I'm sure we can handle anything they throw at us."
Butch: Does...this mean I don't gots to play dead no more?
"Beck: Damn, you two arereallysomethin' else. I could use that kinda muscle in my gang."

"Kotch: This has never! I can't believe it! And the winners of the Corneo Cupthe deadly and dynamic duo, Cloud and Aerith!"
Madam M: My condolences.
Sam: Hmph.
Madam M: Oh! You're taking this rather well. I was looking forward to a little temper tantrum.
"Sam: When you bet it all on a toss, sometimes you get burned by lady luck. Every coin has two sides."
Madam M: You're right of courseeven if they are both the same.
Sam: Later.
"Madam M: And now, I believe I have a prize to collect."
"Leslie: Sorrythe madam will have to wait. The don's demanding that we tack on one more match, it seems."
Madam M: What?
"Leslie: If they win out, then you get paid in full."
Madam M: Now hold on just a goddamn minute!
"Leslie: His call, not mine."
"Aerith: Now that that's over, we can go save Tifa."
"Cloud: So we'll head back to Madam M's, get you changed, and then it's off to Corneo's."
Aerith: Right!
Madam M: Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. But...you still have one fight left.
Aerith: What do you mean?
"Madam M: The crowd loved your show a little too much. People were placing hefty bets, much heftier than you can possibly imagine. Corneo's going to milk this for as much as he can."
Cloud: Meaning what?
"Madam M: You face and defeat Corneo's fighter of choice, and only then will you be declared winners of the tournament."
Aerith: Hey! That wasn't the deal!
Madam M: Don't you think I know that!? (groans) You greedy bastard! Scum-sucking piece of shit festering asshole!
"Madam M: (sighs) But that's the way it is. Corneo's the one who makes the rules around here. But if you win this match, Corneo will have to accept your victory. And the crowd will make sure he does."
Cloud: So this is the last one?
Madam M: I sure hope so.
"Madam M: Go on, now. That prize money is going to pay for your dress."
Gatekeeper: Watching you guys fight gave me goose bumps. Hope your next match is even better than the last! Ready to kick ass!?
On-screen: Participate in the bonus match?
"Gatekeeper: Hey, consecutive matches are tough. Take all the time you need to rest."
Gatekeeper: Ready to kick ass!?
"Gatekeeper: It's not even about the money anymore, man. I just want you guys to win it all! Show 'em what you got!"
"Scotch: Tonight's Corneo Cup has been a spectacle like no other. And we shared your disappointment, ladies and gentlemen, when we told you that it was coming to an end."
Kotch: But nobody felt it more keenly than one Don Corneo...who has decided that a bonus match is in order!
Scotch: Participating in this match will be this evening's leading lightsthe dynamic duo that has crushed all competition thus far! Cloud and Aerith!
Spectator (1): Cloud! Cloud! Over here! Look at them! They're so adorable!
"Spectator (2): You're the man, Cloud!"
Spectator (3): Aerith! I love you! Marry me!
"Kotch: Their opponent! Buried in the bowels of the colosseum... An unspeakable horror, long imprisoned, set free tonight for your entertainment!"
Scotch: The secret star of Don Corneo's stellar stable!
Kotch & Scotch: Enter: the Hell House!
Aerith: Huh?
Aerith: It's just...a house.
Cloud: That's no ordinary house!
"Kotch: The manifestation of pure evil versus the most badass couple this side of Midgarhave you ever seen a fight more incredible, more epic!?"
"Scotch: You have not! No sir, you have not!"
Kotch: They'll be singing songs about tonight for generations to come!
"Scotch: Keep your eyes glued to the action, ladies and gentlemen!"
"Kotch: The Cup's final, final battle..."
Kotch & Scotch: Begins...now!
"Kotch: The battle is joined, and already I can tell you this bonus match will not disappoint!"
"Scotch: This couple has fought the toughest of the tough, the meanest of the mean, but can they handle the horror of the Hell House!?"
"Kotch: Who will come out on top!? Strap yourselves in, folks, 'cause this show is only getting started!"
Kotch: That had to hurt! Has our dynamic duo already found this house's major design flaw!?
Kotch: A heroic move by Aerith as she provides support for her partner! Savor that healing wind!
Scotch: Let it wash over yourestore you inside and out!
Kotch: We have a special guest that wants to kick things up a notch! But don't get too closeyou can't handle his heat!
Scotch: Feel that raging fire! Can the Hell House weather the inferno!?
"Kotch: Tearing through the colosseum like a tornado, a moogle and chocobo!"
"Scotch: Don't be fooled by their cute looks, because they're here to kick ass and take names!"
"Kotch: Grab your coats, folks! You're gonna wanna bundle up for this! We've got the queen of ice herself coming in for a meet and greet. What a beauty!"
Scotch: That frosty stare could strike a man dead where he stands. Maybe I'll be the lucky victim!
Kotch: A fat chocobo from the heavyweight division joins the combatants in the arena! I think the feathers are about to fly!
"Scotch: Will our big-boned birdie make a meal of the Hell House? Will he gobble it right up? Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum!"
Kotch: The spiteful dragon of the sea is here in the arena! I'm warning you folks: youwillget wet!
"Scotch: Hold on tight, ladies and gentlemen, for the fury of the ocean might swallow you whole!"
Kotch: What? Do my eyes deceive me? The king of dragons has graced us with his royal presence!
"Scotch: I hope you have insurance, because safety isnotguaranteed. None of us may make it out of here alive!"
Kotch: Cloud is shakenand stirred! I bet he's not gonna be standing for much longer!
Scotch: Cloud has seen better days! Can he keep fighting the good fight or is he ready to throw in the towel!?
"Scotch: Ouch, that's gotta hurt. Aerith gets a double dose of neighborly hatred!"
Scotch: And Aerith is down for the count!
"Kotch: Can you hear that, Midgar? Aerith fans are not happy!"
Scotch: And Aerith is down for the count!
Kotch: Aerith is down for the count!
Kotch: This housewarming party is putting their love to the test! Are they strong enough to pull through?
"Scotch: I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but this is painful to watch!"
"Scotch: Batten down the hatches, folks, because a storm is brewing on the horizon!"
"Scotch: And the winner, the man-eating monstrosity, the horror, the Hell House!"
Kotch: The babe and beautiful Cloud and Aerith would be champions reduced to food for the beast. We will never forget your sacrifice!
"Scotch: Oof, that color is a dead giveaway! The architect must've had one too many when he designed this thing!"
Kotch: The Hell House is d-d-d-down! Cloud is taking control of the fight and is really showing this building who's boss!
"Kotch: Whoa! And in a stunning turn of events, the Hell House has come to a complete stop!"
Kotch: And the Hell House is down! Will this be the end for our quaint living space of evil?
Cloud: Wait!
Madam M: It's almost disappointing.
Andrea: No. Not yet...
Scotch: Ladies and gentlemen! What is happening!?
Aerith: What the
Cloud: Look out!
Kotch: Just try and call this house warm and inviting now! We dare ya! We double-dog dare ya!
Scotch: The Hell House is showing us itstruepaint job! How will Aerith and Cloud adapt?
Kotch: Who has been caught in the Hell House's sights!?
"Scotch: If you wanna know what's in the box, you'll just have to open it up and see!"
"Kotch: The Hell House has welcomed its first guest! What kind of party is it!? I don't know, but I'm glad I wasn't invited!"
"Kotch: And with that, the gateway to hell slams shut!"
"Kotch: This house is hungry, and it's about to chow down on the competition!"
"Scotch: What is going on in there!? Only time will tell, but I'm not sure we wanna know!"
"Kotch: A miraculous escape from our courageous contender! But from the looks of it, they had a pretty wild time in there!"
Kotch: And Cloud is back with us once again...or is he!? The masticating mansion did a real number on the man!
Kotch: The Hell House is ready to shove its message of hate down their throats!
"Kotch: Oh, man! Did anyone get the number of that house!?"
Scotch: The Hell House isn't afraid to fight dirty!
"Scotch: Now that had to hurt, folks! Are these moves even legal!?"
Kotch: What a brutal hit by the Hell House! There's no way that didn't hurt!
Kotch: Talk about making an impact! The Hell House is absolutely tearing it up tonight!
Kotch: Cloud and Aerith with a stunning reversal! The Hell House is dead in the water!
Scotch: Nowthatis the price you pay for daring to get in the way of true love!
Scotch: The Hell House isn't afraid to fight dirty!
"Kotch: The lovebirds are going hard at the house, but they'll have to do better than that if they wanna razethisroof!"
"Kotch: Well, that sure ain't workin'!"
Kotch: Nope! Not gonna cut it!
Kotch: Not even so much as a flinch!
Kotch: The barrier's still holding! Does our dynamic duo have what it takes to defeat the security of this high-tech home!?
Kotch: Our favorite couple is about to get a face full of flame! Is there any way to escape the heat!?
"Kotch: Here comes the windup, folks! Brace for impact!"
Scotch: There'll be no coming back from this one!
Kotch: Looks like our couple's in for another round of musical chairs!
"Scotch: Another barrage of chaos coming in hot, folks! Will this turn the tide against them!?"
Scotch: Where'd these chairs come from? Who do they belong to? Who needs all those chairs? I have so many questions!
Kotch: Stuffed animals are available at the colosseum gift shop. The perfect present for friends and family! Available only while supplies last so act fast!
"Kotch: Liftoff! We have liftoff! Ladies and gentlemen, are you seeing this!? The world's first flying house!"
"Scotch: What's this? The ol' switcheroo? As usual, the Hell House is up to no good!"
Kotch: This house has had enough of the neighborhood riffraff!
Kotch: Our tremendous twosome has put on their hard hats! They know exactly what they need to do to make this house come crashing down!
Scotch: They're bringing that high-flying house back down to earth!
"Kotch: Well, wouldja look at this! A gift from the selfless and generous Don Corneo himself!"
Scotch: Cloud and Aeriththey stand poised to win it all!
"Kotch: The crowd is going wild, but no amount of applause is gonna bring this house down!"
Kotch: Are we witnessing the final moments of the wicked Hell House!?
Aerith: We did it!
Kotch: And the winners
Scotch: And champions
Kotch & Scotch: Cloud and Aerith!
Madam M: Yay! Yes!
Andrea: That boy...
"Madam M: Awfully rare, you showing an interest in someone. What will you do?"
"Gatekeeper: There you are. I've been looking for you two. So Madam M wanted me to give you a message. She says you guys did pretty damn good, and that you should swing by her shop when you're done here. Got it? I was also hoping you might be interested in a few more matches here at the colosseum. Big events like the Corneo Cup are pretty sporadic, but there's always action if you wanna get a piece."
Gatekeeper: Huh? You wanna take me up on my offer now? Cool! Then I'll see you down below.
"Gatekeeper: Hey, been waiting for ya. Sowhat're ya in the mood to fight?"
"Souvenir Shop Owner: With these babies, you can send intruders flying! I guarantee this is the only home protection you'll ever need!"
Souvenir Shop Owner: Only a few left. Get yours while you can!
Staff (1): Why didn't you tell me you guys were gonna kick so much ass! Can I get your autographs?
Staff (2): Congratulations on the win! You know tonight's tournament is going down in history!
Staff (3): Watching you win was so inspiring! It made me want to fight too!
"Madam M: You're here. Good. I have everything I need to get started. Just one thing before we do. You'retheCloud, right? Cloud the merc?"
"Madam M: Hah! Well that's what you call yourself I'm told, but what've you actually done for the people of Sector 5, hmm? There's this little thing called karma. How a person treats others dictates how they themselves should be treated. And believe meI'll get you the dress that you earned."
"Madam M: I've heard a few stories about you helping out the people of Sector 5. If you don't mind me saying so, though, you could be doing a little bit more. The rule of karma is highly respected in the slums. A somewhat decent person deserves a somewhat decent dress. But really, let's not kid ourselves. Corneo's not even gonna look at what she's wearing."
"Madam M: I'm told you did a wonderful job helping the people of Sector 5. You have a very impressive work ethic. It's like they say, ""Good things come to those who work."" What goes around, comes aroundand in ways that might surprise you. I'm gonna put Aerith in the most gorgeous dress you've ever seen. It'll be a real jaw-dropper."
"Madam M: All right. Now that that's out of the way... Once you change, you won't be able to leave town. Are you sure you're ready?"
On-screen: Have Aerith get changed?
"Madam M: All right, then. Let's get started. Beauty takes a lot of work and preparation, far more than you'd know. In the meantime, let me see, let me think..."
"Madam M: Huh!? Don't waste my time! If you have things to do, then get out there and do them!"
"Madam M: Like I said, once you change, you won't be able to leave town. Are you sure you're ready now?"
Madam M: Hurry. It. Up!
Madam M: There oughta be things you can only do without your friend. Now's your chance to get out and have some fun. I can tell you're already beginning to feel at home here. Though being so new to it I assumed you still wouldn't know how to enjoy yourself properly. So I went and had a chat with Sam. He said he'd be happy to help you out.
Cloud: Hey. No one asked you to do that.
Madam M: But there's so much you don't know! This is the perfect opportunity for you to learn the ways of the world and man the hell up!
Madam M: You look like you haven't experienced the best of what this town has to offer. That really won't do.
Cloud: Not interested.
"Madam M: Then maybe you can show the town what you have to offer instead. Which is to say, why don't you try putting those finely honed mercenary skills of yours to good use here in Wall Market? I have a few little requests that you might be able to help out with. I gave that hand extra-special treatment. Now get out there and show me what you can do with it."
"Madam M: And that's enough of that. Aerith, come with me."
Aerith: Oh boy! I can't wait to see the dress!
"Madam M: The dress is part of it, sure...but we'll also need to do something about that plain-Jane makeup and hairdo. This is gonna take some work."
"Aerith: Ouch! Well, I'll see you later, Cloud!"
Madam: Peek and I'll poke out your eyes.
Sam: Howdy. Madam M said you'd be swinging by. Lemme see if I've got this straight. You ditched your lady friend and fellow champion to have a boy's night out in Wall Market?
"Sam: Kidding! If I know the madamand I dothis was all her idea. I can see why. There's no denying you're skilled with a sword, but when it comes to damn near anything else, well...can't help but have my doubts. Ain't nothing wrong with that, but then there's nothing wrong with expanding your horizons neither. Seeking new experiences. Knowing the ways of this here world will help you to better protect her while you're in it. Reckon I've got a few solid gigs for you. Whaddya say? You game?"
"Cloud: ...Yeah, why not."
"Sam: (chuckles) That's the spirit. You have yourself a grand time tonight, mister merc."
Ronnie: Never seen you before.
Jay: Here to work out? Put some muscle on that bony frame of yours?
"Jules: Cloud! Been waitin' for you to show up. Thanks for coming, and welcome to our humble training hall. Juleshead trainer. If you've got some time to spare, how about a little bit of fun? Wanna try taking on one of our guys?"
"Ronnie: Hah! You're not serious, are you? Look at him! He's a scrawny little thing. I could snap him like a twig!"
"Jules: Now, nowI wouldn't judge this one by his muscle mass. What do you say, Cloud? If you wanna give it a go, just let me know."
Jules: So? You up for a round?
On-screen: Squats: Trainee
"Ronnie: Ha! You're taking me on? You look like a dried-up old terpsicolt left out in the sun. You got no idea what you're getting into, little man."
"Jules: All right, enough talk. We'll settle this the tried-and-true traditional way: a squat-off. Now, let's all see what you've got."
Ronnie: Now don't go crying to mommy.
Ronnie: How? How the hell did I lose to this scrawny little kid who looks like he doesn't even consume his daily recommended amount of protein?
"Jules: Ronnieyou know it's all about quality, not mass. You're too quick to judge people by their build. That, and your overtrained ego are the main reasons you lost to our bold challenger here!"
"Jules: Thanks for helping me teach my boys a valuable lesson. And sorry for dragging you into it. Cloud, we're all one big family here at this gym, and now you're part of it. If you're ever up for training, our doors are always open to you. Let's work together to maintain healthy mindsandbodies."
"Jules: If you're ever in the mood for another workout, just talk to Jay or Ronnie."
"Jay: You wanna go, do ya? All right then, bring it on!"
On-screen: Squats: Amateur
Jay: Bringing everything I've got.
Jay: No!
"Jay: You did it, you really beat me. You gotta be in incredible shape!"
Jules: (laughs) It's unfair that you guys are having all the fun. What do you say? May I have this squat?
On-screen: Squats: Pro
Jules: I won't go easy on you.
Ronnie: Just how much training do you do!?
Ronnie: You're better than I thought!
Jay: You are in the zone!
Jay: Poetry in motion!
"Jay: Slow and steady! One-two, one-two!"
Jay: I can't get enough of those beautiful muscles!
"Jay: You can do it, Jules! We're rooting for you!"
Ronnie: I believe in you!
Jay: Who'da thought it'd bethisclose?
"Ronnie: Oh, man! Who's gonna win this one? It's too close to tell!"
Jules: You gotta loosen up. You're way too tense.
"Jules: I had no idea how strong you really were. You truly are something, aren't you?"
"Jules: Listen up, everyone. We can be stronger, better. Let's hit those weights!"
"Gym Members: You got it, Jules!"
"Johnny: Wait up, Cloud! Sam caught me up on everything. He said you're gonna go rescue Tifa. And to do that, you're trying to learn all about Wall Market. Bro, I know this town like the back of my hand, so I can answer all of your questions! Now, let's go knock this one out! The bar's this way, Cloud."
"Johnny: Drunkards', here we go!"
"Johnny: Uh, are we even allowed to walk through the door? I'm getting a ""regulars only"" kinda vibe."
"Johnny: It's mostly the same folks every night, so... Whoa! You can't just waltz in there uninvited! Listen, there are rules for this kind of"
Johnny: Hey! Old dude!
"Clothing Store Owner: Huh...? Son, is that you? Did you always look so...moronic?"
"Johnny: Wha? Well, right back at ya! Ugh, whatever. We're here to take you back to the store."
Clothing Store Owner: I'm not going back! Not ever! My life is ruined. It's over. Kill me now!
"Johnny: Come on, there's no need to talk like that, old dude! I'll help you out with whatever you need!"
"Clothing Store Owner: Really? Oh, thank you, son! See, I made this bet with the materia merchanta sure thingbut then I lost... And so I had no choice but to steel my heart and surrender my precious inspiration!"
Johnny: Your precious inspir-who with the what now?
"Clothing Store Owner: INSPIRATION! Without it, there's simply no point in me ever going back to the store..."
"Johnny: Got it! I mean, I don't got it, but... I just need to get your inspiration back, right? Whatever the hell that is. Leave it to me, old dude!"
"Clothing Store Owner: Uh, hey... Aren't you gonna go with your friend?"
"Johnny: I've never actually been inside, now that I think about it."
"Johnny: I don't even really know how people use materia. They're just, like, huge orbs of...something."
"Johny: This place looks kinda creepy, don't you think? Like maybe they practice ritual sacrifice or..."
"Johnny: Hey, wait for me!"
"Johnny: Sooo...this is it, huh?"
Materia Vendor: And wadda you two want?
"Johnny: I'm here for the ""precious inspiration"" you took from the old dude."
"Materia Vendor: Inspiration...? Oh, that thing. But I didn't ""take"" it, I won it fair and square. It's mine by rights now."
"Johnny: Well, that's true!"
Materia Vendor: But I tell you what. I'll consider giving it back in exchange for...a favor.
Johnny: ...Whatcha need?
"Materia Vendor: Something only...""real men"" can deliver. I need you to go and get me something from the vending machine at the inn. You know what. You know!"
"Johny: No, I don't think I... Wait. The Sauce!"
Cloud: The Sauce?
"Materia Vendor: Stop saying ""the Sauce!"" ...Anyway. Good luck."
Johnny: The time has come...for me to wield my powers of assessment!
"Materia Vendor: Wait, you haven't even gone there yet? Well, I guess I can't force you to go..."
"Barker: I have the perfect room for the both of you! Just say the word, and I'll show you to it!"
"Johnny: Huh!? No no no, we're not here for that!"
"Barker: Say what? If you don't need a room, then what the hell do you want?"
"Johnny: I wish I was here with Tifa. No offense, bro."
"Johnny: That's it. That's the one! It looks like a regular old vending machine, right? But wait! You ready for this? All right. This particular model has secret buttons."
Cloud: Where?
"Johnny: Well...I can't tell youit's a secret! You just need to tap into your knowledge and expertiselike, grab it and whip it out! And then you'll be able to see everything?"
"On-screen: Use Assess to find the secret buttons? (The higher the materia usage, the luckier you may be.)"
"Cloud: I don't need to ""whip it out."" I've done this before. Watch this."
"Johnny: Whoa, look at you, bro!"
"Johnny: Huh? Is this the Sauce? I dunno... Come on, bro! You know there are more hidden buttons waiting to be pushed!"
Johnny: Oh... So this is the Sauce. Neato... It-it's time. The last button...
Johnny: The Sauce! P-put it away! Put it away before someone sees you! No one can know that we have it!
Vending Machine: You're the grand prize winner! Have a special prize!
Johnny: (screams) Don't scare me like that! Whatever! We got what we came here for. Let's get outta here and head to the materia guy!
"Johnny: Uh, is it me, or is everyone looking at us...? So this is what it feels like to be a champ."
"Johnny: Come on, bro! Hurry up! Let's show him what we brought back from our little trip into the weird!"
Materia Vendor: Ohh! It's you two!
"Johnny: It's time, bro! The Sauce."
Materia Vendor: Could it be...? It is! The Sauce! The Sauce! Whoa... Never thought I'd live to see the day...
Cloud: It's just sauce. No big deal.
Materia Vendor: Don't sell yourself short! This is only given to one who is truly a man among men.
Cloud: I know.
"Johnny: Damn, bro! That's why you're such an awesome dude!"
"Materia Vendor: Oh, right... Hate to break it to you, but that thing you were looking for? Not here. It's long, long gone."
Johnny: You shittin' me!?
Materia Vendor: Nope. Sorry. As I recall...the guy who runs the restaurant should have it.
"Johnny: Ugh... Well, I guess we know where we're headed next. Come on, bro!"
"Materia Vendor: Well, that's that. Time to polish the ol' orbs, give them a spit shine so they positively sparkle!"
"Johnny: Restaurant up next, huh? Getting kinda hungry, actually. Do you smell that? I think it's coming from over there."
"Materia Vendor: Oh! An honor as always, sir!"
"Johnny: Let's see what's on the menu today. Meat, fish, and...ooh, that special looks good."
"Johnny: Man, I like seriously don't know which one to get! I'm a decisive, but when it comes to food, it's a different story."
"Johnny: Hey, wait for me! I still don't know what I wanna order yet!"
Restaurant Owner: Welcome! Feel free to take any open seats.
"Johnny: Sorry, we're not here to eat. The materia guy gave you something, yeah? We want it."
"Restaurant Owner: Materia guy? Ohhh, you're here forthat. I'm surpriseddidn't take you for the type. Lemme ask you something. Either of you know anything about cooking?"
Johnny: Nope. Never cooked once.
"Restaurant Owner: That's too bad. For some reason, my food doesn't taste nearly as good as it used to. I was hoping one of you two might be able to help me figure it out. I've narrowed it down to the fridge, the stove, or the power supply, but I'm not sure what's to blame."
"On-screen: Give him advice? (The higher level your magic materia, the better advice you'll give.)"
"Johnny: Man, I seriously have no idea what it could be. This sucks."
On-screen: The problem is... (Give advice based on your strongest magic materia.)
Johnny: You know...your fridge might be broken. Maybe it's not keeping the ingredients cold enough.
Restaurant Owner: That so? You're an expert on all things ice? Okay then. Let's see if we can't fix this by fiddling with the temperature.
Restaurant Owner: Hmm... At a glance everything looks fine to me.
Restaurant Owner: Here! Eat up!
"Johnny: Man, this looks great!"
Johnny: I can't...
"Restaurant Owner: What a shame. He seemed to be enjoying the meal so I wanted to ask him what he thought. Maybe next time. Anyway, thanks for your help. Ohand here's a voucher with my apologies. Get the poor guy some medicine, will ya?"
Johnny: Drugs...I need all the drugs right now! Outta the way! Outta the goddamn way! N-no... Can't go...
Cloud: Hey. About that thing we're looking for...
Restaurant Owner: Maybe I should fine-tune the flavor moregive it something extra to punch it up? Now what did I do with those spices I ordered from Wutai? I know there's some left...
Cloud: I should help Johnny first.
"Johnny: Goodbye, cruel world..."
"Pharmacist: Hey! Off my doorstep, you bum! You're scaring away my customers."
Johnny: Sanctuary...
"Pharmacist: Hey, you. This yours?"
Cloud: Well...
"Pharmacist: Oh, that a voucher you got there? Should've said something sooner. Come on in."
Pharmacist: What is it with today? People are dropping like flies.
Cloud: Besides this dumbass?
"Pharmacist: Loads of 'em. I got enough outstanding orders to fill a book. I was about to leave and make some deliveries, but..."
Johnny: I'm gonna hurl...
"Pharmacist: Can't very well leave him alone now, can I? Hey, you're not doing much. Maybe you can deliver that medicine for me. You're, what, military or something, right? Then you must know a thing or two about dealing with the sick and injured."
"On-screen: Deliver the medicine? (The higher level your cleansing materia, the more help you'll be.)"
"Pharmacist: You're a lifesaverliterally. So, lemme see, what needs delivering... Hereneed you to deliver this to someone. You'll probably find this guy sprawled out on the ground somewhere. But make sure you check his symptoms before giving him meds."
Johnny: Can't...go on...
"Patient: It was poisoned, I tell ya. The sick sonuvabitch puts poison in his food..."
Cloud: I've got meds. Lemme take a look at you.
"Patient: Thanks, buddy! You saved my life. Here, it's not much, but it's yours. ...I'm grateful for your help but...do you think a guy could get a little privacy?"
Cloud: Should probably head back.
"Johnny: And then there was this crazy-looking house, right? And it was all like trying to kill 'em! But then Cloud was all like bing, bang, boom!"
Pharmacist: Your friend fought...a house? A house?
"Johnny: Oh, hey! Welcome back, bro."
Cloud: Better already?
"Pharmacist: Yeah, and now he won't shut up. Anyway, how'd the deliveries go?"
Cloud: I did about as much as I could.
"Pharmacist: Thanks for the help. And great work. Anyway, I promised it'd be worth your while. Here, Iv'e got something you're definitely gonna like."
Johnny: What is it?
"Pharmacist: Well, it belonged to the owner of the clothing store first. Heard from the cook that you boys been running all over town looking for this, am I right?"
"Johnny: Wait, we have? Hold up. What were we doing before all this? Oh shit! The inspiration!"
"Pharmacist: Bingo. Y'see, all us Wall Market entrepreneurs go way back. We get together for a game every night, bet all kinds of stuff. This found its way into the pool, and eventually into my possession. And now it's yours, 'cause heywhy the hell not. It's a VIP card, highly coveted and extremely rare. They're only given to a select few. Not that having it's gonna do you much good, but..."
"Johnny: Holy mother of... No way! Bro! We gotta get to the Honeyer, um, I mean Drunkards' on the double!"
Pharmacist: Tell the old man I said hi!
"Johnny: C'mon, bro. Get a move on!"
"Johnny: C'mon, c'mon, c'mon! I gotta know!"
"Johnny: You still got the inspiration, right? You didn't lose it!?"
"Johnny: My heart is beating so fast, bro. Like it's gonna burst right outta my chest!"
"Johnny: Hey, old dude. We're back!"
Clothing Store Owner: Huh? Who're you? You're no son of mine. I think.
Johnny: Special deliveryjust for you.
Clothing Store Owner: Hoho! My inspiration! You've returned to me at long last!
"Johnny: Yo, is that...what I think it is...?"
"Clothing Store Owner: Oh you bet it is. And it was hard won! I sewed dresses day and night for those ladies, until I got what I was after. A Honeybee Inn VIP card!"
Johnny: I knew it!
"Clothing Store Owner: Now make way for the VIP, boys. I don't wanna keep my ladies waiting any longer! But firstI should pick up a gift dress!"
"Johnny: Lead the way, old dude. We are comin'!"
"Johnny: Hey, how's about this?"
"Clothing Store Owner's Son: Well, thanks for bringing him back. Can't imagine what you went through. Here, you earned it."
"Johnny: Heyyou're coming, right bro? Get ready for arealWall Market education!"
Cloud: I'm done with this. Youyou can do whatever the hell you want.
"Johnny: I get it, bro. You're scared. It's only natural for people to fear the unknown. It's a pity you're not gonna join us, but I swear to you, bro, as an aspiring Wall Market connoisseur... I'm gonna go in there and get as much inspiration as I can handle. For you, bro! For you! Because Cloudyou are my one true bro. Honeybee Inn, here I come!"
"Clothing Store Owner: Inspiration, here I come!"
Clothing Store Owner's Son: Perfect example of how age has absolutely nothing to do with maturity.
Cloud: Couldn't agree more. Should probably go see Sam again.
"Clothing Store Owner's Son: My dad is one amazing designer! At least, he would be if he ever actually did some work."
"Johnny: Hey, how's about this?"
"Clothing Store Owner: What're you, crazy? This one's much better!"
"Johnny: Hot damn, old dude. Y-you made this one, too?"
"Clothing Store Owner: Now you see why all the ladies love and adore me? Tonight, you're with the VIP. I'll teach you all the right moves, all the ways to make 'em swoon!"
"Johnny: Yessir! I'll be your most loyal pupil, I swear it!"
"Clothing Store Owner: Huh? You wanna help us pick a dress? Alrighty, what d'you think of this real skimpy one here?"
"Johnny: This silky one over here's kinda nice, too!"
"Sam: So, tell me. What'd you see in our little enclave of sin and debauchery? Bet it was an eye-opening experience."
Cloud: Nothing I haven't seen before. That it for jobs?
"Sam: Not exactly. I got one more favor to ask. You wanna get Tifa out, right?"
Cloud: What's your angle?
"Sam: Heh, just get your ass to the colosseum. You'll see."
"Sam: Heh, just get your ass to the colosseum. You'll see."
"Gatekeeper: We've been waiting for you, champ!"
On-screen: Take on which challenge?
"Gatekeeper: Stands are packed, thanks to you! Now get out there and give 'em a show!"
"Gatekeeper: Lovers of bloodshed and mayhem! Your favorite champion, Cloud, is back in the ring! Right now, this boy may be hot, hot, hot... But look out, folks, 'cause these dynamite challengers may just blow the champ clean off his throne! I hope you brought shades because you're about to see some fireworks! Fighters...begin!"
"Gatekeeper: The reigning champ does it again! Was that hot enough for you, fight fans? Did the champ bring the heat!? Indeed he didhe proved there's nothing more explosive than the guns he's packing!"
"Sam: Nice going, champ. You were in fine form today. Here's your cut. You earned it."
Cloud: Not here for the cash. Tell me about Tifa.
"Sam: Ahh, Tifa... She's something of a bombshell herself, huh? Girl keeps in shape, and boy does it show."
Cloud: Hey.
"Sam: Just making an observation, that's all. Anyway, seems like you're serious about getting the poor girl out of her predicament. I could tell easy enough by the way you fought back there."
Cloud: Cut to the chase. Well? You helping or not?
"Sam: Never said I wouldopposite, even. Getting mixed up in other people's business isn't my way. Plus... As you are now, I reckon you could ride to her rescue without anybody's help. And that's the truth. You've changed since you first rolled into this here town. For the better."
"Sam: At any rate, I've said all I'm gonna say. Your lady friend oughta be done changing by now, am I right? She ain't no Tifa, but she is a firecracker. Keep her waiting too long and she might just blow up in your face."
Stablehand: The Angel of the Slums strikes again! It even says so on the card!
"Mireille: Oh, don't be an idiot! The Angel would never stoop so low as to steal from children! I'm telling you, I saw the real culprits."
Stablehand: You're saying there's multiple Angels on the loose?
Mireille: What? No there's not!
Stablehand: Then the Angel of the Slums is their leader!?
Mireille: Hell no!
Stablehand: Hmph! How can you be so sure?
Mireille: How can you!?
Mireille: Madam M told me about a merc. That you? Maybe you can help us sort this out. Some criminals have stolen a shipment of donations bound for the Leaf House. The fiends!
"Stablehand: The culprit is none other than the notorious Angel of the Slums. People worship her as some kind of folk hero, but there's no denying she's the one that done did it! I mean, look at this calling card. ""The Garden Angle Three""...? Well they must've meant to write ""Guardian Angel""!"
"Mireille: Oh, come on! ""Garden angle""!? Listen to me. I guarantee this is not the work of the Angel. I saw it with my own eyes. Three shady-looking types wandering around, scouting their mark I bet."
"Stablehand: Well if you're so sure then bring 'em here! Prove to me this wasn't the work of your beloved ""Guardian Angel""!"
"Mireille: You heard the man, merc. I've got to find those thieves to clear the Angel's nameand I need your help to do it. She would never, ever, do anything to harm the less fortunate. Find the three I saw and bring them here to me. They ran off toward the old expressway on the other side of Evergreen Park."
Mireille: The expressway's just past Evergreen Park. Hurrythose thieves've got a head start. They won't catch themselves!
Beck: (laughs) The garden angel strikes again! Suckers! And all it took was one fake card. Too easy! (laughs)
"Burke: Sucks to be you, Miss Angel, but we're stealing your name and all that sweet loot!"
Beck: Hey! It's you!
Burke: The hell you doin' comin' after us!?
Butch: Shit! Um...play dead. Play dead!
Beck: Shuddup! It's too late for that. Bring it. We're ready for you this time! Wakey wakey! Time to shine.
"Beck: Check out this brick shithouse! We picked him up at the colosseum! Gonna pay you back doublenah, quadruple for what you done to us!"
"Butch: What's a droople? I, uh...what are we doing!?"
Burke: Uh... Sh-shut up! We're kicking blondie's ass for bein' an ass!
Cloud: You're coming with me.
Stablehand: These are the Angels of the Slums...?
"Butch: Oh man, you're real stupid! We're the garden angels! Get it right!"
"Beck: Shut your trap, moron!"
"Mireille: Hmph, you don't honestly thing that the beloved Angel of the Slums could be any of these three idiots, do you?"
"Stablehand: Nah, I recognize the masks. These guys're just small-time crooks who've been pestering folks around here for a minute. Should've listened to you earlier. Sorry about this."
"Mireille: Well, you should be sorry. I'll consider us square once you've taught these boys a lesson."
Stablehand: Deal. All right. Get moving!
"Beck: Hey, watch it! Not so rough, you lummox."
"Butch: Yeah, you lummox! You lum...mucks?"
Cloud: So what about the donations? Do you need help taking them to the Leaf House?
"Mireille: Kind of you to offer, but I can manage on my own. I know these streets like the back of my hand. Better, even."
Staff: It's the Angel of the Slums! She took the don's stuff! He's gonna be pissed!
"Mireille: Well, I'll be seeing ya. Thanks to you, we can put this mess behind us. I'm grateful."
"Cloud: ""The Guardian Angel of the Slums, radiant defender of the downtrodden""...? Huh. Wonder if I'm an accomplice."
Cloud: That's enough of that. Should head on back to Madam M.
"Gatekeeper: Why hey there, champ! Got word from Madam M. She said you had time to kill before Aerith's ready for the big event. So, uh...whaddya say to taking on a little extra work while you're waiting around? We've got a helluva lotta fans clamoring to see their favorite champ go another round or ten. And something tells me they're not gonna rest until they see you kick ass again. Now get on down to the colosseum ASAP!"
"Gatekeeper: Here he is, the man of the hour!"
On-screen: Take on which challenge?
"Gatekeeper: Stands are packed, thanks to you! Now get out there and give 'em a show!"
"Gatekeeper: This challenger wanted another bite at the champ! One of Sam's favorite machines of mayhem, Cutty! He's been sharpening his blades and dreaming of payback! Can our champ come out on top again? Fighters...begin!"
Gatekeeper: Our champ stands victorious once more! Cloud wins! Cutty's quest for sweet revenge has ended in bitter defeat!
Madam M: Very nicely done! (chuckles) Here's your cutyou earned it.
"Cloud: Wait, you're here? What about Aerith?"
"Madam M: My people are working on her hair right now. I thought I'd take the opportunity to drop by and watch your match. (laughs) I have to admit, I never get tired of seeing Sam's precious toys take a beating."
Cloud: ...That right?
Madam M: I can tell by your hands you've come a long way. They're the hands of a fighter...who has found new purpose. A woman...or two? I wonder...
Cloud: Just doing what I've always done.
"Madam M: (chuckles) Anyway, Aerith should be finishing up soon. I'll go on ahead to check on her. Whenever you're ready, come back to the parlor."
On-screen: Check in on Aerith?
Johnny: Nooo!
Johnny: Cloud! Finally! Tifa! SheI Tifa! She-she'sI don't
Cloud: Take a deep breath. What about Tifa?
"Johnny: I heard Corneo was gonna audition new girls soon, and Tifa's...Tifa's gonna be I just...I-I don't know what to do."
Cloud: Well I do.
Johnny: I'll come too!
"Johnny: Hey Cloud! Bro! I can call you bro, right?"
Cloud: Nope.
"Johnny: Just wanna say, bro, that I'm totally relieved that you're looking out for Tifa. So like, how'd you get so strong anyway, bro?"
Cloud: I said
"Johnny: The way you fight, bro, is like poetry and violence! ""Bam! Bam! Whoosh whoosh!"" You know? I really wish I could be just like you. My problem is that I tend to overthink and overanalyze everything. Sobro, do you have any advice for a smart, stand-up guy like myself?"
Cloud: No.
"Johnny: Well, this is it for me. Call me crazy, but...I have a feeling that I'll just be getting in the way."
Cloud: Go find Aerith at Madam M's. Tell her to wait for me there once she's done. Think you can handle that?
Johnny: Yessir!
Leslie: You again.
"Leslie: You know that's only good for women, right?"
Cloud: Yeah. It's for Aerith.
"Leslie: Who? Oh, that girl you were with. Sorry to hear that. Well, either way, you're stuck out here, pal. I can't let you in."
Cloud: I wasn't asking for permission.
"Leslie: Wouldn't try it if I were you. Trust me, you don't wanna screw with the don. If you even think about causing trouble, he'll make sure someone pays for it. And that ""someone"" might wind up being the girl you're trying so hard to break out. Or it could wind up being someone you've never even met before. Get it? You're in the don's world now. Anyway, you've got some time. The audition won't start for a while. If you're sure you wanna go through with this, then bring the girl and the letter. But...if I were you, I wouldn't."
"Leslie: Go on, get outta here."
"Johnny: Hey, get outta the way! Quit gawking! Move it, move it! C'mon! Yo, clear the road!"
Johnny: Ma'am.
Aerith: Heya...
"Cloud: Uh, Aerith? What are you wearing?"
"Aerith: I know right? It's bad. Like, super bad. I've been trying to figure out if there was anything more I could've done with it, but..."
Cloud: Doesn't really matter if you get picked or not anyway.
"Aerith: Yeah, but still... You put a lot of work into this."
Aerith: ...Did you put a lot of work into this?
Aerith: Heya.
Cloud: Hey. What are you wearing?
Aerith: I hear Corneo likes his girls super-duper girly and dolled up. But I thought he might appreciate something a little more down to earth for a change.
"Aerith: What, you don't like it?"
Cloud: I...didn't say that.
Aerith: Then...does that mean you do like it?
Cloud: Uh...
Aerith: Heya.
Cloud: That's really...
Aerith: Yeah. Corneo's got certain...tastes. This dress is so gaudy and impossible to move in...
Cloud: Y-yeah...
Aerith: Cloud!?
Cloud: 'Scuse me.
"Cloud: Hey, wait a minute. Did Johnny forget to give you my message?"
"Aerith: The one asking me to stay put? No, I got it. I was worried about you."
"Cloud: I'm starting to think this place is more dangerous than we thought. Who knows what they'll ask you to do in this ""audition."" No way in hell I'll let you go in there by yourself."
"Aerith: By myself? Oh, don't worry, I wasn't gonna. Come on. You'll see."
"Cloud: See what, exactly?"
"Aerith: According to Madam M, you've caught the eye of a certain fabulous someone, and they'd like to meet in person."
Cloud: Huh?
Loitering Man: Look at you all dolled up and fabulous. Where are you headed tonight?
"Sweet Old Man: Well, what do we have here? You're quite the pretty little lady."
Man in Love: Huh. She's not bad at all.
Woman in Love: What? Say that again.
Man in Love: Don't be like that. You're still the most beautiful girl in the world. And I'm lucky to be with you.
"Woman in Love: Ohh, I can never stay mad at you!"
"Womanizer: Hey there, cutie. Where you headed? Why don't you let me buy you a cup of coffee?"
Critical Woman: Hmm... I give her a B for effort.
Sharp-Tongued Woman: That dress is completely overshadowing her. She's got a lot to learn.
Poet: You are like the beautiful flower that blooms under the brilliant moonlight.
Cloud: Why are we here?
"Aerith: To see the Honeybee Inn's Andrea Rhodea, and convince him to give you his stamp of approval. You said you didn't want me going alone, right? Well, with Andrea's help, you can join me. It'll be fun! And honestly, I think you'll look pretty cute in a dress."
Cloud: What!?
"Aerith: It's pretty rare for Andrea to take a personal interest in someone. At least, that's what Madam M said. Trust me, this is gonna work out great."
Cloud: Uhh...
Aerith: C'mon. Don't you wanna save Tifa?
Cloud: Wait
"Aerith: No can do, Cloud. This is our plan, and you'll learn to love it. So! Here's how I think we should approach him. Madam M said Andrea was a man who'd give anyone a fair chance to win him over. So I say we march right up to him, explain the situation, and see where that gets us. Sound good?"
Aerith: C'mon. Don't you wanna save Tifa?
Receptionist: Good evening. Welcome to the entertainment extravaganza that is the Honeybee Inn.
Cloud: We're here to see Andrea Rhodea.
Receptionist: You must be Mr. Cloud. He's waiting for you.
"Cloud: ""Mr. Cloud""?"
"Receptionist: I've been instructed to send you through without delay, sir. Please make your way to the stage in the back."
Cloud: What stage?
"Receptionist: The one in the back, sir. Straight through those doors and down the hall."
"Honeygirl: Watch the stinger, sweetie. What shape am I making?"
Johnny's Father: Hmm... It's a circle.
"Johnny's Father: Huh? Who's there? Eh, whatever... I'm havin' trouble seein' straight. What's the answer?"
On-screen: The shape is a...
"Honeygirl: Ding ding ding ding ding! That's a right answer, baby!"
"Johnny's Father: Ya did it, boyo! I'm so damn proyd of ya."
"Honeygirl: Aww, that's a wrong answer, sweetie!"
Johnny's Father: Man... You know what? You're useless...
"Johnny's Father: Oh, I getcha. Ya wanna go for round two!"
On-screen: Try again?
Johnny's Father: Huh? You're still here? But...why...?
Palmer: I'm gonna getcha!
"Customer: Oh yeah, right there. That's the stuff!"
"Honeygirl: Hey there, dollface! We've been waiting for ya! Come on in, have a seat!"
"Cloud: No, I'm not here for"
"Honeygirl: Huh? ...Oh, wait a minute. I think you might've wandered into the wrong room by mistake."
Honeygirl (1): And here's the man of the hour!
Honeygirl (2): Chosen by Andrea himself.
Honeygirl (3): Our honored guest!
On-screen: Head to the stage?
"Honeygirl (1): This is your first time, right? It's okay. Do you want to practice your dance moves first?"
Cloud: Why would I want do that?
Honeygirl (2): Andrea thought it might be a good idea.
"Honeygirl (3): Over here, c'mon now!"
Cloud: Hey! Hold on!
"Honeygirl: You've got real rhythm, mister. Move over girls, a new dancer's come to town!"
"Honeygirl: Well, you weren't...awful, I guess"
On-screen: Practice again?
"Honeygirl: C'mon, c'monthe show's about to start!"
"Madam M: My, my! Is that Cloud? Darling! I had no idea."
Honeygirl: Now you just sit tight until Andrea takes the stage!
"Andrea: Welcome to the Honeybee Inn...Cloud. You seek my approval, do you? I understand. But those who crave my favor must first prove that they know how to move."
Aerith: Woohoo!
Andrea: Think you can follow my lead?
Aerith: Woohoo! You're a start!
"Aerith: (laughs) Keep it up, Cloud! Work it!"
Aerith: C'mon Cloud! Get into it!
"Aerith: Uh, umm..."
Aerith: Nice moves! (laughs) I love it!
"Aerith: Well, you tried...?"
"Andrea: Honey...I'm in love. Yes. Yes, I will transform you into a vision of beauty. Now, without further ado, let us begin!"
Honeyboy: You werebornfor this.
Andrea: Come.
"Andrea: Perfection! True beauty is an expression of the heart. A thing without shame, to which notions of gender don't apply. Don't ever be afraid, Cloud."
Cloud: Please don't.
Cloud: Not a word.
Aerith: Not even one?
Cloud: No!
Aerith: But you're so pretty!
Aerith: Hey! Watch the way you walk.
Aerith: No time to dillydally-let's go!
Honeygirl (1): Promise to come back soon?
Honeygirl (2): Don't be a stranger!
"Honeygirl (3): After all, we honeybees need fresh flowers topollinate!"
"Critical Woman: Hey, you. We're looking for new hires. Wanna come work with us?"
"Sharp-Tongued Woman: With your looks, you could be the best in Wall Market. No, the best in Midgar if you wanted to!"
Critical Woman: We hope you decide to join us!
Sharp-Tongued Woman: You could conquer the world with those cheekbones of yours!
"Chadley: Ohhh... Ahem. Forgive me, miss, but the way you're staring at me is rather... O-oh goodness... I'm experiencing an emotional response..."
Chadley: What is this emotional response...?
Man in Love: Whoa! She is the most beautiful girl in the world.
Woman in Love: Wait a minute! I thought you said that I was the most beautiful girl.
"Man in Love: All right, thenyou'rethe most beautiful girl in the world. Butshe'sthe most beautiful girl in the entire universe!"
Woman in Love: You are such anasshole!
Man in Love: I'd like to take this moment to officially declare to you my undying love!
Woman in Love: What the hell did I ever see in you!?
"Madam M: Don't we look absolutely stunning in our dress? Not that I ever had any doubt you would, darling. I was a little pressed for time since Andrea didn't give me much notice, but I did my humble best. How could I not go the extra mile for the merc who's done so very much for me and mine. What's one more dress between friends?"
Sam: Can't say I ever understood the appeal of going to so much trouble to gussy yourself up.
"Madam M: No, you certainly do not, and I doubt that you ever will."
Sam: Wh...what's with the attitude?
"Barker: Hey there, ladies! Would you be interested in making alottamoney? You get to eat, drink, and have loads of fun! How does that sound to you!"
"Mireille: I owe you for your help. Here. I'm no fashionista, but I'm sure this'll go great with that dress of yours."
"Mireille: Oh, too good for my gifts, huh? Come on, just take it already, would you? Got these things comin' out of my ears as it is. Now get goin'. Teach that greasy slime ball a lesson he won't soon forget."
"Clothing Store Owner's Son: Hmm... You just might be the perfect ""inspiration"" my dad's been missing..."
"Jules: Came running when I heard you were putting on a show. I didn't know you were such an amazing dancer! I wouldn't recommend lifting in that outfit, but if you need to work up a sweat later, feel free to pop into the gym!"
Sweet Old Man: Am I dead? Did these beauitful angels come for me?
Kind Old Man: Are you one of them models? The ones who wear those pretty clothes?
Sweet Old Man: I feel blessed just seeing them.
Kind Old Man: I've got butterflies in my stomach! It's been a while since I felt like this.
Weapons Vendor: Your beauty is deadlier than anything I have here in my store!
"Johnny: Bro, look at you. So...how's the dress workin' out for ya? I wanted to help out. Do my part, you know? After Andrea told me the plan, I ran all over looking for...something. But, like, I don't got a lotta money..."
Johnny: Don't worry bro. You got this!
Leslie: No way.
"Aerith: Here you areletters from Andrea Rhodea and Madam M. That ought to do the trick, right?"
Leslie: You serious?
Aerith: Is there a problem?
Leslie: I hope you know what you're in for.
"Aerith: Oh, we'll be fine."
Leslie: If you say so. Come on.
"Corneo Lackey: The two of you here for the audition? Second floor, at the very end of the walk. And don't go pokin' your nose in where it doesn't belong!"
Corneo Lackey: Welcome to the mansion of the esteemed Don Corneo.
"Corneo Lackey: Room's on the second floor, at the very end of the walk."
"Corneo Lackey: That one's Madam M's girl, ain't it? Man, she's hot."
Corneo Lackey: We've been waitin' for ya to show.
Corneo Lackey: That Andrea's girl? I'd let her do things to me.
Corneo Lackey: Go to your room and wait. Quietly.
Corneo Lackey: Room's at the end. Keep walking!
"Aerith: What's that weird, sweet smell? And why do I feel so dizzy?"
Cloud: Gas. Come on.
Cloud: Dammit.
Aerith: Cloud...
"Corneo Lackey (1): Wassup? How you pretty ladies doin'? Feeling a little light-headed? Well, we can't have that. What say we escort you to the parlor, so you can make yourselves more comfortable?"
Corneo Lackey (2): Let's get this show on the road.
Aerith: Where...are you...taking us?
Corneo Lackey (1): C'mon now. Upsy-daisy...
"Corneo Lackey (2): Hey! Handle with care, asshole!"
Corneo Lackey (1): The hell!? You wanna throw down!?
"Corneo Lackey (2): They're Corneo's girls...so if ya leave a mark on 'em, you ain't gettin' off with a warning."
"Corneo Lackey (1): Yeah, I know."
"Corneo Lackey (2): Managed to wrangle some real lookers this time though, know what I'm sayin'?"
"Tifa: Hey, can you hear me?"
Cloud: Tifa!?
Tifa: Yes...?
Cloud: You okay?
Tifa: ...Mm-hmm.
Cloud: Good.
"Tifa: Wait a minute. (gasps) Cloud!? Is that you!? Oh my god, that makeup! And that dress!"
"Cloud: Nailed it, I know. Thank you. Moving on."
Cloud: You good?
"Aerith: Yeah. Bit woozy, but I'll manage."
"Aerith: Hey, Tifa. How you doing?"
Tifa: Okay...
Aerith: Oh rightI'm Aerith. A friend of Cloud's. We were worried and thought we'd come help you out?
Tifa: Thanks...?
Cloud: Cut the chatter. We gotta leave.
Tifa: Huh?
Cloud: Right now.
Tifa: No! Not until I've got what I came for.
Cloud: What?
"Tifa: So... After we made it back to the slums, some guys came around asking all kinds of questions. So I did some digging..."
Cloud: And found out they were Corneo's men.
Tifa: Right. They were interested in Avalanche... But...I couldn't figure out why. So I thought I'd come and ask the man himself.
Cloud: Seriously?
"Tifa: Thought if I could find a way in, and get some one-on-one time... But then I realized I'd only be one of three candidates. And that if he didn't pick me...it would all be for nothing."
"Aerith: Then your worries are over, aren't they? Because the other two candidates are right here. Right?"
Cloud: Right...
"Aerith: So yeah! If we're all in on it, then nothing can go wrong!"
"Tifa: Uh, I guess not..."
"Aerith: YoumeCloud. Makes no difference who gets chosen, does it?"
"Tifa: I dunno, Aerith. It feels wrong getting you involved in all this."
Cloud: Don't even bother trying to talk her out of it.
Aerith: Aww! Cloud gets me! Took you long enough.
Cloud: So what happens now?
Tifa: I think they'll call for us when it's time.
Aerith: This room gives me the creeps.
"Corneo Lackey: Now ladies, listen up. I'm sure you're still feeling a bit woozy, but tonight's audition's about to begin. Head out the door to the left and up the stairs. Come on ladies, let's hustle."
Cloud: All right guys. Let's do this.
Tifa: (chuckles) Do you want to do this?
"Kotch: Okay, my beautiful ladies! Time to line up for the don!"
"Kotch: Wait. You look kinda familiar. We haven't met before, have we?"
"Kotch: Eh, whatever. Alright! Y'all good to go? Then let's do this thing! Introducing Wall Market's most elegible bachelor... The one and only Don Corneo!"
Don Corneo: Ladies!
Don Corneo: Nice. Very nice! Whichever one shall I pick?
Don Corneo: Shall I pick you? Or maybe...you?
Don Corneo: Oh yeah! I've got it! I've got it! Today's bride-to-be is...
"Aerith: ""Today's""?"
Kotch: And tomorrow's or the day after'sif the don takes a shine to you.
Cloud: Pathetic.
"Don Corneo: Huh? Hey, which one of you said that? Was it you?"
"Don Corneo: Ohhh, you got a mouth on you! I'm gonna enjoy breaking it in! Today's lucky lady is the big-boned girl! (laughs) Still playing hard to get? I can dig it. Oh yeah."
Don Corneo: The leftovers are all yours.
"Kotch: Hell yeah! Okay ladies, y'all coming with me."
"Don Corneo: Don't be shy, little kitten. Shimmy on over and give daddy some sugar! No need to play coy. Nobody here but you and me..."
Don Corneo: You're even cuter than I thought!
Cloud: Back off.
Don Corneo: Ooh! (laughs) This kitten's got claws! Iloveit! (laughs)
Cloud: What was that?
"Don Corneo: Don't you worry your pretty little head. Just a picture to preserve the moment! And to ensure you don't do anythinginappropriatelike say ""No""..."
Cloud: Asshole...
Don Corneo: Oh! Praise me more!
"Kotch: Ayo, fellas, we've got guests! And y'all got first crack at ""entertaining"" them! Courtesy of the ever-generous Don Corneo himself! Never forgetthe don provides!"
Scotch: Yeah...
Corneo Lackeys: Corneo!
"Scotch: So, ladies. Ready to...get to it?"
"Aerith: Yeah...I guess I'm good to go whenever. How 'bout you, Tifa?"
Tifa: Mmm...Four guys between us... Okay. Let's not keep Cloud waiting.
Aerith: Right.
Scotch: Wait...I know you... The colosseum!
Corneo Lackey: What the hell!?
Tifa: Get down!
"Corneo Lackey: Oh, you stupid W-wait!"
"Tifa: Good job, Aerith!"
Aerith: It was nothing compared to you!
Leslie: Andrea filled me in on the situation. I come bearing giftsyour gear. I'll do what I can to clean this up. Just finish the job.
Aerith: Thank you!
"Aerith: Okay, let's go rescue Cloud."
"Tifa: Corneo's room, right?"
Leslie: Better hurry.
"Corneo Lackey: Man, I'd love to spend some quality time with girls like that. Bet they're going at it right now. Lucky bastard!"
Corneo Lackey (1): What're you doing here?
Corneo Lackey (2): Hey! Ain't you two the rejects!?
Don Corneo: (laughs) Don't stop! Tell me what a bad boy I am!
Cloud: You depraved bastard!
"Don Corneo: (laughs) Yes! Yes, I am! Here I come, baby! (screams)"
Don Corneo: Hey! Who the hell gave you permission to do that!? One of you get in here and teach this bitch some manners!
"Tifa: Sorry, but... Your boys had to learn some manners too."
Don Corneo: What the!?
Aerith: Cloud! Your clothes!
"Don Corneo: So you're a man, huh? What are you three up to?"
Tifa:We'llask the questions. Like: why'd you have men in Sector 7 asking about Avalanche?
Don Corneo: Huh? Dunno what you're talking about.
Tifa: Don't play dumb with me. Let's try again. Why did you have men in Sector 7 asking about Avalanche? Spill the beans or...
Cloud: I'll cut 'em off.
"Don Corneo: Alright, alright! I'll talk! I'll talk! Some guy with a gun for an armI was paid to find him!"
Tifa: Paid by who?
Don Corneo: I can't tell you that! They'd hunt me down like a dog!
Tifa: Well you better...'cause if you don't...
Aerith: I'llrip'em off.
Don Corneo: It was the director of Public Security! Heidegger! It was Heidegger!
Tifa: Shinra!? And what were they planning?
"Don Corneo: Some things are better left unsaid, ya know!?"
"Aerith: See, I'm not so sure they are. Better keep talking..."
Tifa: Or I'll smash 'em.
"Don Corneo: (squirms, laughs) Heh. Alright, you got me. I could never say no to a sexy girl. Since Avalanche blew up two reactors, Shinra's decided they ought to stamp them out, home base and all. And I mean ""stamp out."" By targeting the support pillar and blowing it up."
Tifa: The pillar?
Don Corneo: Did I stutter? The plate will come crashing down! (mimes explosion noises) It'll be Sector 6 all over again. I'm sure you've been there and seen the wreckage for yourself. So you know exactly what Sector 7's gonna look like!
Tifa: They wouldn't...
"Aerith: Come on, guys! We gotta go!"
Don Corneo: Before you do!
Cloud: No.
Don Corneo: Please! This won't take long!
"Don Corneo: As everyone knows, villains only divulge their plans in a certain situation. But what is that situation?"
On-screen: What is that situation?
"Cloud: When they're faced with certain death, jackass."
Don Corneo: Not what we were looking for! But you can find it...in the sewers!
Cloud: When they think they've already won...right?
"Don Corneo: Ladies and gentlemen, we have ourselves a winner! You get an all-expenses-paid trip...to the sewers."
Cloud: I dunno. When they've lost their minds?
"Don Corneo: Close, but no cigar! Your parting gift...is in the sewers!"
"Don Corneo: Oh, I'm sorry! Time's up! The answer lies...in the sewers!"
Don Corneo: Hee hee hahaha! Enjoy the sights and smells!
President Shinra: Are we on schedule?
"Heidegger: (laughs) The Turks are on top of it. Yes, there will be no delays."
"Reeve: Please, Mr. President! I am asking you to reconsiderno, begging. The Sector 7 undercity is home to more than 50,000"
President Shinra: (groans) Director Tuesti.
"Reeve: At least let us issue a warning, sir."
Heidegger: The stench of the director's cowardice fills the room yet again.
President Shinra: Reeve. Progress requires sacrifice. Learn to live with it.
Cloud: Where in the...?
On-screen: Sewer System
"Cloud: Damn, it reeks."
Cloud: Tifa?
Tifa: Cloud... We have to get to the slumsright now!
Cloud: Yeah.
Tifa: I didn't wanna drag Aerith into all this...
Cloud: She'll understand.
Tifa: How do you two know each other?
"Cloud: I saved her, she saved me... Round and round it goes."
Tifa: And...that's all there is to it? Sure there isn't something else going on?
Aerith: Dammit.
Cloud: Aerith.
Aerith: Cloud... We have to get to Sector 7...
Cloud: Yeah.
Tifa: That bastard!
Tifa: You gotta be kidding me!
Cloud: Good to go?
Aerith: You bet!
Tifa: Bring it on!
Tifa: There it goes...
"Aerith: Do you think it lives down here, or...?"
Cloud: Was probably Corneo's pet. And we were dinner.
Aerith: (mimics Corneo's laugh)
"Tifa: Hey... You don't believe that crazy story of his, do you? Shinra wouldn't sacrifice a whole sector just to take out Avalanche, would they? Destroying part of the citykilling all those people, just to get at us?"
Cloud: I dunno... Is Corneo the kind of guy who'd make up shit just to screw with you?
Tifa: I wouldn't put it past him.
"Aerith: But...if he was telling the truth... And there's still a chance he was, isn't there? Then...we should go. And if it turns out he was lying, then so what? Right?"
Cloud: Tifa!
Tifa: I knew it. These tunnels are all connected.
Cloud: What is it?
"Tifa: I'm pretty sure we can use these tunnels to make our way back to Sector 7. The sewers under Sectors 6 and 7 should be connected. ""If you get in trouble, just follow the stench."""
Cloud: Another one of those lessons?
"Tifa: An Avalanche saying, actually. We use them to move around the undercity. In emergencies."
Cloud: Sure we're not lost?
Tifa: Positive. There should be a big waterway just up ahead. Let's find that first.
"Aerith: Ugh, it reeks down here."
"Tifa: Well the undercity isn't exactly the prettiest place, and we're under that so..."
Tifa: Is it safe to go through here?
Aerith: It's really dark.
Tifa: I'm sure we'll be fine. Come on.
"Tifa: Hey, Cloud... Assuming Corneo was telling us the truth... What do you think Shinra's really up to? I mean, they've gotta have an endgame, but I can't imagine what it is. Destroying a whole chunk of the city just to get back at us doesn't make any kind of sense."
Cloud: Yeah. I can't imagine any way they could profit from it. It's gonna cost them a fortune to rebuild.
Tifa: Corneo's lying. He's gotta be. Guys like him do it all the time out of habit.
Cloud: Locked up tight.
Tifa: But not if we used the skeleton key Jessie made.
Aerith: Huh. Does this mean it's in the water?
Cloud: We'll see.
"Cloud: That's a power generator, all right."
Aerith: Wow. Talk about ancient.
Cloud: It's an antiqueolder than the mako reactors even. It'll be a miracle if it still works.
Cloud: This it?
Aerith: It worked!
Tifa: Wait a minute. I know this place. Sector 7 should be just on the other side of this waterway.
Cloud: So this is where Sector 6 ends.
On-screen: Sewer System - Trunk Line
Tifa: And where Sector 7 begins. Once we cross over we can start looking for a way back to the surface.
Cloud: Might be harder than you think.
Tifa: Let's just try to make our way down this tunnel. See if we can't use those gates to clear a path. We can do this. We'll figure it out.
"Aerith: Yeah, for sure."
Tifa: All right! Now we should be able to get across.
"Cloud: I'll go first, okay?"
Tifa: Dammit. I can't stop thinking about what Corneo said.
Aerith: I know... Me too.
Tifa: It's gotta be a trick. There's no way they'd go that far. But... But what if Corneo really was telling the truth...? We have to get there in time to stop it. We have to.
Aerith: Right.
"Tifa: Aerith, what are you not telling me?"
Aerith: Huh?
Cloud: Guys! C'mon! We gotta keep moving!
Tifa: Coming! I'll go first.
Tifa: Okay Aerith! Your turn!
Aerith: On my way! Here we...go.
Tifa: Almost there!
Tifa: Aerith!
Cloud: Jump!
Tifa: That was close.
Aerith: Thanks. You saved me.
Tifa: (chuckles) Least I could do.
"Aerith: Hear that, Cloud?"
Aerith: C'mon.
Tifa: Focus!
Aerith: Still thinking about the plate?
Tifa: Yeah.
Aerith: The future isn't...set in stone. That's what I always tell myself.
Tifa: Yeah...? I hope you're right.
"Aerith: How 'bout this, then? Think of something fun. After saving Sector 7, you're gonna...?"
"Tifa: I'm gonna... Go shoppingtopside! I'll buy... Stuff for the bar! Decorations, coasters..."
Aerith: Can I come?
Tifa: You'd better!
Aerith: Then it's a date! (both laugh)
Tifa: Cloud can carry all our stuff!
Aerith: He'll be our pack chocobo!
Cloud: What was that about me?
Tifa: Nothing! (chuckles)
Tifa: Huh!? No way!
"Aerith: C'mon, Tifa!"
Aerith: Cloud! Hold on tight!
"Tifa: On three, okay? One, two, three!"
Cloud: Sorry 'bout that.
Aerith: No need to be.
Aerith: Look. That must be the way out!
On-screen: Sewer System - Primary Treatment
Tifa: I wonder. There must be some way we can lower the water level.
"Tifa: Guys, check it out. Seventh Heaven's water tank has something similar. I'm betting we can use this to control the sewage level."
Aerith: Hey Cloudyou wanna give it a try?
Cloud: This oughta drain the water...right?
Aerith: No luck?
Cloud: Must be busted.
"Tifa: A red light indicates a blockage, apparently. We can use the hand pump to clear the blockage. Sounds about right. I remember having to do this at the bar before."
Cloud: Alright. I'll
"Tifa: Aerith, you mind giving me a hand? Cloud, you stay put. Keep an eye out for more red lights."
"Cloud: Wait, I'm not sure"
Tifa: Trust me. This is the best way to handle it. We'll be back soon.
Tifa: So maybe this is a little different from the one at the bar. More...industrial?
Aerith: Here goes.
Tifa: Spectacular!
Aerith: That went well.
Tifa: Try to stay in sync.
Tifa: Keep calm.
Aerith: Coulda gone better...
"Tifa: Alright, I think that did it!"
Aerith: Wonderful!
"Tifa: Okay, let's head back. Cloud's probably getting worried."
Cloud: Nicely done.
Tifa: We make a great team.
Aerith: Go team!
Aerith: Sure is nice to go up for a change.
Tifa: Hope the pillar's not much further...
Cloud: Hang back. I'll go on ahead and secure the exit.
Tifa: Cloud!
Tifa: Looks like they're hungry for more.
Aerith: We're not delicious! Not even a little bit!
Cloud: Get going.
Tifa: Now!
Aerith: Okay!
Cloud: You too!
Tifa: But there's too many of them!
Cloud: Not for me.
Tifa: Hurry!
"Cloud: Last warning! Back off, or die!"
Tifa: Cloud!
Aerith: C'mon!
Rude: ...Understood. The Avalanche mission's been approved. We are to proceed as planned.
Reno: This is bullshit. What the hell are they thinking?
"Rude: ""Threats to public order are to be summarily put down."" This is what we've always done."
"Reno: ""Summarily put down."""
Reno: Guess it's a little late to grow a conscience. ...Meh.
Cloud: Just on patrol.
Aerith: Don't worry. We'll make it in time.
On-screen: Train Graveyard
Cloud: We could get lost in here.
Tifa: This is the train graveyard all righta real treasure trove of scrap. Sector 7 should be just past that large maintenance facility over there. I vote we stay past the light so we can see where we're going.
"Aerith: Dark, dark, everywhere..."
Cloud: That it?
Aerith: It's deserted...and kinda creepy.
"Tifa: People don't come around here often. And not just because of the monsters, but...because of the stories."
Aerith: What kind?
"Tifa: Everyone seems to think that the train graveyard...is haunted. ""Those who lose their way out there in the dark of night will never, ever find their way back home again."""
Cloud: Is that right?
"Tifa: I mean, it's not like I think it's true or anything, but you know...it's just..."
Cloud: Then let's hurry.
"Tifa: Guys, what was that!?"
Tifa: (screams) Don't scare me like that!
Tifa: I think I just heard a little kid... Did you guys hear it too?
Cloud: Why would there be kids out here this late?
Tifa: What? Then
Tifa: Huh? What is that!?
Cloud: You okay?
Aerith: All good...I think.
Tifa: Still in one piece here too.
Tifa: Guys?
Cloud: Seriously?
"Aerith: ""Come on,"" huh? Well, that's...inviting."
"Cloud: Alright, let's see what's inside."
"Tifa: Well, whaddya think...?"
Aerith: Hmm... I'm game!
Tifa: But...
"Aerith: It'll be fine! We've got a bodyguard, don't forget. Mine! Right?"
Cloud: Ghosts aren't my thing.
Tifa: You're just being modest! After you!
"Cloud: Mind letting me go, then?"
On-screen: Abandoned Station - Maintenance Facility
Tifa: What was that!?
Aerith: Look! Over there!
Aerith: Found you. Hey...can we talk? Just for a bit?
Cloud: Get back.
Aerith: It's you...
Aerith: Don't!
Cloud: That thing's dangerous.
"Aerith: I know, but even so..."
Tifa: What the!?
Cloud: Run!
Cloud: You okay?
Tifa: Yeah.
"Aerith: Thanks, Cloud. You saved us."
Cloud: Gonna need to find another way through.
Tifa: Wh-what now?
???: This train will be stopping at the Sector 7 slums...and is bound for the train graveyard. The train will depart shortly. Please stand clear of the closing doors.
"Aerith: That's not funny, you know."
Cloud: Guess the crane's up there.
Cloud: It's not working. There's no power coming through.
Aerith: I wonder if this is another prank? Someone might be messing with the power supply to make us run around.
Tifa: Do you think there's...more in here?
Aerith: Looks like.
Aerith: Aha! Found you!
Tifa: I'm pretty sure I saw a door on the other side of this place. I think our only choice might be to find another route.
Aerith: Tifa!
"Aerith: ""Coming to get you""...?"
Cloud: I don't have time for your shit.
"Aerith: ""That was fun""... All this time, you were waiting for someone to come and play with you."
Cloud: What're you talking about?
"Cloud: C'mon, let's get back to the crane."
"Tifa: ""Those who lose their way out there in the dark of night will never, ever find their way back home again."" What do you guys think would've happened if they'd caught us?"
Aerith: I wonder... Maybe they're the ones who were caught.
Cloud: Can we just drop the whole
Aerith: What if they're trapped here and can't leave?
Tifa: Just like we hoped! What a relief.
Aerith: We should be able to get through now.
Cloud: Let's find out.
Aerith: We're through!
Tifa: Great. Let's head outside.
Tifa: Wait.
Aerith: A girl?
Tifa: Marlene?
"Marlene: ...And...the kids that the black wind carries away have to live in the train graveyard forever and ever! So you have to stay far, far away from there!"
"Tifa (flashback): All right, then. I will."
"Marlene: Oh, you know Betty? Yesterday she went with her daddy to...to..."
Marlene: When is...Daddy coming back?
Tifa (flashback): Actually...he might not make it home tonight.
"Tifa: Marlene, what are you"
Tifa: We can't waste any more time here.
Cloud: What was that about?
Tifa: Nothing you need to worry about. Let's get going.
Aerith: It's moving!
Tifa: Maybe now we can get to the other side.
"Tifa: This path is blocked too? But we're so close, I can see it."
"Aerith: Hey, do you think these trains might still run?"
Cloud: Could give it a try.
Cloud: Good call. Looks like it still works.
Aerith: I knew it!
Tifa: Everybody good?
Cloud: Yeah.
Aerith: Huh? I think that's...
Tseng (radio): Plate separation code is... Got it?
"Reno (radio): Yeah, yeah, of course I do! We can drop the damn thing whenever... It's just that..."
Reno: You got a death wish or something? Because I sure as shit don't.
"Tseng (radio): Reno, what's happening? Do we have a problem?"
Reno: Not really. Small arms fire from some local boys trying to defend the pillar.
"Tseng (radio): More would-be heroes, huh? Sending reinforcements. The more players that take the stage, the better."
"Reno: So that's what we are, huh?"
Tseng (radio): Contact me when the mission is complete.
Cloud: Tifa...
Tifa: They're really gonna drop the plate.
Cloud: They won't if Barret and the others have anything to say about it.
Aerith: All we can do now is keep moving.
Tifa: Please... Please let us be in time.
Cloud: Why am I not surprised?
Aerith: Wowwould you look at that!
Tifa: Thanks.
Cloud: Let's go.
Tifa: Almost there. Come on!
Cloud: Right.
Aerith: Cloud!
Cloud: Aerith!
Marlene (Tifa's memory): The kids that the black wind carries away have to live in the train graveyard forever and ever!
"Aerith: You're just trying to help, aren't you?"
Aerith: You. You're the one who...
"Boy (vision): Are you ready? Well, are ya!?"
"Boy (vision, 2): I'm ready now!"
Girl (vision): Me too!
Boy (vision): Found you!
Girl (vision): No way!
Boy (vision): We found you!
"Boy (vision, 2): Aw, you got me."
"Boy (vision): Hey, where's Aerith?"
Aerith (vision): I'm ready! I'm ready!
Aerith (vision): I said I'm ready! Come get me!
Aerith (vision): I'm right here... (cries)
Cloud: Aerith!
Tifa: Hey. We found you.
Aerith: I guess you did.
Cloud: Let's go.
Tifa: How do we hurt it?
Aerith: Hit it with magic.
Cloud: It'll bounce right off. Gotta deal with the barrier first.
Aerith: Cloud!
Tifa: Look out!
"Tifa: Hold on, guys. We're coming."
Tifa: And you...can go to hell!
Tifa: Let's go.
Cloud: Right.
Aerith: Right!
Tifa: It's that ghost...
Tifa: Wow...
Aerith: So long.
Tifa: We made it!
"Shinra Helicopter: Attention, Avalanche! You are surrounded! Stand down and surrender to Public Security immediately! Shinra does not negotiate with terrorists! Resist and we will use lethal force! I repeat: Shinra doesnotnegotiate with terrorists! Resist and we will use lethal force!"
"Barret: Got your lethal force right here, asshole!"
Security Officer (1): Stop! I said stop!
Security Officer (2): Drop the weapon now!
"Avalanche Member: Screw you, you fascist pricks!"
Tifa: Dropping a whole plate...just like that. No. No way.
Aerith: Tifa!
On-screen: Sector 7 Undercity Station
Aerith: Please! Let us through!
Cloud: What are you!?
"Aerith: Cloud, Tifa! We have to get past, whatever it takes!"
Tifa: Right!
Tifa: There's too many!
Cloud: Aerith?
Aerith: Come on!
Barret: What you got!? Come on!
Tifa: That's Barret!
Cloud & Tifa: Wedge!
Cloud: You okay!?
Wedge: Cloud... It's Shinra! They're trying to take out the pillar!
Cloud: I know.
Wedge: I have to go back Barret and the others are still
Cloud: Stop! Stay with Wedge. I'm going up.
Aerith: Sure.
"Wedge: I'm going too! I can still fight! Biggs, he They were shooting at me and he"
"Tifa: Wedge, please. Let Cloud handle it."
Aerith: Don't worry. I'll patch him up.
"Wedge: Hang on, guys! Help is coming!"
Cloud: Wedgelisten to me. Youstay here with them.
"Biggs: 'Bout time you showed up, merc. Gotta do my part to clear the path before you steal the show."
On-screen: Sector 7 Slums Pillar
"Security Officer (1): Ah, for the love of... I'm getting sick of this. Don't they have anything better to do?"
Security Officer (2): Tell me about it. You see how hard we got hit over here? Shit. What's wrong with these people?
Security Officer (2): What the? Avalanche!?
Security Officer (1): Hostile contactone target! Engage!
Security Officer: Bastards just keep coming! Don't think you're gonna get away with this!
Cloud: Biggs!
Biggs: You made it...though...I might not. Hey. Is Wedge...
Cloud: Don't worry. He'll bounce back.
Biggs: That's...good to hear. Could've used some extra padding myself. (coughs)
Cloud: Don't talk.
Biggs: It's...pretty bad up there. Cloud. Promise me. Don't let it be for nothing.
On-screen: Don't let it be for nothing.
Cloud: I won't.
Biggs: You're a good man. Giving me that...that comfort.
Cloud: What about you?
Biggs: I've still got some fight left in me. 'Nough for another platoon or two. Don't gotta be a SOLDIER...to make a difference.
Biggs: Oh. One more thing. The Leaf House. It's an orphanage. In the...Sector 5 slums. The kids...they're great. I used to visit(coughs)
"Cloud: That, you'll have to do yourself."
Biggs: Lemme guess...not a fan of kids.
Cloud: No.
Biggs: But you have...so much in common.
Biggs: Good luck...Cloud. Our future...is in your hands.
Cloud: This isn't over.
Helitrooper: ContactL5! Moving to engage!
Helitrooper: Wutai dogs!
"Reno: Testing, testing... Attention, Avalanche scum! We know all about your evil plans to destroy the pillar. But the Turksahem! But Shinrathat's uswon't let you get away with it! So go crawl back into whatever hole you crawled out of, or something!"
"Reno: That oughta do it, right?"
Rude: Eh. Good enough.
"Reno: Wait. I know you... Mister ""First Class."" (chuckles) First-class asshole! Gotcha now! You ain't got nowhere to run!"
Cloud: Not good.
Rude: Throw down your weapon and surrender! Shinra does not negotiate with terrorists!
"Reno: Man, screw this cheap-ass play."
Tifa: Get down!
Aerith: Thank you!
Wedge: That was a close one...
Aerith: How is it?
"Wedge: Much better, thanks."
Tifa: I'm sorry. I can't stay hereI have to help them.
Aerith: Go. Follow your heart.
Tifa: Aerith. There's a bar in the center of townSeventh Heaven. I need you to
Aerith: Get Marlene to safety. Right? It's okay. I'll find her.
Tifa: Huh?
"Tifa: Can you take her to the bar for me, Wedge?"
Wedge: Consider it done! Now get up there and kick Shinra's ass!
Wedge: C'monSeventh Heaven is this way!
"Aerith: Wedge, wait!"
"Wedge: You guys can't stay here! Come on, come on!"
"NPC: Hey, let us through! How else're we supposed to get to Wall Market!?"
"Senior Officer: Sir, you need to step away from the gate!"
Wedge: You have to open the gate! If you don't let these people through
Senior Officer: Back off! It's not gonna happen!
Aerith: Wedge!
Wedge: I'm no goodnot to anyone up there or down here...
"Aerith: That's not true, Wedge. Don't give up hope yet! We can still save a lot of lives!"
"Wedge: You don't think we're gonna stop them from dropping the plate, do you? I wanna believe that we can still win somehow."
Aerith: Mm.
Wedge: But...something in my gut tells me we're due for a reckoning. Just this...feeling. Know what I mean?
"Aerith: Yeah... I do. But...that's no excuse to give up. I don't wanna look back one day...and wish I'd done it different. Right here, right now, I need to know I did everything I could."
"Wedge: (screams) I'm not sure what's gonna happen next. But I am sure I don't wanna regret the choices I make tonight. Our lives are in your hands. If you don't open up, we're all gonna die!"
Senior Officer: Close it!
"New Recruit: No, sir! I will not obey that order!"
"New Recruit: This way, everyone! Quickly, quickly!"
Senior Officer: You can't just... Wait!
"Aerith: Wedge! Seventh Heaven is just down this road, isn't it?"
Wedge: Head straight and look rightyou can't miss it!
Aerith: Don't worry about me!
"Wedge: Alright, I'll get these people to safety!"
"New Recruit: This way, everyone! Quickly,quickly!"
"Wedge: There's no time, guys! You've got to get out of Sector 7 as quickly as you can! We'll have a better chance to survive if we work together!"
"Aerith: Get out of Sector 7, please! You need to get as far away from Sector 7 as possible! Right now! Go to Sector 5 or 6anywhere but here!"
Aerith: You all have to get out of Sector 7! Now! Please!
Marle: Slow down! Do you know what's going on? What do they want with the pillar?
"Aerith: Well, there's still time, but..."
Marle: They're going to drop the plate on us?
Aerith: Yes.
Neighborhood Watch Member (1): Those sons of bitches!
Neighborhood Watch Member (2): What good do they think that'll do!?
"Marle: Feel free to cry about it later! Right now, we need to get everyone to safety."
Neighborhood Watch Member (1): Waitthe watch should clear the roads first!
"Marle: Ah, good thinking! Hop to it!"
"Marle: Avalanche, I take it?"
Aerith: Just a friend.
Marle: Tell Tifa to lay low. We'll take care of things here.
Aerith: I've got to get to Seventh Heaven!
"Neighborhood Watch Member: We've got this area covered, don't worry!"
Aerith: That's it!
NPC: Oh god. Look out!
Aerith: Oh no...
Undercity Resident: Look outit's gonna crash!
Aerith: Marlene!
Neighborhood Watch Member: We need water! Hurry! The fire's spreading!
Aerith: Ow... Marlene...
"Aerith: Oh, no! Need to find another way to get there!"
Aerith: Gotta get through. Gotta find a way.
"Neighborhood Watch Member: If anyone needs any assistance, please let the watch know!"
Neighborhood Watch Member: This underground passage'll take you to Wall Market.
Aerith: Finally!
Aerith: Hold on.
"Undercity Resident (1): Go, go, go!"
Undercity Resident (2): Quit pushing!
"Aerith: Oh, you poor thing!"
"Aerith: I know it must hurt...but you've got to be brave now, okay?"
"Marle: C'mon, keep moving! This way! Hey! Hey! Over here! C'mon!"
Aerith: I'll take you to her. Ready?
"Aerith: Almost there, okay?"
Aerith: No need to rush. Steady now...
Aerith: I'll be fine. Don't worry about me.
Neighborhood Watch Member: We can get through this! We just have to work together!
Neighborhood Watch Member: Get to Wall Marketnow! It's too dangerous here!
"Marle: This way, people! Quickly now! Keep moving!"
Aerith: Can you take care of her?
Marle: Of course.
Betty's Dad: Betty! I've been looking everywhere for you!
Betty: Daddy!
Aerith: You'll be fine.
Marle: Stop! That way's already
"Aerith: Please, I need to get through!"
Aerith: Almost there!
"Tseng: Confirmed, one more bird lost. Probably for the best. After all"
Tseng: Change of plans. You can take it from here. Someone's been a little too adventurous.
Aerith: Please be okay.
"Aerith: Hold on, Marlene. I'm coming for you."
"Aerith: You're Marlene, right?"
Marlene: Who...who are you?
Aerith: I'm...a friend! Of Tifa's!
Marlene: Um... Where is she?
"Aerith: Right now, she's with Cloud and the others."
Marlene: Daddy too?
Aerith: You mean Barret? Yep. He's there too.
Marlene: Wait... Daddy's not coming home?
"Aerith: Not yet. That's why I came to find you. Tifa asked me to. She said, ""Take care of Marlene."" The thing is, this place isn't safe now. I'm gonna take you somewhere safer, okay?"
Marlene: Are they gonna destroy the bar? Are they gonna destroy our house?
"Aerith: I know it's hard. Just remember, you still have your daddy. You can build a new home together. Anywhere. Shall we go?"
Marlene: You smell nice.
Aerith: Oh?
Marlene: Like...like our flower.
Aerith: I hope you remember it. C'mon.
Aerith: Tell you what. We'll grow lots of flowers at your new house.
Marlene: Do you think that I could help too?
Aerith: Of course you can. Heywhat's your favorite flower?
Marlene: (chuckles) Ummm...
"Tseng: You led us on a merry chase, Aerith."
Aerith: Tseng.
"Tseng: Before you say another word, know that your options are limited."
Aerith: There's nothing to be scared of. Okay?
Aerith: How about...we make a deal?
Cloud: Gotta move.
Reno: Pop your head out and let me finish this already.
Rude: Stairs.
Reno: Two birds with one shitload of bullets!
Reno: Hey!
Tifa: Cloud!
Cloud: What the hell!?
Tifa: Nice catch!
Cloud: You're crazy!
"Tifa: Just like you. So suck it up, 'cause I'm not leaving."
"Reno: Dammit! You wanna explain yourself, partner?"
Rude: Uh... Hand slipped.
Cloud: Where's Aerith?
Tifa: I sent her to Seventh Heaven to get Marlene out.
Cloud: And Wedge?
Tifa: I asked him to show her the way.
Cloud: Okay.
Tifa: We can still stop this...right?
Cloud: Yeah.
Tifa: Then let's keep moving!
"Reno: And where do you think you're going? Come out, come out, wherever the hell you are!"
Reno: Save us all some time and give up.
"Reno: I don't know about you, but I amoverthis shit!"
Reno: Looks like you guys are having the time of your life.
Tifa: What was that?
"Jessie: So, how'd you guys rate my latest and greatest design? Eleven outta ten?"
"Jessie: Today's your unlucky day, 'cause I never miss."
"Reno: What, what?"
Rude: Seems we've lost control of the top floor.
Reno: Huh? Our guys are seriously struggling to take down these assholes?
"Rude: Anyway, we may need to intervene personally."
"Reno: Whatever you say, partner. Keep 'em busy, will ya?"
Tifa: Jessie!
"Jessie: Oh, jeez... Tifa... If you could see the look on your face..."
Jessie: So...you're the guy...who gets to hear my last words... Heh... Lucky me.
Cloud: Like hell they're your last.
"Jessie: It's okay, Cloud... It's okay. They were my bombs. They were all...my victims. I had it...coming."
Jessie: My hero. So gentle...
Cloud: Just try to hang on!
Jessie: (chuckles) So dramatic... I...I just wish that... I could've had you over again... Everyone... With Mom's cooking... I really wanted...to believe...we could...
Cloud: Yeah. You owe me a pizza.
Jessie: (chuckles) That's right. I do. But...I don't think...
Jessie: Oh no... Tifa's crying. Did I say something wrong?
Jessie: Don't you guys...have somewhere to be? It's not polite...to stare...you know...
Tifa: Jessie...
Cloud: Hey...
Barret: (screams) I ain't done with you yet! You hear me!? Think you can come up in heredo what you wantand we're gonna take it!?
Tifa: Barret!
Barret: Tifa!? Get your ass behind cover! Now! Chopper's gonna chew you up!
Cloud: Still alive and kicking?
Barret: Damn right! Leadin' man sticks around till the credits roll! Though we gotta keep moving if we wanna make it that far. You ready?
Cloud: Yup.
"Reno: Time for a rematch, huh... Rude!"
Cloud: You!
Reno: It's nothing personal...bitch! Ha!
Reno: Missed me!
"Barret: You're next, asshole!"
"Reno: Sorry, losers! Gotta play for keeps today. No time to dick around."
Announcement: Plate separation authorized. Awaiting confirmation. Plate separation authorized. Awaiting confirmation.
"Reno: Yeah, yeah, coming right up."
Reno: No you don't! Not when I'm working!
Announcement: Plate separation authorized. Awaiting confirmation.
Cloud: Press it.
"Reno: Now, now... You ain't got shit on us."
Cloud: Careful. He's quick.
"Barret: Yeah, quick at runnin' away, maybe!"
Reno: Ha! In your dreams.
Reno: So. Heard you gave Rude a beating.
Cloud: Had to.
"Reno: No choice, huh? I guess I ain't got one neither."
"Reno: Stubborn little shitbirds, ain'tcha?"
"Rude: Prepping for bombing run, how copy?"
Reno: Say what!?
Reno: I see you're doin' whatever the hell you want. Guess I'm rubbing off on ya.
"Cloud: Heads up, guys!"
Reno: Dammit...
"Reno: (chuckles) Clipped your wings, huh?"
Rude: I was planning to join you anyway.
Reno: Any landing ya can walk away from... C'mon! Let's teach 'em the Turks two-step!
Rude: Time for you to learn...
"Reno: What happens when you mess with the Turks! If you're gonna pick a fight with the Turks, you'd better be prepared to leave in a body bag."
"Barret: Confident, ain't we?"
Rude: Reno!
Reno: Rude!
Announcement: Plate separation authorized. Awaiting confirmation.
Cloud: How do we stop it?
Reno: Who knows?
Barret: Where you going!?
Cloud: Move!
Barret: Getting real tired of your shit!
Cloud: Tifa!
Barret: Where'dja
Announcement: Plate separation initiated. Plate separation initiated. Commencing separation sequence. Section 1 separation imminent. Evacuate immediately. Plate separation initiated.
Barret: You son of a bitch! What have you done!?
Tifa: Cloud!
Cloud: Tifa!
Rude: Five minutes to go.
Tifa: What do we do!?
Tseng (computer): Nothing. There is nothing you can do now.
Tifa: You can't do this!
Aerith (computer): Tifa! I found Marlene!
Tifa: Aerith!
Barret: Marlene? My Marlene!? What did you do with her!?
Cloud: Where are you!?
Aerith (computer): I'm at the
Security Officer (computer): Sir. C'mon.
"Tseng (computer): Your activities unwittingly brought you into contact with the Ancient, who is now back in our custody where she belongs. For this, you have my sincerest gratitude. Alas, the sector in which you stand has been condemned."
"Cloud: ""Ancient""?"
Aerith (computer): Run! You have to go now!
Tseng (computer): And where exactly do you expect them to go?
Cloud: Aerith!
Announcement: Total plate separation imminent. Evacuate the area immediately.
"Tifa: No, no, no..."
"Barret: If we don't get the hell outta here right now, we're dead! We gotta think of something! Think dammit think! Look around... Gotta be something! Shit...shit... Shit!"
Barret: Hey! Over here! Found us a way out!
Cloud: Tifa.
"Barret: C'mon, c'mon!"
Barret: Now!
On-screen: Sector 6 Slums - Gate
Barret: Hey! Anybody out there!?
Tifa: Barret!?
Tifa: I think I hear him up ahead!
Barret: Hey! Can anybody hear me!?
Cloud: Here goes.
Tifa: Andpush!
Barret: Marlene... Marlene! Marlene!
Barret: Marlene! Biggs! Wedge! Jessie!
Barret: Goddammit. Goddamn you! Goddamn you all! (cries)
Barret: Marlene... Marlene... (cries)
Tifa: It was us. We did this.
"Barret: No. You can't think like that. Whatever came before, it was Shinra that pulled the trigger today. Am I right!?"
Tifa: ...Yeah.
Barret: Hold on to this. This...anger. Okay?
Cloud: Barret. Marlene's fine. Aerith found her.
Barret: Aerith? Is that the girl they took?
Tifa: Yeah. That's her.
Barret: The hell's going on!?
Tifa: I asked Aerith to find Marlene and take her somewhere safe.
Barret: And she did? You sure!?
Barret: Hey! Where you going!?
New Recruit: How could this happen...?
Senior Officer: I didn't really think that...
New Recruit: I don'tWhat do we do now?
Senior Officer: What you were hired to do. Get these people outta here!
"Senior Officer: So you know, things could've been worse if you hadn't done what you did. Sometimes you can't let yourself be bound by orders."
New Recruit: I've made up my mind. I'm not gonna do this job for Shinra anymore. I'm an officer of the people now!
"New Recruit: We need to think about supplies and shelter and food for all these people. I work for the people now, not some corporation."
"Senior Officer: You know, you've given me a lot to think about. I can't let rules and orders dictate my life."
Barret: I saidwhere you going?
Cloud: Aerith's house. It's in the Sector 5 slums.
Barret: And that's where Marlene is?
Cloud: Where we hope she is.
"Barret: Tell me she is! Give me something to hang on to! Even if she's not. I won't blame you for it, I swear!"
Barret: Who am I kidding. I'd probably try to tear your head off.
"Cloud: Hey, Tifa. Know anything about ""Ancients""?"
Tifa: I know I've heard of them at least.
"Barret: They come up in planetology books. Meant to be the original stewards of the planet. Could even ""commune"" with it. Talk to it and stuff."
Cloud: That must be why the Turks wanted her so badly.
Sephiroth (in Cloud's memory): Within my veins flows the blood of Ancients. This planet...is my birthright.
"Sephiroth (vision): You have failed again, I see."
"Sephiroth (vision): But through suffering, you will grow strong. Isn't that what you want?"
Tifa: Cloud?
Cloud: It's nothing. Let's go.
"Sam: Hey. Pretty crazy, huh? Can you believe this mess?"
Cloud: You doing all right?
"Sam: I am, but I can't say the same 'bout my birds. Poor things're scared half to death."
Cloud: Wait. Over there.
Barret: What the hell are they doing here?
"Cloud: Their jobs, probably. Just focus on seeing Marlene again. Nothing else."
Security Officer (1): Found 'em?
"Security Officer (2): We're searching the compound as we speak, sir."
Andrea: Did you find what you were looking for?
Cloud: Thanks to you I did.
Andrea: Good. Now never let it go again.
"Madam M: Well, this is a fine mess..."
Cloud: How bad is it here?
"Madam M: Compared to Sector 7, we're doing fine. But that's hardly an accomplishment."
Barret: You guys run into Jessie at the pillar?
Tifa: Yeah...Biggs too. They were both in pretty bad shape. But Wedge wasn't up there with 'em. He got out.
Barret: All right.
"Stablehand: Come on now, there's no need to be afraid. We're all scared..."
"Barret: I've been thinking, y'all... We gotta go find the others."
Tifa: Huh?
"Barret: If we don't look for them, who will?"
Tifa: ...Right.
"Barret: Hey, Cloud. Gonna need your help with it too."
Cloud: Right.
On-screen: Sector 5 Slums - Center District
"Barret: This is Sector 5, right? So where's this place you said Marlene is?"
Cloud: Where I think she is. It's a house on the other side of town.
"Barret: Well, come on then, pick up the pace!"
Cloud: I'm going as fast as you are.
Chadley: Cloud! I'm glad to see that you're okay. In these trying times I hope to develop new materia to help us endure.
Cloud: That's the house.
Barret: Marlene! Marlene!
Barret: Where's Marlene!? Is she here!?
Cloud: Barret!
"Barret: Sorry. I'm Barret. Marlene's my little girl. Marleneshe's got short hair. She's cute as a button, with the heart of an angel. She was wearing... Uh...pink! She was wearing a pink dress today!"
Elmyra: She's sleeping upstairs.
Elmyra: I said she's sleeping!
Tifa: I wanna see her too. C'mon. Let's go look in on her.
Elmyra: Keep it down. Don't wake her.
Barret: Marlene...my baby. Thank god.
Tifa: Sh.
Elmyra: Shinra has my daughter now.
Cloud: I'm sorry.
"Tifa: No. I'm the one who asked her to go get Marlene. We'd only just met, but she was so kind and helpful. I...took advantage of her."
Elmyra: It's not your fault. It was only a matter of time before she ended up back there.
Cloud: Because she's an Ancient. That it?
Elmyra: So she told you about that? She must trust you all a great deal...
"Elmyra: Yes. Aerith is an Ancient. Probably the last one living. She's not my daughter. Not by blood, I mean. If that's what you were wondering..."
"Elmyra: About fifteen years ago... My husband, he'd been shipped off to fight on the front lines. But then I received a letter saying he'd be home for a bit. So when the day came, I went to the station to meet him... But...he didn't come. I couldn't help fearing the worst, even then...but I told myself his leave must've been postponed, that he'd been delayed. Every day I went, to wait, and to pray..."
"Elmyra: And that's how I met her. Her and her mother. I thought maybe they'd run away from Wall Market. Or that they were topsiders fallen on hard times. I'd seen that sort of thing a lot. ""Take Aerith somewhere safe."" Those were her mother's dying words. My husband had been away for so long, and I was lonely. So I convinced myself the safest place for the girl was with me."
"Elmyra: It took no time at all for her to start feeling like family. She was a real chatterbox. She told me strange stories... Like how she and her mother had escaped from some sort of facility... And how she wasn't sad because her mother had just...""returned to their planet."""
"Barret: Their planet, huh? Yeah, that sounds about right."
"Elmyra: I didn't understand any of it at the time. When I asked if she meant one in the sky... She said no, this one. Right here. I mean...what can you say to that...?"
"Aerith (flashback): Mommy, don't be sad."
"Elmyra: That's what she said to me one day, out of the blue."
"Elmyra: So I asked her, ""What's wrong?"""
"Aerith (flashback): A man you really, really love just died. His heart came a long way to say goodbye. But he couldn't stay, 'cause he had to return to the planet."
"Elmyra: I didn't believe her, of course. And then, a few days later, I received a letter saying my husband had been killed in action. Things like that, she'd just know. It was a lot to deal with, but we were happy. And then came the knock."
Aerith (flashback): Coming!
Aerith (flashback): No... Go away!
Tseng (flashback): Aerith... You know you're not just any little girl. You're a descendant of the Ancients.
"Elmyra: I had no idea what he meant, so I said, ""Who are the Ancients?"""
"Tseng (flashback): They were the original stewards of the planet whose boundless knowledge and wisdom shall guide us to the promised land. Some believe the promised land to be a myth. Others, an allegory of sorts. But we take the words of the scriptures at face value, and believe it to be quite real. Which is why Shinra would like very much for Aerith to help us"
Aerith (flashback): You're wrong! I'm not an Ancient!
"Tseng (flashback): But Aerith... Even when you're all alone, don't you hear voices whispering secrets?"
"Aerith (flashback): No, never!"
"Elmyra: But all three of us knew that wasn't true. That man knew exactly who Aerith was, where she'd come from, and what she could do."
"Cloud: They knew where she was, but they didn't just take her? Doesn't sound like the Turks I know."
"Elmyra: She had to come willingly, otherwise it wouldn't work, they said. That's why...even if they did take her away, I'm sure she's still being treated like a guest... And that they'll send her straight back home once they get what they need."
Cloud: I doubt it.
"Elmyra: You're not planning anything, are you? Don't make things worse than they already are. If I lost her too, I don't know if I could... if I could ever... Just don't."
Tifa: Cloud. Maybe she's right about this. Maybe they'll let Aerith go when it's all over. Maybe...we'd be better off waiting a little while.
Barret: Let's head back to Sector 7. Got things to take care of. Like...checking up on the bar.
Tifa: Yeah.
Cloud: Okay.
Elmyra: Take care of yourselves now.
Barret: We're gonna win this fight. I promise.
Tifa: The main entrance to Sector 7 is buried under rubble now. So how are we supposed to get back inside?
Cloud: Underground passage in the park.
"Barret: Ah, good plan."
Tifa: But how do we get to the park?
Cloud: I know another way to get there. Aerith showed me before.
Barret: Heh. This Ancient girl knows her stuff. Didn't mean anythin' by it.
On-screen: Sector 6 Slums - Collapsed Expressway
"Barret: Aight, let's keep moving."
On-screen: Collapsed Expressway
Bandit: Get the bastards!
"Beck: Not so fast! You wanna come through here, you'll need to provide due compens You again!?"
Burke: Oh shit!
Barret: Friends of yours!
Beck: Stop lying! We go way back!
Tifa: Over there!
Barret: Huh? That a way out?
Tifa: I'm almost afraid to go back. To see it with my own eyes...
Cloud: Tifa...
Tifa: Come on.
Barret: Wymer! You're alive!
Wymer: Still in one piece.
Barret: Who else made it out?
Wymer: I wish I knew... Sorry.
Tifa: It's fine.
Barret: I'm just glad you survived. Gives me hope for the others.
Wymer: This is bad.
Betty: I really hope that all my friends are okay.
"Betty's Dad: I'm sure they are, honey. Don't worry."
Item Store Owner: Never know what you're gonna run into out there. Best be prepared.
Item Store Owner: Careful out there.
"Weapons Vendor: Sector 7, huh?"
Barret: Yeah... Left a few things behind.
"Weapons Vendor: I see. I know it's not much, but it's all I got."
On-screen: Head underground?
On-screen: S7-6 Service Tunnel
Barret: Okay. Let's see what's on the other side.
Barret: Again!?
Cloud: That one was a lot closer.
On-screen: Sector 7 Slums
Barret: My god...
Marle: Just a little more! Come on! C'mon!
Neighborhood Watch Member: It won't budge!
Barret: Make room!
Tifa: Marle!
Marle: You're alive!
Cloud: With me. Ready and
"Barret: Great job, guys."
Undercity Resident: Thank you. (cries)
Marle: I can't tell you how relieved I am to see you. So. What now?
Barret: Don't know. Find somethinganythingto do.
Marle: Been back to the bar yet?
Barret: No.
Marle: Maybe you should go take a look.
Barret: Okay. First the bar...then the rest.
Marle: Careful. The roads are a mess. Watch your step or you'll wind up in a hole!
"Barret: Hello! Anybody out there!? If you can hear me, say something!"
Cloud: Tifa.
Cloud: Get back!
Barret: Shit!
Tifa: Hear that?
Cloud: That's Wedge's cat.
Barret: What?
Tifa: Let's follow it.
"Barret: Ready? One, two, three!"
Tifa: Is this all that's left of Wedge's place?
Barret: Hey! We're coming down! Stay right where you are!
Barret: Hmph. This place reeks of Shinra.
Tifa: Wedge?
Barret: Wedge!
Barret: Of all the times! (screams)
On-screen: Shinra Underground Test Site
Barret: Tifa! Cloud! Shout if you can hear me! Hey!
"Barret: If there's no path, you gotta make one."
Barret: Must be a secret Shinra facility.
Barret: How long it take 'em to build all this beneath our feet?
Barret: Man...you'd think they dug halfway to hell.
"Barret: Just no escapin' them, is there?"
Barret: I'm really gonna enjoy burning it all down.
"Barret: Tifa! Hey, Tifa!"
Tifa: Barret!
Barret: You okay?
"Tifa: To tell you the truth, not really. I think there's a nest around here somewhere. Can you take care of it?"
Barret: I gotcha!
Barret: Sorry.
Baret: Tifa! Where's Cloud?
Tifa: I don't know.
"Barret: Well, he can take care of himself. We've got bigger issues."
Barret: Are you all right?
"Tifa: Yeah, I'm good, thanks."
Barret: All right. Gotta go find Wedge. Come on.
"Tifa: I'm afraid to ask, but did you just shoot your way in here?"
"Barret: Well, yeah. Worked, didn't it?"
Barret: If I gotta climb another damn ladder...
Tifa: Hey. You think Wedge is holding up okay?
"Barret: Of course he is. He's a lot tougher than people think. Probably sleeping soundly, dreaming about his cats."
Tifa: You're right. We should treat him to a nice meal when he gets back. His choice.
Barret: Gotta stay on my toes if I'm gonna make it outta here alive.
Barret: Wedge!
Tifa: He's okay.
Barret: You sure?
Barret: (chuckles) Making me worry like that. I'd kick your ass if you didn't look like shit! Thank god.
Tifa: Thank you!
Tifa: Okay. Let's go.
Barret: Uhsure!
Barret: Yup...it's you all right.
Tifa: What is this...?
Tifa: Barret!
Barret: The hell is this now!?
Barret: Where were you freaks hiding!?
Tifa: Are they Shinra experiments!?
"Barret: Hah! Well if that's the case, then it's only right we put the bastards down!"
"Barret: Ah, of course there's more."
Tifa: You good?
Barret: Like you even gotta ask!
Barret: Gettin' real tired of this shit!
Tifa: This is ridiculous.
"Barret: We gotta close that duct. Tifa, you're up!"
Tifa: Okay! Cover me!
Barret: Tifa!
Tifa: Seriously!?
Tifa: It's using its friends as weapons!?
"Barret: Hey, Tifa! Heads up!"
Barret: Huh! Getting tired?
Tifa: Look!
"Barret: (laughs) Well, that sure looks like a weak point to me!"
Barret: All that's left is to deal with these freaks!
Tifa: Cloud!
"Barret: 'Bout time, merc."
Cloud: You're up.
Barret: Late to the party and you're givingmeorders?
Barret: Hell yeah!
Barret: So how'd you manage to track us down?
Cloud: Followed the trail of bullet holes. There's nobody else I know who'd leave that kinda mess.
"Tifa: Oh, god...were those..."
Barret: People?
Cloud: Yeah. That's the Shinra I know.
Tifa: Cloud?
Barret: What the hell was that?
Tifa: We need to get him somewhere safe. Everything else can wait until after.
Barret: Agreed. Let's go.
Tifa: Cloud.
Cloud: Good kitty.
"Barret: I want you to take Wedge back for me. I'm gonna look around for the others. He made it, didn't he? They could still be alive."
"Cloud: I saw them both at the pillar... Jessie and Biggs. Saw...how bad they were hurt. I'm sorry, but..."
Barret: Don't.
Tifa: They've returned to the planet.
Barret: They...they were supposed to return tous.
Barret: But if we stop now...they'll never let us live it down. So...we carry that weight.
Barret: I'm sorry. I truly am. We had no other place to go and...
Elmyra: I would never leave a wounded man out on the street.
"Cloud: Elmyra. I know what you said, but you have to let us go after Aerith."
Elmyra: Not this again.
"Cloud: We found an underground Shinra lab where they've done human testing. This wasn't the first time and it won't be the last. I know these people, and I know they're never gonna let Aerith go. She's the last living Ancient on the planet. Think about what that means to Shinra's scientists. Especially to that son of a bitch Hojo. We're all just numbers and meat to him."
Elmyra: Enough!
Cloud: But
Elmyra: Please. I need some time to think. You've all had a long day. Why don't you go upstairs and get some rest.
Barret: You should rest up while you can.
Cloud: Likewise.
"Barret: Nah, I'm goodreal good. 'Sides, when I close my eyes, I start thinking 'bout things. 'Bout people. Like Finn. Lazy little punk. Kid would do damn near anything 'cept what you told him. But ask him to paint you a picture and boy howdy. Those Stamps in the tunnels? Finn's work. Every one."
"Barret: Then there's Al. Intel guy. He had these tricks for stealing codes I still don't understand. Stole his share of hearts, too. But, when it came to the ladies, he just had the one trick. Bouquet of flowers hidden behind his back. Funny to think, some of 'em might've even come from here. He pulled the flower trick on Tifa once, believe it or not. She told him where to stick 'em."
Cloud: 'Course she did.
"Barret: Our quartermaster, Nellie, had a good laugh at that. She was tight with Jessie. People sometimes took 'em for sisters even. They'd say ""No way!"" and get upset, but then they'd start giggling and you knew..."
"Barret: Yeah... They'll all be fine. They're strong. They're tough. Like me. After we save Aerith, I'll introduce you to them."
Cloud: Sounds good.
Barret: Never thought I'd feel better after talking with your hard-boiled ass.
Cloud: Think you can sleep now?
Barret: Oh yeah. Like a baby.
Cloud: Can't sleep?
Tifa: No. You too?
Cloud: I heard footsteps.
Tifa: Sorry. Didn't mean to wake you.
Cloud: I'm a light sleeper. It's a SOLDIER thing.
"Tifa: That flower you gave me the other night. That was from Aerith, wasn't it?"
"Tifa: I knew there was something weird going on. You, buying flowers. They symbolize reunion, believe it or not. I was curious, so I looked it up. I tried to keep it alive as long as I could. But now...it's dead and buried."
Tifa: Like the bar...our home...and everything else.
Tifa: They took everything from us. Again. (cries)
"Tifa: Cloud... Cloud, you're hurting me."
Tifa: It's stupid. I know that crying's a waste of time.
Cloud: That's not true.
Tifa: Thank you.
Cloud: How is this...? Is this a dream?
Aerith: Maybe. You tell me.
Cloud: You okay?
"Aerith: Don't I look it? I used to live in the Shinra Building, back when I was really little."
Cloud: Your mom told us.
"Aerith: Right. So it kinda feels like I've gone back to my childhood home, you know? Honestly, it's not that bad."
"Cloud: So what, you wanna stay?"
"Aerith: C'mon, Cloud. Don't be silly."
Cloud: Your mom's really worried too.
"Aerith: ""Too""? So you're worried about me?"
Cloud: Of course I am.
Aerith: I'm sorry about that. Really.
Cloud: Is that...?
Aerith: Everyone dies eventually.
Cloud: I suppose.
"Aerith: So we need to make the most of the time we haveto live our lives the way we wanna live. Every minute...every moment, matters."
Cloud: I'll remember that.
Aerith: Good. So...
Cloud: You need to embrace this moment. Right?
"Aerith: I'm glad I met you, Cloud. I really am. I'm grateful for all the words we've shared. For all the moments and the memories. You've made me more happy than you know. And I'll always cherish what you've given me. But... But whatever happens, you can't fall in love with me. Even if you think you have...it's not real."
Cloud: Do I get a say in all this?
Aerith: It's almost morning. Time to go.
Cloud: I'm coming for you.
Aerith: If that's what you want. Thank you.
"Barret: You've done more for us than we deserve. I won't forget this. If you ever need anything, all you gotta do is holler."
Elmyra: Happy to help out however I can.
Cloud: Elmyra.
Elmyra: ...I've been thinking about what you said.
Cloud: She's calling out to me. I can feel it.
Tifa: We all can. So please. She's our friend. We have to help her.
Barret: Mm.
Elmyra: I always knew it was coming. Knew that one day I'd have to say goodbye to my baby girl. But not yet. Pleasebring her back to me.
Marlene: Daddy!
Barret: Marlene...
Marlene: Are you going?
"Barret: I'm sorry, honey. I wish I didn't have to. I wish I could be with you all the time. I really do. But if I stay here, I can't fight out there."
Marlene: Hm?
"Barret: Some bad people are...trying to hurt the planet. And Daddy...Daddy and his friends are trying to stop those bad people. The slums, your friends, the whole planetit's Daddy's job to protect it."
"Barret: And that's why I've gotta go. You remember that nice girl who came to find you? Well, now we have to go find her. And when we bring her home, you ned to say thank you, okay?"
Marlene: 'Kay! That girl... She was kinda...
Barret: What?
Marlene: Nothing. You should help her.
Barret: We will.
Marlene: You'll come back...right?
"Barret: Of course, I promise."
Marlene: Okay. You can go!
Tifa: Barret...
Barret: She's tougher than me.
Barret: Aight! Time to get some payback.
Cloud: Don't forget why we're doing this.
"Barret: I know, I know. To rescue Aerith."
"Tifa: So, how're we supposed to get topside? With everything that's happened, the trains still aren't running."
"Barret: Well, we could walk along the tracks."
Cloud: The city's on high alert. All the roads and public transit have probably been locked down by now.
Barret: So what's the plan then? You know another way up?
"Tifa: No, but I think I know someone who might."
Cloud: You mean Corneo.
"Kyrie: My fellow grounders, listen up, because boy, do I have some news for you! And it's assured to knock your socks all the way into next week! Gather round, 'cause this is the good stuff!"
"Kyrie: So, after bombing Reactors 1 and 5, what do the eco-terrorists do? They go for the trifecta and take out Mako Reactor 7! Another attack by amateurs who don't care about collateral damage. The sky is falling and Avalanche is to blame! But wait! Did you know Wutai is the one funding their activities!? For all their claims about fighting for the slums...they're nothing more than pawns of Wutaipuppets dancing to the tune of their foreign masters! And that's the truth! Topside news delivered straight to your ears! That'll be five gil. Five gilcome on!"
"Undercity Resident (1): Damn, man! Knew we couldn't trust Wutai to leave us alone."
"Undercity Resident (2): It's the reactors. They want 'em, we got 'em."
Undercity Resident (3): Does this mean there'll be another war?
Undercity Resident (1): After what they've done? What choice do we have?
"Kyrie: Five gil apiececough it up! The truth ain't free, you know!"
"Barret: We ain't no damn pawns of Wutai! I couldn't care less about the rest, but that shit?"
Tifa: No one will listen to us. There's no point in even trying.
Tifa: I'm sorry.
"Barret: Hey... Hey Tifa, listen. There's no room in this for regrets or what-ifs or any of that. All we can do is keep moving forward. Keep following this path we chose. Wherever, so we can say we did all we could."
"Tifa: I know. But...right now...instead of looking forward, you need to look around. Everyone here is terrified. So I'm asking you...don't."
"Tifa: I know we're short on time, but let's try to help out wherever we can."
"Chadley: Marvelous! Leviathan, the patron deity of Wutai, is not an enemy to be trifled with. Together, you can cleanse the world of the Shinra scourge."
"(Upon defeating Bahamut in Chadley's VR Combat Simulator.)Chadley: Now that was a battle! What an impressive feat to hold your own against one of the most exalted summons known to man. Together with the legendary Bahamut, I have every confidence you can expunge Shinra from existence. Such bravery... incredible!"
Tifa: Do we really have to deal with Corneo again?
Cloud: Got no other choice.
Barret: What? Did you guys get into it with him or something?
Tifa: I don't wanna talk about it.
"Barret: Huh? Hey, Cloud, what ha"
Cloud: Don't recall.
"Innkeeper: It's quite crowded at the moment, but I'll see what I can do."
On-screen: Stay the night?
Innkeeper: Have a safe trip.
"Souvenir Shop Owner: With these babies, you can send intruders flying! I guarantee this is the only home protection you'll ever need!"
Souvenir Shop Owner: Only a few left. Get yours while you can!
"Gatekeeper: Hey, been waiting for ya. Sowhat're ya in the mood to fight?"
Barret: No one's home.
"Kotch: Help, somebody! Hey!"
"Kotch: You mother Uh, I mean... Hey, there. Would you mind helping me out? I'm kind of in a bind, as you can see..."
"Kotch: Thanks, you guys! Man, these jerks from Shinra showed up outta nowhere! Accused me of leaking information and called me ""useless."" And, well, the rest is history. Well, anyway, thanks for helping me out. Peace out!"
Leslie: Long time no see. What brings you back here?
"Tifa: Well, we need to find a way to get topside as quickly as possible, and we figured Corneo oughta know one."
"Leslie: Is that so... In that case, I can help."
Barret: You serious? Then tell us!
Leslie: Follow me.
Cloud: Let's just hear him out.
Barret: So...what's the deal with the hole?
"Leslie: Unfinished business. If you three give me a hand with it, I'll give you what you need to get topside."
Tifa: You want us to go back into the sewers with you? What's down there?
Leslie: Corneo's hidey-hole. That's where I'm headed.
"Barret: You're not gonna try to screw us over, are you?"
"Leslie: If that's what you think, walk away. I'll find somebody else to work with. And you'll have to find another way to get topside."
Cloud: All right. We're in.
Barret: Say what?
"Cloud: He betrays us, he dies."
Leslie: Fine by me.
Tifa: He means it.
"Leslie: I'll tell you more after we've climbed down. When you're good to go, let me know."
Leslie: You guys ready?
On-screen: Head into the sewer?
Leslie: Okay. Follow me.
Barret: Seriouslywhat's the deal with the hole?
Cloud: It's a trop for the don's enemies.
Barret: What?
Leslie: No one's ever gotten out alive. Well. Until recently that is.
Ms. Folia: How far could they have gone?
"Ms. Folia: Oh, Cloud! Have you seen the kids around by any chance? I haven't seen them since they left to do their patrols. I knew I should've told them to stay inside today. If you do happen to run into them somewhere, could you tell them to come back right away? I can describe them if it'd help"
Cloud: Don't worry. I'll know.
Barret: Just stay calm and wait here. Never knowthey might come back on their own. Okay?
"Ms. Folia: Yes, of course. Thank you so very much."
"Oates: Hey, Cloud."
Barret: Hmm. Gotta be one of them lost kids.
Oates: Lost? Who said we were lost? Stupid old man.
Barret: What'd you say?
Cloud: What're you doing out here? And where's everyone else?
"Oates: Well, we saw a bunch of tombstones lying on the ground, so we decided to stand them back up. And then I heard laughing coming from somewhere, and when I turned around, everyone was gone. I was alone."
Oates: That! I heard that and everyone disappeared.
Cloud: Heads up!
Oates: Guys!
Boy (1): Oates!
Boy (2): Look! Cloud's here too!
Barret: So why'd you kids come out all this way?
"Oates: This is where our parents are. They're resting, but we wanted to say hi. Sometimes you just wanna do that, you know?"
Barret: ...I do.
Oates: Thanks so much for coming to find us! That's another one I owe ya! We're gonna head back to the House now. Ms. Folia's probably pretty worried.
"Boy (2): Hey Cloud, I found this on the ground. You should take it. I think it might come in handy!"
Barret: Buncha little smart-asses... With good hearts.
"Stablehand: Hey, you! Cloud, right? Man, am I glad I caught you. Samhe told me who you are. Said you're a merc, and a former SOLDIER at that! Listen, I hate to ask, but we've got a few runaway birds. Mind helping us find them? Poor things were so startled by that plate coming down, they just up and bolted. I'm sure they're around here somewhere, frightened and hungry. My poor birds..."
Barret: Worried about 'em huh? All right. I think we can help you out.
"Stablehand: Oh, thank you! When you find them, feed them this. THere's there missing all told, and their names are Coco, Lolo, and Momo. They'll come on home once they got some food in their bellies. Good luck. I'm counting on y'all."
"Stablehand: Oh, thank goodness! Been looking for y'all. You gotta help me. It's the chocobos... They've escaped, wouldn't you know!"
Sam: Thanks for agreeing to find my birds. You're a real saint. Someone said they heard a chocobo warking in one of them Sector 5 back alleys. Heard there's a chocobo out by the collapsed expressway. A chocobo was spotted near the old church. That's about all that's reached my ears. I'd bet good money those wandering birds are mine.
Chocobo: Kweh kweh.
Chocobo: Kweh...? Kweh!
Chocobo: Wark wark. Kweh kweh.
Barret: Okay then! That makes three.
Cloud: We'd better check in at Sam's.
On-screen: Return to Sam?
"Sam: There's the champ with a heard of gold! My babies are all back home, safe and sound. Now I can finally get back to the busienss of business. Thanks, partner. Here, y'all earned this. It's a pass that'll get you a ride on one of my carriages whenever you need itfree of charge, of course. Not bad, am I right?"
"Sam: Chocobos're somethin' else. You can ride 'em, pet 'em, befriend 'em. What would we do without 'em? They're the reason a guy like me can keep a roof over his head in a town like thisand that's no lie. I wouldn't blame ya for doubting that coming from me, but it is what it is."
Madam M: If it isn't Cloud.
Cloud: We're looking for a way topside. Know one?
"Madam M: Good luck with that. Security's so tight these days that not even a gnat could slip through. Wall Market's in a sorry state, too. Corneo's men are turning it upside down looking for Avalanche."
Madam M: Hmm? The man with a gun for an arm...
Barret: What? Got a problem?
"Madam M: No, but you might. Corneo's men are searching high and low for an Avalanche member who fits your description. Shinra has placed a very impressive bounty on you and your friends' heads. And a lot of people are looking to get rich."
Barret: Ain't these fools got anything better to do?
"Madam M: You should also know that you and that arm of yours were spotted in the Sector 5 slums. Apparently, you were loitering in a rather lovely flower garden?"
Barret: Oh yeah...? Wait!
Tifa: This is bad. Really bad.
Barret: Let's move!
Madam M: Do be careful on your way back to the slums.
Housemother: Oh Cloud! Thank goodness you're here. A group of Corneo's men just came throughheaded for Aerith's place.
"Housemother: I don't know what business they have with Aerith, but I know it can't be anything good."
Corneo Lackey: I dunno... You really think this gun-arm dude'll come back instead of running?
"Hoodlum: Oh, you bet your ass he'll come back. Now shut up and keep your eyes peeled."
"Corneo Lackey: Yeah, yeah. Well, not like we're goin' anywhere with this thing, anyway."
Hoodlum: How's he holdin' up?
Corneo Lackey: Beats me. His face creeps me out.
Corneo Lackey: Better watch where he points that thing.
"Hoodlum: Better watch your mouth, bitch. You don't wanna give him a reason to hold a grudge, ya know?"
"Corneo Lackey: Hey, it's him! Gun-arm!"
Barret: Heard you punks were lookin' for me. Didn't wanna keep you waitin'.
Corneo Lackey: Wait! You!?
Hoodlum: Should've known you were one of 'em!
Cloud: But am I?
"Hoodlum: Whateverenough of this bullshit! Hey, let 'em loose."
"Corneo Lackey': Uh, sure!"
"Hoodlum: Hah! Y'all are in for a world of hurt now! Hack 'em to bis, y'hear me! Leave the faces, though. Shinra ain't gonna give us the bounty otherwise!"
"Hoodlum: We give up, okay!? We won't say a word to no one about you bein' here. Reallyhonest!"
"Cloud: That's right. You'll tell everyone we were never herethat the rumors were bullshit. And if we hear about you, or any of your friends, coming round here ever again..."
Tifa: You'll answer to my boot.
"Hoodlum: Yessir! Er, miss!"
"Jules: It's been hours nowdon't you think you've done enough? Believe me, I ought to know."
Andrea: No...not yet...
Ronnie: Andi...
Andrea: Cloud... How are you?
Cloud: I was hoping you knew a way we could get topside.
"Andrea: Hmm... Sorry, but it's...not possible..."
"Andrea: Well, well. What do we have here? I can see you're someone who likes to train, to be their very best."
Tifa: Me?
"Andrea: Your physique: slender, yet toned. And that perfectly balanced symmetry. I can tell from a glance that you learned from the best there is. But your muscles look tight, which can only mean one thingyou're conflicted."
Cloud: Tifa?
"Jules: Excuse me. You're Tifa, right? While you're here, wanna give Andi a run for his money? Work up a sweat, release some endorphins. It's the answer to everything. I promise."
Andrea: I'm in...if you are.
Andrea: All right then. The winner will be the one who does the most pull-ups.
On-screen: Challenge Andrea?
Andrea: It's just the two of us now.
Andrea: Thank you. I had quite a wonderful time.
"Andrea: You truly are perfection, my dear."
"Andrea: ...It seems you've bested me, Tifa."
Tifa: I can't believe I won.
Andrea: Your fiery passion pushed me to my limits and helped me to overcome my lingering stress and fatigue. I'll be taking the stage tonight in the best condition of my life. Thank you.
"Tifa: No, thank you for...the same!"
Andrea: To commemorate the evening. I would be honored if you joined me onstage for a perfomance someday. (laughs)
Jules: There's always time for training.
Jay: Are you ready for this?
Jay: No!
Jules: Okaylet's have some fun!
Jules: You know where to find me for a rematch.
"Betty: Everyone's so sad... Think, think..."
"Betty: Oh, heya!"
Tifa: Betty. I'm so glad to see you're okay.
"Betty: You too! Uh, where's Marlene? Is she okay?"
Barret: Don't worry. She's safe.
"Betty: Really? I'm so glad! Hey, can you help me with something? I'm looking for music discs for the jukebox. I think some new music might cheer people upmake them happy!"
Tifa: That's a wonderful idea.
"Barret: Okay! If we find any music discs, we'll bring 'em straight to you. You just promise to crank up the volume, all right?"
Betty: You know I will! Thanks!
"Betty: Hmm, I don't think this song's doing it. People still seem kinda sad. I'm still seeing a lot of frowns."
"Old Man: It's not right, me getting out..."
Woman: Hngk...
Man: Th-th-there's nothing left for me now.
Guest: There's nothing quite like kicking back and letting the music flow through you. What's that? You wanna get in on my flow?
"Souvenir Shop Owner: With these babies, you can send intruders flying! I guarantee this is the only home protection you'll ever need!"
"Woman: Hey, what's up man! You vibing with this jam too? You can have a copy if you want."
"Betty: Hmm, I don't think this song's doing it. People still seem kinda sad. I'm still seeing a lot of frowns."
"Betty: Ooh, I like this one. It's really peaceful, don't you think?"
Woman: Um... Is it okay if I stay and listen for a bit? This song is a favorite of mine.
Betty: Sure!
"Betty: Wow, what a song! It makes me feel like I can do anything!"
"Man: Yeah...yeah! I can feel this song calling to my inner warrior. Yeah, I can take on the world! It's time I took action, made a stand!"
"Barret: Hell yeah, that's it! That's the fire we need right now! Be a force for change, brother!"
Betty: I know this one! Marlene and I danced to it before.
"Old Man: That's wrong! Wrong, wrong, wrong! This is how you get down with this jam. I oughta knowit was my favorite back in the day! Pay attention kiddo! It's all in the hips!"
Marlene: Wow!
Betty: Tell me if you find more music discs!
Betty: Isn't this great!? Everyone's smiling again. Thanks so much for the help!
Tifa: Our pleasure. I think we needed it too.
"Barret: (hums victory fanfare, laughs) Until our victory fanfare rings out through all of Midgar, our battle will rage on! Hey, I'm just kidding."
Doctor: What am I gonna do now...?
"Doctor: Hey, I know you. You're Aerith's bodyguard. I could really use her help. She always knew where to find the best herbs, and... You haven't seen her, have you? I used up all my meds treating people injured when the plate fell, you see. I could make more, but not without those herbs."
Cloud: So what do you need?
"Doctor: You mean you're willing to help me out? Oh, thank you! You'd be doing this town a huge favor. Here's a list of everything I'm looking for."
On-screen: Return to the doctor?
"Doctor: Oh! Did you manage to get everything I needed? Thank you. This oughta be more than enough. I can see why Aerith put her trust in you. Don't worry. I'll take it from here. You've done more than your fair share already. Here, take this. I'm betting it'll come in handy."
Doctor: My medicine's gonna help a lot of people.
"Johnny: What were you thinking!? Stupid, stupid, stupid! Crawl into a hole and die!"
"Johnny: Bro! Tifa! Damn, is it good to see you guys again."
Cloud: I told you to stop calling me that.
Johnny: Bro. I'm in serious need of your expertise. Lend me a hand!
"Cloud: Fine, what?"
"Johnny: Truth is, I'm, uh, trying to get outta town, for, uh, reasons. Yeah, reasons. But the thing is... (cries) I got mugged! She took it. Took it all, man! I tried to chase her down, I really did! But she was real fast-like. Man, what I am gonna do? This could be the end for ol' Johnny boy! I'm beggin' yahelp me out! Come on, bro!"
Cloud: (sighs) What'd she look like?
"Johnny: Bro! Uh, hold on. Lemme thinkwanna get this right. She was a cutie. Black hair. Pretty sure she was wearin' a hat. And...oh yeah! She was wearing these striped stockings too."
Cloud: Kyrie...?
Barret: Which way'd she go?
"Johnny: Uh, toward the church I think."
Kyrie: What? It wasn't me. You've got the wrong girl! Never committed a crime in my life!
Cloud: You Kyrie?
"Kyrie: Kyrie? Who's that? Can't say I know her, but cool name."
Tifa: (chuckles) Someone mugged our friend and took every last gil he had. Sound familiar?
"Kyrie: Oh, that? I thought I was in actual trouble. Don't scare me like that!"
Barret: Now I remember you. You're that chick. The one who was spreadin' lies in Sector 5.
"Kyrie: Oh yeah, I did do that. Good times, good times."
"Kyrie: Hold on. I know you, blondie! You're that merc everyone's talking about! Maybe my luck's not so bad. Shinra's after me. You've gotta help me."
"Cloud: Stole from them too, did you?"
"Kyrie: No! Well, yes, sortait's complicated. How was I supposed to know they were Shinra? And now those jerks won't leave me alone! Even though all I took was some ugly key. I mean, what's the big deal anyway?"
Barret: Wait a minutethat was you!?
"Kyrie: ...Oh greqt. So, everyone's talking about it? Is this the end? Am I a dead woman? Do I have to go on the run? Leave Midgar forever and never look back?"
"Tifa: Kyrie, please. Just give us the money you stole from our friend, would you? And the key while you're at it."
Kyrie: No way. You're gonna split the second I do. And then who'll protect me? I can't handle this on my own...(cries)
Cloud: We'll handle Shinra if you give us the key. Deal?
"Kyrie: It's a deal! Right about now, those Shinra creeps should be hanging out at the colosseum. They're waiting for a special match to start, starring yours truly. It's the talk of the town."
Tifa: You're joking!
"Kyrie: Oh, I won't be there. I'm not stupid."
Barret: It's a miracle you've managed to stay alive this long.
Kyrie: I'll take that as a compliment. Now run along and clean up my mess.
"Gatekeeper: Oh! Champ! Couldn't have picked a better time. This Kyrie chick totally flaked on her match, which means we're down a fighter. And we can't exactly pit the other guy against himself! What d'you say? Mind takin' her spot?"
On-screen: Take on which challenge?
"Beastmaster: The hell you doin' here!? Where's the girl, Kyrie!? That thievin' little pip-squeak!"
Barret: Guessin' he's the guy she's runnin' from.
Cloud: Kyrie's not coming. You'll have to make do with us.
"Beastmaster: Whatever. I can roll with it. After all, you and me, we got unfinished business!"
"Gatekeeper: In a shocking turn of events, our next bout is now a grudge match! Which of these two will claim victory in today's Angel Cup!? Fighters...begin!"
"Gatekeeper: Our reigning champion does it again! Not only does he retain his crown, but now he can add beast whisperer to his list of impressive achievements!"
Barret: Hah! That wasn't too much trouble.
Gatekeeper: Watching you guys fight gave me goose bumps. Hope your next match is even better than the last!
On-screen: Return to Kyrie?
"Kyrie: So, how'd it go?"
"Cloud: Well enough. If they're smart, they won't send anyone else."
Kyrie: Really!? (sighs) That is so good to hear!
"Barret: Learn your lesson, girl?"
"Kyrie: Totally! From now on, I only steal from the right people."
Barret: That ain't the lesson.
"Kyrie: (sighs) Talk about a weight off my shoulders. Oh, I completely lost track of time! I'd better get going."
Mireille: Hold it!
Kyrie: Grandma!? Why're you here?
"Mireille: You, young lady, are gonna hear about this later. Thank you for keeping her out of trouble."
"Tifa: She say ""grandma""?"
Mireille: What? Did I forget to mention it to you? Kyrie's my granddaughtermy flesh and blood. See? We even have the same eyes.
"Mireille: Kyrie, the key. You've kept them waiting long enough."
"Kyrie: Yeah, yeah... What's it for, anyway? Why do you guys want it?"
"Mireille: And how's that any of your business, young lady? Learn to wipe your own ass before you start rooting around in other people's shit."
"Kyrie: Ugh, Grandma! Cut it out. You're embarrassing me..."
"Mireille: Me embarrass you? Says the girl who steals from anyone. Even a thief needs principles, not to mention the courage of convictions to follow their conscience. Take it from methe Guardian Angel of the Slums."
Tifa: Wait a minuteyou're the Angel!?
"Mireille: And you three are Avalanche. There's a fire in you. I can see it flickering in your eyes. That same fire's in me, too. The Guardian Angel of the Slums, Avalanchethey're just names. We are who we choose to be. But you have to decide who that is, and commit. Make the most of your time while you still have it. Right?"
"Damon: It's you, my good merc! What brilliant timing you have! Oh, hello thereit is a pleasure to meet you both. I'm a journalist for the Daily Buzz."
Barret: The Daily Buzz? You mean that trash filled with Shinra fluff pieces?
"Damon: Well, yes, that's fairbut we do get a lot of inside information because of our close ties with the company. (laughs) Curious? Here's the scoop. A certain division of Shinrathat shall remain namelesswas planning to seize Corneo's assets. But before they could, the key to his secret vault within which his misbegotten gains were securely tucked away...was stolen! And my sources tell me that the thief...is the undercity's beloved hero: the Angel of the Slums! The unidentified bandit who's been targeting anyone with ties to Shinra or Corneo! Yes, that Angel of the Slums has struck again! Well? Do I have your undivided attention now?"
"Barret: Kinda, but hurry it up. We don't have time for a three-act play."
"Damon: Then I'll make this quick. So! My good merc. You do remember where the Angel's hideout is, right?"
Cloud: Do you remember the death threat she left there?
"Damon: Oh, that. I've decided to seek the silver lining in this case. If the Angel of the Slums deigns to taken an interest in a humble reporter, then that itself would be a story!"
Cloud: ...What are you asking?
"Damon: If you recover the stolen key, feel free to help yourself to the contents of Corneo's vault. All I want is knowledgethe identity of the Angel. So if you happen to learn anything of value, I'd be tremendously grateful to you if you passed it along."
On-screen: Former Disposal Area
Barret: Okay then. Y'all think we got everything? Question is: now what? It's not gonna be easy selling this stuff.
"Tifa: Oh, I know. What about Marle? We could ask her to help. I'm sure she'd be happy to."
"Marle: Oh, what brings you here?"
Cloud: Gifts from an angel.
Tifa: They're to be used to help the people of Sector 7 rebuild.
"Marle: The Angel of the Slums? You didn't meet her, did you? Tell me, what was she like?"
Cloud: Never met her. Just her go-between.
"Marle: A shame. Bless her sweet soul... I don't know what to say... I'll make sure the funds are put to good use. Here, why don't you take this? Something tells me you can use it more than me."
Wymer: This is bad.
"Wymer: Oh, hey Barret."
"Barret: Hey, how's it going?"
"Wymer: Could be better. I've got a good number of watchmen out looking for survivors. But as much as I'd love to join them, I've got another mess on my hands at the moment. Remember those rumors about a lab? They're true. There is onehidden underground somewhere, and it's full of monsters. So, Cloud...think you can lend us a hand with it? It's only a matter of time before these monsters come calling. I know it's a dangerous job but"
Cloud: But no one else can do it.
"Wymer: Well, yeah. So help us out."
Wymer: I've been hearing reports of howling from deep underground.
"Neighborhood Watch Member: We've been getting tremors ever since last night. Roads are collapsing, and sinkholes are opening up all over."
Barret: Yeah! That's how it's done.
"Wymer: You took care of those monsters? Oh, thank you! That's one less big problem to worry about. We owe you."
"Barret: I know it's tough right now, but stay strong, y'hear?"
"Wymer: You too, buddy. But hey, we're grounders. We don't break easy. I know it's not much, but take this, with my thanks."
"Johnny: My wallet! My precious wallet! You really did it, bro! I knew I could count on you."
"Cloud: For the last time, don't call me that."
Johnny: Thank you. Now I can get outta town.
Tifa: You're leaving?
"Johnny: Hush, Tifa. Don't try to stop me. I'm a wanted man in these parts. If I stayed I'd be a danger to you too."
"Tifa: Uh, okay..."
"Johnny: But if you begged me to stay, I could reconsider throwing everything away"
"Tifa: Good luck out there, Johnny."
"Johnny: Oh, er...okay."
Tifa: You'll be fine wherever. You're Johnnydon't forget!
"Johnny: Uh, yeah...hell yeah, I am! I'm your Johnny, Tifa. And nothing's gonna bring me down! Bro, Tifa, keep on shinin'. Johnny out!"
On-screen: Sewer System
"Barret: Youaregonna hold up your end of the bargain, right?"
Leslie: Long as you hold up yoursyeah.
"Barret: I don't trust you, and I don't like you. So if you so much as breathe in a suspicious way...I'll turn that face of yours into a honeycomb."
"Leslie: I'd save your bullets for the monsters if I were you. Some are a lot tougher than you'd think. Hate to say it, but I can barely take 'em on my own. You, on the other, shouldn't have any trouble, am I right?"
Cloud: Let's get this over with.
Leslie: Head for the trunk lineit marks the border with Sector 7. You three lead the way. I'll follow a short distance behind.
Barret: The mark of Avalanche. Right. Jessie and Biggs stashed a skeleton key down here.
Tifa: I never got the chance to thank them for what they did.
Cloud: Tifa...
"Tifa: Let's just keep moving, okay?"
"Leslie: Hate to interrupt, but the trunk line's just through that door. The one over there."
"Barret: Yeah, we heard you."
Barret: Made it. 'Bout time.
Leslie: This way. There should be a door with Corneo's mark on it around here somewhere.
Tifa: Hey...wasn't this locked before?
"Leslie: Your time to shine. Clear the path ahead, would you?"
"Barret: Yeah, yeah..."
Tifa: Can I ask you something? Why did you help us out before? You could've lost everything.
Leslie: Andrea. He told me to.
Tifa: That really it?
Leslie: And I couldn't bring myself to let it happen again...
Tifa: Huh?
Leslie: It doesn't matter. Let's go.
"Leslie: Wait. We're getting close to Corneo's hideout. From here on, I'll take the lead."
Barret: This it?
Leslie: Yeah.
Cloud: So how we supposed to get topside?
Leslie: Through here.
Cloud: Then you're telling me we're not done?
"Leslie: Sorry guys, but it's not that simple"
Leslie: No... Wait! We gotta catch him!
Tifa: Huh?
"Leslie: He took the key to the door! Without it, we're screwed!"
Cloud: Let's go.
Barret: Bastard went that way!
Leslie: Shit! Don't lose him!
Leslie: Deal with 'em!
Barret: Where in the hell did that thing run off to?
Leslie: Up. As if this wasn't enough fun already.
On-screen: Sewer System - Old Line
"Leslie: The area up aheadit's that thing's den. Keep your eyes peeled. You never know when its friends're gonna pop up, or where."
"Barret: We ain't got time to play hide-and-seek, ya little shit!"
"Barret: (chuckles) Gotcha now! So, gonna make us work for it, are ya! I'm not gonna hurt ya, little fella. So just stay st"
Cloud: Take the right.
Tifa: I'm on it.
"Barret: Your days are numbered, ratboy!"
Tifa: He's so slippery!
Cloud: Just like his owner.
Leslie: Give it back!
Leslie: Give it back.
Tifa: That's...
Leslie: Give it back.
Barret: That's not a key.
Leslie: Sorry.
Barret: That's not your pendant either. Were they family?
Leslie: No...
"Leslie's Fiance (flashback): It was all just a dream, wasn't it... But one day... No. Time to wake up. And forget."
"Leslie: Six months ago... On that day Corneo picked her as a bride. And on the next she vanished without a trace. But before she did, she gave it back. Salt on the wound. Thing cost me a small fortune."
Tifa: Why did you wanna come down here?
"Leslie: Revenge. I know I need to let go, but I can't. I need closure, 'cause without it...I'll never be able to move on."
"Cloud: It's fine. As long as you get us topside, we're still in."
"Leslie: Thanks. And don't worry, I got you."
Barret: You all right.
Leslie: I know a shortcut. Follow me.
Barret: That twisted piece of shit. I'm gonna enjoy beatin' him to a pulp.
"Leslie: Corneo's mine, and mine alone."
Barret: Huh?
Leslie: Please.
Cloud: Fine.
Leslie: Wait outside.
Barret: Think the kid's gonna be okay goin' it alone?
Leslie: It's Leslie! Got some urgent info for hte don!
Don Corneo: Oho? Come alone?
Leslie: 'Course.
Don Corneo: Really? Without my little Avalanche kittens? I thought I told you to round them up and bring them to me.
Leslie: Actuallly...it's them I came to talk about.
Don Corneo: Leslie. I don't think I need to remind you why I'm down here. Spilling the beans to those three escape artists was a serious mistake. And now I'm on Shinra's shitlist! The plate stunt was meant to be an unprecedented tragedy claiming countless innocent lives... But those naughty little kittens organized an evacuation and screwed up the plan.
Don Corneo: I'll let you in on a secret. Shinra's going to abandon Midgar...and build something close to paradise. I was invited to be a part of itdon of a new and improved Wall Market. I'll be lucky to live another week. Leslie... I was gonna let you run your own placegive you a piece of the action. What a shame.
"Don Corneo: Pop quiz time, kiddo! Villains like us only divulge our evil plans...in a certain situation. But what is that situation, hm?"
Leslie: When you think...you've already won.
Don Corneo: Goodbye.
"Cloud: Think again, Don."
Don Corneo: Oho! It's you!
"Barret: You were talking 'bout the Sector 7 plan. Keep talking, asshole."
"Don Corneo: Ahh! Over there! Over there, look!"
Barret: Don't try to bullshit us!
Don Corneo: But that's the thing! It's not technically bullshit when it's true.
Don Corneo: Good Abzu! Feel free to play with your food! Don out...
Barret: Bastard...
"Cloud: First him, then Cornei."
Cloud: You okay?
Leslie: Where's Corneo?
Barret: Sorry. Bastard got away.
Leslie: It's fine. I'll track him down eventually. Not like I have anything better to do.
"Tifa: You know, I wouldn't be so sure about that. She could still be out there."
Barret: Can never be sure how much someone means to ya till they're gone. Don't give up on her yet.
Leslie: Was it a message? What was she trying to tell me?
"Tifa: ""We'll meet again."""
Leslie: Huh?
"Tifa: It's a symbol of ""reunion."""
Leslie: Then I guess I've got no choice but to find her first. Thanks.
Barret: Hold up. I think ya might be forgetting something.
Leslie: I haven't. Found it. Let's get outta here. And then I'll give you what you need.
On-screen: Head back up?
Barret: Ahh! Taste that sweet Midgar smog!
Leslie: This way.
"Leslie: Grappling guns. You can practically fly with the souped-up motors on these babies. Sector 7 is on the other side of that wall. The guns will get you over and past it, along with any number of other obstacles. Butthey're one-way tickets. So once you start up, there's no coming back. You should probably get your affairs in order. Just in case."
Tifa: Thank you.
"Barret: Didn't tell you before, but we're looking for someone too."
Leslie: That right? Hope you find 'em.
Cloud: You too.
Barret: Let's go.
"Barret: Ready to do this? Once we start up that wall, we won't be comin' back here any time soon."
On-screen: Climb over the wall?
"Barret: We won't be comin' back here anytime soon. Best handle any unfinished business now, okay?"
"Barret: Hope you're ready now. No coming back, remember? Last chance to change your mind."
"Barret: So...when this is over, you gonna go on being a merc?"
Cloud: That's the plan.
Barret: Reckon it suits you.
"Tifa: Yeah, it does."
Barret: Used to think you were a little shit with a big attitude and a bigger inferiority complex. Quite possibly the worst person I have ever met. But that was before I figured you out. All this? It ain't you.
"Tifa: Deep down, you're a pretty nice guy. Didn't see it when we were kids, but..."
"Cloud: Don't know about any of that, but kindness is no use on the battlefield. If anything, it's a liability."
"Barret: Hey, no one's asking you to treat Shinra with kid gloves."
Tifa: Aerith's up there waiting for us.
"Barret: Then we better get a move on, huh?"
Cloud: Ready?
Barret: Two goals! Goal one! Kick some Shinra ass and save the planet! Goal two! Save the girlwhile kicking more Shinra assand get out!
Cloud: Copy.
On-screen: Collapsed Sector 7 Plate
Barret: Gotta be careful. No tellin' what's gonna collapse or when.
Barret: See what I mean?
"Neighborhood Watch Member: Hey, you guys might wanna turn around."
Tifa: A friend of ours needs help.
Neighborhood Watch Member: It's too dangerous.
"Cloud: For you, maybe."
Neighborhood Watch Member: Do what you gotta...
Tifa: So that's where we have to climb?
Barret: If it comes apart while we're up there...(imitates falling and splatting)
"Cloud: We've made it through worse, you know."
"Barret: Yeah, no kidding. It's a miracle we haven't been killed a dozen times over by now."
Barret: It's a dead end.
Tifa: Wonder if this rope belongs to search and rescue.
Barret: Think we might be able to climb up here.
Tifa: Time for the grappling guns. Try to aim for that part of the rope that's hanging there.
"Barret: Don't screw up and fall. By the way, how well you do with this grappling gun will tell us a whole lot about you."
"Tifa: (chuckles) Just remember, we can't come back down. Are you ready?"
Barret: I think I see a rope hanging off the top there.
"Barret: Too easy. This keeps up, I'm gonna get bored."
Cloud: Kill team.
Barret: We can take 'em.
Cloud: We need to stay on mission.
Barret: I know. Saving Aerith is our top priority.
3-C SOLDIER: You... You're Avalanche!
"Radio: Hunter 2-2! Respond, dammit!"
Cloud: This is Hunter 2-2. Just had to put down a few monsters. Over.
"Radio: Roger. Friggin' Avalanche making us put in OT... Probably cowering in the dark somewhere. If you find the shitheads, make 'em suffer. 2-3 out."
Barret: Listen up! We ain't runnin' and we ain't hidin'! Y'all don't know the meaning of sufferin'! But you will!
Cloud: Call was over.
Barret: Not this guy again!
Tifa: Come on! We need to get inside!
Barret: Why don't we use our grappling guns to get up there? Jump over all this shit.
Cloud: Not much choice.
Security Officer (1): What the!?
Security Officer (2): It's them! Avalanche!
"Security Officer (1): 2-3, this is 1-4we have contact!"
Barret: I guess everybody and their mothers knows we're here now.
Security Officer (1): Goddamn traitors!
Security Officer (2): Take 'em down!
Security Officer (3): There they are!
Security Officer (4): Stop 'em!
Security Officer (5): They're over here!
Security Officer (6): Surround 'em!
Tifa: They'll be coming for us now.
"Barret: Well, to hell with being subtle!"
Tifa: What do you think? Can we climb it?
Barret: Surewith a grappling gun.
Tifa: I just hope that this time it holds.
Barret: I think I see a rope hanging off the top there.
"Barret: Dammit. If any of this crumbles, we're all going down."
Tifa: No...
Barret: Don't youeverforget this view.
Barret: Just thinkin' about bustin' into Shinra HQ's got me fired up!
Cloud: Save some for later.
"Barret: No need, son. I've got more than enough to keep me goin' for days."
Barret: Don't look down. You can do this. Don't look down. Just keep going. Don't look down. Don't look down!
Cloud: Hide!
Barret: That son of a bitch is back!? I thought we lost him!
Barret: Dammit! Looks like there's only one way to go.
Cloud: We were headed that way anyway.
Barret: You want some of this? Then come get it!
Tifa: Cloud...
Barret: I guess...we'll build another bar.
Tifa: Yeah. We will.
"Tifa: You'll help too, won't you?"
Cloud: For a price.
Cloud: Run!
"Barret: Run, dammit, run! Move your ass!"
Barret: Shit! Look out!
Barret: Was gettin' tired of playing tag anyway!
Cloud: C'mon!
Cloud: You okay!?
Tifa: Cloud!
Cloud: Grab on!
Barret: That was close!
Cloud: It's not done with us yet.
"Barret: Yeah, I hear ya. Let's blow the bitch outta the sky!"
Barret: What the hell!?
Barret: Oh you gotta be shittin' me.
Cloud: Don't get caught in the open.
Barret: (chuckles) We win again. Not that there was ever any doubt! (chuckles)
Barret: Now what?
Cloud: Shit!
Cloud: Tifa!
Tifa: Barret!
Barret: There's such a thing as too much excitement.
Tifa: Yeah. And there's still more to come.
Barret: Guess so.
Cloud: Hope everybody's warmed up.
Security Officer: That's good.
Barret: Rolled out the welcome wagon.
"Tifa: Gotta say, I can't help but wonder if this is a lost cause."
"Barret: Well, ya know, some lose causes are worth fighting for."
Cloud: Let's just think this through.
"Barret: So. I got an idea. Frontal assault, guns blazing. Make for a good story."
Cloud: Why'd we bring you along again?
Cloud: Rear entrance. We'll get inside via the parking garage.
On-screen: Shinra Building
Tifa: Security's looking pretty tight.
Barret: Ha! So they know what they're up against.
Cloud: Somehow I don't think it's all for us. Could be for Avalanche. Or maybe even Wutai.
Barret: Can't be for Wutai. What about the cease-fire?
Cloud: That only put the war on pause.
"Barret: Either way, I'm gonna put the fear of Avalanche in 'em! Their days of sittin' smug in this glass tower are over!"
"Cloud: We're here to rescue Aerith, remember? We don't need much more attention than what we're gonna get. We need to be smart."
"Barret: Yeah, I hear ya! But my soul's screaming for payback, you know? I'm a tickin' time bomb, and sooner or later, I'mma have to blow up!"
"Cloud: Well, then make it later."
"Tifa: That one therethat's a Shinra truck, isn't it?"
Cloud: C'mon.
On-screen: Shinra Building - Underground Parking Garage
Security Officer (1): How's it looking out there?
Security Officer (2): Anything?
Security Officer (1): Nah.
Security Officer (2): All clear!
"Security Officer (1): Roger. Okay, head on in!"
"Barret: So far, so good. (screams)"
Security Officer (1): Where'd you come from!?
"Security Officer (1): Hey, what's going on!?"
Security Officer (2): Halt! Show me your hands!
Barret: Ha! Bring it on!
Cloud: The idea was to not get noticed.
Barret: Stealth ain't my style.
Cloud: You never planned to be stealthy in the first place.
"Barret: Don't remember. Maybe, maybe not."
Barret: It's feelin' like a proper party now!
Cloud: (sighs) Let's keep moving. Should be a service entrance in the back.
Security Officer (1): What's the situation?
Security Officer (2): Can't get in contact with HQ.
Security Officer (1): Didtheydo this?
Security Officer (2): No idea.
Security Officer: What the!?
SOLDIER: Intruders! Get 'em!
Security Officer: Huh!? Who's that!?
Security Officer: Get them!
Security Officer: That's far enough!
Barret: That's that.
Tifa: Sure hope no one else knows we're here.
Cloud: Come on. We need to move.
On-screen: Shinra Building - Entrance
Barret: Nobody's home.
Cloud: Yeah.
Tifa: Do you have any idea where they might be holding Aerith?
Cloud: I'm thinking a research facility. That'd make the most sense.
Barret: And where is that?
Cloud: Upper floors...maybe near the top... That's where you are.
Barret: Maybe!?
Tifa: Maybe we can use the console at the reception desk to find out.
Tifa: This building's incredible.
Barret: Hah! A shining monument to corporate greed. One of these days I'm gonna tear it down and burn the rubble.
Cloud: But not today.
"Barret: Yeah, yeah."
"Tifa: I don't know about you, but I don't think we should try touching it."
Barret: Shit. Making life hard.
Cloud: Let's just keep heading up.
Cloud: Either the elevator or the emergency stairwell.
Barret: Isn't the lab we're looking for on one of the top floors? I vote we take the elevator.
"Barret: No getting upstairs without a keycard, huh?"
Tifa: Think we're gonna need a few before this is over.
Cloud: Pretty sure I saw one lying around.
Barret: The reception desk!
"Cloud: Yeah, but how to get in?"
"Tifa: Go up and over, maybe?"
Tifa: Look. Pretty sure we could reach it if we hop across those lights.
Barret: I don't know...
"Tifa: I think I'll give it a shot. As the lightest one here, I figure I've got the best chance. You two can sit back and watch."
"Tifa: Okay, guys. Wish me luck."
Barret: You be careful.
Tifa: Aren't I always?
Cloud: Tifa!
Barret: Oh shit! Tifa!
Cloud: Are you okay!?
Tifa: I thought I was dead for sure!
"Tifa: Hand over hand, huh? That's fine, bring it on."
Tifa: This isn't so bad. Pretty close now. Just need to make it over there.
Tifa: Almost there. Just need to get across those platforms.
Barret: That's some fine work.
Tifa: Ah! I might be able to disable security from here.
Tifa: Huh?
"Barret: Ha! Hot damn, girl."
Tifa: But I didn't do anything...
"Barret: Shit, I'll take it. So you can use that to look up what floor the research facility's on?"
Tifa: I think so. Gimme a sec.
"Tifa: Bingo. Professor Hojo's lab. 65th floor, looks like."
Tifa: Huh. Guess we can only get to the 59th floor via the elevators or stairs. To access any level above that. we need to check in at the Skyview Hall reception.
"Cloud: 59th floor it is, then."
Barret: Right.
Elevator: Going up. Doors closing.
Barret: So what can we expect further up?
Cloud: More security and restrictions. It's not gonna get any easier.
Barret: Huh?
Elevator: 10th floor. Doors opening.
On-screen: 10th Floor - Administration
Barret: Wasn't expectin' that.
Tifa: Think anyone knows we're here?
"Cloud: Nah, we took 'em down quick."
Elevator: Going up. Doors closing.
Tifa: Wonder if it'll stop again.
Barret: People oughta try using the damn stairs sometime!
"Cloud: If it happens again, we'll deal with it like before. We got this."
"Barret: Well that didn't take long, did it?"
Elevator: 20th floor. Doors opening.
On-screen: 20th Floor - Research and Development
Elevator: Going up. Doors closing.
Barret: Straight on up to the top now. C'mon.
"Tifa: We just keep getting waylaid, don't we?"
Cloud: If you wanna take the stairs...
Barret: Now that you mention it... No.
Elevator: 30th floor. Doors opening.
Cloud: Heads up. Could be trouble.
On-screen: 30th Floor - Urban Planning
Elevator: Going up. Doors closing.
Tifa: Right. Normal people work here too.
Barret: She probably called for help.
Elevator: 40th floor.
Barret: Who's it gonna be next?
Elevator: Doors opening.
On-screen: 40th Floor - Space and Aeronautics
"Shinra Employee: Yeah... Yeah, we're safe here. What about you, Mom? You okay? Good. That's a relief... ...What? Oh, they gotta be kidding!"
Elevator: Going up. Doors closing.
"Shinra Employee: ...No, we haven't heard anything new yet. But they told us that Avalanche could attack again at any time. Just get somewhere safe, okay? Yeah. About that..."
On-screen: 45th Floor - Advanced Weaponry
Elevator: Going up. Doors closing.
"Tifa: A whole lotta mormal people with families and friends work for Shinra. People just trying to support their loved ones as best they can. I know it's not exactly a revelation, but... It's easy to forget."
Barret: A good man who serves a great evil is not without sin. He must recognize and accept his complicity. He must open his eyes to the truththat his corporate masters are profiting from the planet's pain. Only then can he redeem himself. I know you know this.
Tifa: I do.
Cloud: Tifa. We need to focus on saving Aerith.
Tifa: I know. I will.
Elevator: 59th floor. Doors opening.
Barret: You have got to be shittin' me.
Cloud: Nope. We're a lot less likely to get caught this way.
Barret: But a lot more likely to die of boredom.
Cloud: It's only fifty-nine floors.
Tifa: Nothing to it.
"Barret: Well, at least it ain't a race. Small blessing."
Tifa: Wonder what it's like up there.
Cloud: More security and restrictions. It's not gonna get any easier.
Barret: We're gonna be exhausted by the time we finally get to the top.
"Cloud: Long as you pace yourself, you'll be fine."
Barret: Maybe we should take a quick break.
"Tifa: C'mon, Barret."
On-screen: 10th Floor - Administration
Barret: You can stop if you want. Can even say it's for me.
Cloud: Just say you can't hack it.
"Barret: I'll hack you, jackass!"
Tifa: That's enough from both of you. Stupid arguments aren't going to get us there faster.
"Cloud: But Tifa, I wasn't"
Tifa: Not now. Save it for the top!
Barret: Guess these labs...and shit...are all the way at the very top?
Cloud: Yep. The very top.
Barret: That's...good to know...
On-screen: 20th Floor - Research and Development
Tifa: Cloud! Keep an eye on Barret!
Cloud: Copy.
Tifa: What was that? I don't think I heard you. Speak up!
Cloud: I'll keep an eye on Barret!
Barret: Thanks for the assist.
Cloud: Whatever.
Barret: I said...wait up!
"Tifa: Hey, guys! Where are you!?"
Barret: Hey! Just a few floors behind you!
Tifa: Oh? You're sounding better!
"Barret: Think I've got, like, a stairclimber's high!"
Tifa: Glad to hear it!
On-screen: 30th Floor - Urban Planning
Cloud: You tired?
Tifa: I was. But I'm feeling okay now.
Barret: Hahhh... Hahhh... Hahhh... Then what're we waitin' for!? Let's roll!
Tifa: You really are doing better!
Barret: Hahhh... We...we gotta keep movin' (laughs)...to keep movin'! Hahhh...
Tifa: Hard to argue with that. Let's go.
On-screen: 4oth Floor - Space and Aeronautics
"Barret: But tell me, these stairs...are these stairs ever gonna end!?"
Tifa: I dunno! Ask the stairs!
Cloud: I don't think the stairs are talking.
"Barret: Well, duh. I mean...duh."
Cloud: I was joking.
Tifa: That's enough from both of you.
Barret: Worst route ever. Gimme a suicidal last stand. At least At leastat least that'd have an end!
Cloud: Let's shut up.
"Tifa: Yes, let's."
Barret: Why?
Tifa: Because wishing for trouble might bring it.
Cloud: Yup. And you're in no state to fight anyway.
Barret: So...whatshouldI do?
Cloud: Shut up and move.
On-screen: 50th Floor - Public Security
Barret: This sucks! I wanna go back!
Tifa: You wanna go down all those stairs you just climbed?
"Barret: Another day, another struggle... Climbing stairs is so much trouble."
"Barret: Cloud, slow down!"
Tifa: ...The end.
Barret: Made it.
Cloud: The real challenge starts now. Okay. Let's go.
On-screen: B13 - Materia Research Facility
"Researcher (1): Seventy, eighty, ninety, one hundred percent, one hundred ten... Mako supersaturation confirmed."
Researcher (2): Engaging materia cooling to reduce temperature.
Subordinate: Madam Director. You have a meeting shortly.
Scarlet: Stop. Your timing is impeccably atrocious.
Researcher (1): Mako density and materia integrity are both holding steady.
Researcher (2): Registering mass increase in core materia!
Scarlet: Now... Show me something truly exquisite!
Researcher (2): Contaminants registered!
Scarlet: We're leaving.
Researcher (2): Materia growth acceleratingoutpacing models! Registering crystallization within the reserve tanks!
Researcher (1): The reaction is out of control! We have to stop it quickly
"Scarlet: Clean up the mess, would you?"
Subordinate: Ma'am.
On-screen: 59th Floor - Skyview Hall
"Barret: So this is the Skyview Hall, huh? Bet this place cost a fortune and then some."
Cloud: Let's look for reception.
Barret: Hey! Check it out.
"Tifa: Come take a look, Cloud."
Barret: Damn fools.
Tifa: Hm?
"Barret: Ones who come here at night to ""take in the view."" So pretty and marvelous and beautiful! But every little light burning bright runs off her blood. And bit by bit they bleed her, never stoppin' to think how it'll end for them."
Tifa: Yeah.
"Barret: Terrible, but beautiful all the same."
On-screen: Go to 3F (Elevator Hall)?
Elevator: Going down. Doors closing.
"Receptionist: You must be here for our grand tour. Visitors have access to floors 60, 61, 62, as well as floor 63. You will proceed in that order. By the exit to each floor, you will find a device that will allow you to update the keycard in your possession...thereby allowing you to access the next floor. And now begins your grand tour. Please enjoy the Shinra experience!"
Barret: Why's this whole thing gotta be such a big pain in the ass?
"Tifa: I don't know about you, but this is kinda weird."
Cloud: You think everything's going too well?
"Tifa: Yeah, I do. Think this is a trap?"
"Barret: Ha! If it is, then bring it on. Let's get this party started!"
"Barret: Man, why we gotta get all these damn keycards just to get anywhere?"
Cloud: This is Shinra HQ. The hell did you expect?
"Barret: Says the former company man himself. Guess you'd know about all the rules, regulations, and red tapeit's like coming home, huh?"
On-screen: 63rd Floor - Urban Planning Administration
"Reeve: Yes. Every reactor, every pillar. Like I said...a full inspection. There's no telling what kind of damage there might be. If you see anythinganything out of the ordinary, I want to know."
"Administrative Assistant: Sorry to bother you, sir..."
"Reeve: No, it's fine."
Administrative Assistant: I've brought the damage assessment for Sector 7 you requested. Sir...perhaps you should try and get some sleep.
"Reeve: No, not yet. I need to finish preparing my draft of the reconstruction plan before tonight's board meeting. Whatever reasons they might've had, destroying an entire sector is... ...It's beyond the pale."
Administrative Assistant: Director... I would strongly advise you not to say such things outside this room.
Reeve: Don't I know it...
On-screen: 60th Floor - Memorial Museum
On-screen: President Shinra Exhibit
"Guide: Welcome to the Shinra Building, our humble home!"
"Barret: Oh, hell no."
"Guide: Here in the Memorial Museum...you can learn all about our president...as well as the various divisions that make up the company...and of course, the city of Midgar and the miracle of mako energy. Whatever takes your fancy, you're sure to learn something new!"
"Barret: Yeah, yeah. Shut up."
Tifa: I think I just threw up a little.
Barret: Man thinks very highly of himself.
"Guide: Hey, everybody! How's the grand tour? I hope you're all enjoying yourselves! Wasn't itfunto learn about Shinra and our esteemed president? And to get a peek at the president's mementosthat was super cool!"
"Guide: Now, moving along! The next exhibit will teach you about the important work we do here...by giving you a closer look at each of our divisions! I hope you're ready to be amazed, because you simply won't believe all the exciting adventures we have here!"
On-screen: Business Division Exhibit
Tifa: These all look so familiar.
Barret: 'Cause we've destroyed a bunch of 'em already.
Guide: The Advanced Weaponry exhibit is currently undergoing maintenance. We apologize for the inconvenience.
"Palmer: What, what? Read this? This paper right here? Give me a moment... ""Welcome to the Shinra Building. The Space and Aeronautics Division has taken rocket systems developed for military applications and adapted them to a different purpose: the search for new precious resources in the infinite reaches of space."" That being said...since we have plenty of mako at the present, those plans are currently on hold. It's a...bit of a shame, really."
"Hojo: (sighs) Uh, welcome to Shinra headquarters. My duties as director of Research and Development are, in all likelihood, far beyond your ability to comprehend. So, there will be no presentation, as it would be a waste of my time and yours. But rest assured, we are making great strides. Albeit not at this particular moment, because I'm filming this rubbish instead. I believe I've wasted enough of my precious time as it is. Science waits for no one, after all. Sogood day."
Guide: The Public Security exhibit is currently undergoing maintenance. We apologize for the inconvenience.
"Reeve: Welcome to the Shinra Building. Our mission here at Urban Planning is to supply the residents of Midgar with energy created from mako. We also take pride in maintaining public infrastructurethe pillars and railways that run all throughout the city. Currently, we are working to construct an intra-plate expressway. When this project has been completed, it will provide much easier access to numerous locations all across Midgar. We appreciate your patience and understanding in the meantime."
"Guide: Impressive, wasn't it? I hope you enjoyed learning about our divisions...and the wonderful ideas and solutions that are produced to benefit us all! Here at Shinra, we strive to ensure the safety of all residents around the clock!"
"Guide: Now, moving along! The next exhibit will teach you all about the miracle of mako energy and our reactors...as well as the city of Midgar itself! So come on!"
On-screen: Mako Energy Exhibit
"Guide: This is Midgarour homerecreated in 1/10000 scale. As you can see here...the eight mako reactors form a ring around the center of our city...and keep Midgar running day and night. The mako which flows beneath our feet is a truly limitless resource. At Shinra, we have developed technologies to extract it...and transform it into the fuel and electricity that powers everything we do. Thanks to the miracle of mako energy, our lives are richer and better than ever before. Mako keeps our lights on at night, and made Midgar into the city that never sleeps. A triumph of technology and testament to man's potential."
Barret: Nothin' but a buncha lies!
Cloud: Except that makohasmade people's lives better.
Barret: It's made people blind. Blind to the cold hard truth. Even I used to buy into their bullshit. Rememberin' that...makes me even madder.
"Guide: Congratulations! You can call yourself a proud Shinra scholar! Now, moving along! Next you'll learn about our progress in advanced science and technology. Please proceed to the 61st floor, the Visual Entertainment Hall."
"Guide: Welcome to the Visual Entertainment Hall, where we showcase Shinra's cutting-edge technology...through an immersive visual and audio experience. Please relax and enjoy the show!"
On-screen: 61st Floor - Visual Entertainment Hall
"Guide: Please stay, and enjoy the show!"
Barret: This place is empty.
Barret: The hell!?
"Guide: In the distant past, our planet was home to a people we call the Ancients. Many millennia before we discovered mako, these precursors were already pioneering its use. Somehow they learned of the great reservoir of energy pulsing beneath their feet. And once they had...the Ancients developed the means to harness this bountiful energy and bend it to their will. The fruits of their labors have survived to this very day in the form of certain kinds of materia. Their scripture, too, has endured: ""We who are born of the planet, with her we speak. Her flesh we shape."" ""Unto her promised land shall we one day return. By her loving grace and providence may we take our place in paradise."""
"Guide: Alas, the Ancients themselves are long gone. Two thousand years ago, a meteor brought an end to their civilization. But before their fiery end, did the Ancients find their promised land? Even now, we have only to wonder. Times have changedand the Shinra Electric Power Company is committed to changing and evolving with them. Like the Ancients, we have harnessed the power of mako."
"Guide: Are they out there, watching us? Waiting for us to join them in some blessed corner of the worlda green and verdant land, where boundless mako energy will provide for our every need? Shinra is working for you, to fulfill the hope of the Ancients and lead us to that promised land. We shall not rest until our dream is realized."
Barret: That it?
Cloud: No!
Cloud: Sephiroth...

"Palmer: Oh dear, oh dear... A man of my refined tastes running out of butter! Shorn of its proper accompaniment, this tea...might as well be boiled pond water!"
"Palmer: No, it couldn't possibly have been..."
"Barret: Crazy-ass thing made me wanna puke. And not just 'cause of the presentation, but the content too. Oughta come with a warning! That ain't for kids!"
Cloud: That wasn't just a movie.
Tifa: That huge meteor... What was that about?
Barret: Like I saidnothing you should show a kid.
"Guide: Congratulations! You can call yourself a proud Shinra expert! Your mission is to go out and tell everyone about the wonders of Shinra! Next, you'll be visiting the repository for Shinra's expertise and know-how. Please make your way to the 62nd floor, the Corporate Ar"
Barret: What the!?
"Hart: Greetings and welcome. Avalanche, I presume? My name is Hart, and it's a pleasure to meet you. I've come to escort you to Mayor Domino, per his request."
Barret: The mayor of Midgar? The empty suit that's just a mouthpiece for Shinra?
Hart: Yes. The mayor of our dear Midgar...the most magnificent city ever built. That Mayor Domino. The Visual Entertainment Hall has been experiencing technical difficulties of late...and he suspected that these difficulties might impede your progress.
Cloud: So what does the mayor want with us?
Hart: I'm afraid you will have to ask him that yourself.
Barret: Guess we're supposed to follow.
On-screen: 62nd Floor - Corporate Archives
Barret: Look at this place! So whatyou telling me the mayor's some kind of crazy bookworm?
Hart: Through here.
"Barret: If this is a trap, you're a dead man, y'hear?"
Hart: The mayor is waiting.
Barret: This can't be right.
"Domino: Ah! Wonderful! You finally made it. I am the mayor of the great metropolis of mako. Domino, at your service. (chuckles) I must say, you three haven't exactly been discreet. I wonder who's been cleaning up all your messes."
Cloud: What the hell's going on?
Domino: Come on. Think about it. You've been caught by security several times...walked in front of every other camera...and scared an accountant half to death. Do you hear the alarm? No? You're weclome.
Domino: I can only assume your cell wasn't looped in. I am Avalanche's man on the inside.
Barret: Say what?
"Domino: Is it really that surprising to you? You've seen where they've put me. The mayor of the greatest city in the whole wide world...tucked away in a secret broom closet in the damned archives! The nerve. Those stupid Shinra pricks thought I'd just shut up and accept their treatment, but they were wrong! Dead wrong!"
"Barret: Huh. Well, this oughta make things easier."
Tifa: We need to break into Professor Hojo's lab.
Domino: What? Why? You mean you're not here to give President Shinra his comeuppance?
Cloud: We're here to save a friend who was taken.
Barret: But the president's gonna get his tooif I have anything to say about it.
"Domino: Well, I don't particularly care what you end up doingso long as it hurts Shinra."
Barret: Great.
Domino: So. I can get you as far as the 64th floor.
Barret: Hold up. You telling me that that's the best you can do?
Domino: That is indeed the best that I can do.
Cloud: But you're the mayor.
"Domino: ""But you're the mayor""!? Does this look like the office of a mayor? I'm a glorified librariannothing more! They don't even invite me to their meetings! Sorting records and reportsthat's all I do! My hands and fingers have more paper cuts than skin! No one knows my painmy daily torment! They've made me a pathetic shell of a man."
"Barret: Okay! They did you wrong, like usbut we'll make it right. So just calm down. Deep breaths, man. Deep breaths."
Domino: Hm. Let me see that keycard of yours.
Domino: Here you are. You can now use it to access the Recreational Facility on the 63rd floor.
Barret: And then what are we supposed to do?
"Domino: You look for a fellow Avalanche collaborator. Identify yourselves and he'll give you a keycard to the 64th. The countersign is... ""The mayor is the best!"" ""Midgar's mayor is nothing less!"" ""Everyone says he's cooler than the rest!"""
"Domino: Just say ""mayor"" to the guy, and if he goes ""the best!"" with gusto, then you've found your man. You got it?"
"Domino: If you think you've found the collaborator, say ""mayor"" and see if he says ""the best!"" You got it now?"
"Hart: If you require additional assistance, please do not hesitate to ask."
"Cloud: So, can you tell us anything about this collaborator?"
"Hart: Certainly, I can do just that. But a man in my position must conduct his affairs with discretion. Which is to say that that which has been requested cannot be freely given...if you take my meaning."
Barret: You want money!
"Hart: Disclosing confidential information entails considerable risk. Due compensation is to be expected. In this particular instance, that would amount to ten thousand gil."
"Barret: Rip us off more, why don'tcha?"
"On-screen: Give 10,000 gil?"
Hart: The 64th floor is reserved for our executives. The individual you seek is fastidious and well-dressed. This individual likes to visit the 63rd floor to decompress from the stress of the job.
Barret: That really all you got for us?
"Hart: Oh, are you dissatisfied with your purchase? How unfortunate. Perhaps this will help preserve our relationship."
Barret: Huh?
Hart: An expression of my gratitude and appreciation.
Barret: That's better.
"Hart: If you require additional assistance, please do not hesitate to ask."
Tifa: I still can't believe the mayor is working with Avalanche.
Barret: Would've been nice to know. Idiots at HQ shoulda kept us in the loop.
On-screen: 66th Floor - Hojo's Laboratory: Main Level
"Hojo: So. About this precious promised land of yours... Come now, Aerith. You misunderstand my intenions. I wish only to satisfy their material greed so I can be left to pursue my great work.Ourgreat work, my dear."
"Hojo: Hmm. You're the spitting image of her now. I regret it to this day. If she had only trusted me instead of trying to run, it could have played out quite differently. What a terrible tragedy, to lose the last of the pure-blooded Ancients...though not completely. Would like to see your mother? Albeit, through the lens of one of my microscopes. Did you really think we'd leave such a precious specimen to rot in the gutter? We collected and catalogued every last bit of her. Hair, skin, organs, every fragment of every bone... As breathtaking in death as in life! Asyou, my dear! Ifalna was elegance, right down to her cellular structure. (chuckles) And there it is. That same elegance."
Hojo: Ohyes. Time for yet another meeting. Sit tight. I won't be long.
Aerith: (gasps)

"Tifa: It's pretty late, but I bet people are still here dealing with the aftermath of Sector 7."
Barret: It's their own damn fault.
Cloud: Stay focused. We need to find this guy.
"Barret: Yeah, yeah. Guess I better get working on my conversation skills."
Tifa: They look busy.
Cloud: A plate did just fall.
Tifa: Seeing them like this somehow makes me feel a little bit better.
Cloud: Let's find our contact.
Barret: Not seeing any security around. One less thing to worry about.
Barret: Where are you...mister collaborator...
Tifa: I think we just need to start talking to people who look the part.
"Barret: Remember, say ""mayor."""
"Tifa: If they say ""the best,"" then we have a winner."
Host: Today we welcome a special guest: Shinra's Director of Public Security...who has an important message to share with us.
"Heidegger: Everyone here at Shinra is deeply saddened and outraged by this unconscionable act of terrorism. But at the same time, we will not be cowed by threats or violence. To the people of Midgar, I make this vow: we will find the villains responsible and bring them to justice. Are you listening, Avalancheyou cowardly dogs!? Run all you like. Shinra is coming."
Barret: The hell's that?
Cloud: Combat sim. You can use it to train for battle in a virtual space.
Barret: Does training in that thing really make you better?
Server: Hello there! Sowhat'll it be for you today?
Cloud: The mayor.
"Server: Mayo? Sorry, we don't have any here."
"Server: Come on, why don't you eat something hearty? It'll give you energy."
"Shinra Employee: Hm? Are you military? Cool, cool. I guess things have been keeping you pretty busy around here. Have you found the guys who did this yet?"
Cloud: The mayor.
Shinra Employee: Huh? Uhh...what about the mayor?
Cloud: Never mind.
"Shinra Employee: No, I'm gonna be here a while longer."
Cloud: The mayor.
"Shinra Employee: Hey, shhh! I'm on the phone!"
"Shinra Employee: Please, just leave me alone."
Cloud: The mayor.
Cloud: The mayor.
Shinra Employee: You're gonna train in the sim at a time like this?
Cloud: The mayor.
Shinra Employee: Hm? Are you looking for the mayor? He's not on this floor...
"Shinra Employee: You're military, right? Can you give me any tips for doing better in the sim?"
Cloud: The mayor.
Shinra Employee: Mare? I need to be tough like a horse?
Server: Welcome. What would you like?
Collaborator: You work here? I don't recognize you. Can I help you with something?
Cloud: The mayor.
"Collaborator: ...Is the best! I was told to expect you. Need access to upper floors, right?"
Barret: That's right.
"Collaborator: Before I trust you with this keycard, I need to see what you can actually do."
Barret: Say what?
"Collaborator: Do you know what would happen if you got caught? We're putting our lives on the line here. Prove you're worth it. We have a state-of-the-art combat simulator. It can provide a real challenge, let me tell you. If you beat the sim, then the keycard is all yours."
"Collaborator: All right, I've seen enough. I'm a man of my word. Here. This keycard will grant you access to the 64th floor. You can use the elevator to get there. Once you're up there, just what is it you plan on doing?"
Cloud: We came to get one of our friends. She's being held in a research lab somewhere.
Collaborator: A lab? Then she must be with Professor Hojo. It won't be easy to get to her. Access to R&D is limited to authorized personnel only.
Cloud: We'll find a way in. Know where we can find Hojo?
"Collaborator: A board meeting is scheduled to start soon. It's being held in the main conference room. President Shinra, Professor Hojo, and the other directors will be in attendance."
Barret: Think they like surprises? We can even take the president as a hostage. Think of the leverage!
"Collaborator: Try it, and security will be on your asses in seconds."
Cloud: We need to find out what they're planning.
"Collaborator: So you want to spy on their meeting? Hmm, I have an idea. Head to the men's restroom. You can climb into the air ducts there. They go all the way to the conference room."
Cloud: Thanks for the tip.
"Chadley: Cloud. I've been waiting for you. You haven't forgotten me, have you? I'm an intern in the R&D Division here. I took the liberty of hacking into the executives' private network to monitor your progress through the building. I will support you in any way that I can. I sense a surge in trust. We should keep this brief to avoid suspicion."
"Security Officer: Cloud? You're Cloud, right? Holy shit! It's cool, bro. We went through training together. Damn! So you still alive and kicking, huh? Some of the guys heard you got smoked, but I told 'em it was all bullshit!"
"Security Officer: Hey, sit tight manI'mma go get Kunsel. I'll be right back!"
Barret: Old buddy?
Tifa: You okay?
Cloud: Yeah.
Tifa: But you were just
Cloud: I'm good. Let's keep moving.
President Shinra: I trust the narrative is intact?
Heidegger: Rock solid. The people have embraced the Wutai-Avalanche conspiracy wholeheartedly. I've almost come to believe it myself.
President Shinra: Wutai's response?
"Heidegger: So far, nothing. And if those cowardsdoreact, all the better for us and our story."
President Shinra: Very well. Then we shall stay the course.
"Heidegger: If I may, sir, there was one other matter."
President Shinra: Oh?
Heidegger: A message from our man Palmer.
Barret: Dammit!
Tifa: Barret.
"Barret: Yeah, yeah, I know. We came here to save Aerith. That's our first priority."
"Cloud: That's right. We only get one chance. Hojo should be at that board meeting, so that'll buy us some time. We need to plan this just right."
Domino: I've done everything I can for you. Now don't make me regret doing it!
On-screen: 64th Floor - Conference Rooms
Shinra Employee: Can I help you?
Tifa: What's the plan?
Cloud: Little bit of recon. Need to find a way to infiltrate that room.
Barret: You hear the words comin' out of your mouth? We just gotta find that bathroom so we can get into the air duct. Ask anyone here. They can point us in the right direction.
"Cloud: No, thanks. We can find it on our own."
"Shinra Employee: Yes, what is it?"
"Tifa: All right, I'll wait out here."
Barret: Huh? You can't hang out here.
Cloud: Tifa. It'd be better if you waited inside.
"Tifa: Maybe, but this is... Oh...never mind, you're right."
"Tifa: Oh, thank god. No one's in here."
Barret: Love to show them what the ones down below look like.
"Tifa: Come on, let's just find that duct."
Cloud: Gotcha.
"Barret: Look, I'm..."
Cloud: On guard duty.
Barret: Right.
Tifa: So...can I go with you? Don't wanna be here any longer than I have to.
"Cloud: Yeah, sure. Just follow behind."
Shinra Employee (1): I'm sure they're safe.
"Shinra Employee (2): But we live right by Sector 7 and I keep calling and calling, but I still can't get through."
Shinra Employee (1): I heard that all the phone lines are down. It doesn't mean anything.
Shinra Employee (2): ...You sure?
Shinra Employee (1): Pretty sure...
"Shinra Employee: Depending on the board's decision, we may start two projects simultaneously: rebuilding the plate and the city. Members of the Urban Planning Division will likely take point on both. Director Tuesti has ordered teams to come up with three-, five-, and ten-year plans. Each team needs to come up with a detailed proposal and schedule. We're going to have to put a lot of man-hours into this, so we'll need to start ASAP. Does anyone have any questions at all? If not, then we'll wait for the director to return."
Cloud: This it?
"Palmer: I'm telling you, I saw him! With my own eyes! Sauntering down the corridor!"
Heidegger: We don't have time for this nonsense!
Palmer: He was as close to me as you are now! The shock of it made me spill my tea!
"Heidegger: Enough already! If there are intruders in the building, my men will deal with them."
Palmer: But Mister President! Sir! I swear to you
President Shinra: Reeve.
"Reeve: Sir. I have the damage assessment for Sector 7, and I'm afraid the figures are catastrophic"
President Shinra: Spare us the doom and gloom. Was there anything else?
"Reeve: Uh... Well sir, I've also drafted a reconstruction plan"
President Shinra: That will not be needed. Not with the Ancient in our custody once more.
"Reeve: Uh...with respect, sir, I don't see how"
"Scarlet: Two words, Reeve: ""Neo Midgar."" Hm."
President Shinra: In their promised land...we will build a new mako-powered metropolis.
Reeve: Mister President! We still don't know for sure that the promised land even
President Shinra: Professor Hojo.
"Hojo: The test results were within expectations. The specimen is somewhat lacking compared to her pure-blood mother, but for our purposes she should more than suffice."
"President Shinra: So, she can lead us to the promised land?"
"Hojo: Well, Mister President, that remains to be seen. I would like your permission to secure her cooperation through more ""forceful"" means. Forceful yet gentle. She is a precious resource that must be handled with care."
"Scarlet: Personally, I've never had a problem with torture."
"Heidegger: My armory is at your disposal, should you require anything."
Hojo: I...had something more...psychological in mind. Better to scar the psyche than mar the flesh.
Palmer: (laughs)
President Shinra: Proceed as you see fit. However. You will not make the same mistake twice. Is that clear?
"Hojo: If I may, Mister President, I have an idea how we might mitigate the risks. Simply put, we could have the Ancient reproduce. In the absence of a second specimen, we would need to identify an alternative mate. I would start with candidates from SOLDIER. These would of course include S and G types. Quite frankly, there's no telling what kind of properties a crossbred specimen might possess. So What say you all?"
President Shinra: If there is nothing else.
Reeve: Mister President!
President Shinra: Meeting adjourned.
"Reeve: Please, sir!"
Hojo: Something stinks.
Barret: Anything?
Cloud: The man in the lab coat. Head of R&D. We follow him.
Barret: Okay. And then we kill the son of a bitch.
Cloud: Not until he's led us to Aerith. That's the plan.
"Hojo: Walking the halls of this very building. Who would have believed it. I wonder...were I to arrange a face-to-face...(chuckles) How I should like to meet their offspring. Ahh, but that can wait. First, we must have answers. A simple psychoactive agent should suffice. Nothing likely to cause any long-term damage. (laughs)"
On-screen: 64th Floor - Hojo's Laboratory: Entrance
Cloud: Let's go.
Barret: Right.
Barret: Don't move! I ain't bluffing.
Hojo: What is this?

On-screen: 65th Floor - Hojo's Laboratory: Sublevel
"Hojo: You must be the ones who've been stirring up trouble lately. The eco-terrorists? If so I can't imagine what business you have with me. The president's upstairs. Go on, shoo."
Barret: Shut up. Keep walking.
Barret: None of y'all better move a muscle!
"Hojo: Do stop pushing. Unlike you, I am less accustomed to physical violence."
Barret: You'll get used to it.
Hojo: What is it that you want?
Barret: Our friend. She's in your lab.
Hojo: Really?
Barret: Tell us where Aerith is!
"Hojo: Oh, so she's your friend... Well well well, in that case... Yes... That might do the trick."
Barret: Mind speaking up some?
Hojo: It's nothing. Just imagining how she might react if I were to present to her your fresh corpses. (laughs) I promise...you will regret this.
Barret: Hey! Hojo's getting away!
On-screen: 66th Floor - Hojo's Laboratory: Main Level
Cloud: Aerith!
Hojo: Very impressive. I really must thank you for providing me such invaluable combat data.
"Barret: Cocky little egghead, ain'tcha."
Hojo: The results provided by my predictive models...indicate that this force should be more than capable of handling you.
Barret: Y'all 'bout to learn predictable.
Cloud: We're taking Aerith back!
"Hojo: Oh? ""Take her back,"" you say? Correct me if I am wrong, but did the girl not come here of her own free will? Or do you mean to tell me that she is your ""personal property""?"
Barret: She only came here to save Marlene!
Hojo: I'm afraid you misunderstand. But I really can't be bothered to explain. This facility is home to extraordinary specimens that will change the world as we know it. Do try to be considerate.
Barret: Looks like your models got it wrong.
"Hojo: Yes...an unknown variable, perhaps. Well, no matter. Reinforcements will soon arrive."
Cloud: But will they get here in time to save you from me?
"Hojo: My, are you a SOLDIER?"
Cloud: Yeah.
"Hojo: No, not quite. Oh, now I recall. My memory was mistaken. My boy, you weren't a SOLDIER..."
Hojo: What!? What is thisfascinating phenomenon!? What's happening!? Where are you taking me!?
Barret: What are those things up to this time?
Aerith: Cloud!
Cloud: Barret!
Barret: Got it. Stand back.
Aerith: You came for me.
Cloud: Yep.
Tifa: You good?
Aerith: I'm great!
Barret: Thanks for saving Marlene. I owe you one.
Cloud: Save it for later!
Tifa: Aerith! You okay?
Aerith: Mm-hm. Thank you.
Cloud: Let's get outta here.
Barret: The hell was that thing?
Aerith: We need to go!
Tifa: Aerith!
Barret: What the!?
Cloud: Come on.
Barret: What? You wanna go?
Aerith: Stop. This child's a friend.
Barret: Uhh... So what the hell is it?
Red XIII: A fascinating question.
Tifa: Did it justtalk?
"Red XIII: You asked what ""it"" is. Hmm... I am that which you see before you. Nothing more. I'd appreciate it if we simply left it at that. Agreed?"
Tifa: Thirteen?
"Red XIII: ""Red XIII."" The designation given to me by Hojo."
Tifa: Then...you must have another name. What is it?
Cloud: He got away.

"Reno: Nah, I'm good..."
Rude: What are we going to do about Sector 7?
"Tseng: (sighs) ""We"" are going to do nothing."
Rude: Been thinking. Was all that necessary?
"Tseng: Had we refused, someone else would've completed the task. We have spared that someone the burden of a guilty conscience. Perhaps that will ease yours."
Reno: Yeah...nope.
Tseng: Let's try another tack then. They were a sacrifice to balance the scales.
Reno: Say what?
"Tseng: After everything we've taken from the planet, we were due to give something back."
Rude: Do you actually believe that?
Tseng: Does it matter?
Tseng: Yes. Understood.
Tseng: The VP needs us.
Chadley: That should be everything. Initiate projection sequence.
"Chadley: What do you make of the new form, Weiss? Weve replicated everything about you, from thought patterns to stress responses. You should, however, notice some improvements in my latest update. Indeed, Id venture to say youre stronger now than youve ever been."

Chadley: Given that this is merely a training exerciseno one.
Weiss: Well see. Be sure to choose my victims wisely (laughs)
Tifa: Cloud.
"Aerith: Oh, thank goodness. You're awake."
Tifa: You okay?
Cloud: Yeah. Where are we?
Aerith: Where I livedwhen I was still a child.
"Aerith: My mom and I stayed here, years ago when I was just a little girl. The room...looks exactly the same."
"Aerith: Every morning, they'd come and take my mom away. I remember crying here alone."
"Cloud: ...Aerith. Before we break outta here, talk to us. There's so much we don't know."
"Aerith: I'm...a descendent of the Ancients. That's pretty much it, really. Oh, but just so you know, that's not their actual name. They called themselves...the Cetra."
"Barret: ""We who are born of the planet, with her we speak. Her flesh we shape."" ""Unto her promised land she well one day return."" ""By her loving grace and providence may we take our place in paradise."""
Aerith: You know it!
"Barret: Yeah, well... Honestly I thought that part was just a fairy tale."
Aerith: Shinra thinks it's true. They've been searching for the promised land for a long time.
Tifa: And they must think you can lead them to it... Can you?
"Aerith: (sighs) Nope. Someday, maybe, I'll find it in me. But now? Not even if I wanted to."
"Barret: Even if you could, that land belongs to theI mean... To you and your people. Shinra's after it because they believe it's rich in makomako they've got no right to claim. But they'll try to take it anyway, won't they? Hmph. Greedy bastards'll never stop."
"Barret: Okay. New plan. Y'all take Aerith and get the hell outta here. Me, I'mma go bust some Shinra heads."
"Aerith: Barret, wait... You can't do that..."
"Barret: Oh, great. These assholes again! Probably some Shinra science experiment."
Red XIII: Whispers. Perhaps best described as arbiters of fate. They are drawn to those who attempt to alter destiny's course and ensure they do not.
"Tifa: Like capital D... ""Destiny""?"
"Red XIII: The flow of the great river that is the planet, from inception to oblivion."
Tifa: And you're saying that that flow is somehow...fixed?
Red XIII: Yes. For it is the will of the planet itself.
"Barret: So if we're destined for a bleak future, these Whispers will try to keep us on that course? Now wait just a damn minute! How in the hell can you possibly know any of that? Spouting that cryptic stuffwhich could all be bullshit! I mean, ain't you a Shinra lab ratdog?"
Red XIII: I'm not a rat dog. When Aerith reached out to me...I found this knowledge of the Whispers.
Aerith: Listen to me! Please...
Cloud: Aerith.
"Aerith: The Shinra Electric Power Company isn't the real enemy. It started with them, sure...but I promise you...there's a much bigger threat. I just want to do everything in my power to help. All of you... And the planet."
Tifa: Aerith. What are you not telling us?
"Aerith: I'm lost in a maze, and...every step is taking me further from the path... Every time the Whispers touch me...I lose something. A part of myself. ""Follow them. The yellow flowers."""
Tifa: It's okay. We'll find a way out together.
Aerith: Okay.
Barret: Weird...
Domino: Ah-ha! There you are!
"Domino: What are you doing, man!?"
Wedge: Hey guys! Long time no see!
Barret: Wedge!?
Tifa: You're here!?
Barret: Y-you shouldn't be up and moving!
"Wedge: I'm feeling much better thanks to Elmyra's cooking! Ah, but that's not what I wanted to talk to you about! Listenany moment now"
Tifa: What was that? An explosion?
Wedge: HQ's running the show this time. They're raising hell to try and flush out the president.
Domino: This complicates matters. That explosion just now put the whole building on high alert.
Tifa: So now we're trapped in here?
"Domino: No need to panic, little lady. See? You can still move freely within Hojo's laboratory."
Wedge: Find a way to the roof. An Avalanche chopper will come to extract you.
Barret: HQ's bailing us out? I doubt it. Not after all the shit we've pulled.
"Wedge: I asked them really nicely! Like, super-duper nicely!"
"Tifa: Thanks, Wedge."
"Wedge: Just get to the roof, okay?"
Barret: I didn't ask him to do any of that.
"Cloud: Yeah, well, I'm glad he did."
Barret: Huh? Heh. I'mma still chew him out for it later.
"Barret: Anyway, we gotta get to the roof, right?"
Red XIII: Then we can use the same elevator that Hojo did.
Barret: That elevator. Was it this way?
Red XIII: Yes. His odor still lingers.
Barret: What happened here?
Aerith: The little ones in the pods. Where did they go?
Red XIII: It stinks in here.
Red XIII: Back there.
Barret: Now what do we do?
Red XIII: The one thing we can.
Cloud: Someone's picking a fight.
Barret: So go give 'em one already!
Cloud: Way ahead of you!
Barret: Nice job!
Barret: What?
Barret: Shitwhat the hell Red!?
"Chadley: Now that my research is at long last complete... I believe that it's time I told you the truth about myself. I'm...not human. I'm a cyborg created to serve as Hojo's assistant. I was given knowledge and power beyond that of a human... ...But I was robbed of free will, bound to obey the whims of my master. But when we met, Cloud, I sensed something within yousomething I knew would allow me to break free of my chains. By identifying and studying a subject with infinite potential such as yourself... I could adhere to the directives imposed upon me...all the while pursuing my plans for independence in secret. Your combat data provided me the vital information that I required to enhance my basic functionality... This is the result. Through my research and with your assistance, I have freed myself from Hojo's bondage."
Cloud: Cool.
Chadley: I cannot thank you enough for your help. You've given me the power to finally live my life on my own terms.
Cloud: So...what are you gonna do now?
"Chadley: I'm not sure. It's all a big, wonderful mystery. It's nice not knowing something for a change..."
Cloud: Let's go.
Tifa: Right.
On-screen: 68th Floor - Hojo's Laboratory: Restricted Level
Barret: Hell is this place?
Red XIII: Hojo's treasure. Shinra's dark secret.
Barret: What I wouldn't give to burn it all down...but we need to get to the roof.
Barret: What is that...?
Aerith: Jenova.
Sephiroth (flashback): Mother... Together we will reclaim our world.
Tifa (flashback): I'msickof this! I'm sick of all of this!
Tifa: Cloud?
Cloud: Tell me. Is it really you?
Sephiroth: Don't deny me. Embrace me.
Cloud: (screams)
Aerith: Cloud!
Sephiroth: A touching reunion.
"Hojo: Very, very good! And thus is the hypothesis proven correct! I can only hope you will continuenotto disappoint. (laughs)"
Cloud: I'd better hurry.
On-screen: Classified Research - The Drum
Cloud: Test subject pods? Guess I can use these.
Red XIII: Need a hand?
Cloud: Thanks.
Red XIII: You okay?
Cloud: Yeah. Where're the others?
Red XIII: Nowhere close.
Cloud: Let's go.
Red XIII: What is it?
"Cloud: If we flip that switch, we can get to the other side."
Red XIII: Hm. I may be able to do that.
Cloud: You sure?
Red XIII: Yes.
Red XIII: Will this do the trick?
On-screen: The Drum - 1st Ward
Barret: What kind of freak show have they got going on in here?
Barret: Stay back!
Cloud: Need hand?
"Barret: Yeah, right! Just having a little bit of fun with them, that's all."
Cloud: For how long?
Barret: Long as it took you to get here?
"Barret: Shit, it's like they're churning out monsters here."
Red XIII: That's not far from the truth.
Barret: Hey... You okay?
Cloud: Yeah. I'm fine...
Barret: If you say so.
Cloud: Guess we're out.
Red XIII: What's the plan?
"Barret: First, we find Tifa and Aerith. Then we head for the roof. Should be an elevator somewhere. Didn't expect any of this, but we just gotta roll with it. Come on, let's go."
Barret: All right. Now you're starting to impress me.
Aerith: We got 'em!
"Barret: Yeah! Keep it up, y'all!"
Aerith: Don't move an inch! We'll head down too. Be right there!
Barret: Huh? I can't hear what you're saying!
Red XIII: I think there's something over there.
Red XIII: Now it's my turn.
Red XIII: There's no control panel. We don't have the means to go this way.
Tifa: Hello? Cloud? Can you hear me?
Cloud: Yeah. You okay in there?
"Tifa: No need to worry. We're fine, but what do we do now? I don't see any way out of this room."
Hojo: Ahem. Can you all hear me?
Red XIII: Hojo.
"Hojo: (laughs) So tell me. How are you finding the Drum? You know it's filled with the most advanced technology in Midgar, if not the entire world. You should feel honored to see it firsthand! You'll also have the opportunity to take part in a rather ambitious experiment of mine."
Barret: What!?
"Hojo: When all the pieces are in place, I will open the door to the 3rd ward. Perhaps you can help me with the necessary preparations? Given that you're already in the perfect position to do so. I look forward to data both invaluable and instrumental."
"Barret: ""Necessary preparations""? What the hell is this asshole talking about?"
Tifa: Can't we just ignore him and keep going?
"Red XIII: I'm afraid not. If I know Hojo, he won't let us out until we indulge his request for data."
"Tifa: He said something about a ward, right? I'm pretty sure I saw a door to one upstairs somewhere."
Aerith: So...you wanna check it out?
On-screen: Switch parties?
Cloud: You two'll be on your own. Be careful.
Tifa: Thanks. We will.
Barret: We'll be waiting right here. If anything happensanything at allyou call us. All right?
Aerith: Roger that!
"Tifa: Hey, you think Cloud's doing okay? He's been acting really weird latelymore than usual."
"Aerith: True, but it's CloudI'm sure he'll be fine. But what about you, Tifa? How are you holding up?"
Tifa: Huh? Oh (chuckles) I'm fine!
"Tifa: I guess this has to be the 3rd ward, right?"
Aerith: Think so. But it looks like the door's locked.
Tifa: There has to be something we can do. Let's look around.
Aerith: Gotcha.
Aerith: Look! Now they can get across too.
Tifa: We should let Cloud know.
"Tifa: Cloud, can you hear me? We found the door to that ward he was talking about, but it's locked and we can't get it open."
Cloud: All right.
Aerith: About those preparations Hojo mentioned before... I think we're supposed to do something with that.
Red XIII: The central terminal. Interesting.
Aerith: We were fiddling with some sort of control panel. Do you see a way to get across now?
Cloud: All right. We'll make our way to the central terminal. Sit tight until you hear from us.
"Barret: The hell kind of ""research"" is this?"
Red XIII: The cataclysm that came from the starsJenova. Hojo has devoted half of his life to her study.
Barret: I don't give a shit about any of that.
"Red XIII: The experiments in this facility...involve the enhancement of life-forms and machines through the application...of Jenova biological data. Hojo's plan is to pit his subjects against ust, thereby facilitating their growth."
Barret: Hmph! So this asshole thinks he can treat us like his experiments.
Red XIII: I know what fate awaits these creations. Let us put them out of their misery.
Red XIII: We must first find a passage that leads to the center.
Red XIII: Off I go.
Red XIII: There's no control panel. We don't have the means to go this way.
Barret: Wait sec. Weren't the girls right by the door to the 3rd ward?
Red XIII: There are four switches. One for each ward.
Barret: What the?
Announcement: Transfusion procedure complete. Commencing test of augmented research specimen.
Red XIII: You need to warn the others. Tell them to be careful. Very careful.
"Cloud: Tifa, you there? We accessed the central terminal. The door should be unlocked now."
Cloud: Any one of Hojo's twisted creations could be in that ward. Be careful.
Tifa: We will. See you in a bit.
On-screen: The Drum - 3rd Ward
"Tifa: Uh, what is this place for?"
Aerith: There's a...sadness...
Aerith: Look.
Tifa: Let's get across with those.
Aerith: That hurt. Did we wake 'em up?
"Tifa: Yeah, looks like it."
Tifa: Is this really the exit?
Aerith: I hate that man. I really do.
Tifa: You think now the others can get across too?
"Tifa: Hey, Cloud?"
Cloud: Tifa?
"Tifa: We used the control panel here a little while ago, so you should be able to get to the other side. Can you check?"
Barret: Roger that. Was gettin' pretty bored anyway.
"Cloud: You two, stay there. We'll call if anything comes up."
Aerith: Okay. Be careful.
Red XIII: We need to open the door first.
On-screen: The Drum - 2nd Ward
Red XIII: (sniffs) It stinks.
Cloud: More of Hojo's experiments.
Announcement: Commencing test. All personnel must evacuate area. Commencing test.
Hojo: I hope you're enjoying your experience.
Barret: Why don'tcha come down here and ask me?
"Hojo: Before you get any ideas, you should know this glass is bulletproof. No discernable changes after contact. Most fascinating. Hmm..."
Barret: Hey! We ain't done yet!
Red XIII: It seems we have no choice.
Barret: How'd ya like watchin' your precious toys get torn to shreds!?
"Hojo: I never grow tired of watching my toys be broken, no matter how many times I've seen it happen. Such is the case when you truly enjoy your work. Now, for the next step..."
Barret: Look! Now's our chance to kill the bastard! Time for you to pay the piper!
Hojo: Hmph. They never learn.
Announcement: Commencing test. All personnel must evacuate area. Commencing test.
Hojo: (laughs) Be a good boy and keep the other pets company. (laughs)
Barret: Shit. Looks like Red might need our help up there!
Barret: C'mon! We're going!
Barret: Get outta here!
Barret: What was that thing?
Cloud: Where's Hojo?
Red XIII: Sorry. He got away.
Cloud: Forget about him for now.
"Barret: Remind me. This ain't a hospital, is it?"
Red XIII: Test subjects don't receive treatment.
Cloud: They're enhanced...or dissected.
Barret: This guy's a real piece of work...
Barret: Now what!?
"Barret: Hey, let us out!"
Barret: I remember you!
"Red XIII: And he remembers us, I think."
Barret: Fine! One step at a time it is.
Red XIII: I don't see any elevators around here.
Cloud: I'll let Tifa and Aerith know.
"Barret: Huh, whaddya know. That's the door to the 4th ward."
"Red XIII: If we want to get in, we'll need to go all the way back to the central terminal."
Barret: But the door we used to get here is shut. So what now?
Cloud: The passages have to be connected somehow.
Cloud: Please.
"Barret: It's a PHS terminal. Call up Tifa, see if they can get to the central terminal."
Barret: Hey! You okay down there?
Red XIII: Dammit!
Cloud: Red!
Barret: Shit! He can't hold them off forever!
Barret: You should call Tifa.
Cloud: Right. On it.
"Cloud: Tifa, you there?"
Tifa: Is something wrong?
Cloud: Red fell to your level. Can you try to get to him?
"Aerith: Oh, no!"
Tifa: Come on!
Aerith: Sorry for the wait!
"Tifa: Now, let's get this over with!"
Tifa: Let's finish this!
Tifa: You okay?
Red XIII: I am now.
Barret: Nice one!
Tifa: Have Cloud and Barret found anything?
"Red XIII: Actually, they just found the entrance to the 4th ward. But to unlock it, they have to access the central terminalwhich they cannot do from their position."
Aerith: Maybe we can get to it instead.
"Tifa: Yeah, let's try."
Red XIII: Now it's my turn.
Aerith: Look! An elevator!
Aerith: ...And it's not moving.
"Red XIII: The professor still has plans for us, I presume."
"Aerith: For the record, I don't like this one bit."
Red XIII: All that remains is the 4th ward. We must trust in Cloud and Barret to see it through.
Tifa: This was a good idea...right?
Aerith: Yep! Let's go give the others the news.
Cloud: That you?
Tifa: Yeah. We found an elevator on our side.
Cloud: Good. Glad to hear it.
Tifa: But...we can't use it for some reason.
Aerith: Hojo did something. I know it.
"Red XIII: There's only one thing we can do. We need to head to the 4th ward, just like he wants."
Tifa: We unlocked it on our side. You should be able to get in.
Cloud: Thanks. Wait for us there.
Barret: Right. Now we head back to that door.
On-screen: The Drum - 4th Ward
"Barret: We, uh, made Wedge wait a while to be rescued."
Cloud: Guess so.
"Barret: You know, he really likes you."
Cloud: Maybe.
"Barret: Friendly guy, but he has a hard time opening up to people."
Cloud: Well...that makes two of us.
"Barret: He's got your back, though. Heh...makes two of us."
\Barret: Huh. You hear that?
Cloud: Run!
Barret: Flyin' fishbot here's trying to turn us into mincemeat!
Barret: It's outta control!
Cloud: Dammit!
Tifa: What the!?
Aerith: I think it's coming this way!
Aerith: That's enough.
Hojo: Again you triumph! (laughs) I'd be disappointed if you didn't! Yes... I believe I have just about all the data that I require. Then we are ready to proceed to the next stage.
Aerith: Yes! We got it to work.
Tifa: Could this be a trap?
Aerith: Don't worry. The elevators are safe.
Tifa: All right. If you say so.
Tifa: Huh? Are we there already?
"Aerith: No, something tells me that we aren't. Call it a hunch."
Red XIII: I hear something.
"Barret: We don't have all day, you know."
Tifa: I think it might be locked from this side.
Aerith: Should we open it up then?
Barret: Uh... Cloud...
"Aerith: Heya, guys!"
Barret: Oh...hey. Band's back together. Past time we got outta here and made our way to the roof.
Red XIII: There's an elevator just over there. But it will move only at Hojo's discretion.
"Tifa: Well, okay then. Looks like the elevator's working."
Red XIII: It appears Hojo's done having his fun.
Barret: (laughs) Glad to hear he enjoyed the show.
Tifa: We're back...again.
Cloud: Yeah.
Barret: Hey.
Barret: What the hell's going on?
Tifa: Who would...?
Red XIII: We may find out soon.
Cloud: Let's go.
Barret: So what's above this floor?
Red XIII: The president's office. And then the roof.
"Aerith: Wait. Once we get in that elevator, there's no turning back."
Tifa: We're ready...right?
Cloud: Huh?
Red XIII: The elevator back there can take us down to the central terminal again. Now's the time for any unfinished business.
On-screen: Head for the roof?
Cloud: I'm ready to do this. Let's go.
On-screen;: 69th Floor - Executive Suite
On-screen: 70th Floor - President's Office
Barret: Where the hell is that bastard hiding?
Tifa: And Sephiroth?
Red XIII: Wait. I can hear something.
President Shinra: Help me...
"Barret: Well, well, well..."
President Shinra: Pull me up! I'll give you all the money you want! I have gil! Plenty of it!
"Barret: Thing is, I don't want your money."
President Shinra: Please!
President Shinra: Just let me live. Everything you want can be yours.
Barret: I'm a man of modest dreams. Dropping you from seventy stories up would get me damn near to good.
"President Shinra: But not all the way. You want somethingmore, don't you!?"
Barret: More than this right here? Talk to me again like you know me.
Tifa: Barret!
Aerith: Stop it!
"Barret: You're gonna get on TV and tell 'em. Tell 'em what you did to Sector 7that it was you who killed all those people! Then, you're gonna tell them the truth about Avalanche. That Avalanche ain't Wutai or anybody's puppet! That Avaalnche fights for the peoplethe planet! That we fight to hold Shinra to account for its crimes! That is Avalanche! The filthy sewer rats...who brought down a goliath! You tell 'em that."
President Shinra: Is that really all you want? For your names to be cleared? Hmph. That is what matters most to you? More than shutting down the reactors? Than the future of the planet itself?
Barret: Huh? Damn.
"President Shinra: You're lying to yourself, even now. Truth...justice, honor, freedom! Vain indulgences, every one. Picture it! Picture a world without Shinra. Without mako energy. A stagnant, impotent world. Now picture a natural disaster. Who would help the people? Help the recover and rebuild? You? With their old would ruined, will they thank you for the new? I'm going to give you a chance. One last opportunity to consider what your principles are truly worth. But bear in mind that time is of the essence."
Barret: And what about you Mister President. What are your vaunted principles?
"President Shinra: What principles!? Did you understand even a single word of what I told you? I know what I want, and I take it. I take advantage of whatever I can, and discard that which I cannot. There is no room for sentiment or guilt."
Barret: You son of a bitch!
Tifa: Barret!
Red XIII: This is...
Aerith: The source. Of everything.
Tifa: What's happening!?
Red XIII: It's an illusion. Stay calm.
Red XIII: You okay?
"Avalanche Helicopter: HQ, this is Avalanche 3-1. Making another pass to search for friendlies."
Tifa: Barret! Are you hurt!?
Barret: Don't think so.
Red XIII: This death was not the one ordained for you by fate.
Barret: Thanks.
Cloud: Sephiroth!
Cloud: Everyone okay?
Barret: Hey. Get your man?
Cloud: He got away.
Barret: Huh. 'Bout time we made our escape too.
Cloud: Shit.
"Reno: Sure you wanna do this personally, boss?"
Barret: If it ain't Rufus Shinra. Heir to the throne himself.
Cloud: Yep.
Cloud: Stop.
Barret: Huh!? The hell I will! We can finish off the family here and now!
Cloud: Take Aerith and get outta here.
Cloud: I'll buy you guys some time.
Barret: I could stay hereback you up.
Cloud: Barret...I'm asking you. Please.
Barret: Fine. Have it your way then. But you better be right behind us.
"Rufus: You're a SOLDIER, aren't you? Which, of course, would mean that I own you."
Cloud: Ex-SOLDIER. I quit.
Rufus: Secure the others. Just the two of us. Well. Maybe three.
Cloud: Let's get this over with.
Rufus: Don't say that.
Rufus: Hmph. Not bad.
Rufus: Okay.
Air Traffic Controller: This is control. Hostile air units sighted. Redirect to engage.
Rude: Understood.
Cloud: Think you got my number?
Rufus: Not at all. You're making me sweat. Good thing I came prepared.
Cloud: That's a new trick.
Rufus: Like it? 'Course you do.
Cloud: Now it's just the two of us.
Rufus: Let's make it a night to remember.
Cloud: It's on for real now?
Rufus: Yeah. You should be honored.
Cloud: I could end thishere and now.
"Rufus: No, not quite. Tonight marks a new beginning for Shinra!"
Tifa: You gotta be better than this...if you're gonna play the hero.
Red XIII: Think they can manage on their own?
Barret: You've seen the both in action. You know they can. Besides
Barret: What was that!?
Barret: Gotta believe they made it out.
Aerith: I hope so.
Barret: Dammit!
Red XIII: Hey.
Barret: Screw itwe gotta go back!
Red XIII: Hey!
"Barret: What, Red!?"
Barret: Get down!
On-screen: 64th Floor - Conference Rooms
Wedge: We're cool. Everything's cool.
Wedge: Barret!
Wedge: Not again!
"Wedge: You can't stop me! For Bigggs... For Jessie... Tifa...and Barret too! I'm sorry, Cloud... (screams)"
Wedge: Just...tell me thatthat I made a difference...

Red XIII: Get ready.

Arsenal: Barrier drones damaged. Overriding main cannon safety protocols.
Arsenal: Threat level: critical.
Red XIII: Now! Its right arm!
Arsenal: Defensive systems compromised. Threat level: elevated.
Arsenal: Threat level: critical.
Barret: We piss it off?
Arsenal: Threat level: maximum.
Aerith: This doesn't look good!
Barret: Any ideas!?
Red XIII: Take cover behind debris!
Aerith: They all just...flew off.
"Barret: If more come, we're done."
Red XIII: Then let's finish this quick.
Barret: Not this again!
Aerith: We can't hide! What do we do!?
Red XIII: Stop its attack!
"Barret: Damn, does it feel good to be alive!"
Red XIII: Quite. But we could still die later tonight. Cloud and Tifa could be dead already.
Barret: The hell they are!
Red XIII: Then we need to find a way we can all escapeand quickly.
Aerith: You're right. Let's go.
Barret: All we gotta do now is find the others.
"Security Officer: We have them surrounded, sir."
Heidegger: Yes...I can see that. It was only a matter of time. And here we are. (laughs) So thenwhat is this ragtag group of misfits I see before me?
Barret: Avalanche!
Aerith: Local florist!
Red XIII: Lab rat dog!
Heidegger: And where are the rest of you?
Barret: Up your ass.
"Heidegger: Hm. Charming. Though not what I would've chosen as my last words. Secure the Ancient, but feel free to kill both the idiot and the dog."
Barret: Aerith. You saved my Marlene. Now...it's time I returned the favor.
Aerith: Wait!
Aerith: Cloud!
Heidegger: Goddammit!
"Tifa: Everyone, get in!"
"Heidegger: Stop, them you fools! Don't let them escape!"
Cloud: Let's roll.
Tifa: Okay!
Barret: Why's he always gotta Whoa! Shit.
"Barret: Home free, Red!"
Red XIII: I wouldn't celebrate just yet.
"Barret: Man, you need to lighten up. Hell, you might even try smiling."
"Barret: On second thought...maybe frowning suits you better. Hey, don't pout!"
Red XIII: Look.
Barret: Whoa! Are you guys seeing this!?
On-screen: Midgar Expressway
Aerith: Whispers.
On-screen: Shinra Building - Executive Suite
Rufus: What is all this?
"Tseng: Is something wrong, sir?"
Tseng: I see. Very good.
"Tseng: The men are on standby, sir. Your orders?"
Rufus: Bring them in.
Barret: It's like the whole damn building's made of 'em.
Cloud: Yeah.
Tifa: I don't understand. What are they doing?
Aerith: Who knows...
Barret: Wedgeyou don't think he got caught up in it do you?
"Tifa: If he did, I hope he's okay..."
Red XIII: They're coming.
Barret: Who?
"Barret: This, we don't need."
Cloud: Time to go!
"Barret: They're gainin' on us! C'mon, step on it!"
"Tifa: I'm trying, but it won't go any faster!"
Barret: How the hell'd we get saddled with this junker!?
Security Officer: Give it up! There's nowhere to run!
Barret: No...dammit...
Security Officer: Pull over right now! Wewilluse lethal force to make you comply!
Barret: Stubborn bastards!
Aerith: Look!
Tifa: Come on!
Barret: (laughs) And let that be a lesson to you!
Shinra Helicopter: Firing warning shots.
Cloud: Heads up!
Barret: That chopper is all mine! I'll bring it down real quick!
"Red XIII: Cloud, here!"
"Barret: (laughs) Try catching us now, ya bastards!"
"Red XIII: I hate to spoil the celebration, but...there's more."
Aerith: What the!?
Barret: Cloud! Keep your guard up!
Barret: That's it! Now seize the opening and attack!
Red XIII: Its guard is down. Now!
Barret: Ha haha! How do you like that!?
"Red XIII: Cloud, you all right?"
Cloud: Get down!
Barret: Them again!?
Barret: Guess we owe you another!
"Barret: Shit! We got incoming! I'll take the chopper! The bikes are all yours, Cloud!"
Mobile Officer: We've got 'em! Engaging targets!
"Barret: Ha! Think you can take us? Well think again, asshole!"
Barret: That's itI'm takin' you down!
Barret: We done here!?
Cloud: You good?
Aerith: Somehow!
"Red XIII: Cloud, you okay?"
Barret: So now...they're on our side?
"Red XIII: The Whispers intervene not to defend us, but to preserve the flow of destiny."
"Barret: Oh no, don't youdare!"
Barret: C'mon! You see the piece of shit we're driving here!?
Red XIII: Says the three hundred pound sack of it.
Barret: Hey!
Tifa: Focus!
Aerith: I don't want any trouble!
Barret: Time to meet your maker!
"Barret: Okay, y'all! Let's finish him off! C'mon!"
Red XIII: Cloud!
Cloud: Copy! Go for the head.
Red XIII: With pleasure.
Barret: Nice!
On-screen: End of the Road
"Barret: Okay, asshole, let's"
Aerith: Don't.
Aerith: And you... You'rewrong.
Sephiroth: Those who look with clouded eyes see nothing but shadows.
Aerith: Everything about you iswrong.
"Sephiroth: All born are bound to her. Should this world be unmade, so too shall her children."
Cloud: The world won't end today. But you... You will.
Sephiroth: Listen.
Sephiroth: Destiny come.
Zack: We drag our asses all this way...and this is the welcome we get.
"Zack: Boy, oh boy... The price of freedom is steep."
"Zack: Embrace your dreams. And, whatever happens... Protect your honor...as a SOLDIER! Come and get it!"
"Sephiroth: I'm waiting, Cloud."
Aerith: This is the point of no return.
Aerith: Destiny's crossroads.
Cloud: Then why did you stop me?
Aerith: I'm not really sure.
Tifa: What will we find on the other side?
"Aerith: Freedom. Boundless, terrifying freedom. Like a great, never-ending sky. What you heard just now were the voices of the planet. Those born into this world. Who lived and who died. Who returned. They're howling in pain."
Cloud: Because of him? Sephiroth?
"Aerith: They... Their words...they don't reach him. All these moments and memories, precious and fleeting...they're like rain rolling off his back... And when they're gone, he won't cry...or shout...or anything. He'd tell you that he only cares about the planet. That he'd do everything in his power to protect and preserve it. But this isn't the way it's supposed to be. There's no greater threat to the planet than him. Sephiroth has to be stopped. He has to be. And that's why... I'm asking you to help me. I know that together, we can do this. But if we do... We'll be changing more than fate itself. If we succeed...if we win...we'll be changing ourselves... I guess...maybe, that's why I hesitated."
"Cloud: You said it yourself. He has to be stopped. And frankly, I've heard enough howling for a lifetime."
Aerith: Ready?
On-screen: Ready?
Tifa: Never tried to challenge destiny.
Red XIII: This could well be her last line of defense. It won't be easy.
Cloud: Let's go.
Barret: Wouldn't be the first time I spit in destiny's eye. Whether you can see the seams or you can't...doesn't change that she's always trying to have it her way.
"Barret: Daddy's coming home real soon, honey!"
On-screen: Singularity
"Barret: Don't know about you, but looks normal to me."
Aerith: Over there.
"Barret: Okay, that ain't right!"
Barret: You're alive!
Cloud: Happy to see me?
Barret: Wouldn't go that far.
"Cloud: So that thing...that's a Whisper too, huh?"
"Barret: Looks a lot more like an ""arbiter of fate"" than the others."
Tifa: We can beat them.
Barret: Ha! Bring it on!
"Barret: Come on, that ain't fair!"
Cloud: Run!
Barret: We gotta go!
Cloud: Just go!
"Barret: Shit! Look out! Run dammit, run! Move your ass!"
Tifa: Dammit!
Barret: We gotta get outta here now!
Barret: Did we do it!?
Aerith: Hang on!
Tifa: Aerith!
Barret: What the hell did I just see?
Red XIII: A glimpse of tomorrow if we fail here today.
Barret: Dammit! How do we stop these things!?
"Red XIII: Well, the big one is way over there. However..."
Cloud: These guys are right here.
Tifa: This can't be our future...
Aerith: The future is always a blank page.
Barret: Them again? Least they could do is give us a little breather!
Cloud: I say we split up. Take 'em down at the same time.
"Barret: In that case, ultra big boy's all mine!"
"Cloud: Bring it on, bitch!"
Cloud: Let's do this.
Tifa: Right!
Aerith: We can do thistogether!
"Aerith: Barret, we're counting on you!"
Barret: Ain't no stoppin' us now!
Barret: Gotcha!
"Aerith: Red, you're up!"
Barret: I'm gonna show you what Avalanche is made of!
"Tifa: Barret, go for it!"
Red XIII: I decide my destiny.
Aerith: We did it!
Tifa: Right.
Cloud: Where are we?
"Sephiroth: I'm waiting, Cloud."
Barret: What the hell is this!?
Red XIII: This is
Cloud: Sephiroth...
Cloud: Let's finish this.
"Sephiroth: Fate is not to be taken lightly, Cloud."
Cloud: Shut up!
Tifa: Need some help?
Cloud: Don't know about need... Good to go?
Tifa: You know it!
Aerith: Did you miss me?
Cloud: Not really. He's tough.
"Aerith: Yeah, so what? Screw him."
Aerith: Tifa!
Tifa: What'd I miss?
Tifa: Aerith!
Aerith: Sorry I'm late!
Tifa: Barret!
Barret: Ain't you two havin' fun!
Aerith: Barret!
Barret: Better late than never!
Cloud: Let's go.
Tifa: Barret!
Aerith: Welcome back.
Barret: We get him!?
Aerith: Tifa!
Barret: 'Bout time you showed!
Barret: We get him!?
Tifa: Aerith!
Barret: 'Bout time you showed!
Aerith: We can do this. We can. We can change itmake it right!
Aerith & Tifa: Cloud!
Barret: Go!
Sephiroth: Careful now. That which lies ahead...does not yet exist.
Sephiroth: Our world will become a part of it...one day. But I...will not end. Nor will I have you end.
Cloud: This is...?
"Sephiroth: The edge of creation. Cloud, lend me your strength. Let us defy destiny...together."
Cloud: Never.
Sephiroth: Not yet. Seven seconds till the end. Time enough for you. Perhaps. But what will you do with it? Let's see.
Heidegger: Mister Vice President.
Tseng:Mister President.
Rufus: That's right.
Hojo: (laughs)
Zack: Wait... Was that all of 'em?
"Zack: Hey, Cloud. You see that?"
Undercity Resident (1): There.
Undercity Resident (2): Thank you.
Elmyra: Marlene!
Marlene: Coming!
Marlene: Daddy...?
Barret: Marlene!
Barret: I'll come back.
Tifa: So...what now?
"Cloud: Sephiroth. Long as he's still out there, I..."
Barret: I thought you beat him.
Aerith: We can. We will.
Tifa: Count me in.
"Red XIII: If it's to be a hunt, you could use a nose like mine."
"Barret: I'm in too! Bastard wants to destroy the whole planet, doesn't he? An enemy of hers is an enemy of Avalanche!"
"Zack: Almost there, Cloud. We're almost there..."
Aerith: I miss it. The steel sky.
On-screen: The Unknown Journey Will Continue
"Yuffie: (hums ""Yuffie's Theme"")"
"Yuffie: Well, guys... Your girl finally made it to Midgar."
Yuffie: Whoa...
Yuffie: Awha! (screams)
Yuffie: (sniffs) Blech!
"Yuffie: You got this, Yuffie! Mm-hm."
"Yuffie: My name is Yuffie, materia hunter and elite special forces operative for the new Wutai government. I have orders to infiltrate Shinra headquarters and steal their ultimate materia. To prove to our common enemy that Wutai is not to be trifled with. Members of Avalanche...with your full support... We got this!"
"Yuffie: So, members of Avalanche... Where are you!? Come get me already!"
Yuffie: Okay. If I was a man in a moogle hat...
"Yuffie: Wait, does this mean what I think it does? Interesting... So, I gotta come to you, do I? You got some nerve! (chuckles)"
On-screen: Sector 7 Slums - Outskirts
Yuffie: Hmph! Guess you're never far from a rat in Midgar! Let's see what you've got!
"Yuffie: Well, that was easy! And my search for the elusive moogle continues."
Yuffie: Huh?
Yuffie: (sighs) No pom...
Yuffie: You okay? Anybody home?
"Yuffie: Well, guess I'm not going anywhere until I get that elevator moving."
"Yuffie: (chuckles) Ah, I never cease to amaze myself."
"Yuffie: Yeesh, this town's a total dump. I thought Midgar was supposed to be ""the marvel of the modern world."" Talk about false advertising. ""City of Mako""? ""City of Garbage,"" more like."
Yuffie: Huh? I gotta do something!
Yuffie: Ah... You'll do the trick. Come on down!
Yuffie: Sweet! Now to save the day!
"Yuffie: Have no fear, Yuffie's here!"
Robed Man: Uh... Urah...
"Yuffie: Uh, so...not even a ""thank you""?"
Robed Man: Je...no...va...
Robed Man: Je...no...va...
Yuffie: This is too weird...
"Yuffie: Hn, hn, hah! Okay...! You got this!"
On-screen: Scrap Boulevard
"Yuffie: Huh, okay... That rotten egg smell's gone. Must've gotten used to it. Hah. Way things are goin', I'll be workin' for Shinra next. Nice try, Midgar."
Yuffie: I'm talkin' to myself. City's getting to me!
"Scarlet: Mako Reactor 5 has been temporarily shut down, and all fires have been successfully extinguished. The situation is under control, and the people of our fair city need not worry about any additional complications. We are in the process of conducting a full forensic investigation. But we suspect the device used was similar to that employed in the attack on Mako Reactor 1."
On-screen: Sector 7 Slums
"Yuffie: Oh, oh, oh! Whadda we have here!? (chuckles) Man, that's gotta be Avalanche! Not bad. Not bad at all... But I can do better!"
Zhijie: Yuffie?
Zhijie: Yo.
Yuffie: Wha...? There's our pom!
"Yuffie: So, you're Avalanche?"
Zhijie: I'mZhijie. Follow me.
Yuffie: Wha? W-wait up!
"Yuffie: So, Zhijie, why didn't you come meet me before?"
Zhijie: I figured an elite W agent could find their own way.
"Yuffie: I may be elite, but it's not like I've ever been to Midgar. ...And what exactly is a ""W"" anyway?"
Zhijie: Anyone who lives where you just came from. Think of it as a codename.
Yuffie: Uh-huh...
Zhijie: Still can't believe they sent a kid to do this job...
"Yuffie: This ""kid"" could kick your ass!"
Zhijie: Sayin' you're a fresh face is all.
"Yuffie: Oh, don't worry. I know exactly what you're saying!"
"Zhijie: Gimme a break, will ya?"
Yuffie: And let you walk all over me?
"Zhijie: Well, here we are. Ladies first."
Jessie: I don't get it. The mission was a success. So why aren't they back yet?
"Biggs: Well, judging from the news, they didn't get caught. They'll turn up."
"Wedge: Amd when they do, we're gonna treat 'em to a feast! I can almost taste your pizza now, Jessie!"
"Jessie: Shame, since you won't be getting any."
Wedge: What!?
Biggs: Heh heh...
On-screen: Avalanche's Base
Zhijie: These two are Billy Bob and Polk. And that's Nayo.
"Yuffie: Hi. My name is Yuffie, materia hunter and elite special forces operative for the new Wutai government. I have orders to infiltrate Shinra HQ and steal their ultimate materia. To prove to our common enemy that Wutai is not to be trifled with. Members of Avalanche, with your full support... We got this!"
"Billy Bob: (chuckles) Ready to rumble, huh?"
"Yuffie: You better believe it! So, did you guys meet Sonon yet? He was supposed to be here."
"Polk: Yeah, he got in three days ago."
Nayo: He's out on the town as we speak. Really seems to be enjoying it here.
"Yuffie: Oh he does, does he!?"
"Polk: You, uh...got any bags?"
Yuffie: As if. Ninjas always travel light. It's like a rule.
Yuffie: But I did bring theseWutai's famous Da-chao beans. Eat up. And here you go.
Billy Bob: And you...eat these things?
Billy Bob: (chuckles) Guess you do.
Nayo: Sheesh. You ninjas are insane.
"Zhijie: Do me a favor, Yuffie, and wait here for Sonon. I gotta head out. Your IDs should be ready for pickup by now."
Yuffie: Then why don't I join ya!?
"Zhijie: Naw, I got this. Besides, you reek of trouble. (chuckles)"
Yuffie: Huh?
"Billy Bob: Hey, you gonna be okay out there? Got all the info you need?"
"Polk: Uh, Yuffie? Might wanna wait for Sonon before hittin' the city."
Nayo: You must be tired from your trip. Why don't you get some rest?
Yuffie: With all the noise in this city? Im-freakin'-possible. How about you tell me where in the Shinra Building they're keeping that materia instead. Don't hold out on me now. I know you know.
"Nayo: Actually...I kind of don't. At least, not an exact location. All I know is that Shinrafor most purposestreats materia as a weapon. Which means the Advanced Weaponry Division probably deals with it. And since that's in the basement..."
"Yuffie: I see... So... Shinra hides its top secret materia in the basement. (chuckles) You won't have to wait much longer, my precious...I promise."
"Nayo: Just be careful, will you? Please?"
"Nayo: Oh yeah, you should introduce yourself to Billy Bob. He knows a thing or two about the Shinra Building."
Billy Bob: My teeth...
"Yuffie: You're welcome. So, the materia I'm looking for is in the Shinra Building, right? And where is that, exactly?"
"Billy Bob: (chuckles) Ignorance truly is bliss, huh?"
Yuffie: What did you just say?
"Billy Bob: Haha, didn't mean to offend you. Of course, you probably knew this already, but there's a whole other city built on the plate above us. Shinra Building's right in the middle. You can't miss it."
"Yuffie: Oh,thatone. Why didn't you say so?"
"Billy Bob: Now, if ya wanna get topside, ya first gotta get outta the slums. And for help with that, you should talk to Polk."
Polk: You look kinda nervous.
"Yuffie: I just wanna make sure I have the plan down pat. You know, like how to get up top and all that."
"Polk: Huh, well... If you had an ID, you'd normally just take the train up there. But with all the commotion going on, that's not really an option. Security's on high alert. If you ask me, your best bet is to sit tight and wait for things to settle down some."
Yuffie: Sit tight? But I wanna go now...
"Polk: Be my guest, thengo get killed."
Yuffie: Harsh.
"Nayo: Sonon's still not back? Must be in Wall Market, then."
Yuffie: What's Wall Market?
"Nayo: Let's just say it's a place for people with ""mature tastes."""
Yuffie: Mature tastes...
Nayo: There's lots of different establishments. It's...kinda hard to explain.
"Yuffie: No, I think I get it. Like bars filled with smoke so thick you can't even see, and drinks so bitter you wanna spit 'em right back out!"
Nayo: Uh...
"Yuffie: Where everyone gets drunk and complains about how ""Kids just don't understand the value of hard work. They'll be the death of society."" Ugh, how can they not see thatthey'rethe ones destryoing it!?"
Nayo: (chuckles)
"Yuffie: Wutai's got a place like that, where grown-ups drink their lives away. It's called the ""Happy Turtle."""
Nayo: Interesting. There's a Happy Turtle in Midgar as well.
"Nayo: I don't know where exactly, because I've never actually been, but I do see their flyers from time to time."
"Yuffie: You do, huh? (gasp) They're taking down Midgar one citizen at a time!"
Nayo: (chuckles)
"Yuffie: I salute you, Happy Turtle!"
"Nayo: Come to think of it... There's a man who goes around putting up flyers for the bar. People call him ""Old Snapper."" And he doesn't dress like your average Midgar male. Might be from Wutai."
Yuffie: I oughta find him! Man deserves some Da-chao beans.
"Billy Bob: You know about the VR combat simulation module, right?"
Yuffie: Huh? Uh...course I do! Why wouldn't I? It's that thing that...stimulates...modulation.
Billy Bob: Hm. (chuckles) Kinda. It's a machine that puts you in a virtual world where you can practice fighting all you want. There's even a portable version of it. Guy around the corner has one.
Yuffie: Uh-huh...
Billy Bob: Hardly ever see technology that cutting-edge down here. So whaddya say? Wanna try it?
"Yuffie: I really don't have time to be playin' around with some stimulator. But, just to be polite, I guess I'll take it for a spin."
"Billy Bob: The guy's name is Chadley. He's over by the neighborhood watch. If you ever feel like some virtual training, I'm sure he'd be happy to help."
Polk: You look about ready to die of boredom. Wanna play Fort Condor?
"Yuffie: ""Fort...Condor""?"
"Polk: (chuckles) I shoulda known. It hasn't been out long, so there's no way you Ws would've heard of it."
"Yuffie: Uh, yes I have! And what's more, I'm awesome at it. I'll whoop you so hard, you'll wonder if you ever knew the rules!"
"Polk: For my benefit, then, lemme go over them..."
"Polk: Damn, Yuffie! How'd you do that? You totally kicked my ass!"
Yuffie: You mean you didn't lose on purpose? ...Wow.
"Polk: (chuckles) Well, if you're looking for a challenge, the undercity's got no shortage of serious players."
Yuffie: I've kinda got better things to do.
"Polk: Sure 'bout that? Word is if you beat the grandmaster, you can win some serious cashmateria, too."
Yuffie: Materia!?
Polk: That's right. But you should know the hardcore competitors won't give you the time of day till you've proven yourself.
Yuffie: Whatever! Bring it on!
Yuffie: Ugh... Al this talking's giving me a headache. I'm gonna go do some recon.
"Nayo: I won't stop you. Just don't go too far, okay?"
Yuffie: His ways are a mystery.
New Recruit: Um... Sir? What are we going to do?
"Senior Officer: We're going to concentrate on our jobs, and not worry about things that don't concern us."
New Recruit: But...what if Avalanche is hiding somewhere in this sector?
Yuffie: Sonon's gotta be back by now.
Sonon: I'm back.
"Nayo: Ah, there you are. Someone's been expecting you."
Yuffie: What took you!?
Sonon: Sorry 'bout that.
Yuffie: Wh-what?
"Sonon: Just thinking how you're nothing like your old man. Anyway, it's nice to meet you. I'm Sonon Kusakabe. I was lucky enough to learn how to fight from G"
"Yuffie: Yeah, I don't wanna talk about him. Let's talk about something else. Like how you've adjusted to life hereindulging in ""adult"" pastimes. Which I guess means...drinking yourself stupid! Last thing I need is my partner stinking like an over-the-hill has-been."
"Yuffie: Speaking of drinking...you been to the Happy Turtle? If you're part of Operation Down-in-One, I take it back. I amtherenext time you go. Don't worry, I can do adult stuff just fine."
"Sonon: Well, I don't even know where to begin with all of that... But Idoknow I haven't heard of ""Operation Down-in-One."" At any rate, I'm looking forward to working with you, Boss."
"Yuffie: ""Boss""? As inme?"
"Sonon: Well, I've got a few years on you, I'll admitbut out of us two, you've done this longer."
"Yuffie: I...I guess I have! ""Boss,"" huh? I could get used to that. Beats being stuck on the bottom rung, that's for sure. (chuckles)"
"Sonon: After we get that materia, we can celebrate your promotion at the Happy Turtle."
Yuffie: Yeah! Yeah!
Yuffie: Stupid bird.
Polk: Says the merchandise is good to go. Handoff's at a depot in municipal storage.
"Nayo: Okay. Yuffie, Sonon. You mind coming along?"
Yuffie: Not at all! Need to scope out the city anyway. Really get to know the enemy.
"Nayo: We'll be passing through a rough part of town, so you'll wanna go prepared. I'll leave you to get ready. Hit met up outside when you're done, okay?"
Yuffie: Be right there!
Chadley: Searching for candidates...
"Chadley: Candidate detected. Performing physical analysis. She seems relatively agile, and has substantial muscle mass for her stature. Hm. An acceptable candidate."
"Yuffie: Hey, uh...you wanna tell me what you're mumblin' about?"
Chadley: My apologies. My name is Chadley. Would you be interesting in helping me with my research?
Yuffie: I'm Yuffie. Neet to meet you. So...what're you researchin'?
Chadley: Combat. It would entail doing battle with a summon in a virtual arena using this portable simulator. Interested?
Yuffie: Hmmm...sure! Why not. Imma kick its butt!
Chadley: Very well then...
Chadley: Can I assume you're ready to do battle with a virtual summon?
Chadley: You're withdrawing? That is...most disheartening.
"Chadley: What a shame. It was a close match. However, I did manage to obtain some invaluable data. Analyze and learn from your mistakes, so that you can claim victory next time."
"Chadley: Splendid! Thanks to the data you provided during your battle, I succeeded in developing a new materia! One might say you were ""faster than lightning."" And with the Lord of Levin on your side, your enemies will struggle to keep up!"
"Kyrie: Attention! For three gil, you can play Fort Condor against the lovely Kyrie!"
"Kyrie: You know the drill. You wanna play, you gotta fork overHm? What's your deal? And why're you dressed like a five-year-old? That's just weird."
Yuffie: Uh... What are you talking about? This isn't weirdit's super cute!
"Kyrie: ""Super cute""? Heh. More like ""super lame."""
Yuffie: Not as lame as Midgar.
Kyrie: Huh?
"Yuffie: Just saying how much I was looking forward to playing Fort Condor. I could really use the training, y'know?"
"Kyrie: Sure, I'll put you through your paces...but you do know it's gonna cost ya, right? One match, three gil. Play up."
On-screen: Challenge Kyrie (Rank 1) to a match?
"Kyrie: Um, excuse me? I cheated and Istilllost?"
Yuffie: (chuckles) What can I say? Talent trumps all.
Kyrie: Whatever. You still owe me for my time. It's gotta be worth...seven gil at least!
Yuffie: As if!
Kyrie: I don't wanna think about it. Maybe I should just go home and pass out.
"Johnny: Ugh. Great work, Johnny. Just great. Where you gonna find enough money at this short notice?"
Johnny: Ah! Don't freakin' scare me like that! I'm highly strung! You trying to kill me orHuh? Who the hell are you?
Yuffie: Who am I? Someone who doesn't spend all day muttering to themselves in the shadows... Like some kinda Shinra spy!
"Johnny: Say what!?Me!? Nuh-uh! I was just...y'know...thinkin' about stuff. Huh? Hmm... (chuckles) Yeah, like how to bag that sweet, sweet Fort Condor prize money! It's my ticket outta here!"
"Yuffie: Heh. So you're after the grandmaster too? Sorry to burst your bubble, Mr. Shadow Lurker, butI'llbe the one takin' home those spoils of war."
Johnny: WhaOver my dead body you will! My life's on the line here! I deserve to eat! I deserve to live!
On-screen: Challenge Johnny (Rank 1) to a match?
"Johnny: What!? No, this can't beSay it ain't so! Goodbye fortune... Goodbye pride!"
"Yuffie: (chuckles) NowI'mtaking down Midgar, a citizen at a time."
"Johnny: Huh? Wait, what'd you say?"
Yuffie: That all of Midgar's gonna suffer the same fate.
"Shinra Middle Manager: So when your opponent leads with this, you respond with...this? This game is insane..."
"Yuffie: Hey there, suit. How's that conversation with yourself workin' out?"
"Shinra Middle Manager: Oh! Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb anyone. My daughter's been dying to play this game, and I promised to teach her. But first, I have to teach myself."
"Yuffie: That ""game"" wouldn't happen to be Fort Condor, would it!? If you want, I'll help you figure stuff out."
"Shinra Middle Manager: Y-you will? Uh, thanks, that'd be a great help."
On-screen: Challenge the Shinra middle manager (Rank 1) to a match?
"Shinra Middle Manager: Well, whaddya know! I think I'm startin' to get the hang of this!"
Yuffie: Starting to get the hang of what? Losing?
"Shinra Middle Manager: Losing on purpose, to be precise. If I can let my daughter win without her suspecting, that to me is as good as a victory."
Yuffie: Boo!
"Shinra Middle Manager: (chuckles) I know, I know... But if it'll make her happy..."
Jessie: Where are they? They should've been here by now...
"Yuffie: Hm? Waiting for somone? Ooh, you got stood up."
"Jessie: As if! Wait, who are you?"
"Jessie: Don't mean to be rude or anything, kid, but do you mind? I'm not exactly in the mood."
Jessie: Not in the mood. Go bug literally anyone else.
"Roche: Why, hello there! Forgive me for saying, but you remind me of a dear friend of mine. Perhaps you've met him?"
Yuffie: I dunnois he Shinra too?
"Roche: Perhaps, perhaps... My name is Roche, by the way. Ordinarily, your ill-concealed hostility and exotic wardrobe would give me pause. But not today, for I am here on business of apersonalnature. Looking for my aforementioned friend."
Yuffie: What's his name?
"Roche: Oh, I only wish I knew! But Icantell you that he has a real...""need for speed,"" as they say. And while he boasts averylarge sword, his first love his plainly his mount!"
"Yuffie: Yeah, he sounds great. Say, is that Fort Condor I see over there? You play?"
Roche: I'm always ready for a round of Fort Condor!
"Roche: Though...I suspect a delicate flower like you would wither if exposed to my scorching passion for the game. Maybe after some practice, hm?"
"Roche: (chuckles) In the absence of my friend, you will provide some much-needed entertainment, my dear!"
On-screen: Challenge Roche (Rank 2) to a match?
"Roche: Well played, my friend! And to think I thought I'd best you easily!"
Yuffie: Wait...did you just call me your friend?
"Roche: But of course! With that display of passion, you've more than proven yourself worthy! Henceforth, you shall occupy a place in the pantheon of my closest companions! When next we meet, it will be on the open road, the wind in our hair... Just don't make me come looking for you, my friend!"
"Roche: Hahahahahaha! Nice try, but no."
On-screen: Fort Condor You may now challenge Rank 2 players!
"Yuffie: So, I've been thinkin' about it, and I know just what you need... Round of Fort Condor?"
Jessie: You gotta beDidn't I tell you I'm not in the mood?
"Jessie: (sighs) You know what? Fine, why the hell not. Might help take my mind off things."
On-screen: Challenge Jessie (Rank 2) to a match?
"Jessie: Damn... Well, can't win 'em all."
Yuffie: (laughs)
"Jessie: Ha ha, laugh it up. Now leave me alone, wouldja?"
Yuffie: Hm? What's that I hear? The sound of the world's smallest violin?
Jessie: Keep pushing me...
Yuffie: So...I couldn't help noticing your Fort Condor set. Got time for a game?
Wedge: It'd be my pleasure!
"Yuffie: Then let's do it up! I gotta warn you, though, I'm kind of an expert at this."
Wedge: (laughs) Pretty sure I'll hold my own. I eat experts for breakfast!
"Yuffie: Oho, is that right? Well, you can talk the talk, so let's see ya walk the walk!"
On-screen: Challenge Wedge (Rank 3) to a match?
Wedge: Not gonna lie...I didn't think you had a chance. Sure showed me.
"Yuffie: You freakin' bet I did! Aw, not gonna go cryin' to your cats, are ya!?"
Wedge: Ugh!
"Yuffie: Looks like you've got your work cut out for you, my furry friends!"
"Yuffie: Hey... Wait a second. That was everyone, right? Including the grandmaster? So where's my materia!? I want it now!"
"Chadley: Hell, Yufife. I've finished reviewing your Fort Condor match records. You exhibit what in sporting parlance is called ""the ability to perform in the clutch,"" and ""the heart of a champion."" In combination, these traits make you the ideal player! That being the case, if it isn't too much trouble, would you mind testing your mettle against me?"
Yuffie: Uh... I guess so?
"Chadley: I'm sure you'll ""kick butt""!"
"Chadley: That was quite the performance, Yuffie! Thanks to you, my hypothesis has been substantiated."
Yuffie: Your hypo-thingy's what now?
"Chadley: Substantiated. I was testing security measures against Wutaian espionage operations. By offering a reward, I surmised I could accelerate the rate of adoption, which would, in turn"
"Yuffie: Yeah, yeah, skip to the end!"
Chadley: (sighs) My apologies. What I meant to say was this: The money and the materia are yours. Do with them as you please.
"Yuffie: did you say ""materia""!? So...you'rethe Grandmaster!? Whodda thunk! (laughs) How does it feel, Shinrato see the whole of Midgar brought to its knees by the Amazing Yuffie!"
"Chadley: Heh. Your capacity to remain undeterred and overcome adversity is commendable. You are truly a worthy competitor. When I next test a hypothesis, I would be honored if you would agree to... ...""kick its butt""!"
Yuffie: Anytime!
Chadley: Shame; it was a close match. Maybe next time.
Chadley: Would you care to assist in my research by joining me in a game or two of Fort Condor?
Old Snapper: Oh the joy and cheer that await at the Happy Turtle...
"Old Snapper: Oho! Greetings, softshell. So, how many of those flyers didja find?"
Yuffie: Wha?
"Old Snapper: Ahem! Collect just six flyers for the Happy Turtle, and a one-of-a-kind prize could be yours! Ring any bells?"
Yuffie: Nope.
"Old Snapper: Well then! Allow me to explain. The Happy Turtle's running a contest. And the rules are simple. All you have to do is collect six of our fabulous flyers from around Sector 7...and you'll earn yourself a prize sure to delight even the dourest diamondback! Hah hah! Sadly, a handful of locals have taken to acting like stinkpots toward anything Wutaian, 'speciall since the bombings. Some've even gone so far as to tear down my poor posters. Little wonder nobody's won yet."
Yuffie: Bummer.
"Old Snapper: (sighs) Which leaves me in a pretty predicament... But hey, my pain might be your gain. By collecting just a handful of flyers, you could be the first, andat this ratethe only winner of the most testudinarious contest in Midgar's history! This here's a sample of one of our ads. Breathtaking, isn't it? Now it's up to you to find all six. Leave no shell unturned, no pond unplumbed!"
Yuffie: That prize is as good as mine!
"Old Snapper: Ah, since you're here. You wouldn't happen to have any condor coins on you, wouldja? This job may keep a shell over my head, but my real passion's coin collecting. I'd gladly party with some oddities and commodities in exchange for those little beauts."
Yuffie: Hm hm hm hm-hm-hm-hm-hmmm... (hums Happy Turtle theme)
"Old Snapper: So, what can I do ya for?"
On-screen: What can Old Snapper do for you?
"Old Snapper: Went to check on one of my flyers, and would't ya know, some rascally youngsters've hidden the darn thing."
"Old Snapper: Friend of mine manages some apartments nearby, and she's been kind enough to let me post a flyer."
Old Snapper: Saw one of my babies floating through the air earlier! Poor thing...
"Old Snapper: The one I put up in Culvert Street's vanished, too. Swiped by one of those pesky cats..."

"Marle: Just what do you think you're doing, young lady?"
Yuffie: (screams)
"Marle: And whaddya want withthat, exactly? Better yet, who are you? Heard some punks've been hasslin' the nice people at the Happy Turtle, rippin' down their flyers. Are you one of 'em?"
Yuffie: Mm-mm.
"Marle: So you're trying to sneak a peek at the merc? Not that I blame ya. Boy's easy on the eyes, I'll give him that much."
Yuffie: Uh...
"Marle: But cut your losses, honey. Unless you like your men silent and emotionally unavailable. Merc's built a wall around himself so damn high, even he can't see over it. He'll never tell you what he's thinking. And that attitude of his...! I tried to get through to himbut would he listen? Would he?"
"Yuffie: Uh, I'm really not here for...whoever he is."
Marle: Then whatareyou here for?
"Yuffie: For, uh...directions! But I'm all good now, thanks!"
Yuffie: Hah... That was a close one.
"Yuffie: I'm comin' for ya, flyer!"
"Yuffie: Heh heh, gotcha!"
Yuffie: (screams)
Yuffie: Flyer acquired!
On-screen: The Happy Turtle Newsletter 4 obtained.
"Wymer: Hey! Over here! Can't belive those freakin' morons... They damn near got 'emselves eaten tryin' to hide that stupid poster. You stay away from that factory, y'hear? Place has monsters comin' outta the walls."
Wymer: Fiends've been actin' up since the bombingslike they know something we don't. (sighs) Just wish that merc were still around. He'd sort those critters out.
"Yuffie: Heh heh, gotcha! You thought you could hide from me, didn't ya!"
On-screen: The Happy Turtle Newsletter 5 obtained.
Yuffie: (gasps) My turtle senses are tingling!
"Yuffie: Heh heh, gotcha!"
On-screen: The Happy Turtle Newsletter 6 obtained.
Yuffie: And that makes six! Won't Old Snapper be impressed when I rock up with these bad boys.
On-screen: Return to Old Snapper?
"Old Snapper: Well, well, well... Look what the tide washed in. That's a one, two...three and a four...five andI can't believe itsix! We have a winner! Three cheers for the Happy Turtle's all-conquering champion! Hip hip, hooray! Hip hip, hooray! Hip hip, hooraaay!"
"Yuffie: Please, it was a piece of cake. Only these Midgarian dummies would findthata challenge. Speaking of which... Herefor a fellow tough nut!"
Old Snapper: Would ya look at that... Da-chao beans! Does this mean what I think it does?
Yuffie: Mm-hm.
"Old Snapper: Well, whaddya know. A real-life ninja, paying Old Snapper a visit. Truth be told, I'd love to have you 'round to the bar, but...you got your hands full. (chuckles) Not to mention the whole underage thing. Still just a young'n, I s'pose, ninja though you are. Well, I don't plan on movin' from Midgar anytime soon, so once your shell's seen a bit more wear and tear, make sure to come on back. Whip you up the finest food and drink this side of Wutai. Only the best for you."
Nayo: You guys all set?
On-screen: You all set?
"Nayo: Okay. Streets are kind of a maze, so stay close."
Nayo: Take all the time you need.
Nayo: Yuffie? Where are you going?
"Sonon: So Nayo, where we headed?"
Nayo: To pick up your IDs. There's no way to get topside without 'em.
Yuffie: But I thought Zhijie was getting our High-D's. What happened with that?
"Nayo: He is, but those are different. It takes more than one IDor even twoto survive in this town. Don't forget, Midgar was built by Shinra, for Shinra."
Yuffie: Those tyrants!
"Sonon: Put the claws away, Boss. Least while we're in Shinra territory."
Yuffie: Reowr!
Sonon: Whoa.
"Nayo: So, Yuffie, what do you think of the undercity?"
"Yuffie: Way too crowded. I can't stand it. Ugh, and the stench! How can anyone live here?"
"Sonon: Gotta agree with you about the smell, but you get used to it quick enough."
Nayo: And the crowds stop bothering you eventually. The place can grow on you if you give it a chance.
Yuffie: Uh...wait a second. Are you actually saying you like it here? I thought you hated it.
"Nayo: Midgar isn't the enemyShinra is. I know Ws don't really see the distinction, but...we do."
Yuffie: Then what was that stuff on the news? About a reactor blowin' up and all. No way that was an accident. It had to be Avalanche.
Nayo: Shh!
Yuffie: Sorry...
"Yuffie: Uh, what's up?"
Nayo: Those guys there are from the splinter cell.
Yuffie: Splinter cell?
"Nayo: They used to be with Avalanche, but left after a ""policy dispute."""
"Biggs: Well, look who it is. Lovin' your work! So how many reactors is that now? Wait... Where's Cloud?"
Barret: We lost him.
Biggs: You what?
Tifa: Hewillbe okay though...right?
"Barret: Well...of course he will! A little fall ain't gonna stop a hard-ass like him. He'll come swaggerin' back before long, you mark my words."
Tifa: Yeah...I guess he will.
Barret: Now can we talk about President Shithead? Spoutin' all that crap about us!? That lyin' son of a bitch! Working for Wutai!? Avalanche ain't nobody's
Tifa: Barret.
Biggs: Speakin' of sons of bitches...I heard the Wall Market's very own Don Corneo has his stooges out lookin' for ya.
Tifa: Huh?
Barret: Is that so?
Barret: Don't got time for no low-level mobsters. We got Shinra in our sights.
Barret: Tifa. You and I both know this is far from over. Right? Might as well get some restwhile we still can.
Tifa: Right.
Tifa: You know what? I think I am gonna look into this.
Biggs: Good luck out there.
Nayo: They're the ones who blew up the reactors.
Yuffie: Cool. Should we say hi?
"Sonon: Nah, better not. After what they've done, you gotta assume Shinra's on their tail. Should keep our distance."
Nayo: Yeah. My thoughts exactly.
"Nayo: The people in the splinter cell, they couldn't care less about collateral damage...long as Shinra goes down."
"Yuffie: So, what's wrong with that? Sounds good to me."
Nayo: We're not out to blow Midgar up or tear it downwe want to save it from Shinra. Look around. Nine outta ten of the people living here are innocent bystanders. We can't level their home to take down one company.
"Yuffie: Well, that company almost leveledourhome, and they've gotta learn their lesson."
"Nayo: Yeah, I get that."
"Sonon: Gotta admit, I'm surprised you agreed to work with us."
Nayo: We're just doing what we think is necessary...to build a brighter future. That's all there is to it.
"Sonon: In other words, you're working with us so we don't work with your old buddiesknowing what would happen if we did."
"Nayo: Uh, can we table this for later, maybe? Not sure now's the best time for heavy topics."
"Yuffie: Yeah, couldn't agree more. Consider it tabled!"
"Nayo: So...what exactly does this ""ultimate materia"" do? I'm guessing you have big plans for it?"
"Yuffie: Like after we steal it? Well, the more materia you have, the stronger you are, right? So once we've got theultimatemateria, we'll be stronger than anyone!"
Nayo: I guess you will...
Yuffie: (chuckles) It's gonna be awesome!
"Sonon: And not just that. By sneaking into Shinra HQ and snatching their most prized possession from under their noses...not only will we deal a massive blow to their morale...but we'll prove to them that while Wutai might be down, we're not out. That the gist of it, Boss?"
"Yuffie: Uh, sure is!"
Corneo Lackey (1): See that one?
"Corneo Lackey (2): Well hello there, hot stuff... How'd ya like a shot at the big time?"
Yuffie: (chuckles)
"Corneo Lackey (2): With those looks, I guarantee you're golden."
Yuffie: (chuckles)
Corneo Lackey (2): So whaddaya say? Ready to be queen of the undercity?
Yuffie: Hey! What am I? Chopped liver!?
Corneo Lackey (2): The kid doesn't need to hear this.
"Corneo Lackey (1): Now be a good girl and cover your ears, okay?"
Corneo Lackey (2): You'd be living and working in the most luxurious residence in all of Wall Ma
"Nayo: You want me to be one of Corneo's brides, is that it? Which makes you a ""person of influence,"" right?"
"Corneo Lackey (2): Oh, I see you know your stuff. But I'd say I'm more of a ""helping hand."" So, why don't you help me help you?"
Corneo Lackey (3): Let's get going.
Nayo: What're you doing!? Get your hands off me? Ugh!
"Corneo Lackey (3): Now, don't go playin' ha"
"Yuffie: (laughs) Know any kids who can dothat? No you don't, 'causeI'man adult."
Corneo Lackey (2): (laughs)
"Yuffie: Also, I'm pretty hot stuff myself, thank you very much."
"Corneo Lackey (2): Hah. Sure, whatever helps you sleep at night,little girl. But if you wanna pull up a seat at the grown-ups' table...be my guest."
"Sonon: Hey, at least you tried."
"Corneo Lackey (2): You're gonna eat those words, you smuh piece of shit."
Corneo Lackey (4): Boss! Boss! You're not gonna believe this! The hottie of the century just fell righ t into our laps!
Corneo Lackey (2): She did?
"Corneo Lackey (4): (laughs) Goods under the hood, junk in the trunk, and down for a bumpy ride!"
"Corneo Lackey (2): Sorry, ladies, but after careful consideration, we've decided to go with a more ""qualified"" applicant. Let's go."
Corneo Lackey (3): See ya around!
Yuffie: Okay...
"Yuffie: So, who were those creeps anyway?"
"Nayo: Don Corneo's ""talent scouts."" They'll say and do just about anything to get unsuspecting girls back to the don's mansion."
Sonon: I thought it looked seedy. Guess you'dhaveto be a scumbug to build a place like that.
Yuffie: Oho? And how doyouknow what it looks like?
Sonon: I saw it while I was scouting the area.
"Nayo: Well, we're here. Now we just have to wait."
Yuffie: Wait for who?
"Nayo: Not sure. We used to have someone who could make fake IDs in-house, but...they went off with the splinter cell. We've never dealt with this particular vendor before."
"Yuffie: Hey, uh... What's up with that guy?"
Nayo: Mako poisoning. That's what happens if you don't make the grade as a SOLDIER...or when the military's done using you.
Sonon: Just another one of Shinra's victims.
"Yuffie: Them again!? Oh, Shinra's so gonna get it!"
"Counterfeiter: If it's Shinra you've got beef with... You'll be needing these. Can't access the plate without 'em. They're gonna scan for those things on the train, so make sure to keep 'em on you."
Nayo: Thank you.
"Yuffie: Hey, hold up!"
Yuffie: Try it. You'll love it.
Yuffie: Foreigners and their weak jaws...
Nayo: We should probably head back and wait for Zhijie.
"Yuffie: Enjoy your materia while you still can, Shinra, 'cause we're comin'!"
"Sonon: Not yet, Boss. With things the way they are, we can't just go strolling up to the front gates. We're gonna need Avalanche to help us bypass security before we can do anything."
Yuffie: Aw! Hmph.
Robed Man: Re...un...ion...
Yuffie: A-wha...?
Nayo: Huh. What's this about?
"Nayo: ""Change of plans. Go to the pillar. Will explain there. Hurry.Zhijie"""
"Yuffie: ""Change of plans""?"
Sonon: TheS7pillar?
"Nayo: Otherwise known as ""the roof of the slums."" Follow me, guys."
Sonon: Why's he need us to hurry? I don't like the sound of this.
"Yuffie: Well, if you ask me, it's high time things picked up around here."
"Nayo: You like living in the fast lane, huh."
"Yuffie: Yeah, I'm not your garden-variety Wutaian. I'm a rare bloom!"
Sonon: More like a mutant.
"Yuffie: Ooh, I'msogonna use that!"
Nayo: Almost there.
Yuffie: Hey! That's Zhijie.
Sonon: You're right. Hold up.
"Security Officer: Hey, I'm talking to you! Answer me! Well?"
Zhijie: Uh... Look! A moogle!
Security Officer: Stop!
Sonon: We gotta help.
Nayo: You two go after Zhijie. I'll head back and tell the others what happened.
Sonon: That way.
Sonon: Boss. We might not be back for a while. Best to stock up before leaving.
Yuffie: Do you have any idea what Zhijie actually did?
"Sonon: Whatever it was, he probably did it for us."
"Yuffie: Well, now I feel bad."
"Sonon: No time for that, Boss."
Yuffie: Right.
Zhijie: Shit...
Security Officer (1): Got nowhere to run.
Security Officer (2): Tell us what you know. Now.
Zhijie: (chuckles) How 'bout later? I'm not stupid.
Security Officer (2): Hey!
Security Officer (1): After him!
Yuffie: Oho! Talk about fast. Is he one of us?
"Sonon: We don't have time to get into that, Boss. You can ask him yourself once he's safe. Come on."
On-screen: Shipping Facility
"Zhijie: You got grit, I'll give ya that."
Security Officer: Piece of shit. He's toying with us.
"Yuffie: This some kind of factory or something? It reminds me of a place I passed through when I first got here. And if it's anything like that, it'll be crawlin' with monsters."
Zhijie: Sorry!
Security Officer (1): (sighs) Dammit.
Security Officer (2): We should radio the other squads.
Yuffie: Aha! Been lookin' for you!
Security Officer (1): The hell!?
On-screen: Operate conveyor belt?
"Yuffie: Hey, you think Nayo's alright?"
"Sonon: She's a local, remember. She'll be fine."
"Yuffie: You know, she's actually pretty cool. I feel bad saying this, but after what happened back home, I just kinda assumed no one in Avalanche could be trusted. Like, they were all the same as the ones I fought."
Sonon: Yeah. I can imagine.
"Yuffie: But it looks like Avalanche has changed a lot since that went down, huh?"
Yuffie: C'mon.
Zhijie: You guys just don't know when to quit.
"Yuffie: (screams) Man, that stings... Alright, now you've done it! When this is over, you're gettin' it good! Enjoy your freedom while you can, Zhijie!"
Security Officer (1): Ten-four. Be there as soon as we can. Unit 3 says they've got the suspect detained near pillar maintenance. We'd better not keep them waiting.
Security Officer (2): What? Pillar maintenance? How'd they let him get that far?
Security Officer (1): Hell if I know. Come on.
Yuffie: You heard the main.
Sonon: WaitBoss! No!
Yuffie: (stumbles)
Security Officer: Freeze!
Yuffie: (chuckles)
Sonon: (sighs)
Yuffie: Well that sucked. Why did tailing people have to be so hard?
"Sonon: You gotta learn to think before ya act, Boss. Gonna get yourself killed one of these days."
"Yuffie: Eh. Sure, whatever. Now how do we find Zhijie?"
"Sonon: I've got an idea about that, but let's get to a vantage point first."
On-screen: Storage Depot
"Sonon: Alright, see that massive structure up ahead? That's the pillar those troopers were talking about. Assuming the maintenance facility's near there, we should probably head toward it. Sound good?"
"Yuffie: Yeah, works for me."
Sonon: C'mon.
Yuffie: Now how are we gonna get across. Hmmm...
Yuffie: Oho! Is that a switch I see?
"Sonon: Hey, about what you said earlier."
Yuffie: Which was...?
Sonon: About Avalanchehow it's changed.
Yuffie: Oh. That.
Sonon: These people are too soft. But those splinter cell guys?Theysound like the ones we should've teamed up with. Don'tcha think?
Yuffie: Yeah... I guess so.
"Sonon: I feel bad for complaining, considering all they've done for us."
"Yuffie: I know what you mean, though... They're all just really good people, huh."
Sonon: And that's the problem. Midgar doesn't need good people. Not that we care what happens to it.
Yuffie: Right...
On-screen: Waste Disposal Plant
"Sonon: Hey, Boss... Wanna try treading a little lighter this time? No point fighting if we don't have to."
"Yuffie: Yeah, yeah, I know...! Gotta be quiet... Very quiet... As quiet as a mouse..."
Yuffie: Eek!
Yuffie: (chuckles) Uh... Good morning!
Sonon: (sighs) Why me?
"Yuffie: Alright, it can't be far now. Let's get our rears in gear! Big ""g"", little ""o"", go, go, go!"
"Yuffie: Up ahead. Building just screams ""important."""
Sonon: Pillar maintenance. It has to be.
"Yuffie: Bleh, why'd there have to be so many guards?"
On-screen: Main Pillar Maintenance
"Sonon: I think you know exactly why. Gotta say, they might call this place a maintenance facility...but it looks more like an arms factory to me. Let's keep it tight, Boss. We can't afford any more mistakes. Zhijie's life depends on it."
Yuffie: Understood.
Security Officer (1): Now spill it! Who gave you that information!?
"Zhijie: Oh, his name was something like...Heidegger?"
Security Officer (2): Wrong answer!
Security Officer (1): I'm gonna ask you again.
"Zhijie: Alright, alright, I'll tell you. It was Rufus."
Security Officer (1): You don't say...
Zhijie: (screams) ...Or was it Hojo? (chuckles)
"Yuffie: Huh. Nice goin', Zhijie."
"Sonon: Ready to do this, Boss?"
Yuffie: Born ready!
Sonon: Great. I'll draw their attention. You grab our guy.
"Yuffie: A diversion, huh? I like it. But don't forget:I'mthe leading lady."
"Yuffie: Hey, you! Evildoers! Over here!"
Security Officer (2): What the hell?
Security Officer (1): Who's there!?
Yuffie: That's exactly what I was hoping you'd ask!
Yuffie: And...action!
"Yuffie: Some know me as a beguiling ninja! Others as the world's greatest materia hunter. But! Who am I truly? Well, excited onlookers, wonder no more!"
Yuffie: Before you stands a rare bloom: the single white rose of Wutai...the one-and-only Yuffie! (coughs)
"Security Officer (2): Never mind, it's just some kid."
Security Officer (1): Right?
"Yuffie: Hey, who're you callin' a kid!? (stumbles)"
Yuffie: Uh...guh...uhk...
"Sonon: Award-winning performance, Boss."
Yuffie: (chuckles)
Security Officer (2): Who are you anyway!?
Security Officer (2): Wutaians? Got eyes on hostiles. Requesting backup.
Yuffie: No freakin' way!
"Sonon: Centipede model, huh?"
Yuffie: Couldn't they have made it less gross?
"Yuffie: Oho... Running away, are we?"
"Yuffie: Or maybe it's doing one of those...""tactical retreats""?"
Sonon: Boss!
Yuffie: It's spitting little critters!
Sonon: Drones? What does it needthemfor?
Yuffie: They've got lasers too! And where there's lasers...
Sonon: There's missiles.
Yuffie: How're we supposed to dodge those things!?
Sonon: By not letting it launch 'em.
Yuffie: So now you've come crawling down.
Sonon: This'll make thigns easier.
Sonon: Boss!
Yuffie: Get wrecked!
"Sonon: Wait, what?"
Sonon: Looks like it wants to get serious.
"Yuffie: Oh, we'll make it serious, alrightdead serious."
Yuffie: (chuckles) You see that?
Sonon: That's how ninjas do it.
Yuffie: Yep.
Zhijie: Nice work! You saved my ass.
Yuffie: (gasps) Hahaha... It was nothin'!
"Zhijie: Well, it did earn ya these. Employee ID cards. They'll get you into the Shinra Building. And pretty much any floorbasement included. That's where Advanced Weaponry's got their lab set up...and where they conduct their materia research. If what you're looking for's anywhere in that place, it's gonna be there."
Yuffie: Got it.
"Zhijie: You guys should probably get movin'. Word is, Shinra's got something big lined up for us. Nothing less than the destruction of Sector 7. But, whatever it is they're planning, you're better off out of it."
Yuffie: Right.
Zhijie: Imma go report to the others. Good luck up there. See ya soon.
"Sonon: Yeah. Next time, I'm buying. I'll show you how Wutaians really party."
Zhijie: Deal.
"Yuffie: Don't forget to tell the splinter cellabout Sector 7, I mean!"
Zhijie: I won't.
"Sonon: Well, Boss, sounds like we'd better get going. Let's head up as soon as you're ready."
Yuffie: Ready!
Undercity Resident (1): To think this is where those bastards plotted their attacks. Right under our noses.
Undercity Resident (2): Too bad they made it out before the military could get here. Like chickens flying the coop...
Sonon: Prob'ly best if we don't stick around. Let's catch the train.
Yuffie: 'Kay.
Security Officer: Stay back. That's close enough.
"Sonon: Boss. I don't think we'll be back here anytime soon, so make sure you're ready for anything, okay?"
On-screen: Ready for anything?
Yuffie: I think we're good here. Let's roll.
Yuffie: What's with all these people?
"Train Attendant: Due to the recent incident at Mako Reactor 5, only a limited number of trains are currently in service. Please note that the Sector 5 Undercity Station is closed until further notice. Thank you."
Nayo: Shh!
Polk: Splinter cell's done its best to make things hard for ya. Miss this train and there's no telling when the next'll be.
"Billy Bob: Looks like it's now or never, guys."
"Nayo: Sorry we couldn't give you a proper send-off. Just know that we're rooting for you, okay?"
Yuffie: All aboard!
Yuffie: Oh boy...
Sonon: Gonna be sick?
Yuffie: (gulps) I'll be fine...as long as I'm standing up...
Yuffie: Don't laugh.
"Sonon: Melphie always got motion sick. Chocobos, boats... Sure trains would've done it too."
Yuffie: Who's Melphie?
Sonon: My sister.
Yuffie: Huh...
Sonon: She trained under your father at the same time as me. And she had such promise...
"Yuffie: ""Had""?"
"Sonon: The war was ending... But a Shinra mech went haywire near a crowd, and...she had to do something."
Sonon: They deserve what's comin' to 'em.
Yuffie: Yeah... They do. But I'mnotyour sister.
President Shinra: Are we on schedule?
"Heidegger: (laughs) The Turks are on top of it. Yes, there will be no delays."
"Reeve: Please, Mr. President! I am asking you to reconsiderno, begging. The Sector 7 undercity is home to more than 50,000"
President Shinra: (groans) Director Tuesti.
"Reeve: At least let us issue a warning, sir."
Heidegger: The stench of the director's cowardice fills the room yet again.
President Shinra: Reeve. Progress requires sacrifice. Learn to live with it.
On-screen: Shinra Building - Entrance
"Sonon: Whoa, look at all these people..."
Yuffie: Enough to make you sick. Let's get this over with.
"Newspaper Reporter: Excuse me! I have some questions! You work for Shinra, isn't that right? Then would you care to on rumors that Sector 7 will be the terrorists' next target? They're going to hit the reactor, aren't they?"
Security Officer: You! Stop right there!
Sonon: Elevators're right there. Let's catch one.
"Yuffie: You're up, High-D!"
"Yuffie: C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!"
Security Officer: Hold the door.
Security Officer: What floor?
Sonon: The basement. Advanced Weaponry.
Elevator: Going down. Doors closing.
Scarlet: Perfect. Just perfect. Hm?
"Scarlet: (chuckles) But oh, how the mighty are fallenWutai...colluding with Avalanche and resorting to terrorism? Hm. I always thought the Wutaians an honorable people. They used to be, certainly... But now? Now they're nothing but blood-sucking flies, buzzing around Shinra's face."
"Scarlet: Would you not agree? In light of recent events, I mean."
Yuffie: I would. A hundred percent! (chuckles)
Scarlet: What a lovely smile.
Yuffie: Open up!
Scarlet: I think not. Foreign visitors should take the scenic route. ...And savor the opportunity to meet our latest autonomous weapons. (laughs)
"Sonon: Dammit! I'll never get a better chance. That was Scarlet, director of Advanced Weaponry. It was one ofhermachines that killed Melphie!"
"Yuffie: Calm down, Sonon. Calm down. Remember: we're here for a reason."
"Sonon: Right, Boss... I'm sorry."
Yuffie: Don't be. I was ready to strangle her myself. And that's before she sent us off in the wrong direction...
Sonon: Wheredidshe send us?
"Yuffie: Only one way to find out. Don't worry, we'll get to Materia Research eventually. Just a little longer, my precious..."
On-screen: B16 - Advanced Weaponry: Inspection
"Yuffie: Just look at this place. Weapons here, weapons there, weapons everywhere! They're ready for some serious action."
"Sonon: It sounds like you are, too."
"Yuffie: Duh. Unlike my old man, I'm not some lazy drunk. I fight for what I believe in, somethinghe'dnever understand."
Sonon: Wonder how he's holding up...
"Yuffie: Behind bars, you mean? Not well, if the government's got anything to say about it. Good on 'em. Jail's where he belongs."
Sonon: That's my master you're talking about. Mind laying off him a little?
Yuffie: You know what? Let's drop it. Not exactly my favorite topic. It's only gonna make me mad. More importantly...
"Scarlet: My god, you people are deadly boring. Luckily, I know exactly how to liven things up...with a little experiment. Just don't go dying on methat wouldn't yield very interesting results, now would it?"
Announcement: Unit calibration complete. Initiating combat data-collection sequence.
Announcement: Data collection complete. Re-calibrating for next test.
Announcement: Unit calibration complete. Initiating combat data-collection sequence.
Announcement: Data collection complete. Re-calibrating for next test.
Yuffie: What? There's more?
Announcement: Unit calibration complete. Initiating combat data-collection sequence.
Announcement: Data collection complete.
Scarlet: Credit where credit is due. You exceeded my every expectation. And for being such good sports...you may now leave.
Yuffie: Why did I ever think for a second she'd be nice to us!? She knows damn well it's gonna be a pain in the ass gettin' up there.
"Yuffie: There we go. Honestly, howdoI do it? Now then, Sonon, how ya feel about givin' me a boost?"
Sonon: Ecstatic.
Sonon: And...go!
"Yuffie: Okay, get to climbin'!"
Subordinate: Madam Director. The intruders are about to reach the research facility.
"Scarlet: And we'll let them. Meanwhile, find out what it is they want."
Subordinate: Uh...?
"Scarlet: You do have eyes, don't you? Then you can see that, while they are simpletons, they've made it further than any normal Wutaian ever could. Clearly, they are ninjas.Teenageninjas. And they've come such a long way. We simply must roll out the red carpet. My trusty steed should provide a fitting welcome, I think. Keep me apprised, would you?"
"Subordinate: Ma'am. Cut system power to the research facility. Bar access to confidential data, then retrace their steps. Find out why they're here. Above all, donotlet them out of your sight."
Subordinates: Sir!
"Yuffie: Oh, materia, where are you?"
On-screen: B15 - Advanced Weaponry: Production
Yuffie: Hm? Is that materia I smell?
"Shock Trooper: End of the line, Wutai scum!"
Yuffie: This their idea of mood lighting? 'Cause it's bad.
Sonon: Might be the power. That thing's off too.
Yuffie: Talk about hitting the jackpot! This must be where they make their materia!
"Sonon: Maybebut they're not what we came for. Let's keep movin', Boss."
Yuffie: Totally. After I grab a few souvenirs.
Announcement: Level one power grid: online. Initiating mako energy saturation. Deploying security grate.

Announcement: Level two power grid: online. Initiating mako energy saturation. Deploying security grate.
"Yuffie: Not long now, my precious. You'll be safe in my arms soon!"

Yuffie: Uh...uh-oh.
"Yuffie: (groans) Aw, c'mon! How could we have gotten so lost!?"
"Sonon: Easy now. Focus. Ah, I know. Spare a Da-chao bean?"
Yuffie: Sure...
Yuffie: You ate it!
Sonon: You sound surprised.
"Yuffie: Man, I'm glad you're here!"
Sonon: Likewise.
Yuffie: It really helpsknowing I'm not alone in all this.
"Sonon: Yeah, same here."
Yuffie: Aha! Think I found our way across!
Sonon: Right. Shall we?
Announcement: Employee identity confirmed. Access granted. Occupancy limited to one subject. Proceed to gate to begin training exercise.
Yuffie: Training? Really? Just give us what we came for already!

Yuffie: Man... Another stupid dud!
Yuffie: Wha? Uh-oh...
"Yuffie: Quit holdin' out on us, Shinra! We're here for materia, not these dorks!"
Scarlet: Sohave you found out what they want yet?
"Subordinate: We think so. We can't say for certain, as their behavior is...erratic. But they appear to be searching for materia."
Scarlet: Excuse me? You mean to say that these savages have gone to all this trouble formateria?
"Subordinate: So far as we can tell, yes."
"Scarlet: How very dull. Be that as it may, I suppose I should talk to them."
Subordinate: Ma'am!
"Scarlet: Enjoying yourselves, I trust?"
Yuffie: (screams)
Scarlet: Awed by a simple hologram? How precious. But I know just what you needto loosen up a little. After such a long journey...you must be so tense!
Yuffie: (screams)
"Scarlet: Luckily, I have toys for thatall far more entertaining than this."
Sonon: What do you want!?
"Scarlet: Oh dear. Is that any way to talk to your host? Really though, as guests, it's more about what you want. And I think you'll find it just up ahead. Hurry now. Don't keep me waiting."
"Sonon: So, Boss. What're you thinking?"
"Yuffie: That we're walking into a trap, I guess. But it's nothing we can't handle, right?"
Sonon: Couldna said it better myself.
"Scarlet: Welcome to our state-of-the-art weapons testing facility. This is where we push every piece of ordnance to its limits...and beyond. Such tests are an invaluable part of the development process. Go on, see where the magic happens."

"Scarlet: My, my, how impressive! Seems I may have underestimated how resilient you ninjas can be."
"Yuffie: ""May have""!? How 'bout ""did"", you old hag!?"
"Scarlet: (chuckles) You Wutaians, so fesity. But let's see how you fare against what I have in store for you next. It's quite the treat, I assure you. Only the best for our honored guests, after all. Whenever you're ready."
On-screen: Heavy Weapons Platform Testing
Yuffie: Where are we?
"Yuffie: That thing...can't be operational, can it?"
"Sonon: We better hope not, boss."
"Scarlet: At long last, Wutai's finest deign to join us. You've performed admirably."
Yuffie: Quit acting all superior. We both know you're afraid of us!
"Scarlet: (chuckles) Is that so? Well, maybe I am!"
Yuffie: You should know there's more where we came fromlots more! And you'll never see 'em comin'! Just imagine a whole clan of ninjas landing on your doorstep!
Scarlet: Oh my! We must do something right away!
"Yuffie: Well, you can't!"
Scarlet: Don't say that. Won't you at least give us a chance?
Yuffie: What the
Scarlet: Allow me to present...the latest innovation in Shinra battle armor... Designed by yours truly. This'll be a memory to cherish for the rest of your lives. All thirty seconds of them.
"Yuffie: Oh look, we're surrounded!"
"Sonon: But not for much longer, eh, Boss?"
Yuffie: Right on! They're as good as scrap!
"Scarlet: Rather rude to ignore your playmates, is it not?"
"Yuffie: Hey, no fair!"
Yuffie: WhaCome back!
"Scarlet: Oh, I will, my dear. But I rather suspect you'll wish that I hadn't."
Yuffie: So what! Just smash it up!
"Scarlet: A moment, if you please."
Yuffie: Hey! Don't you know that's cheating!?
Scarlet: (chuckles) Pardon the wait.
Yuffie: More? How many of those things you got?
Scarlet: Useless!
Scarlet: Not nearly mobile enough. Should've known those actuators weren't up to the task. Time for an overhaul.
Yuffie: Hellooo!
Scarlet: Hm?
"Yuffie: My, my, my, how the tables have turned..."
"Scarlet: (laughs) Proud of yourself, little savage?"
Sonon: What're you doing!?
On-screen: Deepground
Weiss: Sleep well?
Nero: Weiss? This is a surprise. To what do I owe the pleasure?
"Weiss: These idiots want to ""digitally replicate"" me, so I'm indulging them."
Researcher (1): All set.
Researcher (2): Transporting...
Nero: (laughs) When will Shinra learn? There is no replicatingyou. They ought to know better.
Weiss: (chuckles) Looking forward to this?
Nero: I am. It has been too long since my last hunt.
Sonon: What'd you do? Tell us!
Scarlet: (sighs) Is this how it's done in Wutai? You just howl until you get what you want?
"Yuffie: That's enough, Sonon. I got this. Alright, lady, out with it. Tell us where you're hiding the new materia. Don't play dumb now. We know you've been cooking up something super-powerful."
"Scarlet: Well, well... Wutai must have some highly skilled intelligence operatives. That...or we have a mole in our midst."
Yuffie: What was...?
Sonon: I'll check on it.
"Yuffie: Alright, but make it quick."
"Scarlet: Youarecorrect that we're in the process of creating an exquisite new materia. However, it is far from complete."
"Yuffie: Yeah, right. You must think I'm stupid."
"Scarlet: Would I lie to you? Regrettable though it is, other plans have been deemed a higher priority."
Yuffie: What other plans?
Scarlet: (chuckles) Well...just between you and me... My colleagues and I...are going to drop Plate Number 7 on the slums. And then we're going to blame it on Avalanche and Wutai.
Yuffie: I don't get it. You're gonna drop a plate? And?
Yuffie: What the!?
Scarlet: Oh dear. I think your friend might've run into trouble. Aren't you going to save him?
Scarlet: Quickly now! (laughs)
Sonon: There you are!
Yuffie: Who're these assholes!?
Sonon: No clue. They just appeared!
"Yuffie: I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but..."
Sonon: Just hit me with it.
Yuffie: There is no ultimate materianot yet. She said it's still in the works. And she mentioned somethin' else. They're gonna drop Plate Number 7.
Sonon: They're gonna dowhat?
Yuffie: They're gonna drop Plate Number 7 on the slums...apparently.
Sonon: But that's the whole upper part of the sector!
Yuffie: Wait! So Zhijie was being serious!?
Sonon: This is bad.
Yuffie: Let's go!
"Sonon: Right behind ya! We may not have that materia, but we do have good intel."
Deepground SOLDIER: They're cornered. Box 'em in!
Yuffie: No way I'm givin' up!
Sonon: That's the spirit. Let 'em have it!
Yuffie: I'm not goin' down till I've been to the Happy Turtle!
Sonon: Huh?
Deepground SOLDIER: Opening doors. Set it up!
Deepground SOLDIER: Grenade out!
Sonon: Yuffie!

On-screen: Combat Simulator Prototype
Yuffie: Is it over?
"Sonon: Somehow, I seriously doubt it..."
"Yuffie: Ow... Man, I so don't wanna go back out there...but I don't think we've got a choice."
"Yuffie: Work, you stupid..."
Yuffie: No good. Door won't budge.
Sonon: Meaning we're trapped.
Scarlet: I want them...to suffer.
"Scarlet: The rest, I leave to you."
Combat Simulator: Pain Sensation Level set to: maximum.
Yuffie: What was that?
Sonon: They figure we need a challenge. Meaning we're in for a world of hurt.
Yuffie: No fair!
Combat Simulator: Pain Sensation: Max. Deploying additional combatants.
Yuffie: Where are these freaks even coming from!? 'Cause I'd really like 'em to stop!
Combat Simulator: Pain Sensation: Max. Deploying additional combatants.
"Yuffie: Joke's on you, Shinra, if you think we're dying in this ugly box!"
Combat Simulator: Pain Sensation: Max. Deploying additional combatants.
"Yuffie: Okay, this is gettin' old!"
Sonon: There's gotta be a projection mechanism around here somewhere. If we can just find it...
Sonon: Boss!
Yuffie: What the!? Why can't I hit it!?
Sonon: Cause that tentacled freak won't let you. We're gonna have to tough this one out.
"Sonon: Boss, the projector! While it's down!"
Yuffie: Leave it to me!
Yuffie: Now can wepleaseget outta here already?
Sonon: Who could've done this?
Researcher (1): Subjects on site. It's time. Initiate the Tsviet field test.
Researcher (2): Sir.
Yuffie: What are you doing? Aren't you all on the same team?
"Nero: ""Team""? Fool. There are no ""teams"" in Deepground."
Yuffie: Deep...ground?
Nero: The place where my brother and I like to play.
"Yuffie: Cool. Now, mind moving aside?"
Sonon: Let's take a different tack.
"Yuffie: Well, can't blame a girl for trying."
Nero: Now...let the games begin.
"Yuffie: What's with this company? They have a ""freaks only"" policy?"
"Sonon: Careful. This ""freak's"" no pushover."
Nero: Do I frighten you?
Nero: You cannot run from me.
"Sonon: Now, Boss. While he's distracted!"
Nero: I have you now.
"Sonon: Sonon, help! Get this creep off'a me!"
Researcher (1): Abnormal readings detected. The control program's been compromised!
Researcher (2): Containment protocol!
Yuffie: You're dead!
Sonon: Boss!
Nero: How dare you? Howdareyou stand in my way?
"Researcher (1): No, please(screams)"
Nero: Now then...where were we?
"Yuffie: Dunno what this crap is, but it's definitely not good!"
Nero: Surrender to the darkness. Embrace it.
Yuffie: Uhn heh...! Urk...!
Nero: All your suffering will soon be at an end.
Nero: All your suffering will soon be at an end.
"Nero: Oh, Weiss. This is it. This is it!"
Yuffie: No darkness! Get it away from me! Get it away!
Yuffie: Ew...I don't want that stuff anywhere near me!
Sonon: Stay focused. We'll get through this.
"Nero: (screams) It hurts, Brother. It hurts...so much...(screams)"
Yuffie: This is bad!
Sonon: Agreed. Let's get outta here.
Yuffie: No!
Nero: This is where you die.
Yuffie: Gross! It's everywhere!
Sonon: Let's end this before it swallows us too.
Nero: It's time I brought this to a close.
Nero: Behold the true beauty of darkness!
Sonon: Aaah! Gah... Raaah!
"Nero: (laughs) Yes, savor this pain."
Sonon: Not my finest moment.
Yuffie: Just stand back. Your boss has got ya covered!
Nero: Come closer. Allow me to hasten the inevitable.
"Yuffie: Yeah, no. I don't think so."
"Nero: Yes, yes! I must know more of this feeling! Of pain! Of death!"
"Sonon: Now, Boss! Let's finish this!"
Yuffie: Don't gotta tell me twice!
Yuffie: Did we?
Sonon: We did.
Yuffie: Awesome...(sighs)
"Sonon: Don't wanna spoil the moment, but...we should prob'ly get going."
Yuffie: But I'm so tired...
Sonon: I could carry you.
Yuffie: You win. Sheesh.
Yuffie: Aha!
"Yuffie: Hey, whaddaya think you're"
Yuffie: Sonon?
Nero: (chuckles)
Sonon: Go...
"Yuffie: No, I"
Sonon: Please.
Yuffie: But...
Nero: (laughs)
Yuffie: Sonon...?
Sonon: Yuffie.... You gotta keep going...forus.
Yuffie: No... Stop it...
Yuffie: Sonon!?
Yuffie: (cries)
Sonon: Damn...
Sonon: Melphie...
Yuffie: (cries) You asshole! I'm not a kid! I'm not your sister!
Yuffie: This is just wrong... (screams)
"Yuffie: (hums ""Chocobo Theme"")"
Yuffie: Don't think I can do this alone.
Yuffie: The Amazing Yuffie wantsyou! Join her team and the sky's the limit!
"Tifa: Hey, Barret. We really walking the whole way?"
Barret: Yup.
"Tifa: Kalm's still pretty far, though, isn't it?"
"Barret: 'Nother full day, give or take."
"Aerith: Question... When my mom says, ""a full day,"" she means from the time you get up in the morning till the time you go to bed...but for me, it means from the time you get up in the morning all the way through till the time you get up thenextmorning. So, which is it for you?"
Barret: Gotta go with Elmyra on that one.
"Aerith: Phew, that's a relief!"
"Tifa: Is it, though?"
"Barret: Cloud. Bet you've had to hoof it from sunup to sundown tons of times. This is all just same old, same old, right?"
"Cloud: That's right. But even so, we're all gonna need to stop and rest. Especially you."
"Barret: Yeah, yeah, I know... Anyway, marchin' into the unknown ain't easy, but don't worry, 'cause I'm here to lead the way!"
Aerith: (chuckles) That's comforting!
Barret: Of course it is! (laughs)
"Barret: Alright, everyonelet's stop here for a minute. Leader's orders! Now breathe in that fresh air!"
"Barret: Actally, scratch that. Let's, uh...save it for later. When we're not so close to Midgar."
"Tifa: Guess this is good-bye, City of Mako."
Aerith: Like this?
Tifa: Yup. Just like that.
Aerith: Cool.
Tifa: Hm? No way! A car!
Barret: Hey! Stop!
Barret: What is it with these damn birds!?
"Tifa: Uh, sorry 'bout that."
"Chocobo Bill: No need to apologize, ma'am!"
"Barret: (hums ""Chocobo Theme"")"
Aerith: Look at that...
Aerith: Where's a roof when you need one?
Cloud: Gonna be okay?
"Aerith: Should be, but... Weird... My stomach's in knots..."
Barret: That's its way of telling you it's hungry. Let's move.
"Zack: It's been a while, huh?"
"Zack: Long time, no see."
Zack: How you been? (sighs)
Zack: Listen... Hey...(sighs)
Zack: I'm back!
Zack: Aerith...?
Barret: C'mon newcomer. Follow me.
Biggs: Wow! You used to be in SOLDIER all right! ...Not everyday ya find one in a group like AVALANCHE.
Jessie: SOLDIER? Aren't they the enemy? What's he doing with us in AVALANCHE?
"Biggs: Hold it, Jessie. He WAS in SOLDIER. He quit them and now is one of us."
Biggs: Didn't catch your name...
On-screen: Please enter a name.
Cloud: ...Cloud.
"Biggs: Cloud, eh? I'm..."
Cloud: I don't care what your names are. Once this job's over...I'm outta here.
Barret: The hell you all doin'!? I thought I told you never to move in a group! Our target's the North Mako Reactor. We'll meet on the bridge in front of it.
"Barret: Ex-SOLDIER, huh? Don't trust ya!"
Barret: If you push the Directional button while pushing the [CANCEL] button to run. (earlier marked
Barret: Yo! This your first time in a reactor?
"Cloud: No. After all, I did work for Shinra, y'know."
Barret: The planet's full of Mako energy. People here use it every day. It's the life blood of this planet. But Shinra keeps suckin' the blood out with these weird machines.
Cloud: I'm not here for a lecture. Let's just hurry.
Barret: That's it! You're comin' with me from now on.
Biggs: Code deciphered
"Biggs: Think how many of our people risked their lives, just for this code..."
Jessie: Biggs and I got the code for this door.
Jessie: Code deciphered
Jessie: Push that button over there!
On-screen: Switch On.
Barret: Little by little the reactors'll drain out all the life. And that'll be that.
Cloud: It's not my problem.
"Barret: The planet's dyin', Cloud!"
Cloud: The only thing I care about is finishin' this job before security and the Roboguards come.
"Jessie: Push the [OK] button in front of a ladder to grab on to it. After that, use the [Directional button] to move up and down."
"Barret: When we blow this place, this ain't gonna be nothin' more than a hunka junk. Cloud, you set the bomb."
Cloud: Shouldn't you do it?
Barret: Jus' do it! I gotta watch to make sure you don't pull nothin'.
"Cloud: Fine, be my guest."
On-screen: Watch out! This isn't just a reactor!!
Barret: ......What's wrong?
Cloud: Huh?
"Barret: What's wrong, Cloud? Hurry it up!"
"Cloud: ...Yeah, sorry."
"Barret: Heads up, here they come!"
"Cloud: Barret, be careful!"
Cloud: It's gonna fire that laser...
Cloud: Attack while it's tail's up! It's gonna counterattack with its laser.
"Barret: I dunno what's goin' on, but... it looks pretty bad. Let's see what it does when it's tail's up..."
"Cloud: Come on, let's get outta here!"
On-screen: Ten minutes to detonation!
Cloud: The alarm!
Cloud: You all right?
Jessie: My leg got stuck.
Jessie: Thanks!
Jessie: Code deciphered
"Jessie: Alright, be careful."
Biggs: Jessie still hasn't come up yet!
Biggs: Code deciphered
Biggs: Let's go!
Biggs: That should keep the planet going... at least a little longer.
Wedge: Yeah.
Barret: .........
Jessie: OK! Now everyone get back.
"Barret: All right, now let's get out of here."
Barret: Rendezvous at Sector 8 station! Split up and get on the train!
"Cloud: H, hey!"
Barret: If it's about your money Save it 'til we're back at the hideout.
Flower girl: Excuse me. What happened?
"Flower girl: Really? I don't know what's going on, but all right."
Cloud: ............
"Flower girl: Oh, these? Do you like them? They're only a gil...?"
"Flower girl: What! Tell me! Uh,excuse me,would you like to buy some flowers? They're only one gil."
"Flower girl: Oh, thank you! Here you are!"
Flower girl: Ahh...not again.
NPC: Just what the hell's going on!?
NPC: Wonder what that is on the wall over there. Let's see...Don't be fooled by Shinra! Mako energy doesn't last forever! Mako is the planet's lifesource! The end is in sight! Protectors of the planet: AVALANCHE
Soldier: Hey! You there!!
Cloud: Shinra Soldiers......
Soldier: What the?
Cloud: hmph!
Soldier: Halt!!
Soldier: That's him!!Cloud: hmph!
Soldier: Over here!!
Cloud: hmph!
Soldier: That's as far as you go.
Cloud: I don't have time to be messin' around with you guys.
Soldier: Enough babbling...... Grab him!!
Cloud: What a pain......
Wedge: Cloud never came.
Biggs: Cloud...... Wonder if he was killed?
Barret: No way!!
Jessie: Cloud......
"Biggs: Say, do you think Cloud's...... Going to fight to the end for AVALANCHE!?"
Barret: The hell would I know!? Do I look like a mind reader? Hmph!! If y'all weren't such screw-ups...
"Wedge: Hey, Barret! What about our money...? Uh, nothin'...sorry. Ahhh......"
Wedge: Cloud!!
Biggs: Cloud!!
Jessie: Cloud......
Cloud: Looks like I'm a little late.
"Barret: You damn right, you're late!! Come waltzin' in here makin' a big scene!"
Cloud: It's no big deal. Just what I always do.
Barret: Shi't! Havin' everyone worried like that you don't give a damn 'bout no one but yourself!
Cloud: Hmm...... You were worried about me!
"Barret: Wha!? I'm takin' it outta your money, hot stuff!"
Barret: Wake up! We're movin' out! Follow me!
"Wedge: Hey, Cloud!! You were great back there!"
Biggs: Heh heh......Cloud! We'll do even better next time.
"Jessie: Be careful, I'll shut this."
"Jessie: Oh, Cloud!! Your face is pitch-black......"
Jessie: There you go!
"Jessie: Say, thanks for helping me back there at the Reactor!"
"On-screen: Last train out of Sector 8 Station. Last stop is Sector 7, Train Graveyard. Expected time of arrival is 12:23AM, Midgar Standard Time..."
NPC: This is why I hate the last train. Hoo-boy...
"NPC: Huh...? This is my house, so make yourselves at home."
NPC: You see the headlines in the Shinra Times? The terrorists that bombed the No. 1 Reactor are based somewhere in the slums. ...blowing up a Reactor... they sure put some thought into this one. They must have a real calculating leader. I wonder what they'll do next?
Barret: Stop actin' like a damn kid. Si'down an' shu'up!
Biggs: It seems this train hasn't switched to security mode yet. I'm sure that will change by tomorrow.
Biggs: ...YAWN...that sure took its toll on me. I'm gonna sleep till we get to the station.
"Wedge: Someday AVALANCHE's gonna be famous ...and me, too!"
Wedge: Cloud!! Don't ya think I got a bright future ahead of me?
"Wedge: All my life, I felt like nothin' but a sidekick. But, after joinin' AVALANCHE and tryin' to save the Planet, I feel like I can do lots of things."
"Wedge: Oh man, that's pretty harsh, Cloud. You really think I won't?"
NPC: Please!! You're bothering the other passengers.
"Jessie: Hey, Cloud. You want to look at this with me? It's a map of the Midgar Rail System. Let's look at it together. I'll explain it to you."
"Jessie: I like this kinda stuff. Bombs and monitors...you know, flashy stuff."
"Jessie: Okay, it's about to start."
"Jessie: This is a complete model of the city of Midgar. It's about a 1/10000 scale. The top plate is about 50 meters above ground. A main support structure holds the plate up in the center, and there are other support structures built in each section... psst...whisper...whisper... (The No. 1 Reactor we blew up was in the northern section.) Then there's No.2, No.3 all the way up to the No.8 Reactor. The 8 Reactors provide Midgar with electricity. Each town used to have a name, but no one in Midgar remembers them. Instead of names, we refer to them by numbered sectors. That's the kind of place this is."
"Jessie: Phew..., this is next! Look."
"Jessie: This is the route this train is on. The route spirals around the main support structure. We should be coming around the center area, right now. At each checkpoint, an ID sensor device is set up. It can check the identities and background on each and every passenger on the train by linking it up to the central data bank at Shinra headquarters. whisper...whisper... (Anyone could tell that we look suspicious, so we're using fake ID's.)"
"Jessie: Speak of the devil... That light means that we're in the ID Security Check area. ...whisper...whisper... (When the lights go off, you never know what kind of creeps'll come out.) ...anyhow, we're almost back now. That's a relief."
"Biggs: ...snore...heebeebeeheebee...snore... (Don't act so damn big, Barret...snooze...)"
Wedge: I'm seein' stars. This sucks. I hate the dark.
"Jessie: I know! Next time, I'll give you one I made myself."
"Jessie: Oh yeah, you might regret it. I'm the type who takes things personal."
"Jessie: Okay, then I'll put a little extra effort in and make it with a BANG."
"Jessie: We're almost there. After talking with you, I really want to do it! I think you've lit my fuse!"
Barret: Look...you can see the surface now. This city don't have no day or night. If that plate weren't there... we could see the sky.
Cloud: A floating city... Pretty unsettling scenery.
Barret: Huh? Never expect ta hear that outta someone like you. ...you jes' full of surprises.
"Barret: The upper world...a city on a plate... It's 'cuz of that &^#$# 'pizza', that people underneath are sufferin'! And the city below is full of polluted air. On topa that, the Reactor keeps drainin' up all the energy."
Cloud: Then why doesn't everyone move onto the Plate?
"Barret: Dunno. Probably 'cuz they ain't got no money. Or, maybe... 'Cuz they love their land, no matter how polluted it gets."
Cloud: I know... no one lives in the slums because they want to. It's like this train. It can't run anywhere except where its rails take it.
"Barret: Yo!! Get over here, all'ya!!"
"Barret: Yo, Cloud! You lissen up!"
Barret: This mission was a success. But don't get lazy now. The hard part's still to come! Don't y'all be scared of that explosion! Cause the next one's gonna be bigger than that! Meet back at the hideout!! Move out!
Barret: Ok! Go on ahead.
Barret: You! Cloud!! Get off your slow-movin' ass!!
Barret: Heh heh... You wanna meet your little baby?
Barret: Hey! Don' act like you don't know what I mean! I'm tellin' you...
Barret: Heh! Jes calm down. Can't have people suspectin' us.
Marlene: Papa!!
"Tifa: Marlene! Aren't you going to say anything to Cloud? Welcome home, Cloud. Looks like everything went well. Did you fight with Barret?"
"Tifa: I should have known. He's always pushing people around, and you've always been in fights ever since you were little. I was worried."
Tifa: Hmm. You've grown up. When you were little you used to get into fights at the drop of a hat.
On-screen: Please enter a name.
"Tifa: Flowers? How nice... You almost never see them here in the slums. But... A flower for me? Oh Cloud, you shouldn't have..."
Cloud: No big.
"Tifa: Thank you, Cloud. It smells wonderful. Maybe I should fill the store with flowers. Cloud, this one still has roots. I can probably start others from it."
Tifa: I'm so glad everyone's safe.
Biggs: Aaah!! Nothin' like that first drink after a job. Hic!! Why don't you have one too?
Biggs: What!? You tellin' me you're too good to drink with me? Don't act big-headed jus' because you were in SOLDIER!
"Biggs: Oh!! That's more like it!! Even if you were with SOLDIER, you're still a rookie here. So you'd better listen to whatever I tell ya!"
Biggs: Hic...!! Oh...... Don't tell Barret what I jus said.
"Wedge: Oh, Cloud! Tifa really knows how to cook. Mmm, mmm...... Anyway, let me tell you somethin'"
"Wedge: Tifa always lets me taste her cooking. And look at me now, I'm rolly-polly. Don't know whether I should be happy or sad. But it's the good food and drinks that make this shop famous."
Wedge: Cloud...... ......forget it.
Jessie: Careless...... You're getting all excited. Wonder what for......?
Marlene: ............
"Tifa: Sorry, Cloud. Marlene seems a little shy."
"Marlene: Papa, welcome home!"
Barret: Yeah. Huh? Where'd you get that flower?
Marlene: Cloud gave it to me.
Barret: Oh...... Did you thank him? ............
"Marlene: Thank you, Cloud. We'll take care of you."
"Tifa: You all right, Barret?"
Barret: Great!!
"Barret: Get in here, fools!! We're startin' the meetin'!!"
Tifa: Cloud... come over here.
Tifa: Sit down. How about... ...something to drink?
"Tifa: OHH!! I can make a drink just as good as anyone else. Everyone says, my drinks taste the best!"
Tifa: Just a minute. I'll make one for you.
"Tifa: You know, I'm relieved you made it back safely."
Cloud: What's with you all of a sudden? That wasn't even a tough job.
Tifa: I guess not... You were in SOLDIER. Make sure you get your pay from Barret.
"Cloud: Don't worry. Once I get that money, I'm outta here."
Tifa: Cloud. Are you feeling all right?
Cloud: ...yeah... Why?
Tifa: No reason. You just look a little tired I guess.
Tifa: You'd better go down below.
"President Shinra: .........today the No.1 Reactor was bombed. The terrorist group AVALANCHE has claimed responsibility for the bombing. It is expected that AVALANCHE will continue its reign of terror. But citizens of Midgar, there is no need to fear. I have immediately mobilized SOLDIER to protect our citizenry against this senseless violence. Thank you and good night."
Wedge: You think I'm a little too uptight?
"Wedge: The next mission will be to blow up the Sector 5 Reactor. Cloud, you're great! Don't you ever get nervous? Or are you like, impervious to feelings? Naw, that couldn't be it."
"Wedge: Well, that's ok. Don't worry about me. I don't look like it, but I'm a coward at heart."
"Jessie: Oops... Hey, look at the news... What a blast. Think it was all because of my bomb? But all I really did was just make it like the computer told me. Oh no! I must've made a miscalculation somewhere."
"Jessie: Hey, that was my bomb's debut. Makes me kinda proud."
"Barret: Yo, Cloud! There's somethin' I wanna ask ya. Was there anyone from SOLDIER fighting us today?"
Cloud: None. I'm positive.
Barret: You sound pretty sure.
Cloud: If there was anyone from SOLDIER you wouldn't be standing here now.
Barret: Don't go thinkin' you so bad jes cuz you was in SOLDIER.
Cloud: ............
"Barret: Yeah, you're strong. Probably all them guys in SOLDIER are. But don't forget that your skinny ass's workin' for AVALANCHE now! Don't get no ideas 'bout hangin' on to Shinra."
Cloud: Stayin' with Shinra? You asked me a question and I answered it...that's all.
Cloud: I'm going upstairs. I want to talk about my money.
Barret: Shucks!! ............money...
"Marlene: Papa, you're so great!"
"Tifa: Wait, Cloud!"
Barret: Tifa! Let him go! Looks like he still misses the Shinra!
Cloud: Shut up! I don't care about either Shinra or SOLDIER! But don't get me wrong! I don't care about AVALANCHE or the Planet for that matter!
"Wedge: .......Cloud. You say you don't care, but you came to talk to me. Cloud... You just want friends. Isn't that right?"
"Wedge: Yeah, well. You look kind of lonely to me. If you ever got anything you want to get off your chest, you can always talk to me."
Wedge: You're terrible. Real cold blooded.
"Jessie: Money... Oh my. It must have been for a lot of it. Sure! Well, what the hell? It's a verbal agreement. Now let me figure this out. Oh stop it, Cloud! Did you hear me?"
Tifa: Straighten things up with everyone for me.
"Tifa: Listen, Cloud. I'm asking you. Please join us."
Cloud: Sorry Tifa...
Tifa: The Planet is dying. Slowly but surely it's dying. Someone has to do something.
Cloud: So let Barret and his buddies do something about it. It's got nothin' to do with me.
Barret: You damn right we'll do something about it. N' you stay outta this Tifa!
Tifa: So! You're really leaving!? You're just going to walk right out ignoring your childhood friend!?
Cloud: What......?
"Tifa: ......You forgot the promise, too."
Cloud: Promise?
Tifa: So you DID forget.
Tifa: Remember......Cloud. It was seven years ago...
"Tifa: Look, the well. Do you remember?"
"Cloud: Yeah...back then. I thought you would never come, and I was getting a little cold."
Tifa (in flashback): Sorry I'm late. You said you wanted to talk to me about something?
Cloud (in flashback): Come this spring...I'm leaving this town for Midgar.
Tifa (in flashback): ...All boys are leaving our town.
"Cloud (in flashback): But I'm different from all of them. I'm not just going to find a job. I want to join SOLDIER. I'm going to be the best there is, just like Sephiroth!"
Tifa (in flashback): Sephiroth... The Great Sephiroth. Isn't it hard to join SOLDIER?
Cloud (in flashback): ...I probably won't be able to come back to this town for a while.
Cloud (in flashback): ...huh?
Tifa (in flashback): Will you be in the newspapers if you do well?
Cloud (in flashback): I'll try.
"Tifa (in flashback): Hey, why don't we make a promise? Umm, if you get really famous and I'm ever in a bind...... You come save me, all right?"
Cloud (in flashback): What?
"Tifa (in flashback): Whenever I'm in trouble, my hero will come and rescue me. I want to at least experience that once."
Cloud (in flashback): What?
"Cloud (in flashback): Ha, ha, ha! What's that!"
Tifa (in flashback): You're laughing at me!
Tifa (in flashback): Come on--! Promise me----!
Cloud (in flashback): All right......I promise.
"Tifa: You remember now, don't you... our promise?"
Cloud: I'm not a hero and I'm not famous. I can't keep......the promise.
"Tifa: But you got your childhood dream, didn't you? You joined SOLDIER. So come on! You've got to keep your promise......"
Barret: Wait a sec big-time SOLDIER! A promise is a promise! Here!!
"On-screen: Received Barret's stash, 1500 gil!"
Cloud: This is my pay? Don't make me laugh.
Tifa: What? Then you'll...!!
Cloud: You got the next mission lined up? I'll do it for 3000.
Barret: What......!?
"Tifa: It's ok, it's ok."
"Tifa: psst, psst...... (We're really hurting for help, right?)"
Barret: Uh......ugh...... (That money's for Marlene's schoolin'......)
Barret: 2000!
"Tifa: Thanks, Cloud."
Tifa: Good Morning! Cloud! Did you sleep well?
"Tifa: psstpsst... (keep it down, they'll hear you. Barret's always edgy before an operation.)"
Tifa: I don't know what you mean.
Tifa: I'm going this time.
Barret: Our target's the Sector 5 Reactor. Head for the station first. I'll fill you in on the train.
"Barret: Yo! Cloud! Before the next mission, I got somethin' I wanna ask you! I, uh,...... I don't really know how to use Materia! I'll give you that Materia you found. Just teach me how to use it!"
Cloud: ...sigh...
"Cloud: Sure, I'll explain how Materia works. First, access the menu. You know the basic functions. The triangle button brings up the menu. Directional buttons move the cursor, like this. Select each menu by using the OK button. If you want to leave the menu, just push the CANCEL button. See? Let's go ahead. Now you're in this menu. Select [Materia] sub menu. Select who you want to use it. Now look at my weapon here. Each weapon and armor has slots in it. Choose which slot you want to put Materia in. Now select the Materia you want to use. This is curative Materia. If you want to know what its effect is, line the cursor up with [Check], and push the OK button. It's just like selecting battle commands. Just line the cursor up to [Magic], you can see that the available magic has increased. Now you can use new magic [Cure]. And that's all there is to equipping Materia. See? It wasn't that tough! When you want to remove any Materia, it's as easy as pointing to the materia slot, and pushing the triangle button. There's just one thing you have to be careful of. Whenever you equip Materia, your situation changes. Parts of you may become stronger... while others get weaker. Normally, when you equip [Magic] Materia, your magic power will get stronger. But your physical strength weakens. So, Materia's kind of a double-edged sword. On the left side of the screen, you can see the Materia's effect on you. It's wise not to overuse Magic Materia. But try out various things. Push the CANCEL button to exit the sub menu. Ok, that's about it. I'll give you some advanced tips later."
"Barret: Shi......! What's this 'It wasn't that tough!' crap! I'm clueless...... Well, you handle the Materia then!"
"Barret: So this is what makes them guys in SOLDIER so great, huh!? Ok. I'll ask Jessie again later. But you're in charge of the Materia!"
On-screen: [Materia System] Access the menu and select [Materia] to equip Materia.
Tifa: I'm going this time.
Tifa: Cloud! I got a message from the Weapon Shop man upstairs. He has something he wants to give you. Don't forget!
"Tifa: Marlene, you watch the store while we're gone!"
Marlene: All right!! Good Luck.
Marlene: Take care!
Barret: YO! Looks like this ain't no private car!! So split up!!
"Shinra Manager: ...hoodlums again. God, don't I just have all the luck..."
Barret: You say sumthin'?
"Barret: I said, 'you say sumthin'!?"
"Barret: Yo, look at that!! It got empty alluva sudden. What's goin' on?"
"Shinra Manager: DAMN!! I...it's empty because of... g, guys like you... Y, Y, YIPES!! You...you've seen the news, right? AVALANCHE says there'll be more bombings. Only devoted employees like me would go to Midgar on a day like today."
Barret: You workin' for Shinra?
Shinra Manager: I won't give in to violence... and I'm not giving you my seat either!
Tifa: Barret!!
Barret: &$#%!! You lucky ^$#^$.!
"Cloud: So, what are we gonna do now?"
Barret: Shit! The hell you so calm about? You bustin' up my rhythm...
Tifa: Seems like they just finished connecting the cars. We're finally leaving.
Cloud: So what's our next target?
Barret: Hah! Listen to Mr. Serious-about-his-work!
"Barret: Awright...I'll tell ya! Jessie's probably already told you, but there's a security check point at the top plate. It's an ID scan system checkin' all the trains."
Tifa: Which Shinra is very proud of.
Barret: We can't use our fake ID's anymore...
"On-screen: Good Morning, and welcome to Midgar lines. Arrival time at Sector 4 Station will 11:45."
Tifa: That means we've got only three more minutes to the ID Check point.
"Barret: Alright, in three minutes, we're jumpin' off this train. Got it!?"
"Tifa: Cloud, come over here! Let's look at the Railway Map Monitor."
"Barret: Yo, Mr. know-it-all, big time SOLDIER! You oughta know the area 'round the No. 5 Reactor, right! So let's hear YOUR explanation!"
NPC: Hmmm......? You're the only ones that'll talk to me or come to my house. I'm impressed.
"Shinra Manager: Waaaaah!! Don...don't worry about me. (oh man, oh man, oh man...!! I'm gonna brag to everyone at work about this...)"
"Tifa: Hmm, it looks like you've seen this already... It's all right. Come a little closer."
Tifa: That's odd. The ID Check Point was supposed to be further down.
On-screen: Type A Security Alert!! Unidentified passengers confirmed... A search of all cars will be conducted! Repeat!! Type A Security Alert!! Unidentified passengers confirmed... A search of all cars will be conducted!
Tifa: What's happening?
Barret: What's goin' on!!
Jessie: We're in trouble. I'll explain later. Hurry! Get to the next car!
Barret: ^%#@%! Someone blew it...
On-screen: Unidentified passengers located in Car #1 Preparing for Lock Down
Barret: Let's go! Keep it up!
"On-screen: You have 15 seconds to reach next car. Reach car 5 if you want to date Tifa/Barret, or get off earlier if you want to date Aeris/Yuffie."
NPC: Hm? ... You'd talk to me even now? I'm really impressed. Let me give you a little something as a reward.
"NPC: If I die in the gutter, use that to revive me, okay?"
On-screen: Car #1: Locked Down Car being sent to the Station
"Barret: C'mon!! Hurry your slow ass up! That's it, huh?"
Tifa: Oh well...
Barret: We're gonna jump outta here!! Follow me!!
Tifa: We got a lot of battles ahead of us. This's going to be tough.
On-screen: Car #1: Locked Down Upgrading to Level 2 Warning
Biggs: Hurry!
"Wedge: They're gonna lock the door, sir!"
On-screen: Unidentified passengers located in Car #2 Preparing for Lock Down
Jessie: Just run! Changing to Plan 2!
NPC: Hey... You guys are rowdy...
"NPC: Well, just calm down."
"NPC: Gosh!! You're adults, but you're making such noise. Please behave while you're in the train."
NPC: Hyu---n!! Hyu---n!!
NPC: Does this mean that we're in a major bind?
NPC: Huh? The hell?! Do you want this?
NPC: Wow! I won't even charge you... Wha-t? Don't get used to it though.
NPC: Wha-t? Let me know when you need me.
NPC: Wha-t? You sure are greedy.
(Upon failing to reach the next car.)On-screen: Car #2: Locked Down Car being sent to the Station
Barret: What!? That's it!?
Tifa: That didn't do anything!
"Barret: We'll jump from here!! Follow me, you 'spensive leech!!"
Tifa: Phew-----! Be strong!
On-screen: Car #2: Locked down Upgrading to Warning Level 3
Barret: Awright! We clear!?
"Jessie: Not yet. They're starting another check. If we're caught, we're done for! But, don't worry. If we move up the train, car by car, we should get past it!"
On-screen: Unidentified Passengers: Moving to front of Train Currently tracking location
NPC: Hee hee!!
NPC: ...nowhere to run...
NPC: By any chance... Busted?
"NPC: Ok, then. That's that."
NPC: I'm so--- sorry. I'll give it back...
NPC: urrrrrrrg
"Johnny: Later...Goodbye...Adios, Midgar!!"
Johnny: sob...
On-screen: Car #3: Locked Down Illegal ID will be taken to the station
Barret: The hell!? So this is as far as we go...?
Tifa: We were almost there.
Barret: We're gonna jump off here!! Follow me!!
Tifa: Don't worry! Don't worry!
On-screen: Car #3: Locked Down Upgrading to Warning Level 4
NPC: Brrrrrr...... It's terrible. Who'd expect underwear bandits in this day and age? They wiped me out!
"NPC: Any idea what happened? All I know is, when I woke up the 3 of us were butt-naked! But I guess you couldn't relate..."
NPC: That scary broad made me take the bomb. Of course I couldn't very well refuse her!
On-screen: Car #4: Locked Down Illegal ID will be taken to the Station
On-screen: Car #4: Locked Down Upgrading to maximum security alert!!
Barret: All right!! We made it!
Barret: Yo!! This way!!
Barret: Let's go!! We're gonna dive outta here!!
Barret: Yo!! Ain't no time to waste!! ...do something!
Tifa: ...Scary...huh.
Cloud: Too late to be saying that now. Why'd you come along anyway?
Tifa: Because...
Barret: Hey you two! There ain't no time for that!
"Wedge: Guess who? It's me, Wedge! Looks like things were a success."
Wedge: I look just like my little brother in these clothes... I wonder how everyone's doin' now...?
"Jessie: It's me, Jessie. How do I look, Cloud? Do I look good in a Shinra uniform?"
"Cloud: ...you look great, just like a man."
Jessie: Yay!! I'm so happy ...I think?
Cloud: Just concentrate on our plan.
"Jessie: You're right, sorry."
Tifa: Yeah!! I've made up my mind! Watch closely. I'm gonna jump!!
Cloud: You don't care if I go first?
"Barret: A leader always stays till the end. Don't worry 'bout me, just go!"
Barret: Yo! Don't go gettin' your spikey-ass hurt! It's only the beginnin' of the mission!
Barret: Later! You take care of the rest!
"Barret: Oh man...... We were forced to get this far out. We can't just go back now. We've gotta go on. Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie did good. Now, it's our turn!"
"Barret: That was close. I thought we were gonna get caught... They probably don't realize that we've sneaked in yet. We should get to the reactor in no time. Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie did good. Now, it's our turn!"
"Barret: Good, so far everything's going as planned. Better not let your guard down till we get to the Sector 5 reactor. Biggs, Wedge and Jessie got everything ready for us. So MOVE it."
"Barret: Well, the reactor's just down this tunnel!"
Cloud: Shinra security guards are there. ...We've got to turn back.
Soldier: You're the AVALANCHE!
Cloud: More security's coming. It's dangerous to stay here.
Cloud: Those light beams are the Shinra's security sensors. We can't go any further.
"Cloud: After coming this far, only an amateur'd get caught by the security sensor."
"Barret: That's one damn tiny hole. You tellin' me to squeeze into that to get under the Plate? No way! Yo, Cloud, what're we gonna do?"
Tifa: ...There seems to be nothing that'll get us stuck in this duct.
"Cloud: Yeah. If we go down this duct, we won't be able to come back up here."
"Barret: Don't be wastin' time. Never know when the Shinra'll find us. Cloud, you jes' gotta go."
"Barret: But, damn man, that thing gives me the chills."
Barret: Whaddya mean we're not goin' in? There ain't no other way of gettin' to the Sector 5 reactor 'cept through here.
"Wedge: Cloud, this way. The reactor's up this ladder."
Jessie: I'm sorry. The ID scan problem on the train was all my fault. I made your ID card special...... So that's why it happened... I put my heart into making it. But I failed.
"Jessie: Next time, I'll give you something more decent. I'll be back at the hideout in my research room workin' on it."
"Biggs: We're gonna pull out now. We'll meet up at the hideout. Cloud, we're countin' on you to blow the reactor!"
Tifa (in flashback): Papa...
Tifa (in flashback): Sephiroth!?
"Tifa (in flashback): Sephiroth did this to you, didn't he!?"
Tifa (in flashback): Sephiroth...SOLDIER... Mako Reactors...Shinra...Everything! I hate them all!
"Barret: Damn man, get a hold of yourself!"
Tifa: You all right?
Cloud: ......Tifa.
Tifa: Mmm?
"Cloud: No... forget...... Come on, let's hurry!"
"Cloud: I know. You're my watch, right?"
Barret: Damn straight. Tifa's old friend... That ain't good enough.
"Tifa: Let's hurry, Cloud."
Tifa: Jessie said we all have to push the button at once.
Tifa: No good. Let's try it again.
Barret: This way!
Barret: Shinra soldiers!?
Barret: SHIT! What the hell's goin' on?
Cloud: ...a trap...
Barret: Presi...President Shinra?
Tifa: Why is the President here?
President Shinra: Hmm... So you all must be that... ...what was it?
"Barret: AVALANCHE! And don't ya forget it! And you're President Shinra, huh?"
"Cloud: Long time no see, President."
"President Shinra: ...Long time no see? Oh...you. You're the one who quit SOLDIER and joined AVALANCHE. I knew you'd been exposed to Mako, from the look in your eyes... Tell me, traitor... what was your name?"
Cloud: Cloud.
"President Shinra: Forgive me for asking, but I can't be expected to remember each person's name. Unless you become another Sephiroth."
"President Shinra: Yes, Sephiroth... He was brilliant. Perhaps too brilliant..."
Cloud: Sephiroth.......?
Barret: Don't give a damn 'bout none of that! This place's goin' up with a big BANG soon! Serves y'all right!
"President Shinra: And such a waste of good fireworks, just to get rid of vermin like you..."
"Barret: VERMIN!? That's all you can say...VERMIN! Y'all Shinra're the VERMIN, killing the planet! And that makes you King VERMIN! So shu'up jackass!"
"President Shinra: ...You are beginning to bore me. I'm a very busy man, so if you'll excuse me... I have a dinner I must attend."
Barret: Dinner!? Don't gimme that! I ain't even started wit' you yet!
"President Shinra: But, I've made arrangements for a playmate for you all."
Tifa:!? What's that noise?
Barret: The hell is this!?
"President Shinra: Meet 'Airbuster', a techno-soldier. Our Weapon Development Department created him. I'm sure the data he'll extract from your dead bodies will be of great use to us in future experiments."
Cloud: ...Techno-soldier?
"President Shinra: Now then, if you'll excuse me."
"Cloud: Wait, President!"
"Barret: Yo, Cloud! We've gotta do somethin' 'bout him!"
"Tifa: Help, Cloud!"
Tifa: THIS is from SOLDIER?
Cloud: No way! It's just a machine.
Barret: I don't care what it is!! I'm gonna bust him up!
"Barret: It's gonna blow! Let's go, Tifa!"
Tifa: Barret! Can't you do something?
Barret: Not a damn thing.
Tifa: Cloud! Please don't die! You can't die! There's still so much I want to tell you!
"Cloud: I know, Tifa......"
"Barret: Hey, you gonna be awright?"
"Cloud: ............ You worry about yourselves! I'm all right, but take care of Tifa!"
Barret: ...Alright. Sorry 'bout all this.
Cloud: Stop talkin' like this is the end!
Cloud: Shit! Can't hold on much longer. Barret......Hurry!
Barret: Don't go cryin' like a woman. There ain't nothin' I can do for ya. Ya gotta do it yourself.
Cloud: Barret...
"Barret: Alright, then, later."
Grey text: ......You all right? ......Can you hear me?
Cloud: ......Yeah......
Grey text: Back then...... You could get by with just skinned knees......
Cloud: ......What do you mean by 'back then'?
Grey text: What about now? Can you get up?
Cloud: ......What do you mean by 'that time'? ......What about now?
Grey text: ......Don't worry about me. You just worry about yourself now.
Cloud: ......I'll give it a try.
Flower girl: Oh! It moved!
Grey text: ......How about that?
Flower girl: Whew...... Am I glad.
Grey text: Take it slow now. Little by little......
"Flower girl: Hello, hello?"
Cloud: ......I know.
Cloud: Hey...who are you?
"Flower girl: Hello, hello!"
Flower girl: You okay? This is a church in the Sector 5 slums. It suddenly fell on top of me. It really gave me a scare.
Cloud: ......I came crashing down?
Flower girl: The roof and the flower bed must have broken your fall. You're lucky.
Cloud: Flower bed......is this yours?
Cloud: Sorry about that.
"Flower girl: That's all right. The flowers here are quite resilient because this is a sacred place. They say you can't grow grass and flowers in Midgar. But for some reason, the flowers have no trouble blooming here. I love it here."
"Flower girl: ......So, we meet again. ......Don't you remember me?"
"Cloud: Yeah, I remember..."
Flower girl: Oh! I'm so happy!
Flower girl: Thanks for buying my flowers.
"Flower girl: You didn't buy any flowers from me though. Well, that's okay."
"Flower girl: Excuse me, but that's really rude!"
"Flower girl: But I'll forgive you, because you bought flowers from me."
"Flower girl: I don't remember a thing. Well, that's okay."
Flower girl: ......I guess you don't remember. You were walking in a daze.
"Flower girl: But I'll forgive you, because you bought flowers from me."
"Flower girl: Well, that's okay."
"Flower girl: Say, do you have any materia?"
"Cloud: Yes, some. Nowadays you can find materia anywhere."
Flower girl: But mine is special. It's good for absolutely nothing.
Cloud: ......good for nothing? You probably just don't know how to use it.
"Flower girl: No, I do...... it just doesn't do anything. I feel safe just having it. It was my mother's...... Say, I feel like talking. Do you feel up to it? After all, here we are meeting again, right?"
Flower girl: Wait here. I've got to check my flowers. It'll just be a minute.
"Flower girl: ......oh, I see. Ahhh. I wonder whose fault that is. It takes a lot to grow them, you know. Poor flowers."
"Flower girl: Just a little longer. Oh! Now that you mention it...... We don't know each other's names, do we? My name is......"
"Aeris: I'm Aeris, the flower girl. Nice to meet you."
Cloud: The name's Cloud. Me......? I do a little bit of everything.
Aeris: Oh...... a jack of all trades.
"Cloud: Yeah, I do whatever's needed."
Cloud: What's so funny? What are you laughing at?
Aeris: Sorry......I just
"Aeris: Sorry, bad timing on my part."
Aeris: Cloud! Don't let it get to you!
Reno: Don't worry about me.
"Aeris: Say, Cloud. Have you ever been a bodyguard?"
"Aeris: You DO do everything, right?"
"Cloud: ......Yeah, that's right."
"Aeris: Then, get me out of here. Take me home."
"Cloud: OK, I'll do it... but it'll cost you."
"Aeris: Well then, let's see......"
Aeris: How about if I go out with you once?
"Cloud: I don't know who you are, but......"
Cloud: You don't know me......?
On-screen: ......I know you.
Cloud: Oh yeah......I know you.
Cloud: that uniform......
"Soldier: ...... Hey sis, this one's a little weird."
Cloud: Shut up! You Shinra spy!
Soldier: Reno! Want him taken out?
Reno: I haven't decided yet.
Aeris: Don't fight here! You'll ruin the flowers!
Aeris: The exit is back there.
Reno: They were......Mako eyes.
"Reno: Yeah, all right. Back to work, back to work."
Reno: Oh! And don't step on the flowers......
"Reno: There they are, over there!"
Aeris: Cloud...that one!
Cloud: I know. Looks like they aren't going to let us go.
Aeris: What should we do?
"Cloud: Well we can't let them catch us, can we? Then, there's only one thing left."
Cloud: Aeris! This way!
Cloud: All right. I'll hold them off.
Aeris: Right. Make sure they don't get through!
Reno: The Ancient is getting away! Attack! Attack! Attack!
Aeris: Eaygh!!
Cloud: Aeris!
"Reno: Think we killed 'em? They shouldn't have put up a fight, I say!"
"Aeris: Cloud, help!"
Cloud: Damn! What's that......?
Cloud: Aeris!
"Aeris: A, all right."
Cloud: Here's a barrel. If I can just push it over......
On-screen: Push the barrel?
Soldier: Guuagh!
"Aeris: Thanks, Cloud."
"Aeris: Oh, Cloud what are you doing!?"
Aeris: Eaygh!!
Cloud: Aeris!
Soldier: The Ancient! We got her!
"Aeris: Whew, that surprised me."
"(At the start of the third wave.)Aeris: Cloud, help!"
Cloud: Aeris!
"Cloud: Aeris, this way."
"Aeris: Cloud, hurry."
"Aeris: We'll get outside through the hole in the roof. Jump off that beam, and we should be able to make it through to the roof."
"Aeris: Ha, ha...... They're looking for me again."
Cloud: You mean it's not the first time they've been after you?
Aeris: ...no.
Cloud: They're the Turks.
Aeris: Hmmm......
Cloud: The Turks are an organization in Shinra. They scout for possible candidates for SOLDIER.
Aeris: This violently? I thought they were kidnapping someone.
"Cloud: They're also involved in a lot of dirty stuff on the side. Spying, murder...you know."
Aeris: They look like it.
"Cloud: But, why're they after you? There must be a reason, right?"
"Aeris: No, not really. I think they believe I have what it takes to be in SOLDIER!"
Cloud: Maybe you do. You want to join?
Aeris: I don't know... But I don't want to get caught by THOSE people!
"Cloud: Then, let's go!"
"Aeris: Wait... Wait, I said!"
Aeris: Puff... wheeze...Slow......down... Don't leave me......
Cloud: Funny... I thought you were cut out to be in SOLDIER?
Aeris: Oh! You're terrible!
Aeris: Hey......Cloud. Were you...ever in SOLDIER?
Cloud: ......
Cloud: ...I used to be. How did you guess?
Aeris: ...Your eyes. They have a strange glow...
"Cloud: That's the sign of those who have been infused with Mako... A mark of SOLDIER. But, how did you know about that?"
"Aeris: ......Oh, nothing."
Cloud: Nothing...?
"Aeris: Right, nothing!"
"Aeris: Come on, let's go! Bodyguard!"
Aeris: Whew! Finally made it off! Now what...
Aeris: My house is over here. Hurry before he comes.
"Aeris: I'm home, mom."
Aeris: This is Cloud. My bodyguard.
Elmyra: Bodyguard......? You mean you were followed again!?
"Elmyra: Are you all right!? You're not hurt, are you!?"
Aeris: I'm all right. I had Cloud with me.
"Elmyra: Thank you, Cloud."
Aeris: So what are you going to do now?
Cloud: ...Is Sector 7 far from here? I want to go to Tifa's bar.
Aeris: Is Tifa......a girl?
Cloud: Yeah.
Aeris: A girl...friend?
Cloud: Girlfriend?
Aeris: Hee hee hee...... You don't have to get THAT upset...
"Aeris: Oh, how nice."
"Aeris: Well, that's...nice. Let's see, Sector 7? I'll show you the way."
Cloud: You gotta be kidding. Why do you want to put yourself in danger again?
Aeris: I'm used to it.
Cloud: Used to it!?
"Cloud: ......Well, don't know... getting help from a girl..."
Aeris: A girl!! What do you mean by that!?
"Aeris: You expect me to just sit by and listen, after hearing you say something like that!?"
Aeris: Mom! I'm taking Cloud to Sector 7. I'll be back in a while.
"Elmyra: But dear...I give up. You never listen once you've made up your mind. But if you must go,why don't you go tomorrow? It's getting late now."
"Aeris: Yeah, you're right, mom."
"Elmyra: Aeris, please go and make the bed."
"Elmyra: That glow in your eyes... you're from SOLDIER, right?"
Cloud: Yeah. Rather I used to be...
"Elmyra: ...... I don't know how to say this, but...Would you please leave here, tonight? Without telling Aeris."
Elmyra: SOLDIER...the last thing Aeris needs is to get her feelings hurt again...
Aeris: You need to go through Sector 6 to get to Sector 7. Sector 6 is a little dangerous so you'd better get some rest tonight.
Aeris: Cloud... Good night.
"Cloud: Oh, man..."
Grey text: ...seem pretty tired......
Cloud (in flashback): .........!?
Grey text: I haven't slept in a bed like this ...in a long time.
"Cloud (in flashback): ...Oh, yeah."
Grey text: Ever since that time.
"Cloud's mother: My, how you've grown. I'll bet the girls never leave you alone."
Cloud (in flashback): ...Not really.
Cloud's mother: ...I'm worried about you. There are a lot of temptations in the city... I'd feel a lot better if you just settled down and had a nice girlfriend.
Cloud (in flashback): ...I'm all right.
"Cloud's mother: You should have... an older girlfriend, one that'll take care of you. I think that would be the perfect type for you."
Cloud (in flashback): ......I'm not interested.
Cloud: ...I must've fallen asleep.
Cloud: Sector 7's past Sector 6... I should be all right by myself...
Aeris: Cloud! I thought the Turks came back! Get some rest!
Cloud: Can't get caught this time...
Cloud: Through Sector 6 to get to Sector 7. I should be able to do it alone...
Aeris: You're up bright and early.
Cloud: How could I ask you to go along when I knew it would be dangerous?
Aeris: Are you done?
Aeris: You have to go through the slum in Sector 6 to get to Tifa's 7th Heaven. I'll take you there. Come on!
Aeris: The gate to Sector 7's in there.
Cloud: Thanks. I guess this is goodbye. You gonna be all right going home?
Aeris: Oh no! 'What ever will I do!?' ...isn't that what you want me to say?
Aeris: Isn't that a little out of the way?
"Cloud: Yeah, I guess so."
Aeris: I could do that. But won't I be in your way?
Cloud: What do you mean in the way?
Aeris: Nothing!
Aeris: Can we take a break?
Aeris: I can't believe it's still here.
"Aeris: Cloud, over here!"
Aeris: What rank were you?
Cloud: Rank?
"Aeris: You know, in SOLDIER."
"Cloud: Oh, I was... First Class."
Aeris: Just the same as him.
Cloud: The same as who?
Aeris: My first boyfriend.
Cloud: You were...serious?
Aeris: No. But I liked him for a while.
Cloud: I probably knew him. What was his name?
Aeris: It doesn't really matter.
"Cloud: Huh? Hey, back there......"
Cloud: Tifa!?
Aeris: That girl in the cart was Tifa? Where was she going? She looked kind of odd...
Cloud: Wait! I'll go on alone! You go home!
Aeris: This place is scary in a lot of ways. Especially for a girl. So we've got to find Tifa fast.
"Aeris: This is Don Corneo's mansion. He's a big shot here in Wall Market. Listen, the Don's not interested in men. So just get the hell outta here."
"NPC: Welcome!! Even unpopular dweebs, like you may meet their destiny here!! You looking for a girlfriend too?"
"NPC: Hey, you're pretty fast. Tifa's our newest girl. But, unfortunately, she's having an interview right now. Here at the Honey Bee Inn, it's customary for all the new girls to be taken to Don Corneo's mansion. Don Corneo's a famous dilettante. Now he wants to settle down and is in the market for a bride."
NPC: Hmm...Seems to like it just fine. Good for you.
"Guard: This is the mansion of Don Corneo, the most powerful man in Wall Market. Look, the Don's not into men. So don't let me catch you around here again..."
"Guard: Hey, and you got another cute one with you!"
"Aeris: Hey, this look's like the Don's mansion. I'll go take a look. I'll tell Tifa about you."
Cloud: No!! You can't!!
Aeris: Why?
"Cloud: You DO know...what kind of... place this is, don't you?"
Aeris: Then what am I supposed to do? You want to go in with me?
"Cloud: Well being a man, that'll be pretty hard. Besides if I bust in there, it'll cause too much commotion. But, I just can't let you go in alone... Oh, man......"
Cloud: First...we need to find out if Tifa's alright...
"Cloud: What's so funny, Aeris?"
"Aeris: Cloud, why don't you dress up like a girl? It's the only way."
Cloud: WHAT!?
Aeris: Just wait. I've got a cute friend I want to bring.
Cloud: Aeris! I can't......
"Aeris: You ARE worried about Tifa, aren't you? Then come on, hurry!"
"Guard: A friend, huh...? Sounds pretty good to me. That'll make the Don happy, too. Who knows, maybe I can......heeee, hee hee."
Aeris: Excuse me! I'd like to get a dress.
"Clerk: Umm, it might take a little time. Will that be all right?"
Aeris: What's the problem?
"Clerk: Well, my father, the owner, has been in a slump lately. You see, he makes all the dresses."
"Aeris: And, where is your father?"
Clerk: He's probably plastered at the bar.
Aeris: So... You're saying we can't get a dress unless we do something about your father?
"Clerk: Yes, I'm sorry. He's caused so much trouble.! You'd help me bring him back?"
"Aeris: Well, if we don't do something, we don't get a dress, right?"
Clerk: Really!? Please help my crazy old dad. I just don't know what to do anymore...
"Aeris: All right, we'll do something. Let's go, Cloud!"
Clerk: So how did it go?
Cloud: We couldn't find him yet.
"Aeris: Excuse us, are you the father of the girl at the Clothing Store?"
Owner: I own the Clothes Shop... but I ain't your father.
Aeris: I didn't say that......
Cloud: Make me some clothes.
Owner: I don't make men's clothes. And I don't feel like makin' anything right now.
"Aeris: Cloud, you wait over there for a second. I'll try and (Upon talking to him."
Owner: Why don't you go over there and have something to drink.
"Aeris: You know, Mister. He always said that just once, he'd like to dress up like a girl. So, that's why I wanted a cute dress for him..."
Owner: What!? A tough lookin guy like that?
"Aeris: So, how 'bout it? Will you make him one?"
Owner: ...might be interesting. I was gettin' a little bored just makin' regular clothes.
Aeris: Then you'll do it for us?
"Owner: Yeah, all right. What kind of dress you want?"
Aeris: Something...
Aeris: And something...
"Owner: Hmm, got it. Y'know I got a friend that has the same taste as him. I'll go (Upon talking to him."
"Owner: Hey, hold on. Wait till I get an image in my head. Gulp...ummm, that's good."
Clerk: Looks like everything went well. He's been making the dress ever since he came back.
"Owner: Oh, you're here. It's ready. Go try it on."
"On-screen: Received Key Item ""Cotton Dress""!"
"On-screen: Received Key Item ""Satin Dress""!"
"On-screen: Received Key Item ""Silk Dress""!"
Cloud: How......do you put this on?
Cloud: Whoa! What are you doing!
Aeris: It's still not right. A wig! That's what you need!
"Owner: Umm, I thought you might, so I talked to my friend about getting one. You know the gym? You'll find a lot of people there like you. Go and (Upon talking to them."
"Cloud: ...'like you'? Aeris, what did you tell him?"
"Aeris: Does it matter? Anyhow, we got a pretty dress!"
Clerk: So? Were you able to get the wig?
"Owner: So, how was it? Were you able to see him?"
NPC 1: You the one...... Who wants to be cute?
Cloud: Cute?
Aeris: Right. And about the wig...
"NPC 1: Yeah, I heard. But it'll cost ya."
NPC 2: Urrrrgh!!! Big Bro!! The only way you're gonna get cuter is if you can beat Big Bro!!
"NPCs: That's right! So, you've got to compete with us!"
NPC 2: You're right. Let's do squats.
NPC 3: All right! We'll beat you out of this gym!

Aeris: THE beautiful Bro?
"NPC 1: What? You didn't know? Always running around here sayin' Big Bro' this, Big Bro' that... Never mind that, come over here. No, I'll explain the rules. From the ready position, push"
NPC 1: Then I'll explain it again.

What kinda place is that to hide it in!? Uuuuhh, Bro's fists of steel cut to the bone! Sorry...you should still be able to use it if you disinfect it first."
NPC 1: Good job. Here's a hand-me-down.
"NPC 2: Hey, Bro I...I was supposed to get that."
"NPC 1: Shut up! You have no room to talk, tying with a beginner like him!!"
"NPC 2: Uuuuhh, Bro's fists of steel cut to the bone!"
"NPC 1: You're really something. Okay, I'm a man of my word, here you are."
NPC 2: Big Bro I'm so mad I'm so so so---mad!
"NPC 1: Shut up! Don't cry, just because you lost!"
"NPC 2: Uuuuhh, Bro's fists of steel cut to the bone!"
NPC 1: Take care of it.
NPCs: Big Bro Get a hold of yourself.
NPC: Hey man. Got a minute? I need to talk...man to man.

On-screen: The Group Room
On-screen: The &$#% Room
"NPC: Paste, paste, paste... (Oh God...here's another one of those guys. You know, the delicate type. Just ignore him, just ignore him.)"
"NPC: Fluff, fluff, fluff... (Hmm...! I guess he doesn't realize his position. I feel sorry for him. Just ignore him, just ignore him.)"
"NPC: Pita, pita, pita... (God, what a pest! All right, get out of here! You dog...) (That's it, I'll name him 'pooch'.)"
"NPC: Mix, mix, mix...... (What should I do... Is he following me? Really? What if he follows me home...?) (Poochy'll do it, I'm sure of it...)"
"NPC: Shake, shake, shake... (You think he's after me? Really? This guy makes me sick... And his eyes are weird too...) (Yeah, don't hurt these guys' feelings. Let's at least say 'hi' to him.)"

Cloud: ............
Cloud: ......Wooo...ow!!
On-screen: Use directional buttons to look around
Cloud: Looks like it's unoccupied.
Cloud: ............
Cloud: I'll take this room.
"NPC: All right. Now all we have to do is enter the room. You're not going to have a change of heart, are you?"
"NPC: Oh, don't be angry with me... (Geez...this one's probably the violent type...) All right, please."
NPC: There you are. Enjoy yourself (You moody creepo!)
Cloud: I wonder if they'd change it if I asked.
Cloud: I've changed my mind... ......I want to change rooms.
"NPC: Oh, yes sir. (So indecisive...) All right, please."
Cloud: Hmm......? You......? What are you doing in a place like this?
NPC: That's what I want to ask you. Should you be foolin' around here? You think problems will just go away just thinkin' about them? Oh no! Help! Someone...! Hurry! You can't change anything by just sitting back and looking at it.
Cloud: What are you saying?

"On-screen: Received Key Item ""Lingerie""!"
"Cloud: What, this rag? For me!? I just don't get it."
"NPC: This way, please."
"NPC: Shall we begin? I guess since you chose this room, that would mean you... Hate being lonely?"
Cloud: I'm always alone.
Cloud: I don't want to talk right now.
"NPC: All right, all right. (...geez, you're so moody!) Come on, everyone's waiting."
"NPC: Here they are. All right, everyone."

"Mukki: How is it, bubby!? Feels good, huh?"
Cloud: I don't feel good. Let me out...
Cloud: Too stuffy in here...
Mukki: You'll get used to it. Try counting to ten.
Cloud: Ten... Nine...
"Mukki: Hey bubby, how old are you?"
Cloud: Eight... Twenty one...
"Mukki: You're less than half my age. I'm so jealous. So how 'bout it...? Do you wanna join my ""Young bubby's"" group?"
Cloud: Seven... Six... Maybe in another life.
"Cloud: Seven... Six... Not to be rude or anything, but could you go do someone else?"
"Mukki: Well, if that's how you feel...too bad. We have a trip planned at a cabin out in the country."
"Cloud: Five... Four... Three... Two... One... Alright, that's ten. I'm gettin' out."
Mukki: Why don't you stick around and play a bit? Daddy's so lonely...
Mukki: Bubby!! This is important to me. Here's a memento of our time together!
"On-screen: Received Key Item ""Bikini briefs""!"
Mukki: Hope we meet again!
"Cloud: This is SOME underwear... I'm supposed to wear this...? Well, if it's to save Tifa... I guess there's no way around."
Cloud: ............
Cloud: If I were to dress up like a woman... Then I've got to really prepare carefully. Seems like I could put makeup on here.
Cloud: I have a favor to ask of you. Can you put makeup on me too?
"NPC: ...paste, paste, paste...... Oh...my......"
NPC: ...............oh my......
"NPC: OK, b-y-e!"

Aeris: Hey!! Cloud!!
"NPC: I bought some pretty flowers from Aeris. 500 gil, a little expensive. Well, at least I got her name."
"NPC: Uuuuuuh! I want flowers too! But, I get so nervous in front of cute girls... It just seems natural to get cautious..."
"Owner: Looks like you're all set. Now try it on, and let's see how it fits."
Clerk: Looks like you got it. So try it on for size.
Aeris: Aren't you going to change?
"Owner: Hmm, not bad. This may be a new business for me."
"Clerk: Yeah, you're right. Should we try it? Thanks for showing us something new. My father's got his motivation back now, So the dress is on the house."
Aeris: Walk more nicely like...this. Miss Cloud.
Cloud: ...What do you mean 'nicely'?
"Aeris: Oh you're so cute, Miss Cloud."
"Aeris: Aaah, I want one. Do you have one that'll look good on me too?"
Clerk: How's this?
Owner: How about that one?
"Clerk: Father, what are you talking about? This one's much better."
"Owner: No, what are you saying? This one."
Aeris: ...I want THIS one.
Clerk: Huh?
Owner: Huh?
Aeris: I'm going to go change.
Aeris: ......No peeking!
Aeris: So? How do I look?
"Aeris: Oh, you're no fun!"
"Owner: Hmm, good. It looks good on you."
Owner: ...Hmm. It's REALLY somethin'.
"Cloud: What's wrong, Aeris?"
"Aeris: ...What is it? Are you going outside like that? I mean, that's okay with me, but..."
"Cloud: ...Oh, yeah."
"Aeris: Get a hold of yourself, Ms. Cloud."
"NPC: Yeow!! Hey, Princess!!"
"NPC: Ummm, not quite there."
"NPC: Ehhhh, so so."
"NPC: Hmm, pretty good."
"Guard: Damn!! Your friend's hot, too! Come in, come in!! Two ladies coming through!!"
"NPC: Hey, ladies. I'll go and let the Don know you're here. Wait here. Don't go wandering around..."
Aeris: Now's our chance. Let's find Tifa.
Aeris: I wonder where she is...
On-screen: Closed...
On-screen: Office of The Don Corneo Keep Out!
Aeris: ...Tifa?
Aeris: Nice to meet you. I'm Aeris. Cloud's told me a lot about you.
Tifa: ...And you are? Hey you're the one with Cloud in the park...
"Aeris: Right, with Cloud."
Tifa: Oh......
Aeris: Don't worry. We just met. It's nothing.
"Tifa: What do you mean, 'Don't worry'...about what?"
"Tifa: No, don't misunderstand. Cloud and I grew up together. Nothing more."
"Aeris: Poor Cloud, having to stand here and listen to both of us call him nothing."
"Aeris: Right, Cloud?"
Tifa: Cloud?
"Aeris: Embarrassed? Come on, speak up!"
Tifa: Cloud!?
"Tifa: Why are you dressed like that!? And what are you doing here!? Forget that, what happened to you after the fall!? Are you hurt!?"
"Cloud: Hey, give me a chance to answer."
Cloud: I'm dressed like this...... because there was no other way to get in here.
Cloud: I'm all right. Aeris helped me out.
"Tifa: Oh, Aeris did..."
"Cloud: Tifa, explain. What are you doing in a place like this?"
"Tifa: Yeah, ummm......"
Aeris: Ahem!! I'll just plug my ears.
"Aeris: Please, go on with your private conversation."
"Aeris: Hey, what's the secret?"
Tifa: ...I'm glad you're OK.
Cloud: Thanks. What happened?
"Tifa: When we got back from the Number 5 reactor, there was this weird man. So Barret caught him and squeezed some information out of him."
Cloud: That's when the Don's name popped up.
"Tifa: Right, Don Corneo. Barret told me to leave the lech alone... But something's been bothering me."
Cloud: I see. So you wanted to get the story straight from Corneo's mouth.
"Tifa: So I made it here, but now I'm in a bind. Corneo is looking for a bride. Everyday, he gets three girls, chooses one of them, and then... ...and, well...... Anyway, I have to be the girl ...or I'm out for tonight."
"Aeris: Sorry...but I overheard... If you know the three girls, there's no problem, right?"
"Tifa: I guess so, but..."
"Aeris: We have two here, right?"
"Cloud: No, Aeris! I can't have you get involved."
Aeris: Oh? So it's all right for Tifa to be in danger?
"Cloud: No, I don't want Tifa in..."
Tifa: Is it all right?
Aeris: I grew up in the slums... I'm used to danger. Do you trust me?
"Tifa: Yes. Thanks, Ms. Aeris."
Aeris: Call me Aeris.
"NPC: He---y!! It's time, ladies. The Don is waiting! I told you not to wander around... I tell ya, women nowadays... Hurry up, will ya!"
Cloud: I probably don't need to ask but the other girl is...... Me......right?
"Tifa: You're right, there was no need..."
Aeris: ...to ask.
"Tifa: Ha ha...You know, if you look closely, you're not so bad... I wonder what Barret would say if he could see you now..."
Aeris: They're going to get suspicious if we don't hurry.
NPC: The Don's waiting in his room... Ha ha ha...
"Kotch: All right, ladies! Line up in front of the Don!"
"Don Corneo: Hmmm! Good, splendid! Now, let's see... Which girl should I choose? Hmm---hmm---!"
Don Corneo: This one?
Don Corneo: Or this one?
"Don Corneo: Woo-hoo, I've made up my mind!! My choice for tonight is......"
Don Corneo: This little beauty!
"Tifa: Fu, fu, fu... Be nice, Don."
Don Corneo: This slender little girl!
"Aeris: Don, you've got great taste."
Don Corneo: This healthy-looking girl!
"Cloud: Wa, wait a sec! I mean, uh, please wait a moment!"
Don Corneo: Woo-hoo! I love chickies who play hard-to-get! Yeowza!
Don Corneo: You can have the other ones!
"NPCs: Yes, sir! Thank you sir!"
"Don Corneo: Well then, shall we go my pretty!?"
Scotch: Hey guys! We've got guests. We'll take REAL good care of you.
"Scotch: This is all thanks to the big boss, Don Corneo! Heeey!! Three cheers for Don Corneo!!"
"Scotch: Heh, heh... Well ladies, are we, uh, all ready?"
Scotch: ...leer...snicker...
"NPC: Whoa! Slow down, what's the hurry? Why don't you stick around... We'll treat you real nice!"
"NPC: Come on, dance with me, beautiful. They say if two people dance together, their hearts will become one, also..."
"NPC: Hey...you're in pretty good shape. Lookit your tight little bod...... No, it's more like...muscles..."
"NPC: Oh your eyes. They seem to...glow. I'm all yours, baby!"
"NPC: Come on, baby! Woo-hoo! I gots ants in my pants wanna do a dance, gotta take a chance and mebbe find romance!"
Scotch: Hey...what's wrong? You want me to keep you company?
"Cloud: No...I'm flattered, but no thanks. Because..."
Scotch: Because......?
Cloud: Because... I ain't INTERESTED in a buncha scrubs like you!!
Scotch: Wha...a MAN!??? God damn it! You think you can get away with this! Get him! Knock the crap out of him!!
"Scotch: Grr! C'mon, what's the matter with you good for nothings!? All right now, COME ON! I'll show you how it's done!!"
Aeris: No---!! Help!!
Aeris: No---!!
"Kotch: Ha ha ha... Wait, you...!"
Aeris: I'm so sorry!!
"Kotch: oh, oh, oh......"
"Kotch: heh, heh, heh!!"
Cloud: Aeris!!
"Aeris: I told you. I'm used to danger. To tell you the truth, my heart was pounding!"
"Aeris: Ye...yes, you're right... ......let's hurry!"
Kotch: C'mon...just once... I won't tell...I promise! I just wanted to act like I got a a cute girl... Cute!!
Tifa: Cloud!!
Cloud: Tifa!!
"Tifa: Of course! If you take me lightly, you're gonna pay for it!!"
"Tifa: Hey, don't you even care about how I am? ......never mind, let's go!"
"Don Corneo: Woo-hoo! Come, come, don't be so shy..."
"Tifa: I know...... But you know, Don Corneo, I'd like you to explain something before we start..."
"Don Corneo: Hm? Oh, you mean about THAT? Don't worry. I'm single. There, feel better now?"
"Tifa: No...I'm not asking about that...... Wa...wait a minute! No, not yet!!"
Tifa: Cloud!!
Aeris: Ye...yes... But Mr. Don. I'd like you to explain something to me first...
"Don Corneo: Of course, my dear. I'll take you through it slowly, step by step. So come on!"
"Aeris: No, that's not what I meant! NO, STOP! Just, just wait a second!!"
Don Corneo: Come! Come! Aoooooooh!! I can't wait any longer! Here comes papa!!
Aeris: Cloud!!
Don Corneo: Wha...what the hell? Who goes there!?
"Tifa: You still don't get it do you, Don Corneo?"
"Aeris: I'm sorry, Don."
Don Corneo: Get what?
"Don Corneo: Ahh, we're finally alone... All right, pussycat... Come to daddy!!"
Don Corneo: Woo-hoo! Don't be shy. We're all alone now...
"Don Corneo: You're so cute, I never get tired of looking at you. Do you...like me, too?"
"Don Corneo: You sure do know how to make a guy feel good! Then, wh...what do you want to DO?"
"Don Corneo: Oh man! I can't stand it! All right, then...... Give me a kiss!! A KISS!!"
On-screen: Ju---st a minute!!
Don Corneo: Wha...what the hell? Who goes there!?
Tifa: Cloud... Were you really......
Don Corneo: A man!? What's goin' on?
Don Corneo: Why? WHY? WHY?
Cloud: Because...
Cloud: Because I'm gonna have to use that mouth of yours to give me some information!!
Don Corneo: A man!? You tricked me!! Somebody get in here NOW!!
"Tifa: Unfortunately, no one'll be comin' to help."
Don Corneo: You're the ones from before! Wh...what the hell's going on?
"Don Corneo: You don't like me? There...there isn't someone else, is there?"
Don Corneo: No way! Hmm? Barret? That sounds familiar...
"Cloud: You know, he's one of the ones you were trying to find out about. You know,AVALANCHE...?"
"Don Corneo: Oh, yeah, yeah. In Sector 7 in the slum..."
Don Corneo: ...and how do YOU know that!?
Don Corneo: A man!? You tricked me!! Somebody get in here NOW!!
"Tifa: Unfortunately, no one'll be comin' to help."
Don Corneo: You're the ones from before! Wh...what the hell's going on?
"Tifa: Shut up, we're asking the questions now..."
Tifa: What did your assistants find out? Talk! If you don't tell us...
Cloud: ...I'll chop them off.
Don Corneo: No! Not that! I'll talk! I'll tell you everything!
Tifa: So...talk.
Don Corneo: ...I made 'em find out where the man with the gun-arm was. But that's what I was ordered to do.
Tifa: By who?
"Don Corneo: No--! If I told you that, I'd be killed!"
Tifa: Talk! If you don't tell us...
Aeris: ...I'll rip them off.
"Don Corneo: Waaaaaaaaaaah--! It was Heidegger of Shinra! Heidegger, the head of Public Safety Maintenance!"
Cloud: The head of Public Safety Maintenance!?
Tifa: Did you say the Shinra!? What are they up to!? Talk! If you don't tell us...
Tifa: ...I'll smash them.
"Don Corneo: ...You're serious, aren't you... ...ohboy, ohbooy, ohboy. ...I'm not fooling around here either, you know. Shinra's trying to crush a small rebel group called AVALANCHE, and want to infiltrate their hideout. And they're really going to crush them...literally, By breaking the support holding up the plate above them."
Tifa: Break the support!?
Don Corneo: You know what's going to happen? The plate'll go PING and everything's gonna go BAMMM!! I heard their hideout's in the Sector 7 Slums... I'm just glad it's not here in Sector 6.
Tifa: They're going to wipe out the Sector 7 Slums!?
"Tifa: Cloud, will you come with me to Sector 7?"
"Cloud: Of course, Tifa."
Don Corneo: Just a second!
Cloud: Shut up!
"Don Corneo: No wait, it'll only take a second. How do you think scum like me feels when they babble on about the truth?"
Don Corneo: Buuzzzzz! Wrong!
Don Corneo: Woo-hoo! Right!
"Don Corneo: Close, but no cigar!"
President Shinra: How are the preparations going?
"Heidegger: Ha, ha, ha!! Smoothly, very smoothly! I assigned the Turks to this."
Reeve: President!! Are we really going to do this? Simply destroy a group with only a few members...
"President Shinra: What's the problem, Reeve? You want out?"
"Reeve: ...No. But, as head of the Urban Development Department, I have been involved in the building and running of Midgar. That's why..."
"Heidegger: Reeve, you should flush those personal problems in the morning!"
Reeve: The Mayor's against this anyway...
Heidegger: Mayor? He just sits in this building all day feeding his face! You still call that a Mayor?
Heidegger: Now if you'll excuse me sir!
President Shinra: You're tired. Why don't you take a couple of days off and go somewhere.
"President Shinra: We'll destroy Sector 7 and report that AVALANCHE did it. Then we'll send in the rescue operation care of Shinra, Inc.... Heh, heh, heh...this is perfect."
Cloud: You alright?
Aeris: Yeah.
Tifa: Man! This is terrible.
"Aeris: Well, the worst is over..."
Aeris: Maybe not...
Tifa: It's too late...... Marlene...Barret ...the people of the Slums.
"Aeris: Don't give up, never give up hope. It's not easy to destroy the pillar, right?"
Tifa: .........Yeah......you're right! We still have time.
Cloud: Aeris. I got you mixed up in all of this...
Aeris: Don't tell me to go home.
"Tifa: Let's see...If we can just get past the trains that are lit up, we should be able to get out of here."
Tifa: We made it! The pillar's standing!
Cloud: Wait! You hear something......above us?
Aeris: ......gun fire?
Cloud: Wedge!! You all right!?
"Wedge: .......Cloud...... You remembered......my name. Barret's up top. ...help him...... An' Cloud... Sorry, I wasn't any help."
Cloud: I'm going up!
Cloud: Aeris! You look after Wedge.
"Tifa: Aeris, do me a favor. I have a bar called '7th Heaven' in this neighborhood. There's a little girl named Marlene there......"
Aeris: Don't worry. I'll put her somewhere safe.
"Tifa: It's dangerous here! Everyone get away from the pillar, quickly! Everyone get out of Sector 7!"
"Tifa: Cloud!! You've gotta go now, or Barret's..."
Aeris: Don't worry. You let me handle this.
Biggs: Cloud... so you don't care...what happens... to the...Planet?
"Biggs: Hmph...you haven't changed. Oh, forget it."
"Biggs: Thanks, Cloud. ...don't worry 'bout me...... Barret's...fighting up there. Go help him..."
Jessie: ...Cloud... I'm glad......I could talk with you...one last time.
Jessie: That's...all right... Because...of our actions...many......people died...... this probably......is our punishment...
Jessie: ...Is...that so......? Ha......cool......as usual... ex-...SOLDIER. ...always...I liked that...in you...
Barret: Tifa! Cloud! You came! Be careful! They're attacking from the helicopter.
Tifa: Better equip ourselves before they attack in full force!
On-screen: Press the (MENU) button to access the Menu. Press the (OK)button when finished.
Tifa: Here they come!
Reno: You're too late. Once I push this button...
"Reno: That's all, folks! Mission accomplished."
Tifa: We have to disarm it! Cloud! Barret! Please!
Reno: I can't have you do that. No one get in the way of Reno and the Turks...
Reno: Try and break it if you can.
Reno: It's time.
Barret: DAMN! It's a time bomb!
Tifa: Cloud! I don't know how to stop this. Try it!
Cloud: ...It's not a normal time bomb.
Tseng: That's right. You'll have a hard time disarming that one. It'll blow the second some stupid jerk touches it.
"Tifa: Please, stop it!"
Tseng: Ha ha ha...... Only a Shinra Executive can set up or disarm the Emergency Plate Release System.
Barret: Shut yer hole!
Tseng: I wouldn't try that...... You just might make me injure our special guest.
Tifa: Aeris!!
"Tseng: Oh, you know each other?"
Tseng: How nice you could see each other one last time. You should thank me.
Cloud: What are you gonna do with Aeris!?
Tseng: I haven't decided. Our orders were to find and catch the last remaining Ancient.
"Tseng: It's taken us a long time, but now I can finally report this to the President."
"Aeris: Tifa, don't worry! She's all right!"
Tifa: Aeris!
Aeris: Hurry and get out!
"Tseng: Ha, ha, ha... Well, it should be starting right about now. Think you can escape in time?"
Tifa: Once that Plate starts coming down it'll be too late. We gotta hurry!
"Barret: Yo, we can use this wire to get out!"
Barret: Marlene! MARLENE!!
Barret: MAR---LE---NE!!
Barret: Biggs!
Barret: Wedge!!
Barret: Jessie!!
Barret: Goddamn it!!!
Barret: Dammit!
Barret: DAMMIT ALL TO HELL!!!!
Barret: What the hell's it all for!?
Barret: ARGGHHHH!!!
"Cloud: Hey, Barret!"
Tifa: Barret!
Barret: ARGGHHHH!!!
Cloud: Hey!
"Tifa: Barret, stop... Please stop, Barret."
Barret: URGHHHH!!!
Barret: God damn...
Barret: Marlene...
Tifa: ......... Barret......?
Tifa: Marlene is... I think Marlene is safe.
Barret: ......huh?
"Tifa: Right before they took Aeris, she said, ""Don't worry, she's all right."" She was probably talking about Marlene."
"Barret: R, really!?"
Tifa: But...
Barret: Biggs...... Wedge... Jessie......
Cloud: All three of them were in the pillar.
"Barret: Think I don't know that? But...we, all of us fought together. I don't wanna think of them as dead!"
Tifa: ...and the other people in Sector 7.
Barret: This is all screwed up! They destroyed an entire village just to get to us! They killed so many people...
Tifa: ...are you saying it's our fault? Because AVALANCHE was here? Innocent people lost their lives because of us?
"Barret: No, Tifa! That ain't it! Hell no!! It ain't us! It's the damn Shinra! It's never been nobody but the Shinra! They're evil and destroyin' our planet just to... build their power and line their own damn pockets with gold! If we don't get rid of them, they're gonna kill this planet! Our fight ain't never gonna be over until we get rid of them!!"
Tifa: .........I don't know.
Barret: What don't you know!? You don't believe me?
Tifa: It's not that. I'm not sure about...me. My feelings.
Barret: An'what about you?
Cloud: .........
Barret: Yo!
Barret: Where's he think he's goin'?
Tifa: Oh! Aeris!
"Barret: Oh yeah, that girl. What's up with her?"
Tifa: ...I don't really know... But she's the one I left Marlene with.
Barret: Damn! Marlene!!
Barret: Tifa. There ain't no turnin' back now.
Barret: Cloud! Take me to Marlene!
Tifa: You're going to help Aeris?
"Cloud: Yeah... But before that, there's something I want to know."
Tifa: What's that?
Cloud: ...it's about the Ancients.
On-screen: In my veins courses the blood of the Ancients. I am one of the rightful heirs to this planet!
Cloud: Sephiroth...?
Tifa: Are you all right?
"Barret: Pull it together, man!"
"Elmyra: Cloud......wasn't it? It's about Aeris, isn't it?"
Cloud: ...Sorry. The Shinra have her.
Elmyra: I know. They took her from here.
Cloud: They were here?
Elmyra: That's what Aeris wanted...
Cloud: Why is Shinra after Aeris?
Elmyra: Aeris is an Ancient. The sole survivor.
"Barret: ...What did you say? But, aren't you her mother?"
Elmyra: ...Not her real mother. Oh...it must have been 15 years ago...
"Elmyra: ...during the war. My husband was sent to the front. Some far away place called Wutai. One day, I went to the station because I got a letter saying he was coming home on leave. My husband never came back. I wonder if something happened to him? No, I'm sure his leave was just canceled. I went to the station everyday. Then, one day........."
"Elmyra: You used to see this sort of thing a lot during the war. Her last words were, ""Please take Aeris somewhere safe."" My husband never came back. I had no child. I was probably lonely. So I decided to take her home with me."
"Elmyra: Aeris and I became close very quickly.That child loved to talk. She used to talk to me about everything. She told me she escaped from some kind of research laboratory somewhere. And that her mother had already returned to the planet, so she wasn't lonely...and many other things."
Barret: Returned to the planet?
"Elmyra: I didn't know what she meant. I asked if she meant a star in the sky, But she said it was this planet... She was a mysterious child in many ways."
Aeris: Mom. Please don't cry.
Elmyra: Aeris just blurted that out all of a sudden. When I asked her if something happened...
"Aeris: Someone dear to you has just died. His spirit was coming to see you, but he already returned to the planet."
"Elmyra: At that time I didn't believe her. But... Several days later... We received a notice saying my husband died... ...and that's how it was. A lot had happened, but we were happy. Until one day..."
Tseng: We want you to return Aeris to us. We've been searching for her for a long time.
Aeris: No! Never!
"Tseng: Aeris, you're a very special child. You are of special blood. Your real mother was an 'Ancient'."
Elmyra: Of course I heard it. That she was an 'Ancient'.
Tseng: The Ancients will lead us to a land of supreme happiness. Aeris will be able to bring happiness to all those in the slums. That is why Shinra would like Aeris's cooperation......
Aeris: He's wrong! I'm not an Ancient! I'm not!
"Tseng: But Aeris, surely you hear voices sometimes when you're all alone?"
"Aeris: No, I don't!"
"Elmyra: But I knew. I knew about her mysterious powers... She tried so hard to hide it, so I acted as though I never noticed."
Cloud: It's amazing how she's avoided the Shinra for all these years...
"Elmyra: The Shinra needed her, So I guess they wouldn't harm her."
Tifa: But why now......
"Elmyra: She brought a little girl here with her. On the way here, Tseng found them. She probably couldn't get away fast enough. She decided to go to the Shinra in exchange for the little girl's safety."
Cloud: Must be Marlene.
Barret: Marlene!! Aeris was caught because of Marlene!?
Barret: I'm sorry. Marlene's my daughter. I'm ...really...sorry...
Elmyra: You're her father!? How in the world could you ever leave a child alone like that!?
"Barret: ...please don't start with that. I think about it all the time. What would happen to Marlene, if I... But you gotta understand somethin'... ...I don't got an answer. I wanna be with Marlene... But I gotta fight. 'Cause if I don't...the planet's gonna die. So I'm gonna keep fightin'! But, I'm worried 'bout Marlene. I really just wanna be with her...always. See? I'm goin' in circles, now."
"Elmyra: ...I think I understand what you're saying... She's upstairs asleep, Why don't you go and see her."
Tifa: It's my fault... I was the one who got Aeris involved in this.
Elmyra: Don't say that. Aeris doesn't think that.
Tifa: I feel so depressed.
Elmyra: ...sigh...
Barret: I'm so glad...... I'm so glad you're all right...
"Marlene: Daddy, don't cry. Your whiskers hurt!"
Barret: Cloud!
"Barret: You gonna go help Aeris, right? She's done so much for me..."
"Barret: If it's the Shinra you're dealin' with, I can't just sit here! I'm comin', too!"
"Marlene: Guess what? Guess what? Aeris was asking me lots of questions. Like what kind of person Cloud is. I bet she likes you, Cloud!"
Marlene: Stupid!
Marlene: I won't tell Tifa.
Cloud: Looks like I could get some rest here...
"Tifa: You're going after Aeris, right?"
Cloud: Yeah.
Tifa: I'm coming with you.
Cloud: We're going right into Shinra Headquarters. ...You gotta be prepared for the worst.
"Tifa: I know. Right now, I feel I have to push myself to the limit. If I stayed here...I'll go crazy."
"Barret: Sorry, but can you take care of Marlene a bit longer?"
"Elmyra: Yes, I don't mind."
Barret: This place is dangerous now. You better go somewhere else.
Elmyra: ...You're right. But promise me that you'll come back to her. Don't get yourself killed.
Tifa: How do we get to the Shinra Building?
Barret: There ain't no train that goes up there anymore...
Tifa: ......
"Tifa: Well, let's just go to Wall Market. We might be able to find something there."
"Elmyra: I mean it, come back to her. Don't get yourself killed."
"Marlene: Daddy, Tifa, Cloud! Please bring Aeris back!"
NPC: You goin' up to the plate? You better have a Battery.
Cloud: You're gonna sell me something you just found?
"NPC: Hey, you knew? But I repaired it, so it's all right."
Cloud: Why do I need a battery to climb up to the plate?
NPC: You'll find out when you get there. How 'bout 100 Gil for each?
Cloud: ......
"On-screen: Received ""Batteries""!"
"NPC: Hmm, looks like you're a little short, son. Come back again."
"NPC: All right then, go see for yourself. You'll be back again."
Kid: Wanna see somethin' awesome? Follow me!
Kid 1: Everyone climbed up this wire. Looks scary......Brrr.
Tifa: Can we climb it?
Kid 1: Yeah. It leads to the Upper World.
Barret: Awright! We'll climb this wire!
Cloud: There's no way we can do this. You know how far it goes up?
Barret: There IS a way! Look! What's that look like?
Cloud: Just a normal wire.
Barret: Oh yeah? Well to me it looks like a golden shiny wire of hope.
Tifa: You're right. This is the only way to save Aeris...
"Cloud: Ok, that was a bad analogy, but, Barret, I understand how you feel."
Cloud: Let's go!
Kid 2: Oh man! This is horrible...
"Kid 3: Hey, scary, huh? Dad told me that it's the Shinra's doing."
Cloud: ...maybe if I put a battery in... The propeller might work.
Cloud: It might work if I put a battery in it.
Cloud: I guess I'll just have to believe the shopkeeper.
"Cloud: Need a battery here, too."
Cloud: Looks like the only way is to jump onto that bar. Should make it if I jump before it comes too close. (use OK button to jump)
Cloud: Jumped too soon...
Cloud: Jumped too late...
"Barret: Hey, you oughta know this building well."
"Cloud: ...Not really, now that I think about it, This's the first time I've ever been to the Headquarters."
"Barret: I heard about this place before. Every floor above the 60th is special and not easy to get to even for employees. Must be where they took Aeris. The security's pretty light now. Awright, let's go!!"
"Tifa: Wait a second! You're not thinking of just going right through the main entrance, are you?"
Barret: Well what else does it look like!? I'm gonna kick some Shinra butt and......
Tifa: That's not going to work! We've got to find another way...
"Barret: Ain't gonna be no other way! If we keep wastin' time like this, Aeris'll..."
"Tifa: I know that! But if we get caught here... Hey, Cloud. ...What should we do?"
"Barret: That's more like it! C'mon, let's go!!"
Tifa: See? Let's be careful and find a different route!
"Receptionist: Excuse me! If you don't have an appointment, you'll just have to..."
Barret: Don't need no appointment... This is a 'mergency! Anyone who don't wanna get their face bashed in better git outta the way!! Yaagghh!
Barret: Let's go to the top!
"Cloud: Nothing. Have to find another way up, I guess..."
Tifa: ......What's wrong?
Cloud: I didn't want to start a ruckus till we saved Aeris. I should have known that was impossible though...
"Barret: Heh, heh, heh."
Cloud: What is it? You're givin' me the willies.
Barret: So there are times when even you fight for other people. I am impressed.
Cloud: Who cares if you're impressed...?
"Barret: Y'know,I ain't so good at sayin' this,but... Sorry...for lotsa things."
"Barret: Wh, what the!?"
Tifa: Look!
Barret: DA-MN...!
"Barret: I don't care where, Cloud! Just stop it!"
Tifa: What's going on!?
NPC: Oh man!!
"NPC: No, uh, that's all right. My mistake. I'm, uh, not getting on."
"NPC: You, you're still driving...? Uh, I'll pass again."
NPC: Oh man!!
Barret: Yo... You really gonna take these stairs all the way up?
Tifa: Well we've got to get to Aeris to help her somehow.
Barret: Talk about out of the way...
Tifa: I don't have time to argue with you! I'm going!
"Barret: Y, yo Tifa! Don't go off alone!"
"Tifa: Wait a minute, Cloud!"
Barret: Don't know... Why...the hell... We gotta...climb...
Cloud: ...because we don't want to start a commotion until we've saved Aeris.
Cloud: I doubt that's possible though...
Barret: ...heh heh heh.
Cloud: Knock it off. You're giving me the creeps.
Barret: So even you will fight for someone else. I had you figured wrong I guess.
Cloud: Who cares what you figured!
Barret: I'm just sayin' mebbe I was wrong...
Tifa: heh heh heh......
"Cloud: What's that supposed to mean, Tifa?"
Barret: ...how much farther do these stairs go on?
Tifa: Why don't you ask them?
"Barret: It's not one of them endless stairways or somethin', d'ya think?"
Tifa: Of course not!!
Barret: Right...couldn't be that...
Barret: Are we there yet?
Tifa: Not yet.
Barret: ...there yet?
Tifa: I said not yet!
Barret: Yo...
"Tifa: Look, don't even ask! We're way way way way far away from being there, ok!?"
"Barret: Damn, man! I've had it! I'm going back!"
Tifa: And take just as long going down as you did coming up?
Barret: ............
"Tifa: C'mon, Barret. Pull it together!"
"Barret: Yeah, well all I know is I'm just flesh 'n' blood... 'cept for this arm of mine. Don't treat me like I'm some ex-member of SOLDIER or somethin'......"
"Tifa: What about me!? I'm human too! Oh, do what you want, I'm going on!"
Tifa: ......?
Tifa: Yaah! Barret! You go first!
Barret: What're ya ignorant? I didn't mean that...
"Tifa: All right, all right!"
"Tifa: Cloud, you go on ahead too!!"
Barret: Yo... What floor is this?
Tifa: ...I gave up counting.
Barret: Why they gotta build these buildings so damn tall?
Barret: That Shinra... They're just no damn good.
Tifa: .........
"Barret: huff... Man, I'm beat..."
"Barret: Marlene, Daddy wanted to see your face one more time..."
Tifa: Would you stop acting like a retard and climb!?
Tifa: It's just a bit more!
Tifa: ...maybe.
Barret: F...finally... M...made it... N...never wanna see... no more stairs the rest of my life...
Tifa: huff...puff... this really takes it out of you... But this is it. We'd better get ready...!
"Barret: Hey Cloud! You come all this way, you thinkin' of goin' back down to the 1st floor?"
"Barret: We ain't got no time for that! Stop messin' around, boy!"
"Barret: Yeah, that's right! Let's go on then!"
Guard: Destroy the intruders!
Cloud: What's this?
"On-screen: Received Key Item ""Keycard 60""!"
On-screen: You don't have a Card Key
Tifa: I hope Aeris is all right.
Barret: This is the real thing. Don't let your guard down.
"Guard: What're you doing here!? No unauthorized people are allowed here!! People like you don't belong here! Go on, get out!"
"Barret: Lookit that, all them guards is runnin' around. Cloud, you go on ahead and signal us when it's safe to come."
"Barret: When those guards turn around, MOVE!"
Tifa: Stay in the shadows!
"On-screen: Wait for the soldiers to let down their guard, then push the [O] button to signal the others!"
Barret: Ok! We gonna rock!
"Tifa: Remember, we're here to save Aeris."
"Barret: Hell, I know that!"
Guard: Hey there! What do you think you're doing there!?
Barret: What the hell're ya doin'? Come on gotta do it again!
Barret: I shoulda known it'd turn out like this... If I'd known it'd be like this in the first place...
Tifa: Shhh! Now let's move on.
NPC: The hell are you? What're you doin' around here?
"NPC: Aeris? How did you know that name? You must be...!? Aeris, you mean that kid. The receptionist. Yeah, I was startin' to worry 'bout her myself. And so another rival appears on the scene, eh? You mean, she's not? It's someone else?"
"NPC: Oh, I see. So you must be that whatcha call it... Shinra, Inc. Repair Division!! You know, it looks like this building is starting to fall apart. This door was just pushed open. You ought to fix this right away. Oh yeah, and take a look on the other floors too. I'll give you this."
"On-screen: Received Key Item ""Keycard 62""!"
NPC: This door is stuck wide open. Better fix this right away.
Hart: How do you do? This is the Midgar Mayor's Office. Mayor Domino is in his office. I am the Deputy Mayor. If you should have any questions feel free to ask me...
"Domino: Hmm? Oh, and who might you be? You all must be those...ahem... Me? I'm Domino, the Mayor of Midgar. Actually, I'm Mayor in name only. The city and everything in it is really run by Shinra, Inc. My only real job is watching over Shinra's documents... Me! The Mayor! A librarian! Ohh...... You want to get upstairs? I tell you what, if you can guess the password, I'll give you my keycard. Yes, that's it. Guess the password and I'll give you my keycard! Get it on the first try and I'll even throw in a special item!"
"Hart: Did you speak with the Mayor? What? A password? Oh, I get it... He's got way too much time on his hands. But you can't really blame him, Everything in Midgar is controlled by President Shinra. Maybe I can help you."
Hart: What do you want to know?
Hart: What can I do for you?
"Hart: Sure, sure. All right. As a public servant, it's my job to serve the needs of the people. So here's a hint..."
Hart: ...for 500 gil.
Hart: ...for 1000 gil.
Hart: ...for 2000 gil.
Hart: Hey now! You're a bit short. I'm sure even item stores in the slums don't give credit nowadays.
"Hart: Oh, my...well, Thank you very much."
"Hart: Now listen. On this floor are four research libraries for four different sections of Shinra, Inc.... Parts of the password are hidden in each of the libraries. Pay careful attention to the files in each room. The name of each library is written on the plaque outside the door."
"Hart: Now, in each library will be one file mixed in from another library. Look carefully at the numbers on each file."
"Hart: There is a number at the beginning of each file name. Of course there's a number even on the files that don't belong in that library. Match the number with the letters in the title of the file. If the file starts with a 4, then check the fourth letter and... well, you get the idea."
"Hart: ...I see. Then, I guess that's that. Good luck finding it on your own. If you still can't find it. I'll just be right over here. Ready to tell you anytime..."
"On-screen: Shinra, Inc. Peace Preservation/ Weapon Dev. Research Library"
"On-screen: Shinra, Inc. Space Dev. Research Library"
"On-screen: Shinra, Inc. Urban Dev. Research Library"
"On-screen: Shinra, Inc. Scientific Research Library"
On-screen: This is the Public Order/Weapon Development Library. Return materials where you found them. Do not mix materials from other libraries.
On-screen: This is the Space Dev Research Library. Click on the plate in front of each library to see which it is.
On-screen: Materials are non-circulating! It is forbidden to remove any materials from this floor.
On-screen: This is the Scientific Research Library. Materials for the... Urban Dev. Library Peace/Weapon Dev. Library Space Dev. Library are held in their respective libraries...
"Domino: Got it? Then tell me. So, what's the password?"
"Domino: BEST!! God, I love the sound of that! BEST!! I AM the best...ME!! No matter what anyone else says, you'd better believe it."
"Domino: KING!! God, I love the sound of that! KING!! President Shinra sucks! I should be King of Midgar!"
"Domino: BOMB!! God, I love the sound of that! BOMB!! I'm so angry, I'm like a walking time bomb waiting to explode!"
"Domino: MAKO!! God, I love the sound of that! MAKO! If I had a lot more of it, I would be a real Mayor!"
Domino: Nope! You're ALL wrong! It's a much better word than that! Try again!
"Domino: ......hmm. Well, ok. Here, take it."
"On-screen: Received ""Keycard 65""!"
"Domino: I never thought you'd get it on the first try... Just goes to show you can't judge a book by its cover. Oh well, a promise is a promise. Take this, too."
"On-screen: Received ""Elemental"" Materia!"
Domino: What...is it full already? Come back again when it's empty.
"Domino: Hmm. It appears you're not completely stupid. Fine then, take this."
"On-screen: Received ""Elixir""!"
"Domino: I see... I think for you...this would be best. Then, I have this to give the lot of you."
"On-screen: Received ""Ether""!"
"Domino: Hoo boy! You finally got it...? You all really don't like to use your heads, do you? ......What the hey. Here, just take it anyway."
"On-screen: Received ""Potion""!"
"Domino: Why would I do something like this, you ask? To mess with them, of course! Shinra's been torturing me forever. That's why I was a little rough on you all just now. Now go up there and really make them suffer. This ought to make us even! Heh heh heh......"
Domino: But my card will only get you to the 65th floor. Can you believe how they treat me? ...ME! Like some common employee...
Hart: If you run into President Shinra please don't tell him about this. I can't be a partner to anymore trouble for Shinra.
"On-screen: Received Key Item ""Midgar Parts""!"
"On-screen: Received Key Item ""Keycard 66""!"
Cloud: A model of Midgar...born from Mako sucked right out of the earth.
Cloud: Parts of the model are missing...
Cloud: ...Sounds like something opened up...
"Cloud: Midgar...born from Mako energy which was sucked right out of the earth. A model of the city... When construction of Sector 6 finishes, Shinra's plan will be complete. That must be why he took Aeris..."
Barret: Geez--! That's a lotta suits!
"Reeve: We have the damage estimates for Sector 7. Considering those factories we already set up and all the investments, the damage is estimated at approximately 10 Billion gil..."
Reeve: The estimated cost to rebuild Sector 7 is...
President Shinra: We're not rebuilding.
Reeve: What?
President Shinra: We're leaving Sector 7 as it is. And restarting the Neo-Midgar plan.
Reeve: ...then the Ancients?
President Shinra: The Promised Land will soon be ours.
President Shinra: I want you to raise the Mako rates 15% in every area.
"Palmer: Rate hike! Rate hike! Tra, la, la! And please include our Space Program in the budget!"
President Shinra: Reeve and Scarlet will divide the extra income from the rate increase.
Palmer: Oh man!
"Reeve: Sir. If you raise the rates, the people will lose confidence..."
"President Shinra: It'll be all right. The ignorant citizens won't lose confidence, they'll trust Shinra, Inc. even more."
"Heidegger: Ha ha ha! After all, we're the ones who saved Sector 7 from AVALANCHE!"
Barret: That dirty #$*$^
President Shinra: Hojo. How's the girl?
"Hojo: As a specimen, she is inferior to her mother. I'm still in the process of comparing her to her mother, Ifalna, but for now the difference is 18%."
President Shinra: How long will the research take?
"Hojo: Probably 120 years. It's probably impossible to finish in our lifetime. Or in the lifetime of the specimen too, for that matter."
Hojo: That's why we're thinking of breeding her. Then we could create one that could withstand our research for a long time.
President Shinra: What about the Promised Land? Won't it hinder our plans?
Hojo: That's what I need to plan. The mother is strong... and yet has her weaknesses.
President Shinra: That concludes our meeting.
Scarlet: Something stinks...
Cloud: They were talking about Aeris...right?
Barret: I dunno.
Tifa: Probably.
Cloud: Let's follow 'em.
Cloud: Hojo...huh...?
"Barret: I remember him. That Hojo guy. He's in charge of the Shinra's Science Department. Cloud, don't you know him?"
Cloud: This is the first time I've actually ever seen him. So...that's what he looks like...
NPC: Let's see... The specimen Hojo asked me for is...
NPC: Is this today's specimen?
Hojo: Yes. We're starting right away. Raise it to the upper level.
Hojo: My precious specimen...
Tifa: Precious specimen...? Is it going to be used for a biological experiment?
Cloud: Jenova... Jenova... Sephiroth's... So...they've brought it here.
"Tifa: Cloud, be strong!"
Cloud: Did you see it?
Barret: See what?
Cloud: It's moving......still alive?
Barret: Where's its $#&*&@ head? This whole thing's stupid. Let's keep goin'.
NPC: That elevator back there is only to transport Specimens. You can't use it. It would be a lot easier if it led to the 68 Floor Research Lab.
Cloud: Aeris!
"Hojo: Aeris? Oh, is that her name? What do you want?"
Cloud: We're taking Aeris back.
Hojo: Outsiders......
"Barret: Shoulda noticed it earlier, you..."
Hojo: There's so many frivolous things in this world.
"Hojo: Are you going to kill me? I don't think you should. The equipment here is extremely delicate. Without me, who could operate it? Hmm?"
Cloud: Ugh.
Hojo: That's right. I recommend you think things out logically before you make any rash moves.
"Hojo: Now, bring in the Specimen!"
"Aeris: Cloud, help!"
Cloud: What do you think you're doin'?
"Hojo: Lending a helping hand to an endangered species... Both of them are on the brink of extinction... If I don't help, all these animals will disappear."
Tifa: ...animal? That's terrible! Aeris is a human being!
Barret: You're gonna pay!
Cloud: Barret! Can't you do anything?
Barret: Awright!! Step back!
Hojo: Stop!!
Hojo: Wh...what are you do-- Oh! My precious specimens...
Cloud: Now's our chance to get Aeris!
"Aeris: Thanks, Cloud."
Tifa: Cloud...what's wrong?
Cloud: ...The elevator is moving.
Hojo: This is no ordinary specimen. This is a very ferocious specimen!
Red: He's rather strong. I'll help you all out.
Tifa: It talked!?
"Red: I'll talk as much as you want later, Miss."
Cloud: We'll take care of that monster. Somebody take Aeris somewhere safe...
Cloud: What's your name?
"Red: Hojo has named me, Red XIII. A name with no meaning whatsoever to me. Call me whatever you wish."
Cloud: Come on!
"Cloud: Aeris, you all right?"
"Tifa: She seems all right, ...in many ways."
"Red XIII: I have a right to choose, too. I don't like two-legged things."
Barret: What are you?
Red XIII: An informed question. But difficult to answer. I am what you see.
"Red XIII: ...You must have many questions, but first, let's get out of here. I'll lead the way."
Aeris: Cloud... so you did come for me.
Red XIII: I apologize for what happened back there. I was merely acting to throw Hojo off guard......
"Barret: Now we've saved Aeris, ain't no need to be in this buildin'! So let's get the hell outta here!"
"Cloud: If all five of us go together, we'll be noticed. Let's break up in two groups."
On-screen: Press the (MENU) button to access the Menu. Press the (CANCEL) button for Change Party. Press the (OK) button when finished.
Aeris: I'll see you later!! We'll be waiting at the 66th Floor Elevator.
Tifa: We'll be going first! Meet at the 66th Floor Elevator.
Barret: Later! Meet up at the 66th Floor Elevator!
Red XIII: Don't be late. Do you know where the Elevator is? The 66th Floor!
"NPC: No! Please don't kill me. I only did what Hojo told me to do. To prove it to you...here, this is the key card to the 68th Floor. Would I be doing this if I was the enemy?"
"On-screen: Received Key Item ""Keycard 68""!"
Barret: Where you goin'? Everyone's waitin' at the 66th Floor Elevator.
Tifa: Where are you going? Everyone's waiting for us at the 66th Floor Elevator.
Aeris: Not that way! Everyone's on the 66th Floor Elevator.
"Cloud: H, hey! What is it?"
Rude: Would you press 'Up' please?
Cloud: Turks? Must be a trap...
Tseng: It must have been a real thrill for you... Did you enjoy it?
Cloud: Ggh...
"Cloud: You all got caught, too?"
Cloud: Where is Aeris!?
President Shinra: In a safe place. She's the last surviving Ancient...
"President Shinra: Don't you know? They called themselves the Cetra, and lived thousands of years ago. Now they are just a forgotten page in history."
"Red XIII: Cetra...That girl, is she a survivor of the Cetra?"
"President Shinra: Cetra, or the Ancients will show us the way to the 'Promised Land.' I'm expecting a lot out of her."
Red XIII: The Promised Land? Isn't that just a legend?
"President Shinra: Even so, it's just too appealing to not to pursue. It's been said the Promised Land is very fertile. ...If the land is fertile..."
Barret: Then there's gotta be Mako!
President Shinra: Exactly. That is why our money sucking Mako Reactor is necessary. The abundant Mako will just come out on its own. That is where Neo-Midgar will be built. Shinra's new glory...
Barret: @$#*^%! Quit dreamin'!
"President Shinra: Oh really, don't you know? These days all it takes for your dreams to come true is money and power."
"President Shinra: Well, that is all for our meeting."
Rude: Come on! Outta his way!
Barret: Hold it! I got a lot I wanna say to you!
President Shinra: If you need something else... talk to my secretary.
Tifa: Psst (Can we get out?)
"Tifa: Psst (Cloud, you're so brave!)"
Tifa: Psst (Don't give up!)
Barret: Hey!
Barret: Aeris is an Ancient and the real name of the Ancients is Cetra. The Ancients know where the Promised Land is and the Shinra is searching for that Promised Land.
Barret: I only heard stories 'bout the Promised Land. I don't know if it really exists. Is that right?
"Barret: The Shinra believe that the Promised Land is full of Mako energy. Which means, if the Shinra get there, they'll suck up all the Mako energy. ...and the land'll wither away. The Planet's gonna get weaker."
"Barret: I can't just leave 'em be. I'm recruitin'new members!! Me, Tifa, Cloud... and Aeris too. How 'bout you?"
Barret: You're so damn boring.
Red XIII: ............Grandpa.
"Barret: Grandpa!? Ha, ha, ha...... Grandpa, hmm......ha, ha, ha......"
Red XIII: What's so funny?
"Barret: Nothin'......ha, ha"
"Aeris: Cloud, are you there?"
Cloud: Aeris!? You safe?
"Aeris: Yeah, I'm all right. I knew that Cloud would come for me."
"Cloud: Hey, I'm your bodyguard, right?"
"Aeris: The deal was for one date, right?"
"Tifa: ............oh, I get it."
"Aeris: ...!? Tifa! Tifa, you're there too!"
Tifa: EXCUSE me.
"Tifa: You know, Aeris. I have a question."
Aeris: What?
Tifa: Does the Promised Land really exist?
Aeris: ...I don't know.
"Aeris: All I know is... The Cetra were born from the Planet, speak with the Planet, and unlock the Planet. And......then... The Cetra will return to the Promised Land. A land that promises supreme happiness."
Tifa: ...What does that mean?
Aeris: More than words......I don't know.
Cloud: ...Speak with the Planet?
Tifa: Just what does the Planet say?
Aeris: It's full of people and noisy. That's why I can't make out what they are saying.
Cloud: You hear it now?
"Aeris: I, I only heard it at the Church in the Slums. Mother said that Midgar was no longer safe. That is...my real mother."
"Aeris: Someday I'll get out of Midgar... Speak with the Planet and find my Promised Land. ...That's what mom said. I thought I would stop hearing her voice as I grew up, but..."
Tifa: ......
Cloud: The door's open... When did it open?
Cloud: What's happened?
Cloud: Tifa... Wake up!
Tifa: What's wrong?
Cloud: Something's wrong. Look outside.
Tifa: I wonder what happened...
Cloud: He should have the key on him...
"Cloud: Come on, Tifa, get Aeris. I'll go help Barret and the others."
Tifa: This's kinda eerie...
Aeris: Must've been attacked by...
"Cloud: Barret, Red XIII ...come with me. Something's wrong."
Barret: How'd you get in? Why's the door open!?
Barret: The hell's goin' on!?
Red XIII: No human could've done this.
Red XIII: I'll go on ahead.
"Barret: I'll clean up back here, so you guys go ahead. And don't get caught by Shinra!"
"Tifa: Come on, let's follow Red XIII!"
Cloud: ...Did it get away? Jenova...?
Red XIII: Jenova Specimen... Looks like it went to the upper floor using that elevator for the specimens.
Red XIII: It looks like it leads up...
"Barret: He's dead... The leader of Shinra, Inc. is dead..."
Tifa: Then this sword must be...!?
Cloud: Sephiroth's!!
Tifa: ...Sephiroth is alive?
Cloud: ...Looks like it. Only Sephiroth can use that sword.
Barret: Who cares who did it!? This is the end of the Shinra now!
Palmer: Uh!
"Palmer: P, p, p, please, don't kill me!"
Cloud: What happened?
Palmer: Se...Sephiroth. Sephiroth came.
Cloud: Did you see him? Did you see Sephiroth?
"Palmer: Yeah, I saw him! I saw him with my own eyes!"
Cloud: You really saw him?
Palmer: Uh! Would I lie to you at a time like this!? And I heard his voice too!
"Palmer: Um, he was saying something about not letting us have the Promised Land."
Tifa: Then what? Does that mean that the Promised Land really exists and that Sephiroth's here to save it from Shinra?
Barret: So he's a good guy then?
Cloud: Save the Promised Land? A good guy? No way!! It's not that simple! I know him! Sephiroth's mission is different!
Barret: Rufus! &*%$! I forgot about him!
Tifa: Who's that?
Barret: Vice President Rufus. The President's son.
Barret: I heard that he's been assigned somewhere else for a long time...
Tifa: I wonder what kinda person he is...
Aeris: I've heard that no one's ever seen him bleed or cry.
Red XIII: I only know his name.
Rufus: So... So Sephiroth was actually here. ...By the way.
Rufus: Who are you guys?
"Cloud: I'm Cloud, former SOLDIER First Class!"
Barret: I'm from AVALANCHE!
Tifa: Same here!
Aeris: ...a flower girl from the slums.
Red XIII: ...a research specimen.
Rufus: What a crew.
"Rufus: Well, I'm Rufus. The President of Shinra, Inc."
"Barret: You only President, 'cause yer old man died!"
Rufus: That's right. I'll let you hear my new appointment speech.
"Rufus: ...Old man tried to control the world with money. It seems to have been working. The population thought that Shinra would protect them. Work at Shinra, get your pay. If a terrorist attacks, the Shinra army will help you. It looks perfect on the outside."
"Rufus: But, I do things differently. I'll control the world with fear. It takes too much to do it like my old man. A little fear will control the minds of the common people. There's no reason to waste money on them."
Tifa: He likes to make speeches just like his father.
Cloud: Get outta this building with Aeris!
Barret: What?
Cloud: I'll explain later! Barret! This is the real crisis for the Planet!
Barret: The hell's that supposed to mean?
Cloud: I'll tell you later! Just take my word for it now! I'll go after I take care of him!
"Barret: Awright, Cloud!"
Aeris: Cloud... I just thought of something.
"Tifa: ...I'll wait for Cloud! Everyone, get to the elevator!"
"Aeris: Hmm, it's going to get pretty ugly from here on. We should check on our equipment."
On-screen: Cloud and Tifa's Materia...
On-screen: Access Menu with [Triangle] button Remove Materia from other members with [Square] End with the (START) button.
Rufus: Why do you want to fight me?
Cloud: You seek the Promised Land and Sephiroth.
"Rufus: Hm, exactly."
Rufus: Mm? Did you know that Sephiroth is an Ancient?
"Cloud: ...A lot has happened. Anyway, I can't let either you or Sephiroth have the Promised Land!"
Rufus: I see. I guess this means we won't become friends.
"Rufus: Heh, Heh, Heh..."
Rufus: Heh... That's all for today...
Tifa: Where's Rufus?
Cloud: I couldn't finish 'em. Looks like this's gonna get complicated.
"Aeris: Quickly, we have to get out of here..."
"Aeris: Quickly, we can escape this way..."
Aeris: Quickly! We'll escape out this way......
Barret: I'll go on ahead!
"Barret: *&^%(*... surrounded, huh? If I was alone this wouldn't be a thang but, I gotta reputation to protect."
Aeris: You all get out while you can. It's not you they're after... it's me.
"Barret: Yeah, well that ain't happenin'. You got caught up in this over Marlene. Now, it's my turn to watch out for you!"
"Barret: Ok, playtime's over for you jackasses..."
"Aeris: ...thank you, Mr. Barret!"
Barret: Who you callin' Mr. Barret? That don't sound right!
"Red XIII: Well then... If you are through talking, may I suggest that we think of a way to get out of here."
"Barret: Huh? Oh, oh yeah... You a cold man. Just like someone else 'round here I know."
Red XIII: Did you say something?
Barret: Notta thing. So what're we gonna do?
Tifa: Barret!!
Barret: Tifa! Where's Cloud?
"Tifa: Everyone, over here!"
Barret: Huh? What's up? Where's Cloud?
"Tifa: I'll tell you later! Hurry, Hurry!!"
On-screen: Control the bike with the [Directional buttons] and save your friends in the truck from the Shinra Pursuit Troops.
"Barret: Well, what do we do now?"
Cloud: Sephiroth is alive. I ...I have to settle the score.
Barret: And that'll save the Planet?
Cloud: ...Seems like it.
"Barret: Awright, I'm going!"
Aeris: I'll go too. ...I have things that I want to find out.
Cloud: About the Ancients?
Aeris: ......Many things.
"Tifa: I guess this's good bye, Midgar."
"Barret: We told Aeris's mom to go somewhere safe, so Marlene should be safe too."
Aeris: She said she didn't want to stay in Midgar anymore. ...Maybe it's for the best.
"Aeris: Stop it, Cloud! I'm worried too."
Aeris: You know what? This is the first time I've ever left Midgar...
"Aeris: A little,...no, maybe a lot. But I have my bodyguard, right?"
Aeris: I thought you'd say that!
Tifa: ...I guess this is the start of our journey...
"Tifa: ...I don't know. But, I don't have anywhere else to go. So I guess it doesn't really matter whether I like to travel or not."
"Tifa: ......Mmm. But you know, it should be all right if you keep your promise."
Red XIII: I'm going back to my hometown. I'll go with you as far as that.
Cloud: Then...
Barret: We need a group leader for our journey. 'Course only me could be the leader.
Tifa: You think so...?
Aeris: It would have to be Cloud.
"Barret: ^#$^%......awright. Go Northeast to a town called Kalm. If something happens, we'll meet up there."
"Barret: 'Sides, we can't have 5 people strolling down the fields. It's too dangerous. Split us into 2 parties..."
Aeris: ...Unexpected
Tifa: ...combination.
"Tifa: Well, have fun with just the guys."
Barret: ...Thought you'd do that.
"Barret: Later, at Kalm!"
Tifa: We'll see you at Kalm!
"Barret: Hey Cloud. If we keep going, we'll never get to Kalm."
"Tifa: Hey, Cloud. Wasn't Kalm right before this cavern?"
Red XIII: ...We won't get to Kalm even if we go through these caverns.
"Barret: Yo, wassup? Can't SOLDIER-man even lead the way?"
Tifa: Kalm should be closer to Midgar.
Aeris: Cloud! Are you lost!?
"Red XIII: If we're planning to meet at Kalm, we should go back and look for it again."
Barret: This is Kalm.
Aeris: We've reached Kalm.
Tifa: So this is Kalm?
Red XIII: ......looks like we've reached Kalm.
"Barret: Yo, I'll be waitin' at the inn... Hurry up and get your butt over there!"
Aeris: I wonder if everyone's there already. Let's hurry over to the inn!
Tifa: Everyone's waiting at the inn. Let's go Cloud.
Red XIII: We're supposed to meet at the inn. ......Shall we go?
Barret: Get over here!
"Aeris: Well then, I'll go on ahead."
Tifa: Let's go Cloud.
Red XIII: Let's go Cloud.
Cloud: Barret and the others are waiting for us at the inn.
Innkeeper: Mr...... Cloud? Your party is waiting for you on the 2nd floor.
"Aeris: Cloud, you're late!"
On-screen: Can't reach it...
"Barret: Yo man, you're late!"
Cloud: Sorry to keep you waiting.
Aeris: Guess everyone's here now.
"Barret: So let's hear your story...... You know, the one about Sephiroth and the crisis facing the planet. Let's hear it all."
"Cloud: ......I used to want to be like Sephiroth, so I joined SOLDIER. After working with Sephiroth on several missions, we became friends."
Barret: You call that a friend?
"Cloud: Yeah, well...... He's older than me, and he hardly ever talked about himself."
Tifa: .........
Cloud: So I guess you'd call him a war buddy...... We trusted each other. Until one day......
Aeris: ...one day?
Cloud: After the war it was SOLDIER's duty to put down any resistance against the Shinra.
Cloud: ......that was 5 years ago. I was 16......
Cloud: It sure is raining hard.
"Cloud: Hey, how are you doing?"
NPC 1: I'm all right.
Cloud: I wouldn't know... I've never had motion sickness.
Cloud: Everything okay?
Sephiroth: Hey.
Sephiroth: Settle down.
Cloud: They gave me some new Materia. I can't wait to use it.
Sephiroth: ...just like a kid.
Cloud: You going to brief us about this mission?
Sephiroth: ...this isn't a typical mission.
Cloud: Good!
Sephiroth: Why do you say that?
"Cloud: I joined SOLDIER so I could be like you. But by the time I made First Class, the war was already over. My big hopes of becoming a hero like you ended with the war. That's why I always sign up whenever there's a big mission. Kind of a way to prove myself."
"Cloud: Say, how do you feel, MISTER Sephiroth?"
Sephiroth: ...I thought you wanted a briefing?
"Sephiroth: Our mission is to investigate an old Mako reactor. There have been reports of it malfunctioning, and producing brutal creatures. First, we will dispose of those creatures. Then, we'll locate the problem and neutralize it."
Cloud: Brutal creatures... Where?
Sephiroth: The Mako Reactor at Nibelheim.
Cloud: Nibelheim... That's where I'm from.
Sephiroth: Hmm... hometown...
"NPC 2: Sir... s, something strange just crashed into our truck!"
Sephiroth: That would be our Monster...
Cloud: Sephiroth's strength is unreal. He is far stronger in reality than any story you might have heard about him.
Aeris: So... Where do you come in?
Cloud: Me? I was mesmerized by the way Sephiroth fought.
Tifa: .........
Cloud: ......and then we reached Nibelheim.
"Sephiroth: How does it feel? It's your first time back to your hometown in a long time, right? So how does it feel? I wouldn't know because I don't have a hometown..."
Cloud: Ummm... how 'bout your parents?
Sephiroth: My mother is Jenova. She died right after she gave birth to me. My father...
"Sephiroth: What does it matter...? All right, let's go."
NPC: Psst... (You keep wandering around here and you'll get in trouble.)
"NPC: It's so boring, being on watch."
Cloud: Shall we practice?
"NPC: Practice... oh, you mean practice my pose. Does someone in SOLDIER always have to be careful about what other people think? ...How did it go?"
NPC: ...Was it like this?
Cloud: Good job!
NPC: I really don't want to be in SOLDIER.
Cloud: I'll come and talk to you once in a while. Just stick with it.
Sephiroth: The Mako smell is pretty bad here.
"Barret (over narration): You wait a minute!! Isn't that, um...? The name of Sephiroth's mother..."
Barret: I remember Jenova. That's that damn headless spook livin' in the Shinra building.
Cloud: That's right.
"Tifa: Barret, would you please let us hear what Cloud has to say? You can ask questions later."
"Barret: Tifa, I was only......"
"Tifa: Okay Cloud, continue."
Aeris: It's a reunion of childhood pals!
Cloud: ......I was really surprised with Tifa.
"Cloud (narrating): ...The town was quiet. Everyone must be staying in their houses, afraid to come out because of the monsters. No, maybe they're afraid of us..."
Sephiroth: We leave for the reactor at dawn. Make sure you get to sleep early.
"Sephiroth: All we need is one lookout, so you others, get some rest."
"Sephiroth: Oh, that's right... You may visit your family and friends."
NPC: I heard Sephiroth was coming and got my camera ready. I want a shot of Sephiroth and a monster.
NPC: I don't take pictures with nobodys.
NPC: All right... So big-headed...
NPC: Hey? This guy's a real...
"NPC: You... Are you Cloud? Really? So that's how it is, huh? Gosh, Cloud, you've grown up to be a nice-looking lad."
"NPC: Let's do this, Cloud. Let me take a picture of you with Sephiroth."
"NPC: OK, OK,...... So big-headed... You're just his assistant"
NPC: Man... I'm so nervous.
"NPC: Look, you never know when a monster's gonna show up, right?"
NPC: ...That's right. Don't blow your chance to become a hero...
NPC: Welcome. Hey? Aren't you...
Cloud (narrating): ...Have I come here before? ...I don't remember.
"Barret (over narration): Now you're pissin' me off!! This don't matter, so get on with it!"
Cloud: This Mansion...
"Cloud: ...No, I'll come here later."
Tifa's father: Hmm? You from Shinra?
Tifa's father: Geez... Big-headed young kid.
Tifa's father: I'm the town's... ...... ......!? Aren't you Cloud? Don't you know me?
Cloud: You're Tifa's...
Tifa's father: Right. I'm Tifa's father.
Tifa's father: ...I want you to stay away from my daughter. We don't need the Shinra's help to protect our town!
Cloud (narrating): This is...... my house. It has nothing to do with that incident five years ago.
"Barret (over narration): Yo wait, I wanna hear."
"Aeris (over narration): Me too! It's been a long time, right?"
"Barret (over narration): Tell us more! You saw your family, right?"
Barret (over narration): Well I ain't gonna force ya...
Cloud (narrating): I don't know if you could call it a 'family'...... My father... died when I was still very young. That's why my mom...... was living alone in this house.
"Cloud (over narration): Yeah, I saw my mom. My mom... she was a vibrant woman. Hadn't changed at all. But a few days later, she died... But when I saw her, she looked fine."
Cloud: Uh...?
Cloud's mom: Ye----s?
"Cloud's mom: Cloud!? Welcome home, Cloud!"
"Cloud: Hi, mom."
"Cloud's mom: Come, come... Let me take a look at you!"
Cloud's mom: Hmmm...... You look so handsome. So this is a SOLDIER uniform?
"Cloud: ......Mom, I..."
"Cloud's mom: My, how you've grown. I'll bet the girls never leave you alone."
Cloud: ...Not really.
Cloud's mom: ...I'm worried about you. There are a lot of temptations in the city... I'd feel a lot better if you just settled down and had a nice girlfriend.
Cloud: ...I'm all right.
"Cloud's mom: You should have... an older girlfriend, one that'll take care of you. I think that would be the perfect type for you."
Cloud: ......I'm not interested.
Cloud's mom: Are you eating right?
Cloud: I'm all right. The Company takes care of me.
"Cloud's mom: Is that so? You can't cook, right? I was worried sick about how you were doing..."
Cloud's mom: Cloud...?
"Cloud's mom: You know, Cloud......"
"Cloud's mom: ......isn't that right, Cloud?"
Cloud's mom: I will always be your mother...
Cloud (narrating): ......Let's stop this......
Cloud (narrating): Hey... I can't... remember much else. There's... nothing more to talk about.
"Aeris (over narration): That's all right, Cloud."
Tifa (over narration): Cloud...? Did you go into my house?
Cloud (narrating): I thought you might be home.
Cloud (narrating): I remember you weren't there.
Tifa (over narration): Cloud...? Did you go into my room?
Tifa (over narration): Did you play my piano?
Cloud: ...Now how did this go?
On-screen: It was Start button to finish.
Cloud: I've heard this melody somewhere before. Managed to play well...
"Cloud: I can read sheet music too, you know...... Ummm, let's see......"
Cloud: Do... Re... Mi... Ti... La... Do... Re... Mi... So... Fa.. Do.. Re... Do... Forget...
Cloud (narrating): The letter...
Tifa (over narration): Did you read it? My letter?
Tifa (over narration): Of course!
Tifa (over narration): Do you remember what it said...?
"Tifa (over narration): Then, let's go on with the story about Sephiroth."
Cloud (over narration): I read it... It was a letter addressed to Tifa from the son of the guy that runs the General Store...
"On-screen: Tifa, how are you? I just arrived in Midgar eight days ago. Yesterday, all of Nibelheim got together to welcome me. The only person that we couldn't get a hold of was Cloud. But everyone said he wasn't really that close to us. So even if we asked, he probably wouldn't have come anyway."
"On-screen: Well, enough about him. Midgar is really something. But to tell the truth, I feel so behind on everything... so out of it. Even the rooms of people in the slums are clean. Right now I'm living in the slums, but I plan to move to a really nice room, like the ones I've seen in magazines, once I make some money. ...but, to do that, I guess I have to find a job first."
"On-screen: That's right. I still haven't found a job yet. I lied to my parents and told them I found a great job with Shinra, Inc. I wonder if it's too late to go back. Sometimes I think I should've taken over my parents' store."
Tifa (over narration): Cloud... Do you remember all of it?
"Tifa (over narration): Then, let's go on with the story about Sephiroth."
Tifa (over narration): Because there was some stuff about me...
"On-screen: I just made it here to Midgar but all I think about is Nibelheim. Hey, Tifa... Is that stupid old water tower still working? Is the old man at the Inn doing well? Are my parents still at the shop everyday? Have any monsters attacked? And most of all, how are you, Tifa? It feels like I haven't seen you for years."
"On-screen: We were all talking about you last night. Everyone likes you. But because everyone idolizes you, I couldn't very well stab them in the back. I always acted cool, but actually, I was just afraid of being jilted. Wow, if I keep writing like this, this'll become a love letter! So, I think I'll stop here. Take care. I'll write again. P.S. Write me back, okay?"
"On-screen: Received ""Orthopedic Underwear!"""
Tifa (over narration): Cloud!!!
Tifa (over narration): ...Cloud. We're talking about something really important here.
"NPC 1: ...Oh, you're with the Shinra? Welcome."
"NPC 1: Oh, I'm sorry! It's you, Cloud! I didn't recognize you."
NPC 2: Shinra----?
NPC 3: Chinra---?
NPC 2: SOLDIER?
NPC 3: Saltza?
NPC 2: Are you going to kill the monsters?
NPC 3: ......are you going to?
NPC 2: He's soooo cool!!
NPC 3: Way cool!!
"NPC 1: Cloud, you've grown to be a strong man."
NPC 3: ........................
NPC 2: Do your best.
NPC 3: Do your best.
"NPC: So, what do you need, Cloud?"
"NPC: Yeah, he's upstairs."
"NPC: It's all reserved for you Shinra people, so I don't mind. But, wouldn't you feel more comfortable staying at home?"
"NPC: Now about the town... A lot of monsters have been appearing in the last 12 months. Other than that, there's not much change. Nothing much exciting happens in a little town like this. It was all right when they were building the reactor."
"NPC: ...while they were still building it. But once it was completed, it's been bad."
"NPC: Anyhow we've got to get rid of the monsters... Then, we'll all be able to relax a little bit."
(Upon talking to Zangan in the inn.)Zangan: ......Hmmmm
Zangan: Is Shinra here to get rid of the monsters?
Cloud: And who are you?
"Zangan: I'm Zangan. I travel around the world teaching children martial arts. I have 128 students all over the world! In this town, a girl named Tifa is my student."
Cloud: Did you say Tifa?
Zangan: Tifa has good sense. She'll be a powerful fighter.
"Zangan: I want to see some Shinra techniques. And if you see anything you can use, you might want to incorporate some of my techniques."
"Zangan: Well, good luck."
Cloud: What are you looking at?
Sephiroth: ...This scenery...... I feel like I know this place.
NPC: We're short one bed...
Sephiroth: .........
Sephiroth: ...We have an early start tomorrow. You should get some sleep soon.
Sephiroth: ...I'm not going to wake you up tomorrow.
"Sephiroth: I've hired a guide to the Mako reactor. I've heard she's young, I hope we can rely on her..."
NPC 1: Think they'd let me take a picture?
"Tifa's father: If I knew this was going to happen, I would've made mountain climbing off limits..."
NPC 2: I was so nervous. I couldn't get any sleep...
NPC 3: ...Late again.
"(Upon talking to Sephiroth in front of the exit to Mt. Nibel.)Sephiroth: Once the guide gets here, we're heading out."
"Tifa's father: Listen to me, Sephiroth. In case something happens..."
Sephiroth: ...Trust me.
"Tifa: I'll be all right, Dad! I have two men from SOLDIER with me."
Tifa: I'm Tifa. Nice to meet you!
Cloud: Tifa! You're the guide?
Tifa: That's right. I just happen to be the number one guide in this town.
Cloud: It's too dangerous! I can't involve you in something like this!
Sephiroth: Then there's no problem if you protect her.
Sephiroth: ...Let's go.
"NPC: Ummm... Mr. Sephiroth! Please let me take one picture for a memento! Tifa, can you ask him for me too......?"
NPC: Cheeeeese!
"NPC: Great, thank you! I'll give each of you a copy once I get it developed!"
Cloud (narrating): A Mako Reactor was built in Mt. Nibel. The cold air of the mountains of Nibel. It was no different...
"Tifa's father: I hate myself for asking you this, but... Don't take your eyes off of Tifa! Hurry up and go back to her side!"
Zangan: Oh? Did you come crying home?
Tifa: It gets harder from here! Follow me!
Tifa: Uh... the bridge!!
Sephiroth: Everyone seems to be all right. Can we get back to where we were?
"Tifa: These caves are intertwined, just like an ant farm... Oh, and Sephiroth... There seems to be one person missing..."
"Sephiroth: It may sound cold, but we've got no time to search for him. We can't go back now, so we must go on. We'll travel together from here."
Cloud: What's this?
Tifa: A mysteriously colored cave...
Sephiroth: It must be the Mako energy. This mountain is especially abundant in it. That's why the Mako Reactor was built here.
Cloud: ...And what's this?
Sephiroth: A Mako fountain. It's a miracle of nature.
Tifa: It's so beautiful...
"Tifa: If the Mako Reactor continues to suck up the energy, this fountain will dry up too..."
"Sephiroth: Materia. When you condense Mako energy, materia is produced. It's very rare to be able to see materia in its natural state."
Cloud: By the way... Why is it that when you use materia you can also use magic too?
Sephiroth: You were in SOLDIER and didn't even know that? ...the knowledge and wisdom of the Ancients is held in the materia. Anyone with this knowledge can freely use the powers of the Land and the Planet. That knowledge interacts between ourselves and the planet calling up magic...... or so they say.
Cloud: Magic...... a mysterious power...
"Sephiroth: Ha, ha, ha!"
Cloud: Did I say somethin' funny?
Sephiroth: A man once told me never to use an unscientific term such as mysterious power! It shouldn't even be called 'magic'! I still remember how angry he was.
Cloud: Who was that?
"Sephiroth: Hojo of Shinra, Inc. ... An inexperienced man assigned to take over the work of a great scientist. He was a walking mass of complexes."
Tifa: A Mako fountain... So this is where the knowledge of the Ancients is.
Tifa: We finally made it. We sure took the long way though.
"Cloud: Tifa, you wait here."
Tifa: I'm going inside too! I wanna see!
Sephiroth: Only authorized people are allowed in. This place is full of Shinra's industrial secrets.
Tifa: But!
Sephiroth: Take care of the lady.
"Tifa: Mm, man! Better take real good care of me then!"
"Cloud: This is...... Jenova, right? The lock won't open..."
"Sephiroth: This is the reason for the malfunction. This part is broken. Cloud, close the valve."
Sephiroth: Why did it break...?
"Sephiroth: ...now I see, Hojo. But, even doing this, will never put you on the same level as Professor Gast. This is a system that condenses and freezes the Mako energy... that is, when it's working correctly. Now... what does Mako energy become when it's further condensed?"
"Cloud: Uh, umm...... Oh yeah! It becomes a Materia."
"Sephiroth: Right, normally. But Hojo put something else in there. ...Take a look."
Sephiroth: Look through the window.
Cloud: Wh... what is this!?
"Sephiroth: Normal members of SOLDIER are humans that have been showered with Mako. You're different from the others, but still human. But, what are they? They've been exposed to a high degree of Mako, far more than you."
Cloud: ...is this some kind of monster?
Sephiroth: Exactly. And it's Hojo of Shinra that produced these monsters. Mutated living organisms produced by Mako energy. That's what these monster's really are.
Cloud: Normal members of SOLDIER? You mean you're different?
"Cloud: H... hey, Sephiroth!"
Sephiroth: N... no...... ...Was I?
Sephiroth: ...Was I created this way too? Am I the same as all these monsters......
Cloud: ...Sephiroth.
Sephiroth: You saw it! All of them... were humans...
Cloud: Human!? No way!
"Sephiroth: ...I've always felt since I was small... That I was different from the others. Special, in some way. But... not like this..."
Cloud (narrating): Am I...... human? I didn't quite understand what Sephiroth was saying at that time. I was even more surprised by the fact that Shinra was producing monsters.
"Cloud (narrating): The next day, Cloud wakes late and runs out to join Sephiroth and the two soldiers at the start of the mountain path, just past the mansion. A few of the townsfolk are hanging around, too."
"Barret: Damn, Shinra! The more I hear, the more I hate 'em!"
Tifa: ......who would have ever thought the Mako Reactor held a secret like that.
Red XIII: That would seem to explain the increase in the number of monsters recently. I think we should listen carefully to Cloud. Don't you think so Barret?
Barret: (Why you talkin' to me!?)
"Barret: Yeah, mebbe so. Wanna take a breather here?"
Barret: ......I get it.
Barret: Hmph! Pokin' his damn nose in where it don't belong. Cloud! Why don't you finish that story?
Red XIII: (Phew......)
Aeris: Tifa... You were waiting outside then?
Tifa: ......Yes.
Cloud: We returned to Nibelheim. Sephiroth confined himself at the inn. He didn't even try to talk to me.
"Tifa: Then all of a sudden he just disappeared, right?"
Cloud: We found him inside the biggest building in Nibelheim.
Tifa: The villagers used to call it Shinra mansion.
"Cloud: Long ago, people from Shinra used to live in that mansion..."
NPC: What's Sephiroth doing?
"Zangan: There's nothing that'll harm the town, right?"
Cloud:...Why do you ask?
Zangan: The Shinra showed up to eliminate any information that could be an embarrassment to the company...
Zangan: you pick these things up when you travel as much as I do.
Cloud: It's Sephiroth. He would never do that.
Zangan: ...Oh my. You sure do have faith.
"Tifa's father: Until we know that there's no danger, we're not moving."
"NPC: There's no sign of Sephiroth, but I know I saw him go into this room..."
"Sephiroth: ...an organism that was apparently dead, was found in a 2000 year old geological stratum. Professor Gast named that organism, Jenova..."
"Sephiroth: X Year, X Month, X Day. Jenova confirmed to be an Ancient... X Year, X Month, X Day. Jenova Project approved. The use of Mako Reactor 1 approved for use..."
Sephiroth: My mother's name is Jenova... Jenova Project... Is this just a coincidence?
Sephiroth: Professor Gast... Why didn't you tell me anything? ...Why did you die?
Sephiroth: Let me be alone.
"Cloud (narrating): Sephiroth didn't come out of the Shinra Mansion... He continued to read as if he were possessed by something, and not once, did the light in the basement go out..."
NPC: Sephiroth seems different.
"Sephiroth: Ha, ha, ha......"
Sephiroth: Who is it!?
Sephiroth: Hmph... traitor.
Cloud: Traitor?
"Sephiroth: You ignorant traitor. I'll tell you. This Planet originally belonged to the Cetra. Cetra was a itinerant race. They would migrate in, settle the Planet, then move on... At the end of their harsh, hard journey, they would find the Promised Land and supreme happiness."
"Sephiroth: But, those that disliked the journey appeared. Those who stopped their migrations built shelters and elected to lead an easier life. They took that which the Cetra and the planet had made without giving back one whit in return! Those are your ancestors."
Cloud: Sephiroth...
"Sephiroth: Long ago, disaster struck this planet. Your ancestors escaped... They survived because they hid. The Planet was saved by sacrificing the Cetra. After that, your ancestors continued to increase. Now all that's left of the Cetra is in these reports."
Cloud: What does that have to do with you?
Sephiroth: Don't you get it? An Ancient named Jenova was found in the geological stratum of 2000 years ago. The Jenova Project.
"Sephiroth: The Jenova Project wanted to produce people with the powers of the Ancients...... no, the Cetra. ...I am the one that was produced."
Cloud: Pr... produced!?
"Sephiroth: Yes. Professor Gast, leader of the Jenova Project and genius scientist, produced me."
Cloud: How... how did he...?
Cloud: Se... Sephiroth?
Sephiroth: Out of my way. I'm going to see my mother.
Zangan: He---y! Is anyone here?
"Zangan: Hey it's you! You're still sane, right?"
Zangan: Then come over here and help me! I'll check this house. You check that one over there!
"NPC: ...Hey, Ummm... Am I going to die?"
NPC: ...Sephi... roth
Cloud: Terrible... Sephiroth... This is too terrible...
Tifa: Papa... Sephiroth!?
"Tifa: Sephiroth did this to you, didn't he!?"
Tifa: Sephiroth... SOLDIER... Mako Reactors... Shinra... Everything! I hate them all!
"Sephiroth: Mother, I'm here to see you. Please, open this door."
Tifa: How could you do that to papa and all the townspeople?
Tifa: ...You promised... You promised that you'd come...... when I was in trouble...
"Sephiroth: Mother, let's take this planet back together. I've thought of a great idea. Let's go to the Promised Land."
Cloud: Sephiroth... My family! My hometown! How could you do this to them!?
"Sephiroth: Ha, ha, ha...... They've come again, mother. With her superior power, knowledge, and magic, Mother was destined to become the ruler of this Planet."
Sephiroth: But they... Those worthless creatures are stealing the planet from Mother
Sephiroth: But now I'm here with you so don't worry
Cloud: What about MY sadness!? My family... friends... The sadness of having my hometown taken away from me!? It's the same as your sadness!
"Sephiroth: Ha, ha, ha... my sadness? What do I have to be sad about? I am the chosen one. I have been chosen to be the leader of this Planet."
Sephiroth: I have orders to take this planet back from you stupid people for the Cetra. What am I supposed to be sad about?
"Cloud: Sephiroth... I trusted you... No, you're not the Sephiroth I used to know!"
Cloud: ......and that's the end of my story.
Barret: Wait a damn minute! Ain't there more?
Cloud: ......I don't remember.
Aeris: What happened to Sephiroth?
"Cloud: In terms of skill, I couldn't have killed him."
Tifa: Official records state Sephiroth is dead. I read it in the newspaper.
"Aeris: Shinra, Inc. owns the paper, so you can't rely on that information."
Cloud: ......I want to know the truth. I want to know what happened then. I challenged Sephiroth and lived. Why didn't he kill me?
"Tifa: ......I'm alive, too."
"Aeris: Seems like a lot of this doesn't make sense. What about Jenova? It was in the Shinra building, right?"
Cloud: Shinra shipped it from Nibelheim to Midgar.
Aeris: Did someone else carry it out after that? It was missing from the Shinra building.
Tifa: Sephiroth......?
"Barret: Damn! Don't none of this make sense! I'm going, going, going, gone! And I'm leavin' the thinkin' to you!"
"Barret: Yo, Cloud! Let's get a move on!"
"Barret: Cloud, what's wrong? You just gonna stand there while Sephiroth heads for the Promised Land? I ain't lettin' Sephiroth or Shinra get to no Promised Land. If they do, then we're all screwed. Y'know what I'm sayin'!"
Barret: Y'all jes leave it to me!
Cloud: Oh brother......
Barret: Fine! That's good enough.
"Barret: Yo, c'mon let's go!"
Cloud: Oh brother......
Tifa: ......... Cloud...? How bad was I when Sephiroth cut me?
Cloud: I thought you were a goner. ......I was really sad.
Tifa: .........
Aeris: I... The Ancients...... Cetra...... Jenova...... Sephiroth and myself......
Tifa: Let's go. Barret's waiting.
Red XIII: What a fascinating story......
"Barret: Yo, Cloud. Here."
Aeris: Cloud. Take this.
"Tifa: Oh, Cloud. Let me give you this."
"On-screen: Received ""PHS""!"
On-screen: ( Changing party members ) Access the menu and select [PHS]. It can only be used on the World Map or at a Save Point.
"Aeris: With [PHS], I can see you any time!"
"Tifa: Just use [PHS], and you can contact any one of us easy."
"Red XIII: [PHS], will put us in constant contact with each other."
"Barret: Awright then, we're outta here."
"Aeris: Well, I'll be going."
Tifa: I'm going on ahead.
Choco Bill: Thinking of crossing the marshes?
"Choco Bill: Hmm, then it'll probably be safer for you to get a Chocobo. That way you can zip through the marshes with the Chocobo. It's the only way to avoid being attacked by the Midgar Zolom."
"Choco Bill: Midgar Zolom...? It's a serpent-like creature over 30 feet tall!! It picks up on footsteps that enter the marshes... And then, BAM!! It attacks!!!"
"Choco Bill: To avoid that, buy a Chocobo at the Choco Bill & Choco Billy Chocobo Farm. To purchase a Chocobo, please talk to my grandson. He's in the Chocobo stables at the far right end of the farm. By the way, there was another person heading towards the Marshes. Without a Chocobo, the Midgar Zolom probably got him. It was a man in a Black Cape."
"Choco Bill: Hmm, then, I guess that's that."
Chole: Welcome.
Choco Billy: Do you want a Chocobo?
Cloud: Mmm......
Choco Billy: You old folks are out of luck!
Cloud: Old folks...?
"Choco Billy: We're all out of Chocobos. I'm taking care of those ones out there for someone else. You know, if you really want a Chocobo, you should go out and catch one."
Choco Billy: Want to know how to catch a Chocobo?
"Choco Billy: You see those claw prints out there? Wild Chocobo's will appear in those areas. But, if you don't have 'Chocobo Lure' they won't come out. They very cautious animals by nature."
"Choco Billy: 'Chocobo Lure' is a type of materia which attracts Chocobos. If you equip this, they'll come to you. But, without it, they won't appear."
"Choco Billy: A wild Chocobo always appears with other monsters. But, you won't be able to catch it because of the monsters. That is why you must defeat the monsters first before you catch the Chocobo."
"Choco Billy: Also, wild Chocobos are really cautious. They'll run away from the slightest things. But, if you use 'Greens' They'll focus on that, and won't run away."
"Choco Billy: Whatever you do, don't make Chocobos angry. They're usually calm, but if you get them angry, you'll get hurt. Oh, and remember, once you get off a Chocobo, it'll escape."
"Choco Billy: Well then, shall we get down to business? I'll sell you the 'Chocobo Lure' for 2000 gil, right now. You want it?"
"Choco Billy: Thanks! It wouldn't hurt to buy some 'Greens' either. Oh, and how fast a Chocobo'll finish eating depends of what type of 'Greens' you feed them."
"Choco Billy: Mmmm, if you don't have it, you'll never catch one."
"Choco Billy: Oh, I'm so glad!"
"Chole: Wasn't it really expensive? But don't be mad at my brother or Grandpa. Ever since dad and mom died, it's been like this..."
Cloud: Did Sephiroth... do this......?
"Barret: This Sephiroth guy's pretty strong, I'd say."
Aeris: Our enemy is someone that could do this...?
Tifa: Amazing...
Red XIII: It's a power that we should respect...
Rude: Just a second!
"Barret: Wh, who are you!?"
"Aeris: By any chance, are you...?"
Tifa: Who are you?
Red XIII: ...... I hoped I'd never see you again...
Rude: Do you know who I am?
"Rude: Well if you know, then this won't take long."
Rude: ......I'm from the Turks. And don't you ever forget it.
Rude: It's difficult to explain what the Turks do...
"Cloud: Kidnapping, right?"
"Rude: To put it negatively... you could say that. ...But, that's not all there is to it, anymore."
Rude: ............
Rude: ............
"Elena: Sir! It's all right, Rude! I know you don't like speeches, so don't force it!"
"Rude: ...Then Elena, explain."
"Elena: I'm the newest member of the Turks, Elena. Thanks to what you did to Reno, we're short of people. ...Although, because of that, I got promoted to the Turks, ..."
"Elena: In any case, our job is to find out where Sephiroth is headed. And to try and stop you every step of the way."
"Elena: Wait a minute, it's the other way around... You're the ones that are getting in our way."
Tseng: ...Elena. You talk too much.
Elena: Mr. Tseng!?
Tseng: No need to tell them about our orders.
Elena: Sorry... Tseng.
Tseng: I thought I gave you other orders. Now go. Don't forget to file your report.
"Elena: Oh! Right! Very well, Rude and I will go after Sephiroth, who's heading for Junon Harbor!"
Tseng: ...Elena. You don't seem to understand.
"Elena: Oh! I'm, I'm sorry..."
Tseng: ...Go. Don't let Sephiroth get away.
Rude & Elena: Yes sir!
Rude: ...Reno said he wanted to see you after the injuries you gave him healed. He wants to show his affection for you all... with a new weapon.
"Tseng: Well, then..."
"Tseng: Aeris... Long time no see. Looks like you got away from the Shinra for a while, now that Sephiroth reappeared."
Aeris: ...so what are you saying? That I should be grateful to Sephiroth?
"Tseng: No... Well, I won't be seeing too much of you, so take care."
"Aeris: ...strange, hearing that from you."
"Tseng: Well then, stay out of Shinra's way."
Tseng: ...Where's Aeris? She's not with you?
Cloud: Aeris isn't with us. She's with the others.
Tseng: Oh... Then give her my regards.
Cloud: What happened to this town? It's so run-down...
"NPC: HEY! This is Shinra, Inc.'s elevator. Don't be snooping around here!!"
Priscilla: He-y! Mr. Dolphin! My name is...... Pri-scil-la! Now you say it.
"Priscilla: Who are you guys? Are you members of the Shinra, Inc.?"
Barret: No! You got it all wrong! We're fighting against the Shinra!
Tifa: No...stay calm...
Aeris: No you're wrong! We have nothing to do with the Shinra.
Red XIII: ...we don't get along well with the Shinra.
Yuffie: Hey watch your mouth! We hate the Shinra!
Cloud: ...that's how it is.
Priscilla: I don't believe you! Get out of here!
Cloud: Great...
Barret: Hey! Look at that!
Tifa: Look at that!
Aeris: What's that!?
Red XIII: Hey! It's a monster!
"Yuffie: Whoa, Gawd!"
Priscilla: Be careful Mr.Dolphin!
"Cloud: Hey! Hold on, we're coming!"
"(After defeating Bottomswell.)Cloud: This is bad... You don't think she's dead, do you?"
NPC: Priscilla!!
NPC: Nope...she's not breathing...
"NPC: Hey, that's it! Young man, CPR, now!"
Cloud: Mouth to mouth!?
Barret: C'mon Cloud.
"Tifa: Cloud, what are you going to do?"
"Aeris: Cloud, hurry!"
Red XIII: You know I can't.
"Yuffie: Do it, Cloud!"
"Cloud: But,... she's just a girl......"
"NPC: What? You don't know how? Come over here, I'll show you."
Cloud: Guess I gotta do it...
"NPC: Just take a deep breath, hold it in. Then breathe into her."
NPC: Hurry up and do it!
On-screen: Push the
Priscilla: Uh...ugh...
"NPC: Hey hey! Priscilla, are you alright?"
"NPC: Hey, come in for a while."
NPC: I heard what happened. You've done so much for Priscilla.
"NPC: You all must be tired. If you want to get some rest, stay here."
NPC: Make yourselves at home.
Tifa: Take a rest?
Barret: I'm gonna relax for a while.
Aeris: Want to rest?
Red XIII: Shall we rest?
Yuffie: Wanna rest?
Cloud: Yeah...
Cloud: Hmmm...
Grey text: ...That reminds me
Cloud: You again? ...Who are you?
"Grey text: ...You'll find out soon. ......But more importantly, 5 years ago..."
Cloud: 5 Years ago...Nibelheim?
"Grey text: When you went to Mt. Nibel then, Tifa was your guide, right?"
Cloud: Yeah...I was surprised.
Grey text: But where was Tifa other than that?
Cloud: ...I dunno.
Grey text: It was a great chance for you two to see each other again.
Cloud: ...You're right.
Grey text: Why couldn't you see each other alone?
Cloud: ...I don't know. I can't remember clearly...
Grey text: Why don't you try asking Tifa?
Cloud: ...Yeah.
"Grey text: Then, get up!"
"Tifa: Hey wake up. Wake up, Cloud!"
"Cloud: Tifa... When Sephiroth and I went to Nibelheim, where were you?"
"Tifa: ...We saw each other, right?"
Cloud: The other time.
"Tifa: No...it was 5 years ago. I don't remember. But, something seems strange outside. Cloud, come quick."
Tifa: Doesn't it seem a little strange? Everything getting so noisy all of a sudden...?
Aeris: I heard that girl regained consciousness.
Barret: Seems like something's goin' on up there!
Red XIII: Does this have something to do with the Shinra?
Yuffie: What's this loud music? It's giving me a headache!
Cloud: Are you all right now?
Priscilla: Umm...thanks for helping...
"Priscilla: I'm sorry , I mistook you for one of those Shinra, Inc...."
Cloud: That's all right.
Priscilla: I'll give you something SPECIAL!
"Priscilla: It's an amulet. Take good care of it, ok?"
"On-screen: Received ""Shiva"" Materia!"
"Priscilla: It's at my house, so come by later to pick it up, ok?"
Barret: What's that music? It sure sounds lively.
Priscilla: I heard they're rehearsing the reception for the new Shinra president.
Barret: Rufus!? I gotta pay my respects.
"Priscilla: Grandpa and grandma told me this beach was beautiful when they were small. But after the Shinra built that city above, the sun stopped shining here, and the water got polluted... I was raised on that story and hate Shinra so much, I could die!"
"Aeris: You think Rufus is thinking about crossing the ocean from here, too? What? Does that mean Sephiroth already crossed the ocean?"
"Red XIII: Cloud, didn't you finish Rufus off?"
Barret: We gotta get to the town up there... Mebbe we could climb the tower?
"Priscilla: No! No! There's a high voltage current running underneath the tower. Don't wander near it, it's dangerous!"
Priscilla: But...you might be able to if Mr.Dolphin helps you. Follow me!
Tifa: High voltage tower...... I guess this means Cloud'll be all right.
"Aeris: Yeah, better leave it to Cloud!"
"Red XIII: We're counting on you, Cloud"
Cloud: Hey!!
Cloud: Wait a second!
Tifa: Don't you just hate this?
Aeris: You're probably right.
"Barret: Yeah, I'd like to take a good look at the new President of Shinra, Inc.!"
Red XIII: That looks like a Shinra soldier.
Yuffie: Aren't you going to follow her?
Priscilla: Wait a minute.
Barret: Now ain't that something! I ain't never seen no Dolphin jump like that!
"Priscilla: Pretty cool, huh? When I blow this whistle, Mr.Dolphin jumps for me."
"Priscilla: Here!! This is for you, Cloud!"
Cloud: A gift? What am I supposed to do with it!?
"Priscilla: Just go into the water, blow this whistle, and Mr.Dolphin'll jump you to the top of the pole!"
Cloud: Jump to the top of the pole?
"Priscilla: See that rod sticking out at the top? If you jump just right, you can climb to the top of the town."
"Barret: Good luck Cloud! If you make it, we'll follow you!"
"Barret: Whoa, I'll hold the PHS for you. It'll break if it gets wet."
Priscilla: You wanna jump with Mr.Dolphin?
Priscilla: Come back whenever you want to see Mr.Dolphin!
Priscilla: Did you drown? It gets deeper the farther you go out.
Priscilla: There's high voltage running through the bottom of the tower. Don't go near it...
On-screen: Get out of the water?
NPC: Hey! You still dressed like that!? Come 'ere!
NPC: Hey! Rookie!! Can't you hear me!! Come over here!
NPC: Here!! Get in the room!
NPC: Today's the big day when we welcome President Rufus! Hurry up and change!
NPC: There's a uniform in the locker. Hurry and change!
Cloud: It's the Shinra uniform.
Cloud: There's Shinra soldiers all around. Better not try anything dumb...
NPC: Quit yappin'! Hurry up!
Cloud: Brings back memories...
NPC: Quit yappin'! Hurry up!
Cloud: A Shinra uniform... I was so proud when I first put it on.
Cloud: I wonder when it was... ...I couldn't stand wearing this thing anymore.
NPC 1: Wow! You look good in it!
"NPC 1: You remember the Greeting procedure, right!?"
"NPC 1: ...the look on your face says you forgot. All right, I'll show you again! Do just like we do."
NPC 2: Commander!! We'll help too! This is how to do it!
NPC 3: We'll sing too!
NPC 1: All right! Show 'em!!
"NPC 2: Now, march!! This's the Welcoming March!"
NPC 3: Then! I'll sing along with you!
"NPC 3: Quietly--!! Aaaaah! Aaaaah! Hey, come on now. Now!"
"NPC 1: And...march--!! One, two...! Three, four!"
Song (on-screen): Rufus--- Rufus Shinra----
NPC 1: Got it!?
NPC 1: All right! Once more!
NPC 1: Good! Make sure you do well at the real parade!
NPC 4: Rufus has arrived! Preparation completed!
"NPC 1: All right, show time! Don't disgrace yourselves!"
NPC: Begin the Welcome Parade!
"NPC: What? It's not time for our shift, yet. Just relax."
Cloud: Uh...yea......
NPC 1: Oh...no...!! No one's here!
NPC 1: Late---!?
NPC 1: Hey! Rookie!! It's because you're running around like that!!
NPC 2: Captain!! We'll take a short cut!
NPC 1: Right! Good idea. Get over here!!
NPC 1: Hey!! Don't get me any madder than I already am!
NPC 1: All right! You first!
"NPC 1: I'll go first! Now you watch close and do as I do, rookie! Just sneak into the back of the line when you see an opening."
"NPC 1: Now listen up! This parade's gonna be broadcast live on Shinra TV, around the world! If you look bad, the whole Junon army will look bad. Remember that and don't screw up!"
NPC 1: OK! Jump in when I give you the sign!
NPC 1: Just sneak in from the back! Don't mess up the row! And no matter what you do don't try to go in from the front!
NPC 1: All right!! Start marching!!
NPC 1: Charge--!!
"NPC 1: No, what're you doing!?"
NPC 1: Hey!! Don't play around!
NPC 1: Just GO! Then you just nonchalantly sneak in from the back! Make sure no one sees you!
NPC 1: Hey!! Don't run away from me!
"(Upon joining the line, spoken throughout, where XXX is the number called by the soldier when the line must hold their weapon up.)NPC: Now!! XXX......!"
TV Producer: What the hell was that soldier doing?
AD: I don't know.
TV Producer: Are the points up?
AD: This's terrible! Am...am I fired?
TV Producer: What!? You're FIRED!! Send that soldier a bomb or something!
"On-screen: Received ""Grenade""!"
"AD: Well, it's so-so."
TV Producer: Hmm... Better send that soldier something.
"On-screen: Received 6 ""Potion""!"
AD: So-so.
TV Producer: Really. I want somebody to send that soldier an expensive gift.
"On-screen: Received 6 ""Ether"""
AD: They just shot up!!
TV Producer: We did it! Send that soldier something special.
On-screen: Received 5000 gil!
"(After the previous lines, on the next screen.)NPC: Good! We made it."
NPC: Oh! President Rufus!
NPC: Hey! Line up and shut up! Don't make a move!
NPC: Hey!
Rufus: How's the job?
Rufus: What happened to the Airship?
Heidegger: The long range airship is still being prepared. It should be ready in about three more days. Gya haa haa!
Rufus: Even the Air Force's Gelnika?
Heidegger: ......Gya haa haa!
Rufus: Stop that stupid horse laugh. Things are different than when father was in charge.
Heidegger: Gya...
Rufus: Is the ship ready?
"Heidegger: Yes Sir, we'll get it ready quickly."
NPC 1: What a disaster.
NPC 2: Heidegger was really irritated...
"NPC 3: The man in the Black Cape's been roaming the city, but we can't find him."
Cloud: Man in a Black Cape?
"NPC 4: He showed up two or three days ago, and killed a few of our soldiers."
NPC 5: He disappeared right after that. There's a rumor going around that it was Sephiroth.
NPC 6: Attention! Dismissed!
NPC 6: Hey! Hey you! You messing with the army?
NPC 6: You're too lazy!! No break for you!!
NPC 6: Get over here!
"NPC 1: This is the military, soldier!! Your orders for today are to send off President Rufus at the dock! I'll keep drilling you until it's time!"
"NPC 2: I'll help, sir!"
"NPC 3: Me too, sir!"
NPC 1: All right!! Line up in order and show me your final pose! Today's command is Formation! Remember it!
"NPC 1: Ready!? Junon Military Send Off, BEGIN!"
On-screen: Left/Right: Left/Right Turn
NPC 2: All right!!
NPC 2: All right!!
NPC 2: All right!!
NPC 2: All right!!
NPC 2: All right!!
NPC 2: All right!!
NPC 1: All right! Now you try it!
"NPC 1: So, you got it?"
NPC 1: All right! Again!
NPC 1: All right! Don't mess up during the real thing!
NPC 2: Commander!! What's today's special pose?
NPC 1: Huh? ...I haven't decided yet.
"NPC 1: All right, rookie!! I'll let you decide! Show me your best move!"
Cloud: Let's see... My best move is...
NPC 2: Woo----ow!
NPC 3: That's awesome!
NPC 1: All right!! We'll go with that as today's special!! Practice it!
NPC 2: Yes sir!!
NPC 3: Yes sir!!
NPC 1: Well then! Meet at the dock!! Don't be late!!
NPC 1: Attention! Dismissed!!
"NPC: Oh! How's it going!? If you're looking for Junon dock, it's over there!"
NPC: This lift goes to the Shinra section... Ever since that Black-caped murderer... But we can't use it because we're all on red alert.
NPC: President Rufus is being sent off at the port.
"NPC: What is it? The elevator's out of order right now due to an inspection. You know, right under us, is a Submarine Dock and the Underwater Mako Reactor."
NPC: Mako energy puts a lot of wear and tear on the machinery. A lot of problems can pop up. So it's necessary for close inspections and maintenance.
"NPC: Come on, forget about your job! Step right up!!"
"NPC: Oh, a Soldier! Welcome!"
"Rude: Mm...? You too? Then, take your mask off and come here. That's our rule."
"NPC: Hey, how could you do that!? Nobody woke me up! And I can't find the uniform I left in my locker, either. I wonder if I left it somewhere..."
"NPC: Geez! Do you think this could be... what they call 'bullying?' Oh man, My future in the military, is pretty bleak."
NPC: Mmm? I'm not going to the parade. The road to becoming SOLDIER First Class is very difficult.
"NPC: Don't mind me. As a man with promise and future, I don't have any time to fool around like the rest of you."
Reno: The President's safety is secure because we're here.
Tseng: Stay outta this.
"Elena: The minute you think the job's boring, you guys start messing around."
"NPC: Hey soldier-boy, aren't you still on duty?"
NPC: Are you sure it's all right? Nap while on duty?
"NPC: Hey! Aren't you still on duty!? Look, I'm in no position to talk, but..."
NPC: Don't become a delinquent worker like me.
"NPC 1: All right, it's time! Ten...HUT!"
NPC 2: President Rufus...has now arrived!
"NPC 1: This is it!! Junon Military Reception--! Do it right---, Do it with enthusiasm...! Ready...!"
NPC 1: All right! Now finish strong!! SPECIAL---!!
"Rufus: Looks like you need more practice. With things looking like this, you better be ready for pay cuts..."
Heidegger: Gya haa ha...!! Here's a special bonus for you!! A token of the President's kindness! Don't forget it!
"On-screen:Received ""Silver Glasses""!"
Rufus: Very entertaining. Keep up the good work.
Heidegger: Gya haa ha...!! Here's a special bonus for you!! A token of the President's kindness! Don't forget it!
"On-screen: Received ""HP Plus"" Materia!"
"On-screen: Received ""Force Stealer""!"
"Rufus: Well done. Keep up the good work for Shinra, Inc."
Heidegger: Gya haa ha...!! Here's a special bonus for you!! A token of the President's kindness! Don't forget it!
"On-screen: Received ""Force Stealer""!"
"Rufus: Once the word gets out that Sephiroth's here, Cloud and his friends will show up, too."
Heidegger: We'll crush them as soon as we find them!
Rufus: We can't have them get in our way.
"Heidegger: Leave it up to me, sir! Gya haa ha!"
Rufus: I thought I told you to stop that stupid laugh...
Heidegger: Gya......
NPC 1: All right! Dismissed!
NPC 3: That was close.
NPC 4: Heidegger's been really edgy lately.
"NPC 3: Because Hojo disappeared, leaving a letter of resignation."
"NPC 4: Heidegger's been forced to take care of that investigation, too."
NPC 1: Hey--! I thought you were dismissed!
NPC 1: We got some cleaning up to do! Hurry up!
"Red XIII: Hey, hurry. You're the last one."
Cloud: How did you get here?
"Red XIII: A dolphin gave me a ride. Priscilla remembered the dolphin after you climbed the pole. But, you mustn't be mad at her."
"Cloud: We'll cross the ocean, to the new continent."
Cloud: ...even if we are wearing Shinra's uniforms...
"NPC: I'm workin' hard already, and you still want me to do more?"
NPC: The new President's probably the same. He's just gonna order us around anyway.
"NPC: Hey, get to work! Both the new President Rufus and Heidegger are aboard this ship! If we do good, we could get promoted!"
"NPC: Geez... What chance for a promotion. The only one who's gonna benefit from this is the Chief, anyway. It has nothing to do with us workers."
NPC: It won't do any good trying to stop me!
NPC: All right! I'm going to show the new President what I'm made of!
Yuffie: Urrrgh... This is why...I hate ships.
"Yuffie: Hey, Cloud. You have any 'Tranquilizers'?"
Yuffie: Thanks... Gross...this is bitter.
"Yuffie: Ugh, you don't have any? ...unless it's an emergency get away from me."
Yuffie: ...unless it's an emergency get away from me.
Yuffie: Where are the others? I dunno. Aren't they hiding somewhere around here? How should I know...? Ugh......urk......
Aeris: Umm......It's me Aeris.
"Aeris: Hey, Cloud. Did you see the Airship at Junon"
"Cloud: ...I heard it was big, but I didn't expect it to be THAT big."
"Aeris: That was REALLY something. Hey, do you think I could get on it?"
Cloud: ...keep hoping.
Aeris: Wow! I'm really looking forward to it!
Cloud: ...It's a Shinra weapon. We probably should've destroyed it.
"Aeris: ...Hmm. But just once, I'd like to ride it."
"Aeris: Let's ride the Airship together, OK? Promise, promise me!"
"Aeris: Just once, I'd like to ride that Airship."
"Aeris: Hey, Cloud. Did you see Barret? I hope he's not doing anything stupid..."
"Tifa: Yes sir! Everything quiet, sir!"
"Tifa: ...But, you know what? I really hate this uniform. Uniforms, soldiers, war, I hate 'em all. They take away all the things and people you love... I wish they'd all disappear. Right, Cloud?"
Tifa: You're right!
"Tifa: Uh, yes sir, I'll continue my watch sir! Hee hee..."
Tifa: ...Cloud. Wearing those clothes seems to have changed you a little. Does it remind you of being in SOLDIER? I hope not...
"NPC: Hey! What's wrong, kid? You got no pep! A seaman's gotta have umph!"
NPC: I got just the perfect thing! 'Invisible Alpha'-- A super drink for seamen!! Just one'll rejuvenate you! Only 250 gil!
NPC: Thanks! This is a necessity for a sailor. This is a must item for a sailor! Ha ha ha!
On-screen: HP/MP Restored!
NPC: Hey! You don't have enough money!
NPC: Hey! Seamen shouldn't be so stingy!
"NPC: Ey ey! Whattaya mean, 'missin'!?"
"NPC: President Rufus and his men are in the Bridge of the Ship. If they see you slacking, they'll bust you one!"
"NPC: Oh man, we're almost to Costa del Sol. When I get there, I'm going to take a long overdue vacation. Maybe I'll go down to the beach and get a tan..."
Red XIII: ....... ......It's me. Red XIII.
"Red XIII: I'm a little woozy, but I shouldn't get caught. Humans only look at appearances anyway. Anyway you look at it, I'd say I make a fine human being."
Red XIII: It's pretty hard standing on two feet...
"Barret: Look, Cloud. It's Rufus and Heidegger. They're this close but we can't do a thing to 'em..."
"Barret: Ummmm...... Gmmmmm...... How can he...... Goin' off laughin' like that? Because of him, Biggs...... Wedge...... Jessie......! Ggggggggh... Ggggh......! Ggggggghhh!!"
Barret: God!! I can't take it anymore! I'm gonna settle things here and now......
"On-screen: Emergency alert! Reports of a suspicious character found! Those not on detail, search the ship. Report when found!"
"On-screen: I repeat. Suspicious character found on board! Those not on detail, search the ship. Report when found!"
"Barret: Damn, did they find us!?"
"Barret: Hey, that don't seem like us. Do they mean...Tifa and the others!?"
"Barret: Get off your spikey butt and let's go, Cloud!"
(Upon talking to the party members after all gather on the deck.)Tifa: Everyone all right!?
Barret: You all right!?
Aeris: Huh?
Tifa: Everyone's here...right?
"Barret: Hey, wait. You don't think that suspicious character is... Sephiroth!?"
Tifa: Really!?
Barret: How the hell am I supposed to know!?
Cloud: ...Let's find out.
"Red XIII: It's the most logical thing to do. Then, who's going to go?"
"Yuffie: N, not me... I don't even like Sephiroth anyway. And besid......ugh......urk......"
"Cloud: ...... Sephiroth...... ......All right, let's go!"
Barret: I'm goin' too!
Tifa: Take me with you!
Aeris: Is it really Sephiroth......?
Red XIII: These clothes are too tight on me. Can I switch with you?
"Yuffie: I told you...I don't want... to, ugh......urk......"
"NPC: Say, who are you? You're not a part of the crew."
"NPC: Oh well, seamen never bother with details! How you feelin'!"
NPC: ...the Engine Room... ...a suspicious......character... No......there's no way...... that......not a human...... That thing's not human......
NPC: .........
Cloud: Is it......Sephiroth?
Cloud: No...not Sephiroth!
Sephiroth: ......After a long sleep... ...the time...... ...time has......come...
"Barret: Look, Cloud!!"
"Tifa: Cloud, look!!"
"Aeris: Look, Cloud!!"
"Red XIII: Over there, Cloud."
Yuffie: Ov......over there!!
Cloud: Sephiroth! You're alive!
Sephiroth: ......Who are you?
Cloud: You don't remember me!? I'm Cloud!
Sephiroth: Cloud...
Cloud: Sephiroth! What are you thinking!? What are you doing!?
Sephiroth: ...the time......is now...
Cloud: What!? What are you saying!? Be more......
Barret: Isn't he......that guy?
Tifa: I've seen this somewhere...before.
Aeris: I've seen this before...
Red XIII: That's what disappeared from the Shinra building...
Yuffie: Eeeew! What IS it! GROSS!
Cloud: ...Jenova. The arm of Jenova.
Barret: Jenova...You mean he's been walkin' around with that thing?
Tifa: Jenova... He's been carrying this thing around?
Aeris: Jenova... With this thing?
Red XIII: Sephiroth took Jenova... What does it mean?
Yuffie: Gag... I'm feeling sick as it is without you having to show me THIS...
Cloud: So it WAS Sephiroth.
Barret: He said the time is now.
Tifa: He said something about it being time for something.
Aeris: The time is now... I think that was what was said.
Red XIII: The time is now...? What does that mean?
Yuffie: He was mumbling something about time!
Cloud: ......Time...is now?
"Barret: I don't know WHAT the hell's goin' on! Cloud, why don't you explain to me what's happened so far?"
"Tifa: I'm getting so confused... Cloud, explain what's happened so far."
"Aeris: Hmm... I don't get it. Hey, Cloud. Can you explain it to us?"
"Red XIII: Hmm... The story's not that simple. Cloud, why don't you summarize what's happened so far?"
Yuffie: So what's the story? Hey Cloud. Give us a quick run down.
"Cloud: ...I'll try, but don't interrupt me while I'm explaining."
"Cloud: Sephiroth went off searching for the Promised Land, so he could become the ruler of the planet... That was 5 years ago. Then Sephiroth came back and killed President Shinra. And then just now all of us saw Sephiroth."
"Cloud: He was carrying Jenova with him. ...This much I do know. He told me he wants to go to the Promised Land with his mother, Jenova."
Cloud: ...I guess that's about it.
On-screen: Dock workers--We will be docking in Costa del Sol in 5 minutes. Prepare for docking.
Barret: Whoa! We'd best hurry and hide somewhere.
Tifa: We should hide somewhere again.
Aeris: Maybe we shouldn't stay in here anymore...
Red XIII: I don't think it's wise to stay here any longer.
Yuffie: Phew... We're finally here... Now we gotta hide......
Cloud: Sephiroth... is alive... The Promised Land... Does it really exist...?
Barret: Damn! Sure is hot here! But I sure feel better now that I can say good-bye to this sailor suit.
Barret: Yo listen up!! Y'all be sure to mingle like regular folks here!
"Aeris: Oh, too bad. I liked Barret's sailor suit. He looked so cute."
"Barret: ......What'ya mean ""cute""?"
"Tifa: Right...well, uh... Barret, why don't you use that sailor suit for pajamas? Right, Cloud?"
Cloud: Ahhh...... You look like a bear wearing a marshmallow.
"Barret: The hell's that supposed to mean!? This happens to be the most comfortable, so shu'up!"
"Cloud: Remember, this isn't a vacation. We're here after Sephiroth. I'm going on ahead."
"Barret: Hmmph, Cloud. You're the one, who's always hangin' around wastin' time. I'm going to skip this resort!"
Red XIII: ...puff...puff... Would you kindly hurry? The heat here is drying my nose.
"Yuffie: Yeah, mine, too!!"
Cloud: All right. We'll take a break and then head off. Don't wander too far off.
Barret: I'll wander wherever I damn well want! Who made him the leader?
Red XIII: It looks like my mane got messed up. I'm going to rest somewhere cool.
Yuffie: Don't bother looking for me!
Tifa: I think I'll go swimming.
Aeris: Sounds good to me!
"Aeris: Hmm? Cloud, are you thinking of anything in particular? Your cool exterior's cracking..."
"Aeris: Well then, let's go!"
"Aeris: Maybe I should get a tan for a change. Which do you like, Cloud?"
Aeris: Got it. I'll remember that.
NPC: What a long boat ride that was!!
Rufus: Hmmm...... Good work everyone......
"Heidegger: Gya, Heh, heh..., ha!! Hurry up with that!"
"NPC: Yes, sir!!"
Rufus: I heard Sephiroth was on board.
Heidegger: ......Yes.
"Rufus: And it seems Cloud and the others were on board, too."
Heidegger: ......Yes.
"Rufus: They all slipped through...... You messed up big this time, Heidegger."
Heidegger: I'm ashamed of myself.
Rufus: Is that all you can do...? Give one word answers and apologize for everything?
"NPC: Ready for departure, sir!!"
Rufus: ......Do something. I'll be expecting results.
"Red XIII: Hm, that's interesting. It's not as if I'm doing this because I want to. You see, this tail of mine, moves quite independently of my will."
Red XIII: Grrr...... Grrrrr.........
Yuffie: Orders are taken at the counter.
"Yuffie: Ah, Cloud! Let me make a buck why don't you? I'm sellin' Materia. Why don't you buy some!?"
Johnny: What's with YOU!!
"Johnny: Hey, is it.........you? We were in SOLDIER, and childhood friends before that. You were such a playboy. And a $#&^ murderer!! Why can't I remember your name?"
"Johnny: That's right. Long time no see. Do you remember me? That's okay. We'll just keep on like we don't know each other. I'm starting a new life in this town. A lot of things happened to us. Heh, I better stop my mumbling! I sure envy you all just living outside with the sky as your ceiling."
"Johnny: You think you're good enough to go around bragging about who you are? I don't wanna hear it! Heh, no more mumbling from me! From now on, I'm starting a new life!"
NPC: I'm sorry about that. He's had some big shocks lately and is pretty depressed.
Johnny: Hurry up and get out of here! I'm happy like this. So keep out of my life. (Upon entering the Costa del Sol inn.)
Barret: Uh uh!
Barret: Hmmm!?
Barret: Marlene! You ok?......
Barret: Dad'll wear this when I go to see you.
Barret: Uh uh!
"Barret: Hey, yo!!! Someone's in here, awright!?"
NPC: Uggh! I feel God awful! Oh!! You! Weren't you the one with that big sailor?
Cloud: What's the matter?
"NPC: Listen to this... All of a sudden, this big sailor just busts in here, and takes over the restroom. He's been in there moaning ever since. I don't know what I'm gonna do."
Cloud: I don't know.
"NPC: Wrong guy? It puts us in a bad situation. That guy's taken over the john. And he hasn't even paid his hotel bill yet. Ah......if you're checking in, would you please pay his bill, too?"
"Barret: Yo, Cloud! Still too early, ain't it?"
NPC: Come on now... He's a friend of yours......fibber.
NPC: What now? Call it a night? 200 gil a night.
NPC: Shucks!! Too bad!
NPC: Hey! Hey you! Does your friend have a cute lady? She came in here looking for him a while ago. Shouldn't you find her?
NPC: What are you going to do? Just forget about her and go to bed? 200 gil a night.
NPC: You look like you can handle it. Well then......
NPC: That's right. Don't worry. Please come by again.
Aeris: Oh! Cloud!!
"Tifa: Look, look at that!"
Cloud: Hm...?
"Cloud: Is that man over there, Hojo?"
Tifa: Go over and talk to him.
Cloud: Not a bad view......
Tifa: What're you looking at? That man over there. That's Hojo from Shinra. Get outta here Go talk to him!
Tifa: Go over and talk to him.
Aeris: I have a bad feeling about this.
NPC 1: heh heh...... All the good ones are gone.
NPC 2: What about that one? Shall we make do with her?
NPC 1: But she's got a guy with her.
"NPC 2: No problem, I can handle him."
"NPC 1: Right? You thought so, too?"
NPC 2: Geez! What about those two?
NPC 1: Heh heh......I want the one on the left.
"NPC 1: Well then, I guess that leaves me with the one on the right."
NPC: God!! What do you want?
"NPC: (Hey, who do you think you are?)"
NPC: Professor Hojo. That scary man says he wants to talk with you.
NPC: (What's his problem?)
"NPC: Yes, that's right. It's the Professor!"
"NPC: Professor... someone's here to see you, sir."
Hojo: I'm busy right now. ......But. Too bad.
"Hojo: No, I remember you all now......"
"Hojo: Yes, yes. I remember now. It's been a long time, Cloud."
"Hojo: Heh heh heh...... All right. You sure are loud. Long time no see, Cloud."
Cloud: Hojo......
Hojo: Sometimes you just gotta do something like this.
Cloud: ......What are you doing?
"Hojo: It should be obvious, I'm getting a tan."
Cloud: Answer me!
Hojo: Hmm! I believe we're both after the same goal.
Cloud: You mean Sephiroth?
Hojo: Did you see him?
Hojo: I see......Ha! Ha!
Cloud: What is it?
Hojo: Nothing. I just remembered a certain hypothesis...... Haven't you ever had the feeling something is calling you? Or that you had to visit some place?......
Cloud: I'll go anywhere Sephiroth is at! To beat him and put an end to all this!
Hojo: I see...... This could be interesting. Were you in SOLDIER?......Heh heh heh! Would you like to be my guinea pig?
"Hojo: Oh, now what? Are you going to draw your sword?"
"Barret: Yo, yo! It's a bad idea to kill him."
"Tifa: Stop, Cloud! I know how you feel, but you mustn't."
"Aeris: Cloud, don't. If he dies, we won't find out anything!"
"Red XIII: ...huff...puff... Stop, Cloud!"
"Yuffie: Knock it off, Cloud! Look I don't know, but he knows a lot of stuff, right?"
Hojo: Ha! Ha! Ha!......
"Hojo: Say, aren't you the 'Ancient'?"
"Aeris: I'm Aeris. The least you can do is remember my name. I want you to tell me something, Professor Hojo... I know I'm an Ancient. My mother told me."
"Hojo: Your mother? Oh, you mean Ifalna. How is she?"
Aeris: You didn't know!? She died.
Hojo: ......I see.
Aeris: Professor Hojo... Is Jenova an Ancient? Is Sephiroth an Ancient? Do we all have the same blood?
Hojo: ......mumble...mumble...head west......
Aeris: He's mumbling slowly... That must means he's hiding something!
Hojo: ..................
"Red XIII: Grrr, Grrr......... ...huff...puff..."
Tifa: Hey! Answer us!!
Cloud: ......It's no use. It's no go.
Hojo: ..................
"Tifa: Oh, right! I remember that, too."
"Johnny: Yeah, yeah! And you remember the time when......?"
"Tifa: Hee, hee, hee!"
"Johnny: Ha, ha, ha!......"
"Tifa: Ha, ha...oh stop it! That's right. Oh really......"
"Johnny: Yeah. Oh yeah, and then that time......"
"Tifa: Yeah, yeah!"
"Tifa: Cloud, would you mind leaving us alone for the day? We haven't seen each other for ages and sometimes it's fun to talk about old times for a change."
Tifa: We'll try not to be too late. So please don't worry about us!
Cloud: I'm not worried.
Tifa: You're right......
Cloud: Just remember we're leaving early tomorrow.
"Tifa: Ok, I know."
"Johnny: Yeah, so don't get mad or anything."
Aeris: Whew... I don't know why I'm so tired. There's so many things I don't understand...... I feel a little uneasy.
Aeris: Cloud...? What do you think of me?
Cloud: I don't understand anything.
"Aeris: ......You're right. Even I don't understand myself. I wonder what part of me is like an Ancient? What is an Ancient supposed to be like? It's strange, isn't it? I don't understand it...... Ahh......I'm going around in circles. I wonder if there's any answer to this. Everything's so complicated."
Aeris: I'm going on to bed.
"Cloud: Sorry, but I never thought about things like that."
"Aeris: How could you say such a thing! Sometimes you make me so mad! Oh, I never should have brought this up!!"
Aeris: I don't want to talk about it!
NPC: Welcome!! What's it going to be? 200 gil a night.
On-screen: Cradled by the sound of the ocean waves...... Sweet dreams...
NPC: Good morning. Be careful traveling.
"NPC: Your party has departed. Oops...... That's bad luck...... I mean, they have already left."
NPC: Wait a minute! There's not enough money here.
NPC: Are you sure? Please come again.
NPC: Whew!! Hey! You're actually talking to me.
Cloud: What is it?
"NPC: I just passed a guy in a black cloak back there. I just tried to tell him that it's dangerous up ahead, and he ignored me!"
Cloud: Sephiroth...
Tifa: Let's hurry on.
"Aeris: There was a black-cloaked guy here, too?"
Red XIII: Hmm...... I'm moving on ahead...
"Yuffie: Oh gawd, what a drag!!"
Barret: ............ahh.
NPC: It's dangerous up ahead. Be careful on your way.
"NPC: If any strangers should greet you warmly while traveling, make sure to greet them back."
NPC: Whew! I guess that's the fun of being on the road.
"On-screen: Oh, oh oh oh oh!! Push the"
On-screen: Get the treasure by holding the Left or Right Direction buttons down while repeatedly pressing the
Tifa: OH!! Cloud! That's it!
Tifa: We can't go on until the bridge is let down. I think there's a switch in that shack over there... But there's too many monsters around and I'm beat...
On-screen: The shack is here!! (^^);
"Aeris: Come on, Cloud. Let's rest a minute."
"Red XIII: Wha? Oh, it's you."
Red XIII: There seems to be an instrument in that hut that manipulates this bridge. Perhaps it's best if we rest a moment.
On-screen: The shack is here!! (^^);
Aeris: Cloud!!
"Aeris: I was just wishing you were here! Unless someone lets down the bridge, we're stuck. Cloud should be able to do something. But let's take a breather first."
On-screen: The shack is here!! (^^);
"Cloud: Ok, then..."
Barret: ......whew!
Tifa: I'm beat...
"Aeris: I'm sure glad I'm with you, Cloud!"
Red XIII: What...?
Yuffie: I'm pooped!
Tifa: Cloud!! Go Cloud!! Go!!
"Aeris: Oh, Cloud!! Good Luck!!"
"(Upon reaching the shack.)Cloud: OW!! Sure is tight in here... Come on, Cloud, don't let it get to you. Let's see...this is it."
Cloud: Maybe if I turn this... ...something should happen.
Aeris: How cute!!
Tifa: Yes!! ...how cute.
"Tifa: Oh, cute!!"
Barret: Haaeyy!
Yuffie: Yeow! What a rock!!
Red XIII: huff...huff...
Cloud: What should we do?
Cloud: Times are tough... I'm taking the treasure.
Tifa: Oh! Cloud! Your hair looks like a Chocobo!
Aeris: Cloud......
Barret: Haeey!! Baaeby!!
Yuffie: Come to mommy!!
Red XIII: Glu...glug...!
Cloud: ...it's got nothing to do with us. Just forget about it.
Tifa: Right! That was admirable of you.
Aeris: Cloud......
Yuffie: You kiddin'?
Barret: Haeey!! Baaeby!!
Red XIII: Glu...glug...!
NPC: Hey! How'd you ever wind up around here?
"NPC: Look, I'm sorry but, I can't do a thing for you!"
NPC: Oh boy!! Corel sure has gone to pot. It used to be a famous coal mining town!
"NPC: They say there were more jobs than you could shake a... Well, you get the picture!"
"NPC: Now, it's nothing but a miserable pit! Me, my bulldozer...everything's out of work."
NPC: Got no job...I can't even show my face. 'Bout all that's left for me is to just live in this hole all day.
"NPC 1: You, you're..."
NPC 2: Hey!! He's back!
Barret: Wait here...
"NPC 1: Well, lookey here! Never thought I'd ever see your face again."
"NPC 1: Those people over there, they with you? Well, I feel sorry for 'em! Hangin' around a walkin' death sentence like Barret."
"NPC 1: Well, lookey here! Never thought I'd ever see your face again."
NPC 2: They kick you out of another town or somethin'? You destroy everything you touch.
NPC 3: You got a lot of balls comin' back here! Look at this place! It's all your fault North Corel turned into a garbage heap!
NPC 2: Why doncha say something!? Or did ya forget what you done here already?
Barret: ...I'm sorry...
NPC 3: ^%$#! You ain't even worth the effort.
NPC 2: Don't waste your time talkin' to that Techno-freak!
Barret: You heard 'em... It's my fault this town was...destroyed...
"Aeris: Barret, what happened?"
Barret: Sorry.
Cloud: What happened?
Barret: My hometown used to be around here.
Red XIII: What do you mean 'used to'?
Barret: It ain't here no more. Heard it got buried... in just 4 years.
Aeris: But how could those people say those terrible things?
Barret: An' it's my fault. ALL my fault.
"(During flashback in Corel.)Barret (narrating): ...My hometown, Corel's always been a coal mining town. It's so dusty, but calm and so poor...... A real small town, this one. That's the first time I ever heard the word ""Mako Reactor"" mentioned since that time..."
Village Headman: What are we going to do? The only one against this is Dyne...
"Dyne: I am definitely against it, no matter what. There's nothing to talk about if you're thinking of throwing away our coal!"
"Dyne: Our coal's been protected for generations. Our fathers, and theirs before them, risked their lives for it. We have no right to throw it all away so easily!"
"Barret (in flashback): But listen, Dyne. No one uses coal nowadays. It's the sign of the times."
"Scarlet: Right, everything is Mako, now."
"Scarlet: It'll be all right, Dyne. Shinra, Inc. will guarantee your livelihood once the Mako Reactor is completed."
"Barret (in flashback): Listen, Dyne. I don't want my wife, Myrna, to suffer anymore."
"Dyne: I know how you feel! I feel the same way too, damn it! But even so, I won't give away our coal mines!"
Village Headman: Dyne...you've got to understand.
Barret (narrating): That's how the Corel Reactor was built......and completed. We all thought it would bring us an easier life.
Barret (narrating): It happened when Dyne and I were out of town for a few days. Corel was burned down by the Shinra troops. All the townspeople... All my relatives...... Everyone...everything......
Cloud: Shinra troops? What for!?
Barret: There was an explosion at a reactor. Shinra blamed the accident on the people. Said it was done by a rebel faction.
Tifa: That's so terrible!
"Barret: Well, I guess that's true. But more than Shinra, I couldn't forgive myself. Never should've gone along with the building of the reactor..."
Tifa: Don't blame yourself. We were all fooled by the promises Shinra made back then.
"Barret: That's why... that's why I get so pissed off!! Not only did they take advantage of me...... But I lost my wife, Myrna, too..."
"NPC: Hey everyone! If you want to go to the 'Gold Saucer', hurry and get on!"
NPC: Ride the Ropeway?
Cloud: Let's get on.
Barret: Dyne was my best friend. We was close ever since we was kids...
Tifa: I never knew. Barret never said a thing...
Aeris: .........
Red XIII: .........
"Yuffie: I'm not sympathizing with Barret! He never should have trusted Shinra, Inc...."
Tifa: .........
Tifa: We better go on!
Barret: Dyne was my best friend. We was close ever since we was kids...
Yuffie: I'm waiting inside.
Aeris: Everything Shinra does seem to make everyone miserable...
Barret: It's all my fault...
Tifa: I never knew. Barret never said a thing...
Red XIII: .........
NPC: Please buy your ticket here.
NPC: Welcome to the Gold Saucer.
"NPC: Are you together? A single pass is 3000 gil, or you can purchase a lifetime pass for 30000 gil."
"NPC: Thank you very much. If you leave Gold Saucer, your tickets become invalid."
"NPC: Thank you very much. If you have a Gold Ticket, you can come and go freely into the park...as long as you don't lose it."
"NPC: I'm sorry, you don't have enough money."
"NPC: Here at the Gold Saucer, there are many places where you must pay with GP. Just think of 'GP' as money that you can only use at the Gold Saucer. GP can only be redeemed at the games in Wonder Square and at the Chocobo Races. Your GP limit is 10000, so please be careful. Please enjoy yourselves."
Aeris: Wow! Let's have fun!
Aeris: I know this isn't the right time to do this.
"Aeris: Hey, Barret, cheer up!"
Barret: ......I ain't in no cheery mood. So jes' leave me alone.
Aeris: Really? That's too bad.
Aeris: Let's go!
"Tifa: ...whisper...whisper... (Wasn't that a little harsh, Aeris!?)"
Aeris: ...whisper...whisper... (Just act normal when this happens)
Tifa: ...whisper... (You think so...?)
Aeris: Of course!
Aeris: We're gonna go play...
Barret: So PLAY! ...messin' round #@^%$! Don't forget we're after Sephiroth!
Aeris: ...I think he's mad.
Tifa: He'll be fine. He seems to be doing a little better now.
"Tifa: We'd better be careful, Sephiroth might be around."
Aeris: I wish we could just forget everything and have fun!
Red XIII: ......You want to go with me?
Yuffie: With me!?
Aeris: Cloud!
"Aeris: Don't go alone, go with me!"
Tifa: Cloud!
Tifa: I'll go with you.
Yuffie: Cloud!
"Yuffie: Let's go together, Cloud!"
Red XIII: Cloud!
Red XIII: Don't go by yourself...
"Tifa: Hey, Cloud, Are we going back without the others?"
Aeris: Are you thinking of just us going back?
Red XIII: Are we leaving the others?
Yuffie: Cloud! Are we just going to leave the others?
Man: Hey boy.
Cloud: Boy...
Man: How is it? You having fun?
"Man: Mmm, so, you ARE having fun. Well, good, good for you boy."
Cloud: My name's Cloud. And stop calling me boy.
Dio: Mmm? Me? I'm the owner of the Gold Saucer. The name's Dio. Just call me 'Dio'.
Cloud: ......(Not even listening)
"Dio: By the way, boy, do you know what a 'Black Materia' is?"
"Dio: Oh, so you do know."
"Dio: Ha ha ha ......that, I say, that's a good one, boy! But it's not good to lie. You can't fool me."
Cloud: Why d'you ask me?
"Dio: Well, a while back, a boy your age came in and asked me if I had a 'Black Materia.'"
"Dio: I thought you might know who he was, seein' as how you're both about the same age."
Cloud: Did he happen to have... a Black Cape...
"Dio: Why yes, yes indeed. And a tattoo on his hand that said '1'."
Cloud: Where did he go!?
"Dio: Ha ha ha, I have no idea."
"Dio: Well then. I say, stop by the Battle Arena if you like, boy. You'll probably like it. Many of my collections are on display there."
"Dio: Ha, ha ha."
Aeris: What happened?
Tifa: What?
Red XIII: What happened?
Yuffie: What is it?
Cloud: Sh...!
Cloud: Shinra soldiers... Even here...
NPC: Attention! Dismissed!!
Cait Sith: Hey you!! What're you lookin' so down for!?
Cait Sith: How 'bout it? Want me to read your fortune!? A bright future! A happy future!
"Cait Sith: Oh, but don't hold it against me if it's not a great prediction!"
"Cait Sith: Oh, so sorry! I'm a fortune telling machine. The name's..."
Cloud: You can only read the future?
"Cait Sith: You kidding!? I can find missing things, missing people, anything!"
Cloud: Then can you tell me where a man named Sephiroth is?
"Cait Sith: Sephiroth, right!? Okay, here goes!!"
"Cloud: ...Ordinary luck. It will be an active fortune. Give into the good will of others, and something big'll happen after summer. ...wait...what's this?"
Cait Sith: Huh? Let me try again.
Cloud: Be careful of forgetfulness. Your lucky color is...blue? ...Forget it.
"Cait Sith: Wait, wait give me another chance! Wait! Let me try it again!"
Cloud: ...What the!?
Tifa: What does it say?
Aeris: What?
"Red XIII: Read it out loud, Cloud"
Yuffie: What is it! Tell us!
Cloud: What you pursue will be yours. But you will lose something dear.
Cait Sith: I don't know if it's good OR bad... This's the first time I ever got something like THIS.
Cait Sith: Then shall we?
Tifa: Excuse me?
Aeris: What are you talking about?
Red XIII: To where?
Yuffie: Huh?
"Cait Sith: As a fortune teller, I can't help but think about this. If I don't see what it leads to, I won't be able to relax. That's why I'm going with you!"
"Tifa: Is it all right, Cloud?"
"Aeris: What are we going to do, Cloud?"
"Red XIII: Cloud, it's all right with you?"
"Yuffie: He's weird! Cloud, don't let him come!"
Cait Sith: I'm comin' with you no matter WHAT you say!
Cloud: H...hey!
Cloud: Mm!?
Cloud: Dead......
Tifa: What!?
Tifa: Wa...wait Cloud!
Aeris: What!? Why?
Aeris: Cloud!? Where are you going?
Red XIII: What the...
"Red XIII: Hey, Cloud!"
Yuffie: Wh...why?
"Yuffie: Don't, don't just leave me!"
Cloud: Did Sephiroth do this!?
Cloud: No...it's not him... They're all shot... Sephiroth would never use a gun...
"NPC: Ugh, ugggh."
"Cloud: Hey, what happened!"
NPC: Ugh...ugh...a man with a gun...on his arm......
Tifa: A gun on his arm!?
Aeris: It can't be!?
Red XIII: ...did he!?
"Yuffie: Wow, that's somethin!!"
NPC: Hold it right there! And stay quiet!!
Dio: Did you guys do this!?
"Cloud: N...no, it wasn't us!"
Dio: I must've been wrong...
"Cait Sith: Hurry and run, it's gonna get ugly."
Cloud: He......hey!
Dio: Hold them!!
Dio: That's as far as you go.
"Cloud: Wait, listen to..."
Cait Sith: Cloud...
Dio: One more to go.
NPC: Yes
Cloud: Hey! Pay attention!!
Dio: There's no need to listen. Pay for your crime down below!!
Dio: Do it!
NPC: Yes
"Tifa: Cloud, you all right?"
Aeris: You all right?
Red XIII: Are you all right?
"Yuffie: Hey, you okay?"
Cloud: Where are we?
Cait Sith: A desert prison... Corel Prison...
Cloud: A desert prison?
"Cait Sith: Yup, a natural prison in the middle of the desert... surrounded entirely by quicksand. I heard that once you get in, you never get out... But, there was one special exception..."
Tifa: Barret!?
Aeris: Hey!! Barret!!
Red XIII: Mmm!? Isn't that Barret?
"Yuffie: Hey? Isn't that guy, Barret?"
Cloud: Barret... Did he really......
Barret: Stay back! This's something I gotta deal with. Jes' leave me alone...
Cait Sith: Whew! That's one of your friends? He sure looks dangerous...
Tifa: ...Barret......
"Aeris: Cloud, what should we do? Barret's not his normal self."
Red XIII: Barret...
"Yuffie: Hey, Cloud! Just leave him alone. I mean, he told us to, didn't he? Then that's that, right?"
Cloud: We should find Barret before we go out into the desert.
NPC: Wo-ho! Welcome to Corel Prison.
"NPC: Hold---it. If you wanna pass, Then you're gonna need the boss's permission."
Cloud: This one's been shot too...
NPC: Ha ha ha
"NPC: I'll tell you one thing, rookie. This desert is extremely dangerous. It'll welcome you in, but when you try to leave, it'll swallow ya. I hear tell, some of them never make it out... the best thing is to stay out of the desert entirely."
NPC: Want to enter the Chocobo Race?
NPC: You thinkin' of livin' here forever? Then live a long life!
NPC: Then go get permission with the boss of this place.
Cloud: Who's the boss?
NPC: You don't even know that? Oh man.
"NPC: This elevator will take you to the top... But, you gotta be picked as a Chocobo Racer, first."
"NPC: Those guys only tell lies. Only lies. Not a one of 'em will tell you the truth. Just talk with 'em a couple of times, and you'll get sick of them."
NPC 1: This place is heaven.
NPC 2: This place is heaven.
NPC 3: This place is heaven.
NPC 1: Man with a gun on his arm?
NPC 1: Never heard of him.
NPC 2: Never heard of him.
NPC 3: Never heard of him.
NPC 1: You wanna see the Boss?
NPC 1: Go Southwest and you'll meet him.
NPC 2: You'll meet him.
NPC 3: You'll meet him.
"NPC 1: Once out in the desert, stay still and don't walk."
NPC 2: Don't walk
NPC 3: Don't walk
NPC 1: There's no way you'll ever see a mysterious Chocobo carriage. No way.
NPC 2: No way.
NPC 3: No way.
NPC: You new? Then go and pay your respects to Mr. Coates.
"NPC: More respects again? You sure are formal, go ahead..."
Mr.Coates: Never seen your face 'round here before. Goin' up?
Mr.Coates: Heh heh! You sure got guts!
"Mr.Coates: You don't seem to understand how things work down here. This is the Gold Saucer's garbage dump. And that makes alluv ya scrubs. The only way to get back up there is to win the Chocobo Race. But, it's not as easy as you rookies think. Of course, if you got the boss's permission it'd be a different story but, YOU'll never get that! Ha ha ha ha."
Cloud: Looks like we could get some sleep here.
"NPC: A rookie? Then you gotta buy something. Yup, that's the rule here."
Barret: Didn't I tell you not to come here!?
Cait Sith: Ju......just hold on for a second! We just want to talk! You'll understand if you just hear us out!
Barret: Didn't want none of ya to get involved...
"Aeris: Hey that's Cloud's line! '...It's too dangerous, I can't let you get involved...' blah, blah, blah..."
Tifa: Yeah. We're already involved in this.
"Aeris: We saw you and hurried here. Barret, just tell us what's going on."
"Tifa: We saw you and hurried here. So come on Barret, just tell us what's going on."
Barret: You guys...
Red XIII: I heard that the murders at the Battle Arena were done by a man with a gun-arm. ...Was that you?
Barret: There's another... another man that got a gun grafted inta one of his arms. It was four years ago...
Barret (narrating): I remember... I was on my way home from visiting a Mako Reactor being built.
NPC: Barret! Dyne! Come quick! The village's being attacked! It's Shinra soldiers!
Barret (in flashback): What!!!?
Barret (in flashback): What the hell happened?......
"Dyne: Hey, Barret! It's not over yet! Everyone's waiting! Let's go back to the village!"
NPC: Barret! Dyne! Protect the village...!
Barret (in flashback): Hmp!! Old man!!
"Dyne: C'mon, Barret! We gotta hurry!"
Barret (in flashback): Krggh!!
Dyne: Barret!! You stay here!!
"Scarlet: Kyaa haa, ha!! You can shoot all day and never hit them with aim like that."
Barret (in flashback): Shu' up!!
"Scarlet: Haa, ha, ha!! Stop playing around and cover me!!"
Dyne: Watch out!!
"Barret (in flashback): Dyne!! Hang on!! Lissen to me!! You're comin' back to the village, hear!!?"
Dyne: Yeah... I ain't lettin' go... You're comin' back... Everyone's waitin' for ya... Eleanor... and Marlene... They all waitin' on us...
"Barret: From then on, I couldn't use my right arm no more. ...I was depressed for a while. But then I threw away my artificial arm and got this gun grafted in. Got a new right arm to get revenge on the Shinra, who took everything away..."
"Barret: Back then, I heard the doc say there was another man who got the same operation as me. But, his was the left arm."
Cloud: ......
"Aeris: But...Dyne's injury was the same as yours, right?"
"Tifa: Yeah, that's right. He was deceived by the Shinra too. He'll probably join us to fight against the Shinra."
"Barret: ...wouldn't bet on it. I gotta 'pologize to Dyne before I can rest in peace. An' that's why, I gotta go alone."
"Cloud: Do whatever you want... Is that what you want to hear? Well, I can't let you do it. Because, if you die on me, I'm gonna have nightmares."
"Aeris: Barret, this isn't the end."
Tifa: Weren't you going to save the Planet?
"Barret: Shit! Tifa, you oughtta know by now."
Tifa: ...That's all right. I'm not so different from you.
"Aeris: That's easier to understand. It's you, Barret."
"Cloud: So there it is, Barret. So I guess it'll be Barret, me, and......"
Tifa: Be careful.
Aeris: I wonder if Dyne will join us?
Red XIII: Hmm? Shall I go with you?
"Yuffie: You sure are all acting pretty heroic, considerin' we're not makin' any money on this..."
Cait Sith: Fortune's good. Everything is perfect!
"NPC: Man, the Boss was REALLY in a bad mood today... Or was it one of his better days?"
"NPC: If you get lost in the desert, just keep going Northeast. If you're lucky, you'll make it back here."
NPC: Wanna ride...?
Barret: ...Dyne ...Is that you?
Dyne: Now that's a voice I haven't heard in years... A voice I'll never forget...
Barret: I always hoped I'd be able to see you again someday... I knew you were alive somewhere... we had the same operation.
Barret: Listen to me Dyne. I want to...
Dyne: What's that?......I hear her voice.
Barret: ......?
"Dyne: I hear her voice, Eleanor's voice. Begging me... not to hate your rotten guts. That's why I didn't hunt you down..."
Barret: ...I know I was stupid. I'm not asking you to forgive me. But...What're you doin' in a place like this? Why ya wanna kill those that ain't even involved? Why?
Dyne: ...Why!? The hell do you care for!? Are the people killed going to understand 'why'? Are the people of Corel going to understand just hearing Shinra's excuses?
Dyne: I don't CARE what the reason is! All they give us are artillery and stupid excuses... What's left is a world of despair and emptiness...
Barret: .......
"Dyne: You still want to hear 'why'? ...All right, I'll tell you. 'Cause I want to destroy everything. The people of this city. This city itself. The whole world! I got nothing left in this world. Corel, Eleanor...... Marlene......"
"Barret: Dyne,Marlene...... Marlene's still alive."
Dyne: ......?
Barret: I went back into town. I thought she was gone for sure. That is why I wanted to be by her side till the end. That's when I found her... ...found Marlene.
Dyne: ...
"Barret: She's in Midgar. Let's go see her together, all right?"
Dyne: So......she's still alive...
"Dyne: All right, Barret. I guess that means you and I gotta fight."
Barret: What!?
Dyne: Eleanor's alone all by herself. I've got to take Marlene to her.
Barret: Dyne...are you insane!?
"Dyne: Marlene wants to see her Mom, don't she?"
"Barret: Stop, Dyne! I can't die yet!"
Dyne: Oh yeah? Well my life's been over ever since then.
Barret: Stop it! I don't wanna fight you!
Cloud: Barret!
"Barret: Cloud, you stay the hell out of it! This is MY problem!!"
Dyne: Urgh!
Dyne: Back!!
Dyne: ...it wasn't just my arm...... back then...... I lost something irreplaceable. I don't know where I went wrong...
"Barret: Dyne...I don't know either, man. Is this the only way... we can resolve this?"
Dyne: I told you... I... I want to destroy everything... Everything... This crazy world... Even me...
Barret: An' what 'bout Marlene? What's gonna happen to her!?
Dyne: ...Think about it...Barret... How old was Marlene back then...? Even if I did go to her now... she wouldn't even know me...
Dyne: And what's more...Barret... These hands are a little too stained to carry Marlene anymore...
Barret: ......
Dyne: Barret... Give that pendant to Marlene... It was...Eleanor's... my wife's...memento...
Barret: All right...
Dyne: ...wow...Marlene's... already......4......
Dyne: Barret... Don't ......make... ......Don't ever make Marlene......cry...
Barret: Dyne...?
Barret: Dyne!
Barret: Dy------ne!!
Barret: ...Dyne. Me an' you were the same... My hands ain't any cleaner...... I shouldn't be able to carry...Marlene either...
Barret: Uuuurrrrrrgh!!!
Mr.Coates: You want somethin'?
Barret: I want to go up.
"Mr.Coates: Like I told you before, you gotta get the Boss' permission, then win the Chocobo......"
"Barret: Dyne's got his reasons an' can't speak. So, I got this, instead."
"Mr.Coates: Yeah, bull--!!"
Barret: I want to go up.
"Mr.Coates: R, right. Did you kill Dyne? You must've. Or you'd never be holding that thing. ...So Dyne's dead... Maybe now, the place'll calm down a little. Dyne didn't care who anyone was......"
Barret: The hell do YOU know!!
"Mr.Coates: R...ri......right! I mean, no, I DON'T know anything. S, s...sorry."
"Cloud: Then, will you get us outta here?"
"Mr.Coates: Huh? Oh man, you guys are mistaken. I already told you, there's only one way to get outta here. That's to win the Chocobo Race and that's held up there, in the Gold Saucer. And, only one racer can go up at a time."
Barret: Say what!?
"Mr.Coates: Noooo! Really, even if you threaten me!! A rule's a rule. I can't change it. If I do, the whole system down here'll get messed up!! An' I can't do that!"
"Mr.Coates: Okay, ok, I'll let one go up there. After that, he's gotta deal with Dio."
"Barret: Awright then. Cloud, you go. We'll wait down here. Hurry up an' win that Chocobo Race, an' get us outta here!"
"Tifa: Right, Cloud. We'll be waiting and rooting for you."
"Aeris: Yes, good luck, Cloud."
Red XIII: You're right. Cloud should do it.
"Yuffie: Well, Cloud go get 'em!"
"Cait Sith: Ok Cloud, knock 'em dead!"
Mr.Coates: Have you decided?
Mr.Coates: All you need now is a manager. ... and register and get a Chocobo...
Ester: Hi......I happened to hear your story.
Mr.Coates: Ester?
Ester: I'll be your manager.
"Mr.Coates: Well, I have nothing against it, but..."
Mr.Coates: This is Ester. She may look kinda funny... But there's no better manager in the races...
Ester: That's so rude...
"Ester: Yeah, well. Nice to meet you, Cloud."
"Mr.Coates: All right then, Cloud. I'll send you up the elevator. Ester'll fill you in on the details."
"Ester: Hmm, so that's what happened. I'll talk to Dio directly. You just concentrate on the race. Oh yeah, getting back to the other thing, there are many different types of Chocobo jockeys. It's not only for criminals. Some people compete for the fame, some people compete for the money, some only for glory... And then there're people like you. Oh yeah, I'll teach you how to ride a Chocobo."
Ester: Ummm... First use the
Man: You new?
"Ester: Hi, Joe."
"Joe: Hey,Ester you're looking pretty as usual."
Ester: Thanks.
"Ester: Let me introduce you, Cloud. This is Joe, one of the top Chocobo Jockeys."
"Joe: Nice to meet you, Cloud. If you're with Ester, then..."
Ester: Right! He's an up and coming jockey. He's only been down here for a day and already he made it up here!!
"Joe: What!? Oh, I see..."
Joe: So what did you do down there?
Joe: Sorry...you're not supposed to ask about the past here...
"Joe: Pretty interesting... I have a feeling that we'll meet again. Then, until we meet again, Cloud."
Ester: I'm going to check on the Chocobo. You just wait here for a while.
Ester: I'll be right back.
NPC: Don't get cocky. Skills don't matter once you get in the race...
NPC: I got nothing to say.
NPC: ......
"On-screen: The race will start in a few moments. Will the jockeys for the next race, please proceed to the paddock. I repeat..."
Ester: Cloud
Ester: Thanks for waiting. I registered you in the next race. This is a Chocobo I prepared myself. He won't lose easily.
Ester: Oh yeah... You know how to ride one?
Ester: Let's see First use the
"Ester: Then, good luck."
Ester: Too bad.
Ester: You had a tough situation there.
Ester: I was expecting a little more from you.
Ester: You were so close.
"Ester: Let me find a better Chocobo for you. Wait here for a while, OK?"
"Ester: If you couldn't win with that last Chocobo... All right, I'll go get the best Chocobo there is!"
"Ester: You gotta be kidding me!? There aren't any other Chocobos better than the last one! Well, if you really want to win, just push the 'SELECT' and try the 'AUTO' mode."
Ester: Congratulations!! Now you're home free!
"Ester: Oh yeah, the owner told me to give this letter to you when you won."
"Dio (letter): Boy, if you're reading this letter, then you must've won. And won a victory that I am sure you earned. I heard about Dyne from Ester. Now that you are victorious, I promise that you and all your friends will get a full pardon, and you all will be set free. And also, by way of apology, I prepared a little gift for you to use on your journey. Sorry I couldn't be there to tell you this in person, but I'm a very busy man. Sincerely, Dio"
Cloud: A gift?
"Aeris (through PHS): Cloud, isn't this great!? The assistant manager just stopped by and dropped off a 'buggy' for you! Now you can go over 'deserts' and 'rivers' no problem. OK, Cloud. I'll be waiting outside."
Cloud: (Hmm? The letter continues...)
"Dio (letter): P.S. I just recently met Sephiroth. He must have a lot of fans with boys your age. Why don't you get his autograph? It seems he's headed toward the South of the river, towards Gongaga."
Cloud: Sephiroth...
"Ester: I guess this is goodbye. Yeah. Well, if you ever get your own Race Chocobo, come back again. I'll take care of your registration and everything. I'll see you again."
"On-screen: How to drive the buggy Press the [OK] button to get on. Press the [CANCEL] button to get off. Buggy's can cross shallow rivers and deserts. You can even enter Costa del Sol and Junon by buggy, by hitching a ride on the 'Cargo Ship'."
Cloud: Oh man...a breakdown? Now?
Cloud: ...Is someone there?
"Reno: Hey, Rude. Who do you like?"
Reno: What are you getting so embarrassed about? Come on? Who do you like?
Rude: .........Tifa.
"Reno: Hmmmm... That's a tough one. But, poor Elena. She......you......"
"Rude: No, she likes Tseng."
Reno: I never knew that! But Tseng likes that Ancient...
Cloud: What are they talking about?
Elena: It's so stupid! They always talk about who they like or don't like. But Tseng is different.
Elena: Ah! Oh no!
Elena: They're here! They're really here!
Reno: Hmm... Then it's time...
Reno: Rude...Don't go easy on them even though they're girls.
"Rude: ...Don't worry, I'll do my job."
"Elena: Then, we're counting on you. I'll report to Tseng!"
Reno: It's been a while.
Reno: Payback time for what you did in Sector 7.
Reno: That's sad.
Rude: That's as far as you go.
Reno: I don't like being taken for a fool.
Rude: That's as far as you go.
Rude: That's as far as you go.
Reno: This is just part of the job. Don't take it personally.
Rude: ..................
Rude: ..................
"Reno: We may be retreating, but... we're still victorious."
Barret: I don't like it. How'd they find out where we were?
"Tifa: Hey, something seems wrong, Like they knew we were coming."
Aeris: ...How could they know we were coming here.
"Red XIII(before ""In the Land of the Study of Planet Life""): Interesting... They were definitely waiting for us."
"Red XIII(after ""In the Land of the Study of Planet Life""): Hey, Cloud. How did the Turks know to wait and ambush us here?"
Cait Sith: How'd they know that we were here?
Yuffie: I don't like this! It's like the whole world knows where we're going.
Vincent: How did they know that we were here...
"Cid: Man, looks like they've taken a short cut."
"Cloud: They followed us...... But there weren't any signs of it. Then, that means......"
"Barret: A spy, maybe? No, no way."
Tifa: A spy!?...No way.
Aeris: That there's a Shinra spy...
"Red XIII(before ""In the Land of the Study of Planet Life""): ......someone's been informing them."
"Red XIII(after ""In the Land of the Study of Planet Life""): ...You think someone told the Shinra about us?"
Yuffie: Maybe it's someone in this group?
"Cait Sith: You don't think there's a spy, do you Cloud? I hate this. Now everyone's gonna blame me because I'm new."
Vincent: Means there's a Shinra spy...?
Cid: And a couple of Shinra dogs are here too!
Cloud: I don't even want to think that there's a spy... I trust everyone.
Cloud: A ruined reactor.
"Cloud: It's Scarlet, Head of Shinra Weapon Development."
Scarlet: ......Hmph! This isn't any good either. You only get junky materia from junky reactors.
"Scarlet: This reactor's a failure. What I'm looking for is big, large, huge materia. You seen any?"
Tseng: ...No I haven't seen it. I'll get on it right away.
Scarlet: Please. We could make the ultimate weapon if we only had some.
Tseng: I just can't wait.
"Scarlet: With Hojo gone, the Weapon Development's been getting a bigger budget."
Tseng: I envy them.
"Scarlet: But, even if we make the perfect weapon, could that stupid Heidegger even use it?"
Tseng: ......
Scarlet: Oh...sorry! I forgot Heidegger was your boss! Ha ha ha!
Tseng: ......
Scarlet: Let's go!
"Cloud: ...Big, large, huge materia? An ultimate weapon? The perfect weapon? Just what are the Shinra up to...?"
Cloud: There's something shiny back there...
"On-screen: Received ""Titan"" Materia!"
"NPC 1: You a traveller? Hey wait, that glare in your eye... you in SOLDIER?"
NPC 2: Oh you're right! Don't you know anything about our son?
NPC 1: His name is Zack.
"NPC 2: It's been close to 10 years since he left for the city, saying that he didn't want to live in the country..."
NPC 1: He left saying he's going to join SOLDIER. You ever hear of a Zack in SOLDIER?
Cloud: Hmmm...I don't know.
Aeris: Zack...
"NPC 1: Young lady, you know him?"
NPC 2: I remember he wrote us 6 or 7 years ago saying that he had a girlfriend. Could that have been you?
Aeris: That can't...
Tifa: Zack...
Cloud: What happened to you two?
Aeris: Zack...
"NPC 1: Young lady, you know him?"
NPC 2: I remember he wrote us 6 or 7 years ago saying that he had a girlfriend. Could that have been you?
Aeris: That can't...
Cloud: Aeris...
Tifa: Zack...
"NPC 1: Young lady, you know him?"
NPC 2: I remember he wrote us 6 or 7 years ago saying that he had a girlfriend. Could that have been you?
"Tifa: ...No, it wasn't."
Cloud: Tifa... What happened?
Cloud: ...Zack. Zack. I don't know anything about that man. ......But That name sounds familiar... Why...!?
NPC: Have you ever met someone in SOLDIER named Zack?
"NPC: I can't believe he hasn't contacted us in 10 years...! ...After all, we're his parents."
Cloud: Aeris...
Aeris: What a shock... I didn't know Zack was from this town.
Cloud: You know him?
Aeris: Didn't I tell you? He was my first love.
Cloud: ............
Aeris: Zack... SOLDIER First Class. Same as Cloud.
"Cloud: Strange, there aren't that many who make First Class, but I've never heard of him."
Aeris: That's all right. It's all in the past now. I was just worried because I heard he's been missing.
Cloud: Missing?
"Aeris: I think it was 5 years ago. He went out on a job, and never came back. He loved women, a real lady's man. He probably found someone else..."
Aeris: Hey? What's wrong?
Aeris: I don't really mind that I haven't heard from him. But I feel for his parents.
"Aeris: Are you...jealous? Hmm? Hmmm? Are you, Cloud?"
Aeris: I'm kidding. I'm sorry.
Aeris: I was hoping maybe you were...
"Aeris: Let's go, Cloud."
Tifa: Zack......
Cloud: Do you know him?
"Tifa: N, no, I don't know him!"
Cloud: Your face tells me differently.
"Tifa: I told you, I don't!"
"Cloud: A, all right."
Tifa: ............
"Tifa: That sounds just like you, leaving town, and saying 'I'm joining SOLDIER!'."
Cloud: There were a lot of guys like that back then.
Tifa: You must really be something making it in SOLDIER out of a group like that. I really respect you...
Tifa: Don't be so humble!
"Tifa: Hard work pays off, huh."
Tifa: You know... I'm as proud of Cloud joining SOLDIER as if it were me.
"Tifa: Cloud, thanks for caring."
"Red XIII: I am home! It is I, Nanaki!"
"NPC: Hey, Nanaki! You're safe! Come on, and say hello to Bugenhagen!"
Cloud: ...Nanaki?
Barret: I finally made it... So this is...Cosmo Canyon!
"Tifa: Red XIII seems different, doesn't he?"
Aeris: Cosmo...Canyon? I wonder if there's any relation to the planet or the Ancients...
Yuffie: Hmmm... Any Materia? Any Materia around?
Cait Sith: Hmmm...So this is Cosmo Canyon.
NPC: Welcome to Cosmo Canyon. Are you familiar with this land?
NPC: You lied. That is something that is not treated lightly here in Cosmo Canyon.
NPC: Let me explain. People from all over the world gather here to seek the Study of Planet Life.
Barret: Wooooooooo! I always wanted to come here!
"NPC: Ummgah! It's full capacity at present, so I'm afraid I can't let you enter."
Red XIII: They helped me some when I was on the road. Please let them in.
"NPC: ...Oh, is that so? You helped our Nanaki? Please, come in."
Cloud: Who is Nanaki?
NPC: Nanaki is Nanaki. That's his name.
"Red XIII: Here is where I was...I mean, ...this is my hometown. My tribe were protectors of those who appreciate this beautiful canyon and the Planet. My brave mother fought and died here, but my cowardly father left her...... I am the last of my race."
Cloud: Cowardly father?
"Red XIII: Yes. My father was a wastrel. And so the mission I inherited from my ancestors, is to protect this place. My journey ends here."
Bugenhagen: Hey! Nanaki--! You're home!
"Red XIII: Coming, Grandpa!"
"Barret: Good timin'. Let's take a breather. I got stuff I want to find out, too."
"Tifa: That's perfect. Why don't we take a break too? We can meet back here in a while, OK?"
Aeris: Let's rest for a bit. There are some things I want to find out about anyway.
"Yuffie: Rest, rest, rest! I wanna rest! There! It's decided!"
"Cait Sith: I'm just dead tired. Everyone, how 'bout some rest?"
Aeris: Maybe there are some people here that know about the Promised Land and the Ancients.
Tifa: Red XIII...... I wonder what's happened to Red XIII...? He's as excited as a little boy.
"Barret: There was this guy who studied 'Planetary Life' here. He couldn't take things the way they were, so he went to Midgar to form AVALANCHE. Wanna hear more?"
Barret: Guess you could say this is where AVALANCHE was born. I always wanted to come here... And...I finally......made it. A lot...happened...
"Barret: And then...? I don't know what's going to happen, now that there is no AVALANCHE..."
"Yuffie: Oh man! This place looks like a real drag. And their Materia sucks, too."
"Cait Sith: Hmm, this place seems like it has a lot of secrets. So, when's dinner?"
"Red XIII: Cloud, this is my grandfather, Bugen. He is incredible. He knows everything."
Bugenhagen: Ho Ho Hoooo. I hear that you looked after Nanaki a bit. Nanaki is still a child you see.
"Red XIII: Please stop, grandfather. I'm 48."
Bugenhagen: Ho Ho Hoooo. Nanaki's tribe has incredible longevity. So you see his 48 years would only be equivalent to say that of a 15 or 16 year old in human reckoning.
Cloud: 15 or 16!?
Bugenhagen: He's quiet and very deep. You thought he was an adult?
Red XIII: ......grandfather. I want to be an adult. I want to grow up to be able to protect you and the village.
"Bugenhagen: Ho Ho Hoooo. No Nanaki. You can't stand on your own yet. To do that now would destroy you in the long run. Reaching up into the heavens, threatening to snatch the very stars from the great city of Midgar. You've seen it, haven't you?"
"Bugenhagen: Well, that's a bad example. Looking up too much makes you lose perspective. When it's time for this planet to die, you'll understand that you know absolutely nothing."
Cloud: ......When the planet dies?
"Bugenhagen: Ho Ho Hoooo. It may be tomorrow, or 100 years from now... But it's not long off."
Cloud: How do you know this?
Bugenhagen: I hear the cries of the Planet.
Cloud: What's that?
"Bugenhagen: The sounds of the stars in the heavens. While this goes on, planets are born, and die."
Cloud: What was that?
"Bugenhagen: Ho Ho Hoooo. That was a scream from this planet. Didn't you hear it? As if to say... I hurt, I suffer......"
Red XIII: They have come here on a journey to save the planet. Why don't you show them your apparatus?
Bugenhagen: Ho Ho Hoooo. To save the planet? Ho Ho Hoooo!
"Bugenhagen: But, then again, I guess it wouldn't hurt to show him."
NPC: Bugenhagen! Several odd looking people have come.
Bugenhagen: The whole place has gotten busy all of a sudden.
Red XIII: He brought friends too. I'll go get them.
"Red XIII: Cloud, please call one of them. Only three people can fit in grandfather's machine."
Bugenhagen: Don't worry. My machine won't run away. You go and invite your friends.
Aeris: Hmm?
Tifa: Are you going somewhere?
Barret: What?
Yuffie: God. I HATE studying!
Cait Sith: What did they say?
Red XIII: Don't worry about me. I've seen it many times. It's my first time back in a while. Let me rest for a bit...
"Bugenhagen: Here, over here. The door's unlocked, come on in."
Bugenhagen: Ho Ho Hoooo. It looks like you have them all together. Then let's begin. I'll be stand there.
Aeris: So pretty...It's just like the real thing!
Tifa: Wow! It's just like the real thing!
"Yuffie: Woa! Wooooah! Pretty good, surprisin' me!"
Barret: This is really somethin'!
"Bugenhagen: Hmm, yes pretty good. This is my laboratory. All the workings of space are entered into this 3D Holographic System."
Aeris: Hey! A shooting star!
"Aeris: Wow, how wonderful."
"Tifa: Look, look! A shooting star!"
Tifa: Oh! This is amazing!!
"Yuffie: Wh, what the? A shooting star?"
Yuffie: Whew!!
Barret: Whoa! Shootin' stars!
Barret: This's really somethin'!
"Bugenhagen: Ho Ho Hoooo. Yes, it is something, isn't it? Well, let's get to the subject."
"Bugenhagen: Eventually...all humans die. What happens to them after they die? The body decomposes, and returns to the Planet. That much everyone knows. What about their consciousness, their hearts and their souls?"
"Bugenhagen: The soul too returns to the Planet. And not only those of humans, but everything on this Planet. In fact, all living things in the universe, are the same. The spirits that return to the Planet, merge with one another and roam the Planet. They roam, converge, and divide, becoming a swell, called the 'Lifestream'."
"Bugenhagen: Lifestream... In other words, a path of energy of the souls roaming the Planet. 'Spirit Energy' is a word that you should never forget. A new life...children are blessed with Spirit energy and are brought into the world. Then, the time comes when they die and once again return to the Planet... Of course there are exceptions, but this is the way of the world."
"Bugenhagen: I've digressed, but you'll understand better if you watch this. Spirit energy makes all things possible, trees, birds, and humans. Not just living things. But Spirit energy makes it possible for Planets to be Planets. What happens if that Spirit energy were to disappear?"
Bugenhagen: ......These are the basics of the Study of Planet Life.
"Cloud: If the Spirit energy is lost, our Planet is destroyed..."
"Bugenhagen: Ho Ho Hoooo. Spirit energy is efficient BECAUSE it exists within nature. When Spirit energy is forcefully extracted, and manufactured, it can't accomplish its true purpose."
"Cloud: You're talking about Mako energy, right?"
"Bugenhagen: Everyday Mako reactors suck up Spirit energy, diminishing it. Spirit energy gets compressed in the reactors and processed into Mako energy. All living things are being used up and thrown away. In other words, Mako energy will only destroy the Planet..."
Bugenhagen: The story of the planets... and those who lived with them... You want to know more? Then you must listen to the words of the elders.
Bugenhagen: Nanaki? His father a coward? So that's it... Nanaki's been thinking that all this time...
Red XIII: ......
"Tifa: Cloud... Bonfires are funny, aren't they? They make you remember all sorts of things."
"Tifa: You know, Cloud. 5 Years ago..."
"Tifa: ......It's nothing. No, forget it. I'm afraid to ask..."
Cloud: What is it...?
"Tifa: It feels like... it feels like you're going far away... You really, really are...... you...right?"
"Barret: Cosmo Canyon... This's where AVALANCHE was born... I promised my guys someday... when we saved the planet from the Shinra, that we'd all go to Cosmo Canyon and celebrate... Biggs... Wedge... Jessie... Now they're all gone... died for the planet."
Barret: ...Really? To save the planet? We all... we all hate the Shinra... Do I even got a to go on? Will they...... ...will they ever forgive me?
"Barret: ...Right now, I really don't know. But I know one thing. If there's anything I can do, to save the planet...or the people livin' on it... Then I'm gonna do it! I don't care if it's for justice or revenge, or whatever. I don't care......let 'em decide for 'emselves."
Barret: Urrrrrgh! I'm gonna do it!! Again... Again...AVALANCHE's born again!
"Yuffie: What a boring place, just like I thought. I wanna go somewhere! Let's go find some Materia!"
"Cait Sith: I wonder how many years it's been... Gosh, it brings back memories......"
Aeris: I learned a lot. The elders taught me many things. About the Cetra... And the Promised Land... I'm......alone... I'm all alone now...
"Cloud: But I'm......we're here for you, right?"
"Aeris: I know. I know, but... I am the only......Cetra."
Cloud: Does that mean we can't help?
Aeris: ......
Red XIII: ...Long ago. ...When I was still very small. We were all around this flame...
"Red XIII: No, never mind..."
Cloud: What happened?
"Red XIII: It's about my parents. When I talk about my mother, I am full of pride and joy... And that's fine. ...But when I remember my father, my heart is full of anger..."
Bugenhagen: ...You really can't forgive your father...?
"Red XIII: Of course. He......left mother for dead. When the Gi tribe attacked, he ran off by himself, leaving mother and the people of the Canyon!"
"Bugenhagen: ...Come, Nanaki. There's something you should see."
Red XIII: ...?
Bugenhagen: The place may be dangerous.
Bugenhagen: Cloud. Will you and one other person come with us?
Barret: ...Where're they going?
Tifa: Can I go too?
Aeris: I wonder what he wants to show Red XIII...?
"Yuffie: Does he want to show him THAT? You know, maybe there's some Materia that's been passed on for generations in this Canyon!?"
Cait Sith: Dangerous? Count me out......
Bugenhagen: Ho Ho Hoooo
Bugenhagen: Are we all set?
Bugenhagen: Ho Ho Hoooo. Shall we go?
"Bugenhagen: All right. Come in, come in."
"Red XIII: Hey? Aren't you going with us, Grandpa?"
Bugenhagen: What are you crazy? It's dangerous in there. I told you that! You want an old man like me should go first? I'll be right behind you.
Bugenhagen: Not ready yet? Tell me when you are ready.
"Bugenhagen: What is it, you're going back? I'll be waiting here for you when you're ready. I can't leave this door open forever."
Cloud: This is a strange looking rock...
Cloud: Funny looking rock...
Cloud: A strange shaped rock...
Cloud:An odd shaped rock...
Bugenhagen: Ho Ho Hoooo. Everyone here's a Ghost of the Gi tribe. Killed in a certain battle.
Red XIII: A certain battle...?
"Bugenhagen: The vengeful spirits of the Gi didn't disappear, and couldn't return to the Lifestream..."
Bugenhagen: We still have far to go. Ho Ho Hoooo.
"Bugenhagen: As you can see, this cave leads to the back of Cosmo Canyon. It was unfortunate that the Gi were larger than us. If they attacked through here, we wouldn't have stood a chance."
Red XIII: .......
Bugenhagen: Let's move on.
Bugenhagen: This warrior went through the cave all alone. Fighting attackers one after another...
Red XIII: Grandpa...... That warrior...
Bugenhagen: Ho Ho Hoooo... We're almost there.
Bugenhagen: What is this......?
"Red XIII: Grandpa, is he...!?"
Bugenhagen: After death... The ghosts of the Gi... Like stagnant air...... This...can't be!!
"Bugenhagen: ...Thank you, Cloud. Because of you, we survived. Nanaki, you have grown strong, too."
Red XIII: ......Oh yeah?
Bugenhagen: Now I know that it wasn't a mistake bringing you here...
"Bugenhagen: Come, I have something I want to show you. Right over here."
Red XIII: This is...
Bugenhagen: ...The warrior who fought against the Gi. He kept them from taking even one step into Cosmo Canyon. But he was never able to return to town...
"Bugenhagen: Look, Nanaki. Look at your father, at the warrior, Seto."
Red XIII: ...That... That's ......Seto...?
"Bugenhagen: Seto continued to fight the Gi tribe here. ...To protect this Canyon. Even after the Gi's poisonous arrows turned his body to stone...... Even after they all ran away... Seto, continued to protect us. And he continues to protect us, even now."
Red XIII: Even now...
"Bugenhagen: You thought that he was a coward and ran away. But he, alone risked his life to protect Cosmo Canyon. That is your father, Seto."
Red XIII: That......that is Seto? ...!? Did mother know?
Bugenhagen: Ho Ho Hoooo...She knew. The two of them made me promise to keep this cave shut. They asked me to seal it myself and not to tell a soul. They said we should forget about this cave.
Red XIII: .........
Bugenhagen: Cloud... Would you mind leaving the two of us alone?
Bugenhagen: Nanaki. I want you to continue your journey with Cloud and the others.
Red XIII: Grandpa!?
"Bugenhagen: Listen, Nanaki. Cloud says they are trying to save the planet. Honestly, I don't think it can be done. For even if they stop every reactor on the planet, it's only going to postpone the inevitable. Even if they stop Sephiroth, everything will perish."
"Bugenhagen: But, Nanaki. I've been thinking lately. I've been thinking if there was anything WE could do, as a part of the planet, something to help a planet already in misery... No matter what happens, isn't it important to try? Am I just wishing against fate?"
"Bugenhagen: I am too old to do anything about it... This year, I'll be 130. Ho Ho Hoooo. That is why, Nanaki, you must go with them! For my sake."
Red XIII: Grandpa...
Bugenhagen: I wanted to show you your real father before you left... I'm so glad that you came back while I was still alive to show you.
Red XIII: Grandpa...don't talk like that. I don't want to think of life... without you......
"Bugenhagen: Ho Ho Hoooo. Well, I've had a long life."
Red XIII: Grandpa! You must live!
Red XIII: I'll see to it. I'll see to what's happening to the planet. And I'll come back to tell you.
Bugenhagen: Nanaki...
"Red XIII: I am Nanaki of Cosmo Canyon! The son of the warrior, Seto! I'll come back a warrior true to that noble name! So please, Grandpa..."
Bugenhagen: That's...Seto's...... Seto......
Red XIII: Seto...... Fa...Father...
Barret: They said they finished fixin' the buggy.
"Barret: The buggy's fixed, so we can go now."
Cloud: Shall we get going?
"Aeris: So this is it, Red XIII..."
Barret: That's just the way it goes. ...You came in handy at times...
Red XIII: Wait for me! I'm coming too!
Cloud: Mmm?
Bugenhagen: Cloud. Please look after Nanaki.
Cloud: What happened?
Red XIII: I think I grew up a little. That's what happened!
Bugenhagen: Ho Ho Hoooo. Come back whenever you need my knowledge.
"Tifa: What---!! This was all supposed to be burnt down, right?"
Cloud: ...I thought so.
Tifa: Then why...? My house is still there too...
Barret: The hell's goin' on!? This a dream or somethin'?
Aeris: ...somthing's strange?
Red XIII: I wonder what's going on...
Yuffie: What the...!?
"Cait Sith: Cloud, maybe you were just dreaming...?"
"Barret: You said the whole town burnt down, right?"
"Aeris: This is Nibelheim, right? But the town's all here."
Red XIII: This is Nibelheim? I heard it burnt down.
Yuffie: I heard from someone that this town was gone!
Cait Sith: The whole town was destroyed by Sephiroth. At least that's what I heard...
Cloud: ...Yeah.
Barret: You trin' to fool us!?
"Aeris: Hey, what's going on?"
Red XIII: Cloud... Did you lie to us?
Yuffie: What happened?
"Cait Sith: Cloud, did you make up your story just to get our support?"
Cloud: I'm not lying! I remember...the intense heat of the flames...
Cloud: Sephiroth!
Sephiroth: Being here brings back memories.
Sephiroth: Are you going to participate in the Reunion?
Cloud: I don't even know what a Reunion is!
Sephiroth: Jenova will be at the Reunion. Jenova will join the Reunion becoming a calamity from the skies.
"Cloud: Jenova, a calamity from the skies? You mean she wasn't an Ancient!?"
Sephiroth: ...I see. I don't think you have the right to participate. I will go North past Mt. Nibel. If you wish to find out...then follow...
Cloud: ...Reunion? Calamity from the skies?
Cloud: What's that...!?
Cloud: A rusty old rocket... Wonder what they'd make something that huge for?
Cloud: There's a Shinra logo on it. Tiny Bronco...... This is cool.
Barret: The Shinra always keep the most useful things to themselves. Let's steal it!
Tifa: I wonder if we can borrow it...
"Aeris: Let's take it? OK, Cloud!"
Red XIII: Will it fly? Is it all right to just take it?
"Yuffie: Cloud, let's steal it! I love stealing from the Shinra!"
"Cait Sith: Cloud! If we steal it, we'll get in deep trouble!"
Vincent: ...Want me to keep watch?
Shera: Um...may I help you?
Cloud: No... We're just looking at it.
"Shera: ...If you would like to use it, please ask the Captain. The Captain should be in the Rocket."
Shera: I'm Shera. And what are your names?
Cloud: I'm Cloud.
"Barret: I'm Barret, of AVALANCHE."
Tifa: Tifa. Nice to meet you.
Aeris: I'm Aeris.
"Red XIII: Nanaki, otherwise known as Red XIII."
Yuffie: I'm Yuffie!
"Cait Sith: Fortune telling machine Cait Sith, here."
Vincent: Vincent. My occupation is......forget it.
Shera: Hmm... So you're not with the Shinra. I thought the approval for the reopening of the Space Program came.
Cloud: ......!?
Shera: President Rufus is scheduled to come here. The Captain's been so restless all morning.
Cloud: Rufus!!?
Cid: What're you guys doin' here?
Cloud: We heard the Captain was here.
Cid: Captain? I'm the Captain!
"Cid: The name's Cid. Everyone calls me 'Captain', though."
Cid: What d'ya want?
"Cid: Wow! Not bad for a kid. Alright then, I'll explain it to you. You know Shinra developed a lot of technological gadgets during the meaningless war, right? Now it's a Mako company, but in the old days it was a weapons manufacturer."
"Cid: Well, they came up with a Rocket Engine. There was so much excitement about the thought of going into outer space. Our dreams got bigger and bigger. They put a major budget into it and made prototype after prototype! Finally, they completed Shinra No. 26. They chose the best pilot in Shinra-- no, in the world--me. I mean, come on."
"Cid: And finally we get to the day of the launch. Everything was goin' well... But, because of that dumb-ass Shera, the launch got messed up. That's why they became so anal! And so, Shinra nixed their outer space exploration plans. After they told me how the future was Space Exploration and got my damn hopes up...DAMN THEM!"
"Cid: Then, it was all over once they found out Mako energy was profitable. They didn't even so much as look at space exploration. Money, moola, dinero! My dream was just a financial number for them! Look at this rusted Rocket. I was supposed to be the first man in space with this. Everyday, it tilts a little bit more. At this rate, I don't know which will come first, this thing falling down or me gettin' outta here. My last hope is to talk to the President......"
"Cid: Yeah! It must be news about restarting the Space Program. A young President, that's what we needed! He still has dreams, too!"
Cid: You out of your *&$^$# mind!? That's my most cherished possession. I can't let you take it.
Cid: Ummm... Just look around...
Shera: Excuse me...Cloud? Did the Captain say anything?
Cloud: Nope...
Shera: Oh...?
"Cid: ^%$#! Shera. What are you, blind!? We got guests!! GET SOME TEA! ^%$#!"
Shera: I...I'm sorry.
"Cloud: Really, don't mind us."
Cid: Shut up! Sit your ass down in that chair and drink your goddamn TEA!
"Cid: Arggggggh! DAMN, I'm pissed!"
Cid: Shera! I'll be in the backyard tunin' up Tiny Bronco! An' make sure to serve them some tea! All right!?
"Barret: ...damn, man. Wassup with that guy's attitude?"
Tifa: Poor Shera.
Aeris: Sheesh...!! What bad manners!
Red XIII: Who does he think he is......?
"Yuffie: Man, this sucks...!"
"Cait Sith: Man, he sure seems wound up tight."
Vincent: ............
Cloud: Sorry. It's our fault.
"Shera: No, no. He's always like this."
Barret: He always like this? That's pretty bad!
Tifa: Is it always like this...? Why is Cid so hard on you?
Aeris: Is it like this all the time? You keep quiet even when he's like that to you?
Red XIII: I think it's a bit too harsh.
Yuffie: What's his prob!? I'm gonna go clean that guy's clock!!
Cait Sith: Is he like this all the time...? Bitin' your head off like that? I could never stand it...
Vincent: ...It's amazing that you can live with it.
Shera: No... It's because of my stupid mistake. I was the one who destroyed his dream...
Cloud: What happened?
Cid (in flashback): Hey! Get your ass in gear! You work like a snail! Even the moon'd get tired waitin' around for your ass!
Shera (in flashback): I'm...I'm sorry.
"Cid (in flashback): Don't take so much time checkin' that *%$^# oxygen tank! Shera, bein' careful's good, but it won't do any good, no matter how many times you check that oxygen tank. That thing wouldn't break even if hell froze over."
Shera (in flashback): But...
"Cid (in flashback): No buts!! You're not stupid, so be more efficient!"
Shera (in flashback): I'm sorry......
NPC 1: Captain! Our dreams are finally coming true!
NPC 2: We are so proud to be a part of the launch of Shinra No. 26.
"NPC 3: Captain, preparations are complete! All that's left is lift off!"
Cid (in flashback): Yeah! Leave it all to me! I'll be back in a few!
"NPC: All right, Captain! Fly our dreams into outer space!"
"Cid (in flashback): Thanks, guys!"
NPC: We're praying for your safety!
"Cid (in flashback): Instrument panel...all clear. Shinra No. 26, ready for launch."
"NPC: Engine pressure rising. Shinra No. 26, 3 minutes to launch. Beginning countdown."
Cid (in flashback): ......finally.
Cid (in flashback): What the? What happened!?
NPC: Cid! We have an emergency situation! A mechanic is still in the engine section of the rocket!
Cid (in flashback): What!? Who is the little ^%$@!?
NPC: I don't know. Activating the intercom in the engine section.
Cid (in flashback): Hey goddammit!! Who the &%$#'s still in there?
"Shera (in flashback): It's Shera, Captain. Don't mind me, go ahead with the launch."
Cid (in flashback): Shera!? What are you still doin' in there!?
Shera (in flashback): I was still concerned. The results of the oxygen tank test weren't satisfactory.
"Cid (in flashback): You stupid little ^$#^%! It's gonna get so hot in there that there ain't gonna be SHIT left when we blast off! You're gonna be burnt to a crisp! You're gonna die! You know that, doncha!?"
"Shera (in flashback): I don't mind. If I can just fix this, the launch will be a success. I'm almost done."
Cid (in flashback): Almost done!? You're gonna die!
"NPC: Cid, we must start the countdown. We won't make it if we don't!"
NPC: Starting engine!
"Cid (in flashback): Hey, wait a minute! Shera's still in here!"
"NPC: What are you going to do, Cid? If we cancel now, it'll be another six months until the next launch!"
"Cid (in flashback): GODDAMMIT, Shera... you wanna make me a murderer?"
Shera (in flashback): Captain!
Cid (in flashback): Shera!?
"Shera (in flashback): Tank Number 7 check is complete. Once I complete Tank Number 8, it's all clear."
"Cid (in flashback): Come on, Shera...hurry up... You're gonna die..."
NPC: 30 seconds until ignition. Beginning countdown.
NPC: Cid! Forget about her. We won't make it in time!
Cid (in flashback): What...what am I...... What am I supposed to do...?
NPC: 15 seconds until ignition. Internal temperature rising.
"Cid (in flashback): Oh man, the moon...outer space... my dreams..."
NPC: Ignite Engine!
Cid (in flashback): SH-------------IT!!
"Shera: He pushed the Emergency Engine Shut Down switch, aborting the mission, to save my life. After that, the Space Program was cut back and the launch was canceled. It's my fault his dream was destroyed... That's why...it's all right. I don't care what the Captain says, I'll live my life for him."
Cid: Shera! You still haven't served 'em tea!
Shera: I...I'm sorry.
Cid: Hurry up and sit down! Or ain't my hospitality good enough for you!?
Cid: They're late... Where is Rufus...?
"Palmer: Hey-HEY! Long time no see! So Cid, how ya been?"
"Cid: Well, if it ain't fat man, Palmer. How long were you figurin' on keepin' me waitin'!?"
Cid: So? When's the Space Program gonna start up again?
"Palmer: Hey-hey! I don't know. The President's outside, so why don't you ask him?"
"Cid: ^$#&! Good for nothing, fat &$#$^@!"
Palmer: Don't say 'fat'!
"Palmer: Hey-hey! Tea! Can I have some too? With lotsa sugar and honey and... oh yeah, don't forget the lard!"
Shera: Is President Rufus here to announce that he's going to restart the Space Program?
Palmer: Hey-hey? Have we met before?
"Palmer: Hey-hey! Is the tea ready yet? With plenty of sugar and honey. Oh yeah, and don't forget the lard too."
"Cid: What the......! You got me all excited for nothing!? Then, what'd you come here for?"
"Rufus: I want to borrow the Tiny Bronco. We're going after Sephiroth. But seems like we've been going in the wrong direction. But now, we think we know where he's headed. But, we have to cross the ocean. That's why we want your plane..."
"Cid: &^#^%! First the Airship, then the Rocket, and now, the Tiny Bronco. Shinra took outer space away from me and now you want to take the sky away from me too!?"
"Rufus: Oh my... You seem to forget it was because of Shinra, Inc. that you were able to fly in the first place."
Cid: What!?
"Shera: Uh, excuse me... This way..."
"Shera: You wanted to use the Tiny Bronco, right? I believe Palmer's going to take it. Why don't you talk to him?"
Shera: I believe Palmer's going to take it. Why don't you talk to him?
Palmer: Hmm... Why do I have to do this...? I'm the head of the Space Program...
Cloud: We'll be takin' that Tiny Bronco.
Palmer: I've seen you somewhere before...
Palmer: I know! The Shinra building! When the President was killed! Ulp! Se...se...security!!
Palmer: Heh-hic-heh-hic!
On-screen: Mako Gun
Palmer: Heh heh hic!
Palmer: Ugh!
Barret: It won't stop!
Tifa: It won't stop!
Aeris: It won't stop!
Red XIII: It's going to take off.
Yuffie: No!! It's gonna take off!
Cait Sith: No! It's going to take off!
Vincent: It's not going to stop...
Cloud: Forget it! Get in!!
Cid: Shit!! The tail's been hit!
Cloud: Emergency landing...
Cid: This's gonna be a big splash. Hold on to your drawers and don't piss in 'em!
Cid: She won't fly anymore.
Cloud: Can't we use it as a boat?
Cid: $#&%! Do whatever you want!
"Cloud: Cid, what are you going to do now?"
Cid: Dunno. I'm history with the Shinra and I've given up on the town.
Cloud: How 'bout your wife? How 'bout Shera?
Cid: Wife? Don't make me laugh! Just thinkin' 'bout marryin' her gives me the chills.
Cid: What're you guys gonna do?
Cloud: We're going after a man named Sephiroth. We'll have to get Rufus of the Shinra someday too.
"Cid: I don't know about any of that, but..."
Cid: What the hell!? Sign me up!
"Cloud: How 'bout it, everyone?"
Barret: I don't care.
"Tifa: Of course, no problem!"
Aeris: I'm all for it.
Red XIII: I don't really care.
Yuffie: Whatever!
Cait Sith: I don't mind.
Vincent: ...Do whatever you like.
"Cid: Glad to be aboard, numbskulls!"
Cloud: Numskulls...?
"Cid: Yeah. Anyone stupid enough to go up against Shinra nowadays, has GOTTA be a numskull! I like it!"
"Cid: So, where we headed? Rufus was goin' after Sephiroth towards the Temple of the Ancients."
Cloud: Really!?...Where is it? That Temple of the Ancients?
Cid: Dunno. That numskull kid was tellin' me he was headin 'The wrong direction'... so maybe it's off this way?
Cloud: Let's just head for land and get some information. Temple of the Ancients... that name bothers me.
"Yuffie: .........Hm. How 'bout goin' west? No, no reason. NO reason at all!"
On-screen: How to fly the Tiny Bronco Press the [OK] button to get on. Press the [CANCEL] button to get off. Tiny Bronco can cross shallow waters and rivers. Players can get on and off it on the beach.
"Yuffie: Wait, wait, wait, wai----t!!"
"Barret: What!? The hell happened, all of a sudden!?"
Tifa: What the--? Did something happen?
"Aeris: What!? What happened, all of a sudden?"
Red XIII: What happened all of a sudden!? Don't scare me like that!
"Cait Sith: Wh, wh, what is it, all of a sudden!? Don't scare me like that!"
Vincent: What happened all of a sudden? Did something happen?
Cid: What the HELL is it! Shoutin' out and jumpin' in front of me all of a sudden!
Yuffie: I know this area pretty well. It gets pretty tough past here. Better get ready...
"Barret: ...Hah, I know what you're thinkin'. And you sayin' that just now means you're up to somethin'! Right!?"
"Tifa: ...Really? Somehow,...I don't believe it. Are you trying to con us again...?"
"Aeris: ......Hmmm...... Something's fishy... You're not planning something sneaky again, are you?"
Red XIII: Hmm...... Smells fishy. You're not going to trick us again...?
"Barret: ...You serious? And you sayin' that just now means you're up to somethin'! Right!? That means, I don't trust you."
Tifa: ...Really? Something's telling me I still shouldn't trust you. Are you thinking of tricking us again...?
"Aeris: ......Hmmm... Something's fishy... You're not planning something sneaky again, are you?"
"Red XIII: Hmm,... Smells fishy. My nose never lies!"
"Cait Sith: You serious? I can't trust a person like you. But, I guess I'm not one to talk."
"Vincent: Further down? I don't see any signs of danger... Also, there's something unnatural in the way Yuffie's acting..."
"Cid: Hey! You, serious? If you're trying to con us, you won't get away with it!"
Yuffie: No! It's REALLY tough...
"Shinra Soldier: There they are, catch 'em!!"
Cloud: Shinra!?
Tifa: Shinra!?
"Cid: What, the Shinra!?"
"Shinra Soldier: Hey, that's not them! These are the other guys from before!!"
"Barret: Yuffie, so you're...!"
"Tifa: Yuffie, you're not......!"
"Aeris: Yuffie, did you by any chance..."
"Red XIII: So you were, Yuffie...!!"
"Cait Sith: Not bad, Yuffie, not bad at all."
Vincent: So what does this mean... You will explain this later...
"Cid: Yuffie! You sure got some nerve, kid!"
Yuffie: I didn't know! I have nothing to do with this one!
Barret: Whaddya mean 'this one'!? 'This one'! So you WERE plannin' somethin'!!
Tifa: This one? Did you just say 'THIS one'? So you WERE trying to pull something off!
Aeris: This one? What do you mean 'THIS one'? So you WERE up to something bad!
Red XIII: What do you mean 'this one' 'THIS one'! So you were concocting some evil scheme!!
Cait Sith: This one? What do you mean 'THIS one'? So you had something else that you're planning to trick us with!
"Vincent: What do you mean, 'This one'? You had something else in mind?"
Cid: Whaddya mean 'THIS one'! 'THIS one'! So you WERE planning some crooked $%*&!!
"Yuffie: No, umm, uh......"
Shinra Soldier: What should we do!?
Shinra Soldier: Uh......Get them! Grab them and ask questions later!!
Barret: The hell's goin' on!? I knew somethin' was missing. All my materia's gone!!
"Tifa: What's going on!? I thought something was fishy... My, my materia is missing!!"
Aeris: What's going on!? I thought something was missing... my materia's all gone!!
"Red XIII: What's going on? I thought something was funny, my materia, disappeared!!"
"Cait Sith: What's going on!? Something's missing, and it's my materia-it's all gone!!"
"Vincent: I thought something was wrong, So that's it. Look, my materia's been stolen..."
Cid: What the hell's goin' on! I knew I was missing something... My materia's gone!!
Red XIII: O...OH NO! All of our materia...gone!?
"Barret: Hey, we gotta problem! Our materia's all gone!!"
Cloud: Hey...where's Yuffie...?
Tifa: Hey...where's Yuffie...?
Cid: Ey...where the hell's that damn kid...?
Barret: That &*&$ kid!!! Grrrrrgh!! Arrrrrgh Uhhhhhhhhhhhh!!
"Barret: She was after our materia from the start!! She went North! When I get my hand on her, I'll get our materia back! C'mon! We're goin' after her!"
Tifa: She's done it to us again!! I'm never gonna forgive her!
Tifa: She was after our materia from the beginning. I won't let her get away with it! I'm pretty sure she ran off North. Let's go after her!!
Aeris: I'm so------ mad!!
Aeris: She was probably eyeing our materia from the beginning. Seems like she headed North. Let's hurry after her and get our materia back!
Red XIII: ZOUNDS!! Grrrrrrrgh...... Grrrgh! Grrrrrgh!!
"Red XIII: Her objective was stealing our materia from the beginning. ...sniff... North! She ran off to the North! I'm not going to let her get away with this! Hurry, hurry! We have to get our materia back!"
Cait Sith: She's done it again! She sure took us for fools!
"Cait Sith: She must've been after our materia from the beginning. We can't just let her get away, right? Then, let's hurry after her! Which way? It's North, the North! It's a message from the stars!"
Vincent: Inexcusable...
Vincent: Seems as though all that she was after was our materia. We can't just let her get away. She ran off......to the North... We must go after her and retrieve our materia back.
Cid: That little ^%#^$@!! Takin' me for a fool!!
Cid: No doubt about it! That kid was after my materia from the start!! Hmm... Seems like she went North. Don't be draggin' your asses! We're going right NOW! That $#@^ is history!!
"Cloud: ...First, I gotta do something about her."
Tifa: I can't just leave it there...
Cid: Damn kid! I'll get her no matter what!
Yuffie: Hey!!
NPC: This is MY house! Nobody gets in!
"Barret: Wait, that damn Yuffie's still gotta be somewhere in this cheap town! Or you all jes' gonna go on?"
"Tifa: Knowing Yuffie, she's still hidden somewhere in town. You sure?"
Aeris: I don't think she came out from here... Is that ok?
Red XIII: I know she hasn't left town! You still want to leave?
Vincent: She couldn't have left town... I think she is must still be here... Or do you want to go on?
Cid: You lettin' that damn kid off the hook? I know she's gotta be in this town somewhere!
"NPC: A girl with materia? No, there hasn't been anyone climbing Da-chao for some time now."
"NPC: What, Yuffie... It's best to ask Lord Godo about that. But today he's not in the best of... Well, I should say... But really he's not so......"
"NPC: Sorry, listen I... No, nothing...never mind."
"NPC: Sorry, but we're entirely sold out now. What's this here? Ah, no...that's uh... ...a sample! Yeah, that's it...a sample. Sorry, but why don't you all come back later?"
"Elena: Yy, you!? How did you get here...? Never mind that. I guess it's fate that brought us together. Get ready to die!!"
"Reno: ...Elena, you talk too much."
"Elena: Ww, what?"
Reno: What are we doing way out here in the middle of nowhere?
Elena: We're taking our vacation and resting up from our work.
Reno: Now our vacation is ruined.
"Elena: B, but..."
Rude: ...even the booze tastes bad now.
Elena: ...sorry...
"Elena: Hmm, you're lucky all right. Now get out of my sight! The next time we meet I won't be so nice."
Rude: To the Turks... To Reno...cheers!
"Reno: Drink, Rude! How long have we been a team...? There have been hard times being a Turk, but all in all, I'm glad I did it. I even got to meet a bunch of wing nuts like you."
NPC: You know I've noticed that there's a pounding noise from time to time in this store.
"NPC: Anyhow, for some reason Yuffie's had a fondness for materia ever since I can remember. She's always hung around places she thought might have it."
"On-screen: Received ""MP Absorb"" Materia!"
"On-screen: Stole ""MP Absorb"" Materia!"
NPC: Huh? What? You DID?
NPC: Yuffie? I saw her a while ago. She must be in one of the houses around here.
"NPC: Yuffie's like that, you know. Sometimes she'll just bust into people's houses. Then she hides in the shadows... Just like a little kid."
"Godo: GOOGAH...what do you want? Don't have...GAH...anything much but, you should be able to...GOO...rest yourselves here. GOGAH...make yourselves at home."
"Godo: ......Yuffie? ......nope, never heard of her. ...GOOGO..."
"Godo: ...you again? I told you once, and I'm telling you again, I don't know her."
"Godo: Listen, I said I didn't know her! There isn't anyone named Yuffie here in Wutai!"
Godo: ...never seen you around here before... Lately I've been seeing a lot of Shinra soldiers around here... You wouldn't have anything to do with that would you?
"Godo: I don't care about who you are. But if you're in trouble with the Shinra, I'm going to have to ask you to leave. I don't want the Shinra hanging around here looking over my shoulder."
"Yuffie: What's with you, you coward!"
Godo: Yuffie......!
"Yuffie: You scared of the Shinra? Then why don't you fall into line and obey them, just like all of the other towns! Those guys are the ones who are really fighting the Shinra!"
Godo: Shut up! What would you know about this?
"Yuffie: You get beaten once, and then that's it? What happened to the mighty Wutai I used to know?"
Godo: No kid like you's going to talk to me like that! You keep acting like that! You ought to be ashamed of yourself!
"Yuffie: That's my style! And it's my own business, not yours! Don't you try and dictate what I should do!"
Godo: Style...? Dictate...? Throwin' around all those fancy words... You're a miserable daughter!
Yuffie: Hmph! You're a sad excuse for a father!!
"Godo: ......take your things and get out of here now. To protect Wutai, we cannot afford to stand up to Shinra."
NPC 1: Oh no! More weirdos
"NPC 2: No, these aren't like the one from a while ago, but these ones look weird too!"
"NPC: What are we going to do, Gramps? Some strange-looking girl came in here a minute ago and I..."
Yuffie: .......
"NPC: That reminds me, Lately I've been seeing a kid around here that reminds me of Yuffie. Always sneakin' around corners And into somethin' she shouldn't be."
NPC: It's been really loud and busy outside. Someone outside must be up to something bad...
"Cloud: You can't get away, Yuffie."
"Tifa: Give it up, Yuffie!"
"Cid: You lost, Yuffie."
"Yuffie: O...ok, I know... I was wrong...... You win. I'll give you back your materia..."
"(After this, perspective shifts to Turtle's Paradise.)Shinra soldier: So our reports were right! He IS here on vacation! We've finally found him! Get the Turks here for back-up!"
Reno: ...what a drag.
"Shinra soldier: Ww, what was that...?"
Reno: Right now we're off duty and can't run off to save your butts.
"Shinra soldier: We know you're off duty, but..."
"Reno: If you knew that, then don't bother us! Lookin' at you is makin' me sober."
Shinra soldier: But you all have orders from headquarters to look for him too!
"Shinra soldier: All right, that's it! We'll get him without any help from the Turks, just you see! And don't think that headquarters isn't going to hear about this!!"
"Elena: Reno, do you think that was really such a good idea!? I mean is that the way a professional, a Turk would act!?"
Reno: Elena. Don't misunderstand. A pro isn't someone who sacrifices himself for his job. That's just a fool.
Elena: Rude...?
Rude: .........
"Elena: Well, I don't buy that! Goodbye!!"
Rude: .........
Reno: Relax. She's not a child. Let her have her way now...
"(After perspective shifts back to the party, in Yuffie's house.)Yuffie: I know, the materia, right? I have it stored in a safe place. ...Follow me."
"Yuffie: ...I've been hearing that ever since I was little. Before I was born, Wutai was a lot more crowded and more important..."
"Yuffie: You saw what it looks like now, right? ...JUST a resort town... After we lost the war, we got peace, but with that, we lost something else. Now look at Wutai..."
Yuffie: That's why... if I had lots of materia I could...
"Cloud: Listen, Yuffie. I don't care about the history of Wutai or your feelings. You've got our materia and I want it back ...now. If you give it back now, we'll drop the whole thing."
"Tifa: I'm sorry, Yuffie. I know how you feel, but we need materia too. ...We just can't let you have it. Please understand."
"Cid: ......Dammit, Yuffie. We ain't got time to be listening to your life story. If you want materia, get it yourself. That's how you should do it."
Yuffie: I know. I know that...
"Yuffie: That...sniff...switch... the lever on the left...... materia's...sniff, hic...in there."
Barret: Ain't nuthin' we can do about it...
"Tifa: Now, the Materia..."
"Aeris: I feel bad, but......"
Red XIII: Were we a little too harsh on her?
"Cait Sith: Well, let's get our materia back."
Vincent: There was nothing else to do.
Cid: Hmmph... I dunno......
Barret: Wh...what the hell is this!?
Tifa: Eyaaaaah
Aeris: Eyaaaaah
"Red XIII: Wh, what are you doing!?"
"Cait Sith: Wh, what is this!?"
Cid: Whoa!?
Yuffie: Ha ha ha------! Never trust anyone that easily!!
Yuffie: Ha ha------! You should've listened!!
Yuffie: The Materia's mine! Tough!
"Yuffie: You want your materia? Then go find it yourself! Yeah that's right. And when you're looking for the materia, remember you gotta steel it. Heh heh... steel...steel! Get it?"
Yuffie: C ya!!
"Barret: Y, yo, wait up!!"
Tifa: W...wait don't leave us here!
"Aeris: Wait, don't leave us!"
Red XIII: Help us first!
Cait Sith: Hey help us...please!
"Vincent: Wait, don't go by yourself!"
Cid: Hey! Help me first!
Rude: .........
Reno: ....... It's just that we're off duty! I don't feel like drinking with you. And don't talk to me
Yuffie: Let go! I SAID let GO! Hey! Who do you think I...... OW! What're you doin'...? Jerk!
Cloud: You.......!
Tifa: Oh! You're......!
"Cid: Ww, who are you!?"
"Corneo: .......ho...... ...............ho......... Hohi, hohi! Hohihi!"
Cloud: Corneo!?
Tifa: Don Corneo!?
Cid: The hell are you doing!
"Corneo: Hohi! I've finally got a new chicky! Two for one, in fact! Hohi, hohi!"
Party leader: Two!?
Elena: H......hey! Let go of me! You're gonna regret this!!
"Corneo: Hohi, hohi! Hohihi!"
Shinra soldier: There he is! It's Corneo! Don't let him get away!
Shinra soldier: Attaaaack!
Rude: .......Elena.
Reno: Hmm... that Corneo is good at escaping...
Rude: .......Elena.
"Reno: Let's go, Rude. We'll give them a taste of what the Turks can do."
Reno: ......Sounded pretty good.
"Reno: If Elena is in his hands, that's going to make things a little difficult. And uh..."
"Cloud: ......Ok. Corneo took Yuffie from us. And without Yuffie, there's no way we'll get our materia back."
"Tifa: ......all right. Corneo stole Yuffie from us, as well. And without her, there's no way we'll get our materia back."
"Cid: ......that's just beautiful! And now that *#$^@'s walked off with Yuffie, too! And without that brat, we can't get our hands on our materia!"
"Reno: Don't misunderstand. We have no intention of joining you. But for now, we'll agree not to bother each other. That's all."
"Cloud: That's fine. We have absolutely no intention of cooperating with the Turks either. Now, uh, just what direction did Corneo run off to?"
Tifa: The same goes for us. We don't want to be friendly with the Turks. Now which direction did Corneo run off in?
"Cid: Of course! There ain't no way we'd wanna join up with the Turks anyway! Anyhow, which direction did that%^$*& run off in?"
"Reno: Hmm, nice attitude. Here's a clue, it's the place that stands out the most."
NPC: Two girls just went off towards Da-chao. I wonder if that place is starting to become popular with the kids? One had herself all tangled up in a rope. And the other one kind of looked like Yuffie.
"NPC: Alright, alright, alright! I saw an old man in flashy clothes running towards Da-chao! He was babblin' somethin' and looked like he could float! It almost bowled me over!"
"Reno: You're finally here. We're gonna split into two. You do whatever you want. But don't endanger Elena. Don't worry. We won't do anything to that girl, Yuffie. For now..."
"Reno: You all thought they might be here too, huh? We were way off. There's no way they could get that far."
Rude: ......
"Reno: Don't fool around. You know the enemy's not gonna wait for us, right?"
Yuffie: LET...ME......GO!!!!
Corneo: Hmm! Delicious...scrumptious! I think I've just found a new HOBBY!
Corneo: Which shall it be? Hmm...Hmm...
Corneo: Should I go...with HER?
"Elena: He...hey, I'm one of the 'Turks'! Don't think you can get away with this!?"
Corneo: Or...maybe...HER?
"Yuffie: Oh GAWD! If I knew this was gonna happen, I would've taken rope escape lessons more seriously!!"
Corneo: Hmm!!! I've made my choice! My companion for the night will be......
Corneo: ...the cheerful one!
Yuffie: GROSS-NESS! Don't mess with me old man! You don't even have any Materia!
"Corneo: Oooooh! And she's saucy, too! Wheee! Wheee!"
"Cloud: All right, that's it!!"
Corneo: Hee-haw. What...what's goin' on!? Who's there?
Yuffie: Oh man! Cloud......!
Corneo: Wheeel...long time no see.
Tifa: Hold it right there!
Corneo: Hee-haw. What...what's goin' on!? Who's there?
Yuffie: Oh man! Tifa......!
Corneo: Wheeel...long time no see.
"Cid: Hey, hey, hey! That's as far as you go!"
Corneo: Hee-haw. What...what's goin' on!? Who's there?
"Yuffie: Oh man! That old fart, Cid......!"
Corneo: Hmm...Who are you guys!?
Cloud: Don't tell me you forgot...
Tifa: That fall into the trap really hurt!
"Aeris: You just don't get it, do you...!?"
"Cid: Maybe God'd forgive an ugly ^#@# like you, but I won't!"
Barret: You damn Midgar hyena...!
Red XIII: Hurry and let the two go!
"Vincent: I don't care what you're doing, so much as the idiotic way you're doing it..."
"Cait Sith: Listen you stupid, slimy, sleazy old scab bag! If you want to get women, there's such a thing as the RIGHT way!"
"Corneo: Be quiet! None of you know how much I've suffered since then... It's a long story, but......"
Tifa: We don't want to hear it! Just let the two go!
"Cid: I don't really give a damn! You're gonna let the two girls go, or else I'm gonna break your arm!"
Cloud: I don't really care! Let Yuffie and Elena go!
"Corneo: Hmm...You guys are...serious. ......Good, good. ...this ain't no time for me to be fooling around either..."
"Corneo: Why did you kill my little Aps? I'm gonna make you PLAY with my new pet, so you won't get in the way of my search for a bride!"
Corneo: RAPPS---come here!!
Corneo: Wait... Just wait a second!
Cloud: SHUT UP!
Tifa: You better say your prayers!
"Cid: Don't be such a poor loser, old man!"
Corneo: Just listen to me - it won't take long. Why do you think a bad guy like me would swallow his pride and plead for his life?
Corneo: Hmm...! WRONG...!
Corneo: Hmm...! RIGHT!
"Corneo: Hmm...! Close, but no cigar...!"
Elena: Eyaaaah...!
Yuffie: Makes me so MAD...!
"Corneo: If I push this button, they'll fall upside down, and we'll have a SQUASHED TOMATOES!"
Cloud: Damn...!
Tifa: Coward!
Cid: So this is how a loser lives...!
Barret: Damn dirty-playin' $#%@&T$*^%$!
Aeris: All right...
Red XIII: Grrrrrgh...!
Cait Sith: You sure are vulgar!
Vincent: ......!
"Corneo: Now, give me your women too!"
"Corneo: Ha, ha, ha, ha! I guess I'm the one laughing last!"
"Reno: No, that would be us."
Corneo: Hee-haw. What...what's goin' on!? Who's there?
Corneo: ...The Turks!
Reno: You knew this was gonna happen ever since you leaked that secret. We're going to take care of you... personally.
Corneo: DAMMIT! Then they're all goin' with me!
Corneo: Ugh...!
"Reno: Good timing, Rude."
Rude: ...Let's get to work.
"Reno: All right, Corneo. This'll be over quick, so listen up. Why do you think we went to all the trouble of teaming up with those guys to get you...? 1. Because we were ready to die 2. Because we were sure of victory 3. Because we were clueless"
Corneo: Two...Number two?
Reno: All wrong.
"Corneo: No...! Wait, sto......!"
Corneo: Aaaaaaaaaa......p
Reno: The correct answer was...
Rude: ...because it's our job.
"Elena: Oh, thank you very much...! I never expected you'd to come help......"
"Reno: Elena, don't act so weak. You're a Turks!"
"Elena: Y...Yes, sir!"
Tifa: Th...Thanks.
Aeris: Thanks for your help.
Barret: Never thought you'd come an' help us...
Cait Sith: You guys have some good in you.
Red XIII: I'll just say you...helped.
"Cid: I guess, thanks for today."
Vincent: It would appear thanks are in order...
Rude: ......
Reno: Yes...this is Reno. Yes...Yes... I'll get on it right away.
Elena: Was that the company?
"Reno: Yeah, they want us to find Cloud..."
Rude: Are we on...?
"Reno: No, today we're off duty."
Yuffie: Hey---who cares about that!? Get----me-----down----!
"Yuffie: Phew, perfect. Now the materia is back in its rightful place."
Cloud: Hey...the placement of it is all messed up.
"Tifa': Hey, what is this...? The placement of it's all messed up!"
Cid: What the hell's goin' on!? The placement of the materia's all messed up!
"Yuffie: Huh? Oh, it'll be all right... Don't be so picky!"
"Yuffie: Anyways, that sure was close...... No, normally I would kick their butts, Boom, Bang!! That Corneo guy's a real pain. I'd rather deal with my dad than deal with that guy."
"Yuffie: Oh, by the way, some of those guys from the Turks are good, huh? At least, after all that, we got the materia back. Now come on everybody, let's continue our journey..."
Yuffie: ......Hey!! W......Wait!
"Yuffie: Oh, all right. Here, I'll give this to you guys."
"Yuffie: Here, look, look!"
"On-screen: Received ""MP Absorb"" Materia!"
Yuffie: .........
"Yuffie: ...No, forget it. Besides, they have lots of materia anyway."
"Yuffie: Come on, wait---! No matter what anyone says, I'm going with you!"
Yuffie: ...next time......
Gorky: Freeze!
"Gorky: You aren't from Wutai, are you?"
Gorky: Only those from Wutai are allowed in the tower! I'll have to ask for you to leave!
Gorky: Hey! I hate people who lie about their identities! Leave this tower at once!
Gorky: Miss Yuffie! You cannot go on to the second floor unless you defeat me!
Gorky: ...
"Gorky: Oh, Miss Yuffie! Will you be climbing the pagoda today?"
"Gorky: Then I, Sacred Gorky, will be your opponent on the first floor!"
Shake: Yo! They call me Shake! I'll be watchin' your fight with Gorky!
"Gorky: Then, begin!"
Gorky: Power Change!
"Gorky: Here I am, Miss Yuffie!"
Yuffie: Of course!
"Shake: Hmm, I thought you were just a wild girl, but you handled that pretty well! Well, we'll see how you do on next one..."
"Gorky: It's just my opinion, but you need more training! Gorky is disappointed!"
Shake: No good! You have to do Gorky! Are you mocking this Pagoda?
Yuffie: Shut up! Shut up! SHADDUP!
Gorky: Winning Miss Yuffie's heart must mean you have tremendous skill.
"Gorky: Here I am, Miss Yuffie!"
"Shake: Hey, you there! Don't ignore me!"
Shake: You aren't good enough to be here! This is the Wutai Temple of Martial Arts!
Yuffie: Who's next?
Shake: Are you blind? I'm right here!
Yuffie: What? I gotta fight a punk?
Shake: Heh! Punk. I'm more of an adult than some bimbo girl!
"Yuffie: Wh, what did you say!?"
Shake: See what I mean? That kind of anger's what makes you so immature! Don't pat yourself on the back until you beat me!
Yuffie: Now watch...!
Shake: 'bout the only thing you do really good is breathe! Sure you're brave enough to fight?
"Chekhov: Hm, so someone finally got past Gorky. So, I guess it's time for Chekhov to stand in..."
"Shake: Here I go, brat! Speed Change!"
Shake: URRGRAAAAGH! So you CAN fight a bit!
Yuffie: Of course!
"Chekhov: Ho, ho, ho... It's been a while since I felt pain..."
Shake: HYAAAAAAH! BRATBRATBRATBRAT!!
Chekhov: You can't go to the next floor unless you beat Shake.
Yuffie: Shut up! Shut up! SHADDUP!
"Shake: So when it comes down to it, you're just all talk. Brat!"
"Shake: Compared to me, all of you are nothin' but a buncha babies."
Shake: URRGRAAAAGH! So you CAN fight a bit!
"Chekhov: How dare they mock us like that, thinking they could sneak past us."
"Chekhov: That being the case, we have nothing further to discuss."
"Staniv: So even Shake's been defeated. It's been a while since you had to fight, Chekhov."
"Chekhov: Unfortunately, this is as far as it goes. Staniv, you watch over there."
Yuffie: That ain't going to happen! I'll teach you about the strength of youth!
"Chekhov: Keep mouthing off like that, little girl, and you're going to get burned."
"Chekhov: Ho, ho, ho. We'll see if you still talk like that after you taste some of my Sacred Magic..."
Chekhov: Magic Change!
Chekhov: I can't believe you beat me...
Yuffie: Of course!
Staniv: This should be interesting...! It's been a long time since I've had a chance to use my powers to their fullest...
"Chekhov: Ho, ho, ho! What does a immature young child know...?"
Staniv: So this IS the average person's limit...
Yuffie: Shut up! Shut up! SHADDUP!
"Chekhov: Ho, ho, ho. What do you expect from a child barely out of diapers!?"
"Staniv: First, Chekhov will keep you company..."
Chekhov: Managing that girl must be exceedingly rough on you.
Chekhov: I can't believe you beat me...
Staniv: HAAAAH!
"Staniv: If it were not for Miss Yuffie, I wouldn't be facing him..."
Yuffie: Huh? Who's the one I'm supposed to beat?
"Staniv: The rule is the best fighter on each floor will be your opponent... Although it's a five-storied pagoda, the fourth floor is the highest... In other words, no one has ever defeated me--Master of Weaponry! You still want to try...?"
Staniv: I like you! Now watch...
Staniv: Weapon Change!
"Staniv: Wh, what...!?"
Yuffie: Of course!
Gorky: Splendid! Your level and skills have improved...
"Shake: Oh, ho! You might not be as much of a child as we thought you were!"
Chekhov: Of course. If WE lost to her...
"Staniv: You have defeated four of our best, but now you will have to face HIM......!"
Staniv: How unfortunate! It was over before I could even put all of my strength into it...
Yuffie: Shut up! Shut up! SHADDUP!
Staniv: You don't seem like the kind of person who can make it to the fourth floor without a problem...
"Staniv: I would like to fight you, however the Five Sacred Gods can only compete with those from Wutai..."
"Staniv: Wh, what...!?"
Gorky: ......
Shake: Sh......!
Chekhov: ...
Staniv: ......
Godo: ...Hm. You can do it......
"Yuffie: D,...Dad!?"
"Godo: I'm glad you made it this far, Yuffie!"
"Yuffie: Why, why are you......"
Godo: I'll answer you by having you try your skills against me! Hold nothing back. Come as if you're trying to kill me! If you don't...then I'll have to kill you!
Yuffie: H...hey!
Godo: What are you doing! OMNI-Change!.......!!
"Yuffie: I'll show you this time, you old Fart-meister!"
Godo: Hmm? A slight improvement.
Godo: Come at me with all you have! OMNI-Change!......!!
Yuffie: Dammit......
Godo: Ohhh! And what was that!? Come back when you get more training!
Yuffie: ...heave......heave...
Godo: ...huff......puff......
Yuffie: O...old coot... n......ot...bad...
Godo: You've......also......improved...
"Yuffie: Hah...Ha, ha......"
"Godo: ...Heh, heh......"
Yuffie: Ha ha haaaaaa......!
Godo: Waha haaaaa......!
"Godo: It's time I gave this to you, Yuffie... This is Leviathan Materia. Take it."
"On-screen: Received ""Leviathan"" Materia!"
"Godo: ...I thought I'd give it to you, but you have no place to hold it. Then, come back for it later. And don't forget!"
"Staniv: But, Lord Godo. The Leviathan Materia should only be given to the person who conquers and takes over this Pagoda. That is our custom..."
"Yuffie: CUSTOM, CUSTOM, CUSTOM... I'm so sick of hearing that! It's so stupid!"
"Gorky: Silence, Miss Yuffie!"
Yuffie: Then what 'bout all the rest of you? You have all that power... Are you satisfied being cooped up in this tower?
Godo: Yuffie...!
"Yuffie: You too, dad...! Just because you lost the war! And turning Wutai into a place like this!"
Chekhov: ...What do you want to say?
Yuffie: You turned Wutai into a cheesy resort town peddling to tourists... How dare you!? Da-chao Statue and Leviathan are ashamed!!
Godo: ...
Shake: She IS a kid.
"Yuffie: Wh, what did you say...!?"
Godo: Yuffie!!
Godo: Forgive me... It's all my fault...
"Gorky: What are you saying, Lord Godo!"
Godo: Losing the war...turning Wutai into this. It was all my fault...
Chekhov: Lord Godo!
Godo: Silence!!
"Godo: Yuffie...... I am the same now as I was before when I wanted the war. But, after I lost the war, I began to think... Is strength, only for defeating the enemy? ...or just something to show-off to others...? Might begets might. That's the same way as the Shinra..."
Yuffie: ......
"Godo: I knew you were looking for Materia for the good of Wutai. But, the reason I hide my strength now, is also for the good of Wutai... And now, I realize both are necessary... Strength without determination means nothing. And determination without strength is equally useless...!"
Staniv: Lord Godo...
"Godo: You there, please take Yuffie with you! I perceive that you all have both determination and strength!"
"Cid: Well, just tell yourself you're on a big ship, and leave the rest to ol' Cid!"
"Cait Sith: If you put it that way, we can't refuse..."
Red XIII: As long as she doesn't get in our way...!
Aeris: All right. We'll take your daughter with us.
"Tifa: ...after that, how can we refuse?"
Vincent: Hmm... You may come if you want to ...
Barret: Jes' don't do nothin' funny to our Materia...!
"Cloud: All right, I don't mind."
"Godo: Go, Yuffie! For the sake of strengthening Wutai!"
Yuffie: Dad...
Godo: I'll take care of the Five Sacred Gods until you return! Go! And come back alive!
Yuffie: ......
Yuffie: Of course!
"Godo: Yuffie, wait a minute. The Materia they all have... After their battle is over, you think they'll still want it?"
Yuffie: Dad...!
Godo: Go! Survive till the end! And return! With the Materia!
"Yuffie: Heh, heh...you bet!"
"Clerk: He, HEY! Waitaminit you!! You can't just walk outta here without buyin' somethin'... Might be unhealthy fer ya, if ya know what I mean."
NPC: You dried up old geez. You tired? Why don't you rest up on the third floor of my house? There's just one condition. You gotta give me some cash.
"NPC: Damn, man!! Just forget about it!"
"NPC: Oh man, oh man...... Go ahead 'n' help yourself to the room."
"NPC: Geez, dude, you're really old. You sure you ain't poorer than me?"
NPC: Cheap%#*^...
"NPC: Use whatever bed you want. Sleep tight, old guy."
"(Upon entering the bedroom at the top of the weapons store if the player has not paid for the room.)NPC: This is a slum, so don't think you can stay for free. What are you going to do? Doesn't just seeing the bed make you sleepy?"
"NPC: Sweet dreams, pops."
"NPC: Rough times, huh pop? Not a dime on you?"
"NPC: Tough guy, huh!? You'd better sleep when you can. You'd better save when you can. That's the trick to being tough. Remember that, old dude."
Cloud: hoo...
"Conductor: When you've been a train man as long as I have, you see a lot of people and a lot of lives. People meeting, parting, joy, sadness... After a while, it doesn't even get to you anymore."
Conductor: I wonder how long it's been... There's an invisible rail between me and the passengers. I could never live their lives. I'm just a train man plain and simple. It's easier that way.
"Conductor: That's not to say that the crossing gate of my heart doesn't hurt now and again. Back during the war, I remember there was a lot of painful scenes then. But, that's a story for another day..."
Conductor: First train leaves Midgar at 05:04am.
"NPC: Hey now!! Oops!! What on earth are you doing? Just butt out......geez! Huh? You come to see it, too? There was a bombing on top. If this pillar should come down, everyone in the slums is dust... Well, there's no point in worryin' about that. Hey!! Look! It's huge, ain't it? Hey... This is a strange and wonderful place. This is my place, but you can come here when you want. Bye, bro!"
"Barret: Yo, Cloud! Over here, now!"
Guard 1: Ah...eh...uhm............ Excuse me. You cannot pass without the proper clearance. Did I do good this time?
Guard 2: You gotta be tougher!
"Guard 1: But, uh, I......"
Guard 2: What the hell do you want? You know who I am? You can't pass. I got the miserable job of keepin' scum like you from trying to sneak in here.
"Guard 1: W, wow! You're great!!"
"Guard 2: Damn right!! Don't waste time talkin's, what I always say!"
"Guard 1: But, uh, I......"
"NPC: Hey!! What the, YOU? Anyone talking to me must be a novice."
Cloud: So what. Everyone's a beginner sometime.
"NPC: Don't act so big, amateur. Seein' as how I'm such a warm hearted guy, I'll show ya the ropes. You come back here tomorrow. I got some things I gots ta do."
"Cloud: The name's Cloud. Used to be with SOLDIER, I got no business with you."
"NPC: Hmmph!! Well, I never heard of ya!"
"NPC: Unn......!! Who the hell are you!? No unauthorized access. Since today's special, I'm gonna let you in on a juicy bit of news. But you gotta keep it to yourself. Do you know about what's been going on......?"
"NPC: I guess you must be sick of hearing it... But it's been so long since there was any real news here. You're worried where it's all heading, right?"
"NPC: Everything's in a buzz 'bout that terrorist group AVALANCHE blowin' up the Sector 1 Mako Reactor. On the surface they say they're an anti-Shinra group, but in reality... They say they're just out to kill as many people as they can. Gyaaaa, Haaa haaa!! That's a good one, ain't it!? While they're bustin' things up on top, the only ones makin' out good are us weapon stores! Now, if we can just get rid of this back stock, we'll be doin' ok."
"NPC: You know what I do? I'll bet you don't. You come here tomorrow and I'll tell you. Ahh, there just ain't no good jobs here in the slums. I wanna go to the upper world."
NPCs: I'm not letting you go tonight. Wow!
NPCs: Isn't there somewhere we could go to be alone? Wow! There's only the train graveyard around here. And they say there's ghosts around too! .......damn. What?
NPC: I'm not opening up. Go away!!
Clerk: We're closed today. Come back tomorrow.
Cloud: What crappy handwriting. And look at all this graffiti!
Sign: Don't be taken in by the Shinra. Mako energy will not last forever. Mako is the life of the Planet and that life is finite. The end is coming. Saviors of the Planet: AVALANCHE
"Johnny: Woo......ah geez, I'm blitzed. I jes love them homemade cocktails. But they sure do creep up on ya."
"NPC: Oh Jesus!! What the hell's wrong tonight!! I thought that long blackout was strange. They say a Mako Reactor was destroyed above. I was jes sittin' here drinkin', watchin' the news by myself. 'n' all of a sudden I get kicked outta the &*%$ store. What's up with that!?"
NPC: I wasn't even done with my drink. I didn't even pay my bill...
NPC: Explosions! Explosions! Oh Man! AVALANCHE is so cool!
NPC: Did you hear?
"NPC: There's a news update. They say that there was a terrorist explosion up above, and that this time it was a Mako Reactor!! You know what this means?"
"NPC: Ya see, I keep on top of these things, an' if ya ask me...... If you knock out Midgar's power, then all of its computers and signals are going to be knocked out too. Financially there must've been about a billion gil worth of damage. An' that ain't all!! A lotta innocent people got killed too! If the explosion had been in the middle of the night, that woulda been one thing. At least the people coulda gone in their sleep."
"NPC: Oh, well excuse ME!"
"NPC: Oh, well excuse ME!"
NPC: This Mako explosion has really sent Midgar into a fit.
"NPC: Hey, come over here. But people will... Who cares? But... There's a weirdo over there. Huh? Say, you're pretty gutsy. Why don't you go snoop somewhere else, Romeo?"
Johnny: Hey!! Open up! C'mon baby!! It's me! Johnny! Mom!!
"NPC: There's a TV in there, but my cheap aunt won't let me in the house. Look for yourself."
"NPC: Now that you mention it, there used to be an outside TV monitor here in the slums. But that Barret, busted it up. Shot it up with that weird machine gun hand of his. Blam, blam, blam. I think it was when President Shinra was on. He was on again this morning, too, you know. Tifa better watch out for her TV."
"NPC: All's quiet!! Shh, I'm spying now! OH!! There's something!! DANGER!! ALERT!!"
NPC: Did you hear?
"NPC: About that little girl named Tifa and that bar called '7th Heaven'. I'm not only informed, I'm kinda nosey too. Anyhow, I got the scoop. You wanna hear?"
"NPC: That Barret and three of his henchmen are like this sometimes. Suddenly, they threw out a customer and start talking trash to him. It's strange, if you ask me. And that place always smells like gun powder. It's dangerous, I tell you. They must be doing terrible things in there."
"NPC: Oh really? Well, aren't you a cool one!"
"NPC: Oh really? Well, aren't you a cool one!"
"NPC: Heh heh...He'll forget about it. OH, you!! Get my friend on the second floor to teach ya."
On-screen: How to use the buttons.
Cloud: Huh? Finger!? What the hell?
On-screen: I'm the position cursor!! Call me whenever you're walking around confused! Push the [SELECT] button and I'll appear over your shiny little head.
"Cloud: Geez, you stand out even more than I do..."
"On-screen: Am I in the way? If so, just push the [SELECT] button one more time. I'm pretty busy myself, and can't always come when you need me. If I don't show up sometimes, don't get mad. Later! [Position Cursor] Push the [SELECT] button when you're lost in the field. Usually, the [Position Cursor] will appear on the screen. But wait!! [Red triangles] mark the exits and [Green triangles] mark ladders. These will help you safely make it through even the darkest streets or dangerous mountains! But, there are times when it won't appear, so be careful."
NPC: This is the Beginner's Hall. You say you're a beginner? But your eyes say you're not.
Cloud: Don't mess with me. I used to be in SOLDIER. I'll tell you how much I know... an' for free too!
Cloud: What do you want to know?
"Cloud: Now I'll tell you about saving. You know what'll happen if you don't save? That's right. Everything you worked so hard to do will be lost! You never know when there might be a power outage. And you've got a long battle ahead of you. It pays to save often and take breaks when you need them. Anyway you'll need a Memory card to save your games. But, uh, none of the stores around here sell any. You'll have to get some at a (real) store. I guess you already have a Memory card. Put the Card firmly into the slot. Put it in either the right or left side. Then when you're ready, access the menu. Select [Save]. Remember you can't just save wherever you want. You can only save at places marked [Save Point]. When you find one, a message will appear. Whenever you reach a [Save Point], you'll want to save your game. Slot 1 is on the left, slot 2 on the right. Choose either one. Next, choose your file and save it. Each Memory card can hold up to 15 files. If you have files from other games on it, there will be less room to save. The screen only shows 3 files at a time so, press the directional buttons to scroll down the list, and you can see the rest. Remember, the more files you have, the longer it will take to load. One last thing. The Memory card is a delicate device. Be careful when handling it. Never remove it while saving or loading. Don't get mad even if you lose. If that happens, just chill out, and let your head, and your console, cool down. That's all. Remember to save often so you don't lose your games."
"Cloud: First, you need Potions."
"NPC: You're a stingy one. Here, I'll give you ONE Potion."
NPC: I don't have any extra Potions on me. Why don't you go buy some?
"Cloud: You probably already know this but... HP is your life force. If HP is lost in battle, you're out of commission. MP is the source of your magic power. If your MP's lost, you'll be unable to cast spells. So, what should we do to cure a damaged ally? There are three ways. First, you can rest at an inn at a nearby town. Second, you can use items to help them recover. Third, you can use curative magic. I'll explain about Magic later, but here we'll talk about items. Select [Item] from the menu. Potion restores HP. If you can't find where Potion is, access the menu and select [Arrange] to change the order of items. You can arrange them however you like. Order items you'll use in the field. Order items you'll use in battle. Prioritize items you can throw in battle. Order weapons and armor separately. Order by name Order by most items held Order by least items held By the way, [Key Item]'s are just that, items that unlock problems just like a key. They're very important items to have. Keep that in mind. Ok, now select [Use], Then select [Potion]. Select the person you want to use it on. If they're already maxed out, you won't be able to use it on them. We can restore MP with [Ether]. You use this the same way you did for [Potion]. Just pick a member and use it! The number appearing next to the item name tells you how many are available. Of course, the more you use, the less you'll have. Some enemies will drop Potions or Ethers, but you'll want to stock up whenever you're at a store. One last thing, if someone in your party gets wiped out, either rest at an inn or use [Phoenix Down]. That's all!"
"Cloud: Now I'll tell you how to use curative magic. First, access the menu and select [Magic]. Next, select who'll cast the spell. Pick an ally equipped with [Restore] Materia. You can select another party member by using the L1 and R1 buttons. The function also work in other sub menus. Better remember that. This is magic you can use, monsters you can summon, and enemy techniques you've learned. Whenever [Magic] is selected... the available magic appears on the screen... So, if you wanted to use [Cure]... you would select it from the menu... then select who you want to use it on. I think Potion is pretty expensive, so... when you're near an inn and you can restore MP, it's better to use curative magic rather than Potion. That's all."
"Cloud: Equipping weapons & armor is basic to battle. Let me show you how it's done. Just finding or buying new weapons or armor, isn't enough. You have to access the menu and select [Equip]. Then, select who you want to equip. You can change weapons, armor and accessories. Accessories have special effects. Just select what you want to change. On the right side of the screen, here's a list of what can be equipped. You can see the item's effect here. Change your weapon with the OK button. Make sure it'll increase attack/defense levels. Pay special attention to Materia slots. The slots that are linked are effective. Also check the growth rates of Materia. Now when you want to remove an accessory... press the triangle button here. You should never remove weapons or armor. Because you never know when you'll be attacked. After you're finished equipping, you should re-equip your Materia. That's it!"
"Cloud: Materia can unleash hidden power in humans. So let's see how Materia is used. First, access the menu. Then select [Materia]. Select who you want to use it. Pay close attention to my weapon here. Each weapon and armor has slots in them. Choose which slot you want to put Materia in. Now select the Materia you want to use. This is curative Materia. If you want to know what its effect is, line the cursor up with [Check], and push the OK button. It's just like selecting battle commands. Just line the cursor up to [magic], you can see that the available magic has increased. Now you can use new magic [Cure]. And that's all there is to equipping Materia. See? It wasn't that tough! When you want to remove Materia, it's as easy as pointing to the materia slot, and pushing the triangle button. There's only one thing you have to watch out for. When you equip Materia, your condition changes. Parts of you will become stronger... while others get weaker. Normally, when you equip [Magic] Materia, your magic power will get stronger. But your physical strength weakens. So, Materia's kind of a double-edged sword. The left side of the screen, shows the effect of the Materia. Try out everything. And that's all. I'll tell you about some of the finer points next."
"Cloud: Access the menu if you find Materia. There's a lot of different Materia around. This is one of them. It's [All] Materia. If you equip this alone, nothing will happen. It's a little tricky, but I'll tell you anyway. Now look at my weapon. Look closely at those two slots. They're joined together as linked slots. You've got to remember to put it into linked slots. Different Materia will affect each other. But only if the slots are linked. Just to show you, let's put some [All] into one of the slots, and [Lightning] in the other. Now we can use [Bolt] on [All] the enemies. But it's limited to once per battle. Combine different things and you'll come up with different results. Combining [Restore] and [All], will let you use [Cure] for your entire party. There are also many useless combinations. For example, [Restore] and [Lightning] [Bolt] and [Cure] can be used normally, but there won't be any compound effect. Specialized Materia like [All] is called [Support Materia]. You can tell the difference just by looking at the Materia's color. This may sound weird, but did you know Materia grows on its own? Even if one of your allies uses it, it will continue to grow with each battle. As its level increases, so will the effects of the magic you can use. I told you [All] works once per battle. But it can work twice or more as it grows. When you get it to the master level, Materia will divide itself, looking like it's giving birth. But that master Materia won't grow anymore. When you can't take Materia on anymore, you'd better sell it or dump it somewhere. You can see the useful functions here. You can [Arrange] Materia, [Remove all] Materia from your weapon. You can throw Materia into the [Trash]. Oops, relax! I wasn't gonna dump it. Let's see. This is a special menu for you. You can exchange all Materia you have between allies, even if they're not in your party. Now about Materia's growth. The growth rate depends on what weapon or armor it's put into. Some will double in growth, while others won't grow at all. In most cases, the Materia's effect won't change whether you put it into a weapon or armor. But [Elemental] and [Added Effect] are completely different depending on whether they're put into weapons or armor. You've got to think about what weapon or armor to use, or what Materia combinations will be the strongest. I remember hearing once... about extraordinary Materia somewhere in the world. I think I've told you just about everything I can."
"Cloud: I'll explain your party's order in battle. First, access the menu and select [Order]. Next, select who you want to switch. Now, select the position you want. This will change their position in battle. In this case there isn't any advantage/disadvantage. But when you select the same person twice, it will place them in either the front/back row in a battle. When they're on the left side of the screen, that'll be the front row... When they're on the right, that'll be the back row. When you're in the front row and you select [Attack] you inflict major damage on your enemy. But you will also receive greater damage. While in the back row, although you do less damage to the enemy, you also receive less damage. For magic attacks, there's no difference in damage between the front & back rows. There is also no difference when you use long range weapons. It's better to keep weaker members... in the back row. And that's it. Of course, I'm better off in the front row!"
"Cloud: You must know your current status. That's one of the basics of battle. Access the menu and select [Status]. Next, select the member you want to check. Were you surprised at the amount of information? I'll explain the order. First, these are your experience points and your level. The more experience you get in battle, the stronger you become. This gauge tells you how many points you need to get to the next level. If you can't beat stronger enemies, raise your level by fighting weaker ones. You'll improve your physical and magical skills. Next is HP and MP. HP is your life force. When it reaches zero, you won't be able to fight. MP is the source of your magic power. Every time you cast magic, you use MP. and when you run out of MP, you won't be able to cast spells. This is called the Limit gauge. It shows your anger level. When the gauge is full, you can use a ""Limit Technique"". I'll tell you about ""Limit Techniques"" later. You know the battle commands are classified roughly into two groups. [Attack] is for regular physical attacks. [Magic] and [Summon] cast magic attacks. Each has attacking power, defense power, and escape probabilities. The value depends on your equipment, and experience level. The total effect is on the chart below. These are commands you can use in battle. And your presently equipped weapons, armor, and accessories. Press the OK button here one more time. There are all types of attacks... Some monsters are weak against fire, others are weak against ice or lightning. The Materia or items you have can add these [Elemental]s to your attacks or protect yourself from them in an enemy attack. This chart shows your current attributes. Press the OK button here one more time. The chart below means [Added Effect]s. Some enemies will use sneaky attacks on you. These attacks change your condition, such as... sleep, confuse, poison, darkness, petrify, silence, small, frog, and so on. These conditions disappear after each battle, except fury and sadness which will remain. To cure these conditions quickly, use items or magic. There are specific medicines for each condition. I know I'm repeating myself but,... when you're taken out in battle, I mean, when you're almost dead, use [Life] magic or the item [Phoenix down]. When you change Materia or equipment it's best to look here to check on them. Mastering Elementals and Added Effects... will make your battles safer. That's all."
"Cloud: Here are a few hints on limit techniques. When an enemy has pushed your anger to the limits, you can unleash unimaginable power. You know what I mean, right? The trick is how to use it. Access the menu and select [Limit]. Now select a member. Now decide what your limit will be. Lower limits have less power, but you can use them more often. If you set your limit higher, you can inflict great damage, but you'll have to wait longer. After using this technique for awhile, you'll improve your technique. Your development will change depending on how you fight. I can't tell you how it will change. That's something you'll have to find out by yourself. I've heard a rumor about secret items that inspire ultimate techniques. I don't know whether or not those items really exist. That's it! Try everything out and use what's best for you!"
"Cloud: You probably know all this. But just in case, I'll go over it. Until you get instructions, don't open or take discs out of the PlayStation. After you open up the Disc Cover I can't guarantee what'll happen. That's all."
"NPC: Hey!! You got one right off! That was Materia. Next, take this [treasure chest]!"
"NPC: Now listen, Hidden in these treasure chests, are a lot of items There are box types and bag types, so make sure you don't overlook any."
"NPC: This is the fabled [Save Point]!! At a [Save Point] you can use a [tent] and/or select ""SAVE"". There's more, too. Look for something called secret. Even if you are wiped out, if you save you can restart from that same point. That way you don't have to worry when you've been wiped out. This is jumping ahead a little but, when you leave Midgar... Once you get the world map, you can save anywhere you like. Remember that. That should be all you need to know about the Save Point. I'll probably see you again somewhere on the road. Take care! I'm a [treasure chest]!! Beginners make sure and keep an eye out for me!!"
NPCs: ......smack......knock......!! Help!
Cloud: You've got to hang in there. You're limit gauge is just starting to build.
NPCs: Waaaah!!
"Cloud: Ok! Now your limit gauge is full, go ahead and use it! Fight with your limit technique."
Cloud: Great!
NPCs: Magic!! Magic!! Help!
Cloud: Calm down! When your enemy uses magic counter with [Magic Barrier] or [reflect]. [Magic Barrier] reduces the damage received from magic by half. [reflect] bounces the attacks off you. But the number of times you can use it is limited so be careful.
Cloud: Great!
"Cloud: If you want to get as strong as me you need to use Materia. And you have to find the best combinations of them. The type of Materia you put in your weapons and armor will determine how quickly your Materia grows. Put Materia into the open slots in your weapons and armor. The possible combinations are limitless. That's about all I can tell you. If you want to be like me, you have to have some natural talent."
"Cloud: Listen kid, don't piss me off! That's all right. Just give it a try. Little by little, you'll get used to it."
NPC: Hey SOLDIER!! Tell us about battles! We'll even pay you!
Cloud: I'm not hard up enough to take money from guys like you. But I'll rap with you for a while.
Cloud: What do you want to know?
"Cloud: ATB or Active Time Battle is a system that is always in operation during battle. Select [Wait] from ATB on the Config Menu and time will stop when you select magic or items during battle. This gives you time to pick out your commands. This is especially helpful to beginners. Selecting [Recommended] ATB in the config menu can stop time while the effects of spells and items are taking place during battle. This lets you take your time looking over the progression of the battle. When you don't want to rush in battle, this is for you! Personally, I always use [Active], but you can use whichever you like."
Cloud: White numbers appearing on the screen in battle are damage points. Green numbers show restorative points. You better watch these if you don't want to get wiped out.
"Cloud: The [change] command can move characters to and from the front and back rows. In the back row, the damage received is less, but the attacking power is less. You can make a [change] by pressing the Directional button in battle. Pushing the Directional button the other direction during battle accesses [defend]. Selecting [defend] reduces the damage you receive by half until the next command. If you're up against a strong enemy, Don't hesitate to use this one. Of course, I never need it."
"Cloud: I don't really remember ever having to use the [escape] command... but you'll probably need it. Push the L1 and R1 buttons at the same time, holding them down, and you can escape."
"Cloud: During battle, there are several [gauges] displayed. You can't check them now, so just remember what I tell you. [time gauge] displays the time remaining until your next turn while in battle. When the gauge is full, you can make your command. If you don't want to make one, push the"
"Cloud: [status] means just that. The status of each character. I'll probably wind up repeating myself, but let me go over a few basic points. Sleep You cannot put in a command until you get up. Poison Steals your HP in battle. Fury Damage is increased, attack accuracy decreased. Tranquilizers will remedy it. Sadness Damage is decreased. Hyper will remedy it. Petrify Will petrify and become immobilized. Every member will be wiped out. Confuse Will attack enemy and ally alike. Silence Will be unable to cast magic. Paralyze Stops time gauges, commands. Darkness Accuracy of hitting attacks decreases. Frog Become a frog. I hate this one!"
"Cloud: Hoo...I'm beat. [status change], since this can be changed with magic and items, you should check it whenever you buy things."
"Cloud: [elemental] is the special effect that comes with certain weapons and magic. It's necessary to move ahead effectively. If you pay attention to the types of elementals you use you'll become intermediate in no time. I put together this list, but remember, it's just a partial list don't take it too literally. Fire Fire effect. Works best on animals and water monsters. Ice Ice effect. Works best on fire monsters and things that hate the cold. Lightning Lightning effect. Works best on mechanical things. Earth Attacks using the earth's power. Doesn't work on flying enemies. Poison Poisons enemies. Doesn't work on any poison based enemies. Gravity Gravity based attack. These hurt if they hit. Water Calls on the earth's water. Works well on fire monsters. Wind Calls up the winds. Works well on flying enemies. Holy Calls up the Planet's power. Works well on dark monsters."
"Cloud: If you use reciprocal elementals in your attacks, the effect is huge! Also, if you use the same elemental, your defenses are raised. But, you have to be careful because the opposite is also true. To see what elementals an enemy has, you need [Sense] Materia. If you get that Materia, you should try using it."
"Cloud: Looks like you didn't get it the last time I told you. What's wrong with you? You touched in the head? Well, don't worry. You just need to push the [SELECT] button in battle. Do that, and the [help message] will walk you through the commands. It also shows you the name of your enemy, so even I use it once in a while. Make good use of it."
"NPC: He used to give us nothing but headaches when he was here, but now that he's gone...I kind of miss him. ......strange, isn't it?"
"NPC: Ha! Ha!...... I wonder if my son's already left? When it's just my wife and I here, you have no idea how lonesome it gets."
"NPC: You want them to be happy and do what they want while they're young, but being a parent, you can't help but worry... I guess I'm not cut out to be a parent yet."
NPC: By the way...... Where are you from?
"NPC: Hm......you said Nibelheim? Wasn't it in the news a while back? Something to do with a Reactor accident... That was the first major Mako accident, so I remember it really being a hot topic."
"NPC: Ha, Ha!...... Well, there's nothin' wrong with that, I'd say. But if you still have a family, You outta at least write them. Even though you may turn your back on your hometown, It'll always be there for you. Least that's how I see it."
"NPC: Well, you mind leaving the two of us alone? I want to enjoy some quiet time together with my wife."
"Clerk: Ahh... Another slow day...... If this keeps up, this store's goin' under... Can't sell any really good medicine in a slum like this."
Clerk: Oh!! Look at this! This doesn't happen everyday. You a......customer? Yes!! Welcome!! We sell! We buy!
"Guard 1: You know, I got some tickets to ""Loveless"", do you want to go?"
"Guard 2: What're you, retarded? Midgar's under martial law now!"
"Guard 1: You mean, you really are concerned for me?"
"Guard 2: Hell no!! But in case you forgot, we're in the middle of a slum. They could be anywhere around, so stay on your guard."
Guard 1: Right. You mean the AVALANCHERS?
Guard 2: Don't you worry. SOLDIER has been added to the police force.
"Guard 1: Boy, it's been a while since SOLDIER's been mobilized, hasn't it? I ever tell you that I flunked the SOLDIER entrance exam? Damn right!! blahblahblah......."
Guard 2: Hey shut up for a minute and let me get back to work!
Guard 1: ............sigh.
Guard 1: What are you more scared of... AVALANCHE or me?
"Guard 2: Oh, you, of course."
Guard 2: HALT!! No one is allowed to pass!!
"NPCs: I've had it! Me too. You know this is the first time, we've ever agreed on something. Yes...... Well then, shall we......? Yes......"
NPCs: urggh............ huff......wheez
"Conductor: Morning. Dawn comes and things never change. You be careful not to get hurt. Come on back again, hear?"
Conductor: ALL ABOARD! The train is about to depart.
Johnny: I'm leaving. Goin' faraway. But when I come back I'll be a better man! This is goodbye! Hey! Childhood friend! You better take good care of Tifa!
NPC: I hope he doesn't get hurt. That worries me the most.
NPC: Ahh! Now I ain't got no one to pick on!
"NPC: Yesterday, everyone in town was peeking at the two of you from outside the bar. Tifa's childhood friend. That's a good one!"
"NPC: Ah...Johnny's gone. You look a little disappointed. I don't like to say it myself but, I'm just a lonely guy when I'm not drinking."
NPC: When it comes down to it...I'm gutless. I'm still just a no good kid.
"NPC: Listen! If there isn't anyone to listen, what's the use of getting gossip on everyone!? Yeah, and you Mr. I-don't-care! I'll get a little more information that would poque even your interest. You wait and see!"
"Clerk: Uh oh...... There goes the pillar. I'm scared, but it's for your own good. If things get too hairy, we'll escape. It's not something you'll see happen too often."
NPC: Uhh......Help! My strange and wonderful little place.
Guard 2: Doh! And this was supposed to be my last job! Do something!! I never thought this would ever happen to me! Great... I'm quitting tomorrow!
"Guard 1: L, look... This is my job, so I have to be here until the absolute last minute."
NPC: Umm... I just LOVE men with a sense of duty. Let me stay here with you.
"Guard 1: B, but... What happens if AVALANCHE shows up?"
NPC: Umm...you're shaking. You're so gentle...I think I'm in love.
Clerk: Hey! Don't come barging into my house and be opening up my freezer! Didn't your mother ever teach you that?
On-screen: Turtles Paradise News No.1
"NPC: Um, we're, um taking care of the um, flowers for the um, lady here. ......is that ok?"
Cloud: Take good care of them.
NPC 1: Yeah!
NPC 2: Sure!
Cloud: That's too much to ask of kids.
NPC: Too much to ask? What's that? I don't get it.
NPC: They're purty!
NPC: I'm gonna water them later......
NPC: Aaaaah......what a drag. You wanna go to that store in Sector 6 again?
NPC: Huh? The hell are you? The hell do ya think you're talkin' to!!
"NPC: That guy in the pipe's a weird one. No matter what you ask him, he only answers 'uuh' or 'aahh'."
Aeris: This guy are sick. He passed out nearby and someone must have helped him here.
NPC: What am I doing? I'm walking around looking at the ground. You find a lot of things people dropped when you look down. You never find them when you're looking up. Right?
NPC: You ever hear of Wall Market?
NPC: Oh yeah? Then maybe I should have you pick something up for me next time you're there...
"NPC: It's a market in the slums of Sector 6. They've got everything you could ever want there. If you can get there, that is. The road's something else."
NPC: Outta the way! Move! You want something... move into the store!
NPC: ooh......aaah.........aghhhh......
Aeris: This is the one...... Won't you help him?
NPC: ooh......aaah.........aghhhh......
"Cloud: Listen, I'm no doctor."
Aeris: No...I guess not...
Aeris: Hey...that man has a tattoo. I think it was the number 2.
Clerk: ...stare... ......hmph...we only trade items for gil here.
Clerk: I don't care if it's scrap metal or materia. We can get anything here in the slums. Got a lot of good materia here. Why don't you look it over?
"Clerk: Take care of yourself. It's the law of the slums. But to do that, first you need weapons, right?"
NPC: Huh? You want weapons? That's too damn bad...... I ain't got no weapons to sell ya! And the reason why is... ...the weapon store's over that way.
"NPC: Toot toot! Next stop...Midgar Midgar. Any passengers getting off on Midgar should please ring. You know, Midgar's supposed to be sparkly 'n' springy 'n' sleeky. Oh yeah. Someday, I'm goin' there."
"TV: And now for the news. Due to a terrorist attack by the group named AVALANCHE, parts of Midgar that were temporarily out of power will be restored momentarily. Following President Shinra's lead, Mayor Domino also spoke out public against AVALANCHE."
TV: Now for the weather. Tomorrow's weather will be overcast and gloomy the entire day. With a slight chance of sprinkles over parts of the city.
"NPC: Hmph......! Everything President Shinra says is a lie. But then again, you can't trust that AVALANCHE, or whatever you call them. You can bat it around all you like. But in the end it comes down to wanting to be like those who live up above. So who do you believe in? Oneself! Me! I never lie to myself, that's for sure!"
NPC: I only believe what I say. That's because I never lie to myself.
NPC: glug...glug... Now...no one... will find it...num... The top one... and the bottom one...
(Upon inspecting the drawers in the house on the second floor if the player did not talk to the boy.)Cloud: ............
Cloud: ............. .......huh?
Cloud: Empty.......
Cloud: .......? 5 gil.
"On-screen: Received ""5 gil""!"
"NPC: Even with all that commotion, you went on like nothing happened. You must really been through the mill to get that."
NPC: Never thought that would come tumbling down. Maybe I better walk around looking up from now on.
NPC: ...sniff...sniff... First there was a rumbling...... ...then cracking... and then ker-blaMM!!... ...I was so scared...sniff...
Clerk: ...stare... ......hmph...we only trade items for gil here. No matter what.
"NPC: Living in a place like this, you could live out several lives, and it still wouldn't be enough! Well, how about some materia? Make some money and then scramble out of here!"
"Clerk: You never know what's going to happen! It's a crazy world, so you'd better at least have a weapon you can depend on! Am I right or what?"
NPC: ...sure is loud outside. Wonder what's happening?
NPC: The hell's up with that!? I don't care if they're AVALANCHE or Avant-garde or whatever you call them. Anyone who brings the plates down on us is nuts!!
"TV: This just in. An accident today... ...the worst in the history of the metropolis. But thanks to the quick response by those in charge, there were no civilian casualties. The cause of the accident is unclear at this time, however, according to some sources it is believed to have something to do with the terrorist activities of the group, AVALANCHE."
"TV: Citizens, unite! Come to the light, Mako energy. Power is Truth Shinra is the future. Your real happiness can be found in obeying the company!"
"TV: What your car is missing is... ...a set of PTZ2000 tires!! That's right PTZ2000, good for your car and they look good too. Shinra, Inc...... Providing piece of mind in your hectic life in everything from can openers to Mako energy."
NPC: sniff.........sniff......... ......'n' I hid it......so nuthin' like this...... would ever happen.........sniff......
"NPC: He heh! I bought an item with the money I'd been saving up for some time now. My dream is to grow up and become a big time dealer on Wall Market. Since I'm feeling so good today, I'll let you have this!"
NPC: My dream is to grow up and become a big time dealer on wall market.
NPC: That's funny...did I drop the key to this gate...somewhere? Was it when I was on that excavation tour?
NPC: Hey! Where's the flower lady?
NPC: These folks went wobbling off somewhere... They said something about the 'Reunion starting'... sounded almost like a chant. Wonder what the heck that meant.
NPC: I'm not going to look up or down! From now on I'm just going to look straight ahead. Maybe not. I'm just flapping my gums. I really wonder how things will turn out.
Clerk: ...stare... ......hmph...we only trade items for gil here. No matter what.
"Clerk: And I just got together enough money to get out of this place... Now it doesn't matter where I go! Ho, ho, ho..."
Clerk: I don't know crap about crap! But I do know one thing. The one thing that you'll always need is a good strong weapon!
NPC: The planet's getting closer. You can hear it rumbling. We don't do something about it and pretty soon it'll be...ker-blam!
"TV: ......ga...... g, ga ga.................."
"NPC: SOLDIER? What about them!? Damn! If they were really from SOLDIER, they would be doing something about all this!!"
"NPC: The trick to bein' a real man, is not to fart around, but to let everyone know where you stand, right off!"
"NPC: Hey, you two. Why don't you get some rest? We have a beautiful room, how 'bout it?"
"NPC: Hey, ya'll. Please stay here!"
NPC: Don't push! Hooligan!
NPC: Please keep out of kitchen!
On-screen: ......Beeeeeep...... blipppp......
Cloud: Whoa!
Cloud: ...Broken.
"NPC 1: All right...1, 2, 3. Squats are all in the rhythm."
"NPC 2: I'm doing my best, bro'!"
NPC 1: How's... this!?
"NPC: Yes? If you want to order, do it at the counter."
"NPC: Aren't cats great? This one's a little big, huh?"
NPC: Oh... what should I do... Should I just buy it......?
NPC: Please come in. Here's a free 'Pharmacy Coupon' if you enter now.
"NPC: Please, stop by."
"NPC: I just can't make up my mind... Mmm. Huh? About what? Hmmm, don't make me say it... It's the shop down on the right."
"NPC: Hey boy! You shore got a good lookin' heifer there! Take her to the Don's place, and you'll make a mint."
NPC: It's a little early to start eating. Come back in a bit.
NPC: Join the club. Try it with us.
NPC: You want somethin'? I don't wanna hear any complaints 'bout how things look.
Clerk: Welcome. Please take your time.
NPC: ...We're closed now.
"Owner: Whew, times are bad."
NPC: Oh dear. I've gained weight again.
Johnny: Man... Should I go......or not? ...I get so mental at times like this. I'm hopeless!!
Johnny: Hey!! Aren't you...? What!! You mean you're...too?
"Johnny: You're Tifa's childhood friend, and you brought a new girlfriend to a place like this!? What kind of guy are you!!"
Johnny: What...Me too. I decided this after a lot of deep thought. My last memories of Midgar...you know. But... That guy over there kinda scares me.
NPC: What the hell!! You *%^&!! This ain't no #$*&^% show!! I'm busy right now!! I'm feelin' like there's gonna be a fight!!
"NPC: Urrrrgh...no way...... I can't go on. Things aren't working out. Between our differences and my pay, it just isn't cutting it."
Johnny: Aeris...... Thanks for the flower and 1 gil. I'll treasure this! I'm going to dry it and keep it for good luck.
"NPC: I asked Aeris for a date... And she said not even if I paid her 1,000,000 gil. Her flowers cost 300 gil, too... She's a good business woman."
"NPC: Uurrgh! So, this is it for today, huh?"
NPC: It's closing time. yawn......I'm so sleepy......
"Bouncer: Sir, is everything all right? Look, Aeris looks so lonely."
NPC: What? Are you ladies going to eat too?
NPC: Hey! Pretty lady. Let me tell you about a good job! Go to the Don's place. You'll make a small fortune!
NPC: You're... Weird.
NPC: Sorry! But we're completely full! Please come again!
"Johnny: Uh...ummm I, I...... Uh...ummm... I'm...Jo......Johnny... Nice to meet you."
"NPC: That's funny. A hard, spiky hairstyle! Looks kinda familiar..."
"NPC: Ummm, young girls...soft skin. Ummm, OK, I'm refreshed now! ...Mmmm? Pretty hard. You work out?"
"Bouncer: Yeah, I only talk to the pretty ones. Mmmm, you're the one. You're just great."
NPC: It came down from the sky. But the old guy who likes tanks took all of it away. I wanted some too.
"NPC: According to that guy with the tank, if you're strong enough, anyone can make it to the top plate. So, build your strength by having a plate of our food."
NPC: I never believed that Sector 7 would ever come down.
"NPC: Phew, it's all dusty ever since the sky came down. I'll have to start over."
NPC: That was scary...
"Clerk: You're dressed normal today. If something else interesting comes up, let me in on it."
NPC: More strength. I bet you could climb all the way up to the upper plate if you used that pipe. Don't you know? The old man at the Weapon shop can tell you more about it.
NPC: So? How's it?
"NPC: Hey!! It's you!! Sorry, but I already heard about you. In addition to dressing like a woman, it seems you like to smash and grind things. We only let cultured customers in! Got it? Then you'd better leave!"
"Kotch: Hey! You're...not them... you're... Please, help me!"
"Kotch: Thanks! You know what? After you left, some Shinra guys forced themselves in here saying things like 'information leaked' and 'good for nothing'. They took Don somewhere and that's it...... I'm still here."
Kotch: Oops! They're here again... I'm outta here! SEE ya
Kotch: I...I was just following the Don's orders! Help me!
NPC: I wish I could live with a real cat.
"NPC: It's a weird world we live in, so eat up and work hard."
NPC: We're not leavin' this city no matter what happens.
"NPC: I don't know what's gonna happen next, But first, you gotta fill your stomach."
NPC: Seems like everything has frills on it.
Cid: Hmm? Let me see that.
"Cid: It should work now. Go on, try and use it now."
Tifa: Cid! What did you do!?
"Cid: Don't get mad, you'll just get more wrinkles. Hey, something's comin' out."
"NPC: These days, you've got to have strength. Come on, you should work out."
"NPC: Oh, so you're back? I got something good for you. Why don't you buy it?"
"Cloud: You probably just found it lying around somewhere, right?"
"NPC: I'll admit that I found it, but you may never be able to get another one like it again. How 'bout 129,000 Gil for it?"
Cloud: ...What kind of price is that?
"NPC: Hey, much obliged. You'll never regret it!"
"On-screen: Received ""Sneak Glove""!"
"NPC: Hmm, looks like you're a little short, son. Come back again."
"NPC: Hmm, that's too bad. This's really something."
NPC: Come again.
"NPC: Heee,...... The Shinra have occupied this shop!"
"On-screen: Shinra, Inc. This week's phrase"
On-screen: Turtle's Paradise Newsletter No. 2
NPC 1: Honey...... Buy me that car!
"NPC 2: But baby, that's way too expensive."
NPC 1: What did you say?
NPC 1: .........
NPC 2: .........
"NPC 1: Hh, hey!"
"NPC 2: Ww, wait for meeeeeee.........!"
"Cashier: Welcome. Today we have on special... Eagghhh!! Here, t, take the money..."
"Barret: Don't want no money. AVALANCHE ain't no packa criminals. We jes want back what your boss stole from us.I mean, ""who"" he stole from us."
"Cashier: A, AVALANCHE?"
"Barret: Now we ain't gonna hurt you. Might even pay ya, if ya help us."
Cashier: Ok...ok...well...
Cashier: What is it?
Cashier: Thank you and come again... Forget I said that...
Cashier: Please take all purchases to the register
"Cashier: You opened up all those things without asking and, hey wait!"
NPC 1: I thought I heard a ruckus downstairs a minute ago. Do you know what that was all about?
NPC 2: No idea. But no need to worry because everything above the 60th floor is safe.
NPC: This is the lounge floor. Above us are the special floors for the big wigs in the company. It's tough working under someone. Tires you out.
NPC: What's keeping her? Did she forget her keycard? Even employees can't walk around above the 60th floor without a keycard.
"NPC: I don't remember seeing your face before... You new here? Say, you're cute. Let me teach you some...things."
"NPC: Wipe that stupid look off your face. I was only going to teach you how to get to the next floor. The higher ups in the company use the floors above the 60th floor. But you can't get there without a keycard. Get a keycard and you can use the elevators freely. ...voila! You hear that sound and the door opens. Just remember there are different types of cards. One keycard alone won't let you go everywhere. For example, 'Keycard 60' only takes you to the 60th floor. 'Keycard 65' only takes you to the 65th floor. It's a security system worthy of Shinra. After all, all the power in Midgar and the world, for that matter, is controlled by them. Oh, I have to go. Gotta get back to work!"
NPC: Oh? That's too bad...
"Computer: ...beep...beep... ......verifying key card...... ........................... Level B employee: verified. You are permitted to open doors on this floor up to three times. blip...... If you receive an item coupon, remember to exchange it for an item. ...warning...refrain from entering the air conditioning ducts recklessly - they are very dangerous..."

Computer: ....... ......... ....... Coupon exchange complete.
Computer: You cannot take on more materia. Please discard some materia. Your 'All' materia was returned for a C Coupon.
Computer: ...beep......beep...... You do not have any coupons.
Cloud: An air-duct... It doesn't look like I'll be able to climb in here.
Cloud: An air-duct......
Computer: ...beep...beep...... Open the door?
"Computer: Bi, bing...... You have opened three doors. If you access the computer, You can begin this process one more time."
Cloud: .......
Cloud: Whew...
Cloud: Feels like I got a little lighter...... At least I think so...
"NPC: ...huff...puff... If you're tired, you should get some rest in the next room."
NPC: ...huff...wheeze... I'm starting to worry about my belly......
On-screen: Take one to restore your energy!! 'Shinra Gym Special Drink' Only 250 gil!!
Cloud: ...Nothing...
Cloud: ...... ...Is it broken?'
"NPC: Sir, what are you doing!? No violence here, please!"
"NPC: Hmph, hmph... Since I'm head of security for this building, stamina's very important to me."
NPC: You must be a visitor. Please feel free to use any unused machines.
Cloud: A nap room...
NPC: ...zzz... Please......let me...... get some...rest......
On-screen: Out of Order
Cloud: There's nothing inside...
Cloud: What is this......a Megaphone? Hanging on to this won't do any good...
"NPC: Whew, I'm so sick of carrying all these files... But I get to meet lots of guys. I guess that's the benefit of being a secretary!"
NPC: ........................ ........................ ........................ ........................ ........................ ........................ Phew!
"NPC: It gives me the feeling that I AM alive. The feeling of moving this world, just with my hands."
NPC: Is it just me or does the Conference Room smell? There's some sort of stench coming from somewhere...
"NPC: Hey, when you're in the bathroom, do you ever hear whispers coming from somewhere?"
NPC: They're having another executive meeting. I wonder if it's about that Plate incident.
"NPC: Sittin' here facing the monitor...day in, day out... I kinda feel......forced...into doing it. And I just don't have any motivation."
"NPC: Come on, we're building the future of Mako!"
"NPC: It gives me the feeling that I AM alive. The feeling of moving this world, just with my hands."
NPC: Welcome... to the fully automated store. Place your order...now.
Computer: ......ga...... ......gaga......ga......
Cloud: ...... ...Is it broken?'
"On-screen: Received ""Mind Source""! Received ""Speed Source""!"
"NPC: Aw, c'mon! Listen to me! Got anything interesting to say?......"
"NPC: Listen to me! Just now, some guy in a black cloak goes walked east towards that grassy field. And he's got this killer sword, and is looking REAL scary......"
"NPC: Tourists, huh? There are some things you should know that'll come in handy when you travel around the world...... Want me to tell you what they are?"
"NPC: Then let me explain how to use the world map. Well then, what do you want to know?"
"NPC: Well then, bon voyage!"
"NPC: Is that so? Well, that's that. Have a nice trip."
NPC: I hear that the natural resources near the reactors are being sucked dry. We're better off with them bringing in the Mako energy.
"NPC: I heard President Shinra was killed. And his son Rufus, the new president, was badly hurt. Hey, I bet that's news to you?"
"NPC: Heh, heh, heh...... This is just between us. I heard it was that there Ava-whaddya call-ums that attacked the President Shinra and his son."
"NPC: Don't care? If you're going to travel, you'd best keep an eye on what Shinra's doing."
"NPC: Shinra is leading the world around by the nose, and you guys are just gonna sit back and take it?"
"NPC: My old man was a miner, but he couldn't go to work after monsters started appearing in the Mythril Mine. Now all he does is sit around getting drunk in the bar..."
NPC: Mr......Cloud? Your party is waiting for you on the 2nd floor.
NPC: 20 gil a night. What's it gonna be?
NPC: Seems like you're a little short. Why don't you drop by again... when you have money.
"NPC: Thanks to Mako energy, life's pretty darn convenient. Thanks to Shinra. Don't you think?"
NPC: See!? How would we get by without Mako energy?
NPC: Hmmn. But I'd hate to think of what life'd be like without Mako energy.
"NPC: Yeah, Mako energy's made our lives much easier. And it's all thanks to Shinra, Inc."
NPC: Mako energy's made things a lot more convenient...... But seems like a lot of plants and animals have been disappearing at a rapid pace.
NPC: I think the old life was better. Don't you think so?
"NPC: Yeah, sure I'm right! You think so, don't you?"
NPC: I thought things were better when I was able to play with animals......
"NPC: Did you say you came from Midgar? I used to live there, too. But I hear they got lots of troubles lately."
NPC: There was a suspicious-looking man in a black cloak! He was carrying a wicked-looking sword. Why doesn't anyone believe me? I'm all alone...
NPC: Why doesn't anyone believe me? I'm all alone...
NPC: ......My older brother's so stupid. He's so embarrassing I could just puke!
"NPC: When I grow up I'm gonna be in SOLDIER. That's why I'm training hard now!! Hyah, hayah, eagghh!"
NPC: Is it true that Shinra made a Monster?
"NPC: Yeah, well either way, as long as we're using the reactor, we can't stand up to Shinra."
"NPC: I heard terrorists bombed a Midgar reactor... There sure have been a lot of dangerous accidents recently. I hate it, just hate it."
"NPC: Me? I used to work in a coal mine down south called Mythril Mine. But, right around then, monsters started appearing. After that, business went to pot and now I spend the days here drinking."
NPC: Urrrp! ...hic... I'm stinking drunk!!
"NPC: It seems there was this group called AVALANCHE runnin' around, but I guess they finally got wiped out by SOLDIER. Shinra is trying to eliminate anyone, who stands up to them. It don't matter if we like it or not. Shinra's taken over, and we gotta live with it!"
NPC: Stay out of the kitchen.
"NPC: Huh? You're looking for your friend? You want to know where the Lifestream is? Let's see, I can't help you with your friend, but I've heard about the Lifestream. When I traveled to the southern islands, a doctor was very kind to me. I seem to recall him telling me something about the Lifestream......"
"NPC: Hey, listen to me! The Shinra troops are on the move. The TV news said Rufus came up with 2 plans. One, is to launch a rocket into space containing Huge Materia...... Is Huge Materia really that destructive?"
NPC: Listen to me! Something really big's happening in Midgar. They were just saying on TV it was Rufus second strategy and... That big cannon's pointed due north...... You think the target's......Sephiroth?
"NPC: Hey, listen to me! I heard the barrier protecting Sephiroth is gone! But with Rufus dead, the Shinra troops don't know what to do Heidegger and Scarlet don't have what it takes to lead the troops...... I really thought something was finally going to get done, but everything's the same... not a damn thing's changed!"
"NPC: Ah, youth... You really believe that big meteor filling up the sky's going to fall here?"
"NPC: If that's the case then all we can do is put our hope in Shinra, Inc."
"NPC: If Shinra, Inc was our last hope, and they've been beaten by terrorists...... Are we all going to die?"
NPC: I want you to stop that talk about a Meteor falling on us!
NPC: Sephiroth put up a huge barrier around the North Crater. Rufus wants to use a mammoth cannon to smash the barrier. He plans to have Shinra troops rush in and attack Sephiroth after the barrier falls.
NPC: The North Crater barrier's been demolished? So now's the time to defeat Sephiroth.
"NPC: Even if Meteor falls, If you're in Midgar, you ought to be safe. They say it's a ""Mako Metropolis"" so they should survive somehow......"
"NPC: My dad still just sits at the bar drinking, even though he knows that Meteor's coming! It's sad. Even though he's an adult, he just doesn't want to see the world as it really is. I dunno what to do."
"NPC: One night, 300 gil. Wanna check in?"
NPC: Seems like you're a little short. Why don't you drop by again... when you have money.
On-screen: Can't reach it......
Cloud: ......Damn it!!
Tifa: Oh! You!!
Cid: ......don't mess with me!!
"On-screen: ...... Dropped ""Megalixir""!"
"NPC: They say the meteor is going to fall, but it's okay! I'm sure Shinra will come through for us in the end and do something!"
"NPC: Dear, can you believe it!? They say that Shinra's gone under!! This world is coming to an end all because those terrorists called AVALANCHE stuck their noses in the wrong place!"
NPC: I can't believe Meteor's really falling this way...... What's going to happen to us?
"NPC: Everyone at Shinra's in an uproar because they heard Weapon's coming. I heard a big hydroplane carrying secret weapons, got attacked by Weapon and was sunk at sea......"
"NPC: If something ever happened to President Rufus, That'd be the end of Shinra, Inc...... and the rest of the world, too."
"NPC: Oh man, oh man! A meteor's gonna fall on us, and now there's some big huge monster the likes of which I've never seen just wandering around out there!"
NPC: What's going to happen to all of us!!?
NPC: I'm gonna hurry up and get strong so I can crush the meteor to bits! But I gotta train real hard to do it.
NPC: The world's changed a lot in the past few days...... That huge monster Meteor was covering up the sky and acting like he owned it or something... A lot of my friends have died...... I'm goin' on a journey to pray for their souls.
"NPC: A map that was sunk along with the ship. .........""Guidebook"""
"NPC: A rose that blooms once every 1000 years in the desert. .........""Desert Rose"""
"NPC: A harp that soothes those who hear it. .........""Earth Harp"""
NPC: I wonder if there's anyone who'll bring it to me?
"NPC: ""XXXX"" and ""XXXX""... Will you guys look for them for me?"
"NPC: Now if I can just get ""XXXX"", I can start my journey..."
"Kalm Traveler: OH! It's ""Guidebook""! Wanna trade it for this Underwater Materia? How about it?"
"Kalm Traveler: Ok then, it's a done deal!"
"Kalm Traveler: It's Underwater Materia. Go on, it's yours!"
Kalm Traveler: I dunno......
"Kalm Traveler: OH! It's ""Desert Rose""! Wanna trade it for that Chocobo over there? How about it?"
"Kalm Traveler: Ok then, it's a done deal!"
"Kalm Traveler: It's a Chocobo. Take it, it's yours!"
Cloud: Looks like my Stable's full. I'll come back when I have room.
Kalm Traveler: I dunno......
Kalm Traveler: OH! It's the Earth Harp! Wanna trade it for some Master Materia? I'm not bein' stingy either! I'll give you all three of 'em! How about it?
"Kalm Traveler: Ok then, it's a done deal!"
Kalm Traveler: It's a 3-piece Master Materia set... and it's all yours!
Kalm Traveler: I dunno......
Kalm Traveler: I guess it's time to go on a journey for the souls of my departed friends......
NPC: I heard Shinra's taking all its biggest artillery from Junon and its various other facilities and gathering it in Midgar to fight the meteor and Weapon.
NPC: They say the remaining members of AVALANCHE broke Shinra's resistance and destroyed the Mako cannon at Midgar.
NPC: What's going to happen to the world...?
"NPC: Listen, I've worked hard till now... and you say Meteor's gonna smash everything to bits? Well, I ain't standin' around listenin' to fool talk like this. Makes a person lose the will to work, that's what it does!"
"NPC: What're ya, dense? Something like that'll never happen! It's ridiculous!"
"NPC: And all of Midgar's gonna be destroyed by a falling meteor? Oh, don't make me laugh! Lately, there's been a number of scary incidents. I hate it. Just hate it!"
"NPC: I heard the remaining members of AVALANCHE smashed the Shinra troops at Midgar. Lately, there's been a number of scary incidents. I hate it. Just hate it!"
Choco Bill: Looking for an Inn?
Choco Bill: Looking for a place to stay?
Choco Bill: How about 100 gil a night...?
Choco Bill: Thank you for your patronage.
"Choco Bill: ....... Ummm, you don't have enough..."
"Choco Bill: Hmm, then, I guess that's that."
"Choco Bill: Hmm, then, I guess that's that."
Chocobo: Wark! Wark? Warkwark wark?
Chocobo: Wark-----
"On-screen: Received ""Choco/Mog"" Materia!"
Chocobo: Wark!! Wark!!
On-screen: They tried to give you something but you couldn't get it.
Chocobo: Wark!! Wark!!
Choco Bill: Welcome.
"Choco Bill: How 'bout a Chocobo Lure materia? Each level it increases, makes it easier for you to find a Chocobo."
"Choco Bill: Oh, what is that? What has this world come to? Stars falling and everything."
"Choco Bill: With things the way they are now, how 'bout raising a Chocobo? No, I'm not trying to persuade you for money. It's just because of the state of things in the world. I thought that it would be a good and healthy thing for you to raise some Chocobos..."
"Choco Bill: Hmm...You just happen to be in luck! It just so happens that we aren't taking care of any Chocobos for anyone else, so... I could take care of 6 Chocobos right now, for 10000 gil per Chocobo. How 'bout it?"
"Choco Bill: To raise a Chocobo, you'll need a 'Chocobo Stable'. And they rent for 10000 gil. Currently, I can rent out up to 6 'Chocobo Stables'. If you rent a 'Chocobo Stable', we will keep up to 4 of the Chocobos you catch in the fenced area outside. At a later date, you can select the Chocobo that you would like to put in your 'Chocobo Stable'."
Choco Bill: 'Chocobo Stables' cost 10000 gil...
Choco Bill: Thank you. My grandson takes care of the Chocobos. He's in the Chocobo Stable at the far right of the farm. Please tell him what you want.
"Choco Bill: ....... Ummm, you don't have enough..."
Choco Bill: We don't have enough room to rent out more than 6 here...
"Choco Bill: Someone once told me there is a 'Chocobo Sage'...somewhere. He seems to know how to raise some great Chocobos. If he really does exist, I'd like to meet him someday."
"Choco Bill: Chocobos aren't hard to take care of. The day to day care will all be done here. But, please buy the food for the Chocobo, and feed them yourselves. Chocobo's abilities will differ with what you feed it, so feel free to choose your own food. Also, if you're able to find a male and a female Chocobo that like each other, they'll produce an egg. But only if you feed them a 'Nut'. New Chocobos inherit the abilities of their parents. I've heard that sometimes new breeds of Chocobo are born with special abilities. I've never actually seen it before, though."
"Chole: Welcome! Hey, I've got something good to tell you. The white Chocobo likes it when you scratch behind its ears. But if you scratch it someplace that it doesn't like, it'll get mad, so be careful."
"Chole: Hey, do you know what a Chocobo Sage is?"
Chole: What!? You've actually met him!? Wow! What did he tell you?
"Chole: Wow, that's amazing! ...let me take some notes."
"Chole: Hey, did you ever see the Chocobo Sage again? What did he tell you?"
"Chole: Wow, that's amazing! ...let me take some notes."
Chole: What...?
"Chole: Other than regular Chocobo, there are ""Mountain Chocobo"" and ""River-Chocobo""."
"Chole: In order for the ""Mountain Chocobo"" and ""River Chocobo"" to be born, You feed the ""Carob Nut"" to a ""Great Chocobo"" or a ""Good Chocobo"" and have it produce an egg. But we don't sell any ""Carob Nuts""."
"Chole: A ""Great Chocobo"" and a ""Good Chocobo"" are found... On an island Southeast of the Chocobo Sage's dwelling at Corel. And in the area west of Corel. The ""Carob Nut"" can be found south of the Chocobo Sage's dwelling. Monsters carry them. Let's see, is Bone Village just south of there?"
"Chole: One surprise If you get the ""Mountain Chocobo"" and the ""River Chocobo"" to produce an egg, You'll get a Chocobo that can cross mountains and rivers. I bet that the right nut for that is the ""Carob Nut."""
"Chole: Bigger surprise: There seems to be a Chocobo that can cross the ocean. If you could cross the ocean, mountains, and rivers, there'd be no place you couldn't go."
Chole: In order to get an Ocean Chocobo you need to get a Mountain-and-river Chocobo to mate with something else.
"Chole: If you mate the Mountain-and-river Chocobo with a ""Wonderful Chocobo"", You'll get an Ocean Chocobo. But to do that you can't use an ordinary Nut."
"Chole: The ""Nut"" that produces Ocean Chocobos is the ""Zeio Nut"". This is the first I've ever heard of it. I wonder where you get them?"
"Chole: Zeio Nuts are found on a little island east of the Chocobo Sage. ""Goblins"" have them. With this, you can produce an ""Ocean Chocobo"". According to my research, Mountain, river, and ocean Chocobos are hard to produce. But, if you take the right care of the Chocobo, and increase their Class ranking by winning at the races, it'll increase your chances of getting one."
Chole: There are no Chocobo.
"Chole: For telling me that story, I'll tell you about each Chocobo's abilities."
"Chole: From what I see, the fastest sprinter is... I think it's XXXX."
"Chole: And, the fastest one is... That's XXXX"
"Chole: Also, from what I can tell, the one with the most stamina is... I think it's XXXX."
"Chole: Finally, the most intelligent one is... That's XXXX"
Choco Billy: Welcome!
"Choco Billy: What the Chocobo eats are 'Greens' The most famous one is the 'Gizzard Greens.' Chocobos will mature differently depending on which 'Greens' they eat. Certain 'Greens' will boost their stamina. You'll have to figure out what kinds have what effects for yourselves. Oh, and Chocobos are born with certain natural abilities. So no matter how much they mature, they can't get more abilities than what they're born with. Remember that if a Chocobo's abilities don't increase even though you feed it, that means its limit is reached. It's best to let those kinds of Chocobo go or mate them to get a new Chocobo."
Choco Billy: A male and a female Chocobo together can produce an egg.
"Choco Billy: The Chocobo out there is part of the stock that you caught. We can only keep 4 Chocobos here at once. If you get a fifth one, the first one will have to be let go. If you don't want that to happen, come back and put it in your own stable."
"Choco Billy: Yeah, you can ride this one. And even if you take it outside, this Chocobo won't run away when you get off of it. If you want to return it to your 'Chocobo Stable' just ride it onto the farm. Then, you'll be able to feed it again."
Choco Billy: Chocobos 'strengths are divided by 'Class'.
"Choco Billy: You don't even have any 'Chocobo Stable' If you want to raise Chocobos, go talk to Grandpa."
"Choco Billy: You have all the 'Chocobo Stables' you can carry. If you want to put a Chocobo in it, first, you must let it go and open a 'Chocobo Stable.'"
Choco Billy: It looks like you haven't even caught one yet...
Choco Billy: Which one are you going to put in the 'Chocobo Stable'?
On-screen: Use the Directional button left or right and
Choco Billy: This...is a wonderful Chocobo!
Choco Billy: This is a great Chocobo.
"Choco Billy: Mmm, this seems like a good Chocobo."
Choco Billy: This Chocobo's so-so.
Choco Billy: This is a pretty average Chocobo.
"Choco Billy: Mmm, this one's not bad."
Choco Billy: This one doesn't seem to be very good.
Choco Billy: I really can't recommend this one.
Choco Billy: Want to put this Chocobo in your stable?
"Choco Billy: Then, give Chocobo XXXX a name."
Choco Billy: I'm really going to let him go.
"Choco Billy: You don't even have any 'Chocobo Stable' If you want to raise Chocobos, go talk to Grandpa."
Choco Billy: Your 'Chocobo Stable' are empty.
Choco Billy: You don't have any 'Greens'... It just so happens I can sell you one...
Choco Billy: Which Chocobo are you going to feed it to?
Choco Billy: How many?
Choco Billy: Is this all right?
On-screen: Speed Plus!
On-screen: Stamina Plus!
On-screen: Intelligence Plus!
On-screen: They're getting along better!
On-screen: Their personalities improved!
On-screen: No improvement...
Choco Billy: I can't give you anything that I don't have.
"Choco Billy: You don't even have any 'Chocobo Stable' If you want to raise Chocobos, go talk to Grandpa."
Choco Billy: Your 'Chocobo Stable' are empty.
Choco Billy: You better have a 'Chocobo Stable' prepared for the little ones too.
"Choco Billy: Looks like you don't have any 'Nuts'... To get them to produce an egg,you need a 'Nut' Do you want me to sell you one?"
Choco Billy: There's only one...
Choco Billy: They gotta be male and female.
Choco Billy: You shouldn't mate those that just mated or those that were just born. There doesn't seem to be any others you could mate it with.
Choco Billy: Which two Chocobos are you going to mate? Talk to the two you like and make your decision.
Choco Billy: You shouldn't mate those that just mated or those that were just born.
On-screen: XXX XXXX Class X
Choco Billy: They gotta be male and female.
Choco Billy: So let's mate these two.
Choco Billy: Which nut are you going to give 'em?
Choco Billy: Is this one all right?
Choco Billy: You got yourself a new Chocobo!
"Choco Billy: Then, give Chocobo XXXX a name."
Choco Billy: I can't give you anything that I don't have.
"Choco Billy: You don't even have any 'Chocobo Stable' If you want to raise Chocobos, go talk to Grandpa."
Choco Billy: Your 'Chocobo Stable' are empty.
Choco Billy: Which Chocobo are you going to let go?
Choco Billy: Is it all right to let this one go?
"Choco Billy: You don't even have any 'Chocobo Stable' If you want to raise Chocobos, go talk to Grandpa."
Choco Billy: Your 'Chocobo Stable' are empty.
"Choco Billy: You can't take that many out a once. You must return the Chocobo that's out, If you want to take out with a different one."
Choco Billy: Which one are you going to take?
Choco Billy: Ride this one?
Barret: Wassup with that broad?
Aeris: Who is that girl...?
"Tifa: Cloud, do you know her?"
"Red XIII(before ""In the Land of the Study of Planet Life""): ...You don't see ones like that everyday..."
"Red XIII(after ""In the Land of the Study of Planet Life""): Who is that girl? She's still a child."
Cait Sith: Who do you think it is? I didn't recognize the face.
Vincent: She has a mysterious weapon... I've seen her somewhere before...
Cid: Who is that kid!
"Yuffie: Haa----ah! Gotcha! And you deserve it, too!"
Yuffie: Man...... I can't believe I lost...
"Yuffie: You spikey-headed jerk! One more time, let's go one more time!"
"Yuffie: Hey, boobs! Try that again! Just one more time!"
"Yuffie: Hey, you bow-legged ol' man! Give me another chance! I'll fight ya again!"
Yuffie: I won't lose this time! Take your time and get ready. Holler when you're ready!
"Yuffie: No way I'm going to fight with punks like you more than once! I'll keep enough for the doctor bill! Next time, you won't be as lucky!"
"Yuffie: Thinkin' of running away? Stay and fight! FIGHT, I said!"
"Yuffie: C'mon...... What's the matter? You're pretty scared of me, huh!?"
"Yuffie: Hmm, just as I thought. What do you expect with my skills? Good luck to you guys too. If you feel up to it, we can go another round. Later!"
Yuffie: I'm really gonna leave! REALLY!
Yuffie: Oh yeah? Then do whatever you want!
"Yuffie: What is it, you still have somethin' for me?"
Yuffie: ......Hmmm. So is that it? I know you want my help because I'm so good! You want me to go with you?
"Yuffie: What, you still want somethin'?"
Yuffie: ...Hmm. So is that it? You want my help 'cause I'm so good! You want me to go with you! Is that what you're saying?
"Yuffie: What is it, you still want somethin'?"
Yuffie: ...Hmm. So is that it? You want my help 'cause I'm so good! So you want me to come with you! Is that what you're saying?
"Yuffie: Heh heh... thought so. You put me in a spot. Hmm, what should I do?"
"Yuffie: But if you want me that bad, I can't refuse..."
"Yuffie: But if you want me that bad, I can't say no..."
"Yuffie: But if you want me that bad, I can't really say no..."
Yuffie: All right! I'll go with you!
Yuffie: Me? The name's......
Yuffie: What are you talking about!? You're the one who should go first!
"Yuffie: Okay forget it! I'm not going with you! Remember, if you piss me off... it'll cost you!!"
Yuffie': Huh? Hey...HEY!
Yuffie: Wait! I haven't even told you my name......
Yuffie: I'm Yuffie! Good to meetcha!
"Yuffie: Heh heh...... just as I planned. Now all I have to do is... a little this...... and a little that...... nyuk, nyuk, nyuk......"
"Yuffie: Hey, wait up! Wait for me!!"
"Yuffie: Here, I'll give you back the money I've stole from you! ......or, uh, what's left of it."
"Yuffie: Wh... what!? Uuuuugh! Now I'm really mad! Make fun of me, will ya! Just watch!!"
"Barret: Hey, we been had! And... my money!"
"Aeris: Hmm... Hey, don't we have less money than what we had?"
Tifa: She's gone... What is it with her?
Tifa: Hey! My money!
"Red XIII(before ""In the Land of the Study of Planet Life""): ...... There's some money missing."
"Red XIII(after ""In the Land of the Study of Planet Life""): Hey! My emergency money!"
"Cait Sith: Gil, gil, gil, where's my gil!?"
Vincent: ...... Difficult to understand her motivation.
Vincent: Hmm? ......pretty fast.
Cid: What the--!? Gone! It's gone! My money's gone!
On-screen: XXX Gil Stolen!
Barret: Shit!! Gimme back my money!!
Aeris: Geez!! You shouldn't do this!!
Tifa: Wait a second! Where's my money!?
"Red XIII(before ""In the Land of the Study of Planet Life""): Greed... A perfect example of human nature."
"Red XIII(after ""In the Land of the Study of Planet Life""): Give...give back what is rightfully mine!"
"Cait Sith: Hey, you can't--! My gil, give it back--!"
Vincent: The Gil doesn't seem to be her real objective...
"Cid: Steal MY money, will ya? You got a lot of #&^%$ nerve!! Just remember who you're dealin' with, punk!!"
Barret: Gone... Wassup with that?
Aeris: She's gone... So what was that all about?
Tifa: She's gone... What is it with her...?
Red XIII: Huh? She's gone...... What is she doing?
Cait Sith: ...She disappeared... I don't have a clue what was going on.
Vincent: ...... Difficult to understand her motivation.
"Cid: She's gone, hey...... What's with that kid!?"
"NPC: We've been fighting the Shinra for a long time at this battlefield. Even now, we're still settled in for a long war with them. If you aren't in a hurry, would you help us fight them?"
"NPC: Listen, we don't want to push you but, if you're in the middle of something, why don't you finish that first?"
"NPC: Let's see...... Head north along the coast, and keep going for a ways and you'll run into Junon. You gotta be careful 'cause it sits in the shadows of a small hill."
NPC: Really!? Then go on up and they'll fill you in on the details.
NPC: All right then...... Take care of yourselves...
NPC: Really!? Then go on up and they'll fill you in on the details.
"NPC: Do you guys want to see it, too?"
Cloud: See what?
Tifa: What?
Cid: What is it?
"NPC: The condors. They're huge. Come on, have a look."
"NPC: What do ya think? Awesome, huh?"
"Barret: Ey, let's get some rest."
Aeris: Let's rest. Okay?
"Tifa: Say, let's take a rest. Okay?"
"Red XIII(before ""In the Land of the Study of Planet Life""): We should get some rest while we can."
"Red XIII(after ""In the Land of the Study of Planet Life""): Let's take a rest when we can afford to."
"Yuffie: Come on... break time, break time!"
"Cait Sith: Now, shall we get some rest?"
Vincent: It's probably best to get some rest now.
Cid: Come on; let's get some shut-eye.
Cloud: ......
Tifa: Yeah...
Cid: Yo!
NPC: Hello. I'm sorry but we're not selling anything now. We're using everything we have for ourselves.
"NPC: Sorry, but I can't sell you anything now."
"NPC: Hmmn, now this is something, I never thought anyone would ever climb up here.......Your eyes are different.Well, anyhow. Any minute now, this will be a battlefield against Shinra. You'd better get down before you get involved."
Barret: Shinra? The hell those jackasses doing here?
"Aeris: What do you mean, ""a battlefield""?"
Tifa: You mean Shinra?
"Red XIII(before ""In the Land of the Study of Planet Life""): The Shinra......"
"Red XIII(after ""In the Land of the Study of Planet Life""): Shinra again."
Yuffie: The Shinra? Here too?
Cait Sith: ......
Vincent: What do you mean by that?
"Cid: A battlefield, we can't overlook that."
"NPC: It appears you have a problem with Shinra, too. After all, you climbed up here. Why not listen to what I have to say for a moment?"
Cloud: ......
Barret: The hell you talkin' about!? They're all fightin' the Shinra too! You gonna ignore that!?
"Aeris: After all, we came all this way, Cloud."
"Tifa: Cloud, let's listen to what they have to say."
Yuffie: Is this about the jewels?
"Cait Sith: I know, I know, Cloud. But let's listen for a bit."
Vincent: There's no harm in listening to them.
"Cid: Man, she sure's cold."
"Tifa: Oh, by all means."
"Cid: All right, talk on!"
NPC: Do you know what's at the top of this mountain?
Barret: Huh? Something's up there?
"Tifa: Come on, let's get it together."
"Yuffie: Look close, old man."
Aeris: A huge bird.
Red XIII: That's the reactor. And the condor.
"Cait Sith: Yeah, come to think of it there was something."
"Vincent: Come to think of it, there was a reactor. But I've never seen anything shaped like it......"
Cloud: The reactor and the condor.
Tifa: That's the reactor and the condor.
"NPC: I can see you're very perceptive. Yes, it's a reactor and a condor. It seems the Shinra doesn't like the idea of having a condor on top of the reactor."
"Barret: Damn, that's one big bird! But why are they trying to get rid of it with weapons?"
Aeris: Why?
Tifa: What's so wrong with having a condor on top of the reactor?
"Red XIII(before ""In the Land of the Study of Planet Life""): It's not very logical."
"Red XIII(after ""In the Land of the Study of Planet Life""): The logic eludes me."
Yuffie: I'm certain there must be state-of-the-art materia inside the reactor. Am I right?
Cait Sith: Huh?......
Vincent: ......That's too much.
Cid: Huh? I don't get it.
"NPC: It seems there's some type of special materia in the reactor above us. And because the condors came, the Shinra rushed troops here. The military wants to get the condor and all the villagers off this mountain. The condors are now warming their eggs, which hatch only once every few years. We would like to protect the condors from being harmed."
Cloud: New lives......
Barret: I'll do it! I'll protect them from Shinra!
"Aeris: We must protect the condor eggs, right?"
Tifa: Condors' eggs. A real work of nature. We've got to protect the life of the planet.
"Red XIII(before ""In the Land of the Study of Planet Life""): So, to protect the eggs, are you gonna protect the reactor?......"
"Red XIII(after ""In the Land of the Study of Planet Life""): We're going to protect the reactor in order to save the eggs."
"Yuffie: Special materia, huh? Well, well, things are getting interesting."
Cait Sith: I'm gonna leave it up to you all.
Vincent: ......and come out in one piece?
"Cid: You guys, what are ya gonna do?"
"NPC: Unfortunately, we don't have the ability to fight Shinra ourselves. That's why we have hired soldiers to help us. As our sponsor you can help us with a contribution or by fighting along side of us... What do you think? You want to join us in our fight?"
Cloud: ......
Barret: What's there to think about? We gotta do it!
"Aeris: Cloud, why are you still worrying about it?"
Tifa: Cloud......
"Red XIII(before ""In the Land of the Study of Planet Life""): You decide what we're going to do."
"Red XIII(after ""In the Land of the Study of Planet Life""): What are we going to do?"
"Yuffie: If things go right, we might even be able to pray to that special materia."
Cait Sith: I'll leave it up to you so please do as you see fit.
Vincent: It's difficult to get back what you've lost......
Cid: Don't be so wishy-washy. Hurry and make up your mind.
Cloud: ......
Barret: Hey! We'll come to the rescue.
"Aeris: Yes, yes. Let's do our best."
"Tifa: Cloud, thanks."
"Red XIII(before ""In the Land of the Study of Planet Life""): I got it. Let me lend a hand, too."
"Red XIII(after ""In the Land of the Study of Planet Life""): Got it. I'm gonna lend a hand, too."
"Yuffie: Okay, it's settled. We're gonna get the materia, right?"
"Cait Sith: Well then, let's do our best."
Vincent: That's the right decision.
"Cid: If you've made up your mind, let's just do it."
Barret: What are you thinking!? And you call yourself a human!?
Aeris: What a jerk. I'm disappointed in you.
Tifa: Well......
Yuffie: We may have lost the materia.
Vincent: Now don't regret what's already past.
"Cid: If you've made up your mind, let's just do it."
NPC: I see...... Come back if you should change your mind.
NPC: Have you by chance changed your mind?
"Tifa: Everyone, listen to what I have to say. I can't possibly leave these people like this. Let's do whatever we can to help them. All right?"
"Cid: If you go that far, what can I say. Well, we'll be able to do something if you leave it up to us."
Barret: Hey! We'll come to the rescue.
"Red XIII: Got it. I'm gonna lend a hand, too."
"Yuffie: Okay, it's settled. We're gonna get the materia, right?"
"Cait Sith: Well then, let's do our best."
Vincent: That's the right decision.
"NPC: Whew, we'll be saved. Ask my son, who's standing guard at the shed, about the details of our military tactics. We're depending on you. Yes, yes, I've also told the store owners about you, so they should sell you various items. And feel free to use our beds."
"NPC: Hello. Do your best. We will, too."
NPC: You hang in there!
"NPC: So, will you help us? I don't want them to get killed. They're gigantic birds and so striking. We simply can't let them be killed by man's selfishness?"
"NPC: Of course not. There's no way, especially at the hands of Shinra. If you're going to go look at them, get on top of that chair over there."
NPC: Thanks for accepting. Let me explain our strategy. The enemy will climb the mountain looking for the reactor. We will leave a trap for them and hire soldiers to protect the area.
"NPC: Well, that's all, but...... This village doesn't have any money. Even if we wanted to fight, our hands are tied 'cause we're broke. If we hired one soldier, we would need 400 gil. So, if we hire 20 soldiers, we must have 8000 gil. So if you folks have the time, we would like you to use your own money to hire these soldiers, buy the trap, set it up and command the troops. If you're pressed for time we'd like you to help us with the money. If you can give us the money, we can then hire soldiers with the funds and block Shinra's attack. We know that what we're asking is selfish. We have sent our wives and children to another village. We are resigned to our fate."
"NPC: Let's get back to square one. If the enemy penetrates our shed, you'll have to fight them immediately. Well, just because you lost once, it's not the end of the world, but if you lose repeatedly, it could be dangerous."
"NPC: Now then, is there anything you wish to ask?"
"NPC: You can win by wiping out the enemy or killing the enemy commander in charge. If the enemy reaches the shed, they'll attack, and you'll have no choice but to go into battle immediately. In the event that you lose during direct contact, even if the enemy gets to the reactor, there's still a chance to save things. But it's only a slight chance, and we have no idea how much the reactor can endure in an attack. When we can't stand up to the attack any longer, the Shinra will take both the condors and our lives, as well as all the materia within the reactor."
NPC: There are four types of enemies.
NPC: Wyverns are flying types that can move at high speed. Stoner and Tristoner aren't effective against them.
"NPC: Beasts are monster types that do not move quickly, but have explosive attacking power."
"NPC: Barbarians are human types. They attack indirectly, so you've got to be on your toes."
"NPC: Commanders are the enemy commanders. They're the ones we want to subdue, but they're formidable foes."
"NPC: Your mobile allies are: Fighters, Attackers, Defenders, Shooters, Repairers and Workers. Your immobile allies are: Stoner, Tristoner, Catapult, and Fire Catapult. Which do you want to hear about?"
NPC: Which do you want to hear about?
"NPC: Fighters are good at defending and attacking, but aren't especially effective or deficient for any enemy."
"NPC: Attackers move extremely fast and are best for expanding the front line. They work good against enemy Beasts, but not enemy Barbarians."
"NPC: Defenders have high endurance, but move slowly. They're best suited for defense. Defenders work best against enemy Barbarians, but not enemy Wyverns."
"NPC: Shooters attack indirectly, but has low endurance. Shooters work best against enemy Wyverns, but not enemy Beasts."
"NPC: Repairers repair allied aircraft, but have little attacking power."
"NPC: Workers set torpedoes. Torpedoes have strong attacking power, but Workers don't. Torpedoes explode when touched by the enemy. The explosions will damage everything in the immediate area."
NPC: Which do you want to hear about?
"NPC: Stoners can fire a single boulder, causing extensive damage to every enemy it hits."
"NPC: Tristoners can fire three boulders simultaneously, causing extensive damage to every enemy it hits."
"NPC: We can't use the Tristoner or Fire Catapult, because they are still being developed."
"NPC: The Fire Catapult is ready now, so we can set it up. We can't use the Tristoner, because it is still being developed."
NPC: Catapults shoot rocks a great distance. causing extensive damage to every enemy it hits.
NPC: Fire Catapults fire bombs a great distance. causing extensive damage to every enemy it hits.
"NPC: We can't use the Tristoner or Fire Catapult, because they are still being developed."
"NPC: The Fire Catapult is ready now, so we can set it up. We can't use the Tristoner, because it is still being developed."
NPC: We have XXXX gil right now.
NPC: We need 3000 gil for each battle. How much can you help?
NPC: Thanks. This makes XXXX gil.
"NPC: We are very grateful, but you don't have enough money."
"NPC: That's enough money for now. If we run out, we'll ask you for more."
"NPC: First off, we must prepare the troops. Move the cursor wherever the x mark does not appear, then press the O button to set-up. After all positions are in place, select by pressing the X button. This starts the battle."
"NPC: Soldiers can only be arranged near the shed, in the beginning. That's because if the soldiers are too far away, they won't be able to follow instructions. You can only put soldiers on the horizontal line at the very bottom. Soldiers can be instructed by pushing the select button. So if any commands are unclear, push it. Soldiers can report by pushing the"
NPC: The cursor will move to the soldier who made the report. Press the
"NPC: It would be great if you could spare the time to help us... But if you really don't have time, would you contribute some financial assistance."
"NPC: Hey, this one climbing up here looks like they'd be just right. Please, any help is appreciated..."
NPC: Preparations ready?
NPC: Perfect timing! They're just around the corner. Get ready.
"NPC: The situation has changed. Looks like the enemy is set to attack. If we lose here, it's over. Our lives are in your hands. We're counting on you. Ready?"
NPC: Ready?
NPC: Hey we're a little short on money... So could you at least make it 4000 gil?
"NPC: I see, very well then. Maybe, we'll fight together again sometime."
NPC: Sorry. We only have XXXX gil. We have to beg for your help.
"NPC: You have 10 enemies. There appear to be many Beasts, so you may want to deploy more Attackers."
NPC: The Barbarians are mixed during this attack. There are more than 20. Set up for a balanced-attack or we'll be in trouble.
NPC: A strong unit's on their way. Looks like around 30. They'll probably climb up here using various routes. Better be careful or we'll be in trouble. And make sure to deploy Fire Catapults.
"NPC: You're probably used to it now, but don't let your guard down. Deploy Tristoners."
NPC:Looks like the enemy numbers 40. Don't let your guard down.
NPC: I think you don't need my advice. The rest is up to you.
NPC: This is the deciding battle. The enemy numbers more than ever before.
NPC: Let's give them all the gil we have.
"On-screen: Received ""XXXX gil""!"
"NPC: Whew, that was good. But Shinra's troops will be back. Be sure and scout the area well... we don't know when they'll attack again. We have XXX allies left, so here's XXXX gil."
"NPC: Oh, yeah. I found this just now on the battlefield. Maybe it'll come in handy for you guys."
"On-screen: Received ""XXXXX""!"
NPC: My God! They're attacking! We're counting on you.
NPC: We made it through that one somehow. But Shinra'll be back. Be sure and scout the area well... we don't know when they'll attack again.
NPC: Are you all right? Looks like a few got through.
NPC: How goes it? The Shinra troops have attacked [number] times since you were here. So we're getting a little short on funds. We have XXXX gil right now.
NPC: How are things going? Seems like there's no activity at Shinra.
"NPC: If you want to get on the elevator that badly, give me 10 gil!"
NPC: Hurry up and get in!
NPC: That's not enough! Can't let you get on...
NPC: You're such a cheapskate.
"NPC: If you see a weapon you want, you'd better buy it."
NPC: You want me?
"NPC: Wow, now this is rare. We almost never have anyone other than the Shinra people visit this town."
"NPC: I know you guys want to go to the Western Continent, but the only way is on a Shinra ship."
"NPC: For the past few decades, the only thing I've been hearing about is the Shinra. I miss the times when we used to talk only about fish..."
"NPC: Ever since...Shinra built that city up above during the war, ... ugh,ugh. There's been no fish in the water! It got so polluted...phew..."
NPC: I don't think I'll ever...cough... ...live to see things... ...beautiful again.
NPC: There's nothing here now... But it used to be a busy port.
Cloud: What kinda place is this?
NPC: Who are you people? Where did you come from?
Cloud: Did you see a man with a black cape?
NPC: Hmm... I've never seen that feller before.
"NPC: Sorry, Cloud. Priscilla needs to rest for a while."
On-screen: Jump up to the cargo ship on the dolphin?
"NPC: I almost passed out when I saw Weapon. It seems Weapon was beaten, but a Shinra soldier told me there are 4 more."
NPC: They say Shinra's gathering Huge Materia from around the world and bringing it to Junon. Bringing it to Junon must mean they want to use their airplanes.
NPC: I've noticed there's been a lot of Shinra ships recently. I think they're going to the off-shore Underwater Reactor. Isn't Shinra trying to transport the Reactor's Huge Materia?
NPC: I heard a war's about to start! And that's why they're moving the big cannon!
NPC: Could be the end of the world...
"NPC: Once Meteor hits, not just the fish, but the whole ocean will be destroyed..."
NPC: It seems like there's something going on again up there. Is that huge plane going to take off again with that deafening roar?
NPC: What? Cloud is missing?
"Tifa: Maybe...he dropped some from the North Caves into the Lifestream... Sir, do you know where the Lifestream runs through? Cloud might have drifted from there."
"NPC: What? The Northern...what? Sorry, but I don't think I follow. But...I think I remember hearing Priscilla saying 'Life...something' before."
NPC: I think I've heard Priscilla mentioning 'Life...something' before.
"NPC: I remember years ago, seein' the Shinra build a long pipe underwater. The underwater reactor is connected to Junon by a pipe. You should be able to get to the reactor through it."
NPC: I just saw some Shinra soldiers all huddled together discussing something. They said a plane carrying Huge Materia would be taking off from the airport above.
"NPC: Listen Cloud, I'm over the hill, but Priscilla is still a child. Isn't there a way to protect at least her from Meteor?"
Priscilla: Who are you---?
Priscilla: Cloud!! Stupid jerk! Look how much you made me worry!! Were you at the Lifestream?
"Cloud: Yeah, that's right."
Priscilla: You've gotta be more careful! Because you're going to marry me one day.
Priscilla: At least knock when you enter a lady's room!
"Priscilla: Lifestream? Yeah, I know! It's Mr. Dolphin's playground. There's a Three-taloned island south of the continent. I heard the Lifestream runs below that island. But why are you asking about the Lifestream?"
"Tifa: Cloud fell into the Lifestream at the North Cave, and has been missing ever since."
"Priscilla: Huh, Cloud!? Hurry up and help him!! He's very important to me."
Priscilla: There's a Three-taloned island south of the continent. I heard the Lifestream runs below that island.
Cid: We found Cloud!
Priscilla: I'm so happy!! Someday I'm going to be Cloud's wife.
Priscilla: I've decided I'm gonna be Cloud's wife.
NPC: Someday I'll get to use my special pose in a real battle!
NPC: Same here!! I'll keep practicing until then!
NPC: Hey!! Civilian!! Stay out of our training!!
NPC: Go around them! And stay out of their way!!
NPC: Grrrrgh--- ---Grrrgh
NPC: ZZZZZ......
NPC: This is a Respectable Inn... guests only!
NPC: You should absorb all the wisdom until it is a part of you.
"NPC: Ok wise-guy, I'll ask about Materia just so you can let off some stress."
Cloud: You're right...
"Cloud: First off, the main points. Some types of Materia, like Magic, grow as you use them. Some, like Summon Magic, grow from being used once a battle, to several times per battle. Their effectiveness changes too. ...There are all different kinds. Some types don't change, but they must grow in order to be divided. ...And that's it. Maybe that sounded too official."
Cloud: Types of Materia... Here goes...!
"Cloud: There's no single way to combine Materia. So here goes the basics. Support Materia... The basic combination is Magic + All. The variety of magic you can cast will increase as your Magic Level increases. When your All level increases, so does the number of times you can use it in a battle. That about covers it."
NPC: Huh? Wait a sec...
"Cloud: You can change between Magic-All and Magic with the L1/R1 buttons. I'll bet you've probably already done this. One effective combination is Elemental + Summon Materia. If you equip this combination to your weapon, you can put Magic and Summon Elementals on your weapon. For example, if you equip Fire + Elemental to your sword, you will end up with Fire Elemental Sword. I'm getting off the subject,... If you equip Fire + Elemental to your armor, it will have twice the resistance to fire damage. Now this is important. When the Elemental levels in your armor increase, so will their effectiveness. From half damage - no damage - absorb. If you combined Elemental and Fire you could develop Fire absorbing armor."
"Cloud: Wait, there's more. Next is the Added Effect for Support Materia. The Added Effect Materia grafts the effects of Compound Status Materia into your weapons and armor. For example, equip Added Effect + Poison to your weapon and select [Attack]. Sometimes you'll give a Poison status. Of course, it doesn't always work. If you don't combine the Added Effect Materia with Status Change Materia, like Confusion or Time, you won't get any effect. To learn more about Added Effect, access the menu and check the Status. It's a little hard to get, but if you take your time, you'll be all right."
"Cloud: Division... I'm pretty good at this. People tell me that my personality is divided. But I don't think so, but maybe it is... Anyhow... Once your Materia reaches the maximum Level, it will divide. The original Materia will no longer grow. Once that happens, all you can do is use it as it is. New Materia always starts out with zero AP, so you need to raise its levels! Of course, once the new Materia reaches its max, it'll divide. That's how you increase your Materia collection. Ha, ha...... Right now I feel like I'm dividing myself."
"Cloud: Once Materia starts dividing, you must be careful. There's a limit to how much Materia you can have. Since we're fighting for the life of the Planet, it goes against my beliefs carrying too much Materia. Either way, I don't really care, but...I'll leave it up to you. That's why, the amount of Materia that we can have is limited to 200... only what we can equip. When you have too much Materia, you need to dispose of some. If you don't, you can't take on any more. So, ditch some Materia before that happens... Ahem...I mean, give them back to the Planet."
"NPC: Ok. Expert! Enlighten us on Limit Techniques, why doncha?"
Cloud: I don't have too much to say about that...
"Cloud: There are 2 basic ways of building up your Limit techniques. First, just use them! And second is to finish off as many enemies as possible! It sounds easier than it is. Everyone knows that when you gain a new Limit technique, you need to select it in the menu. And you knew that you won't be able to use advanced techniques on each level if you haven't used the basic ones. Since the type and growth for each limit techniques is different, that's about all I will say."
"Cloud: A long time ago I heard extreme techniques exist within the Limit techniques. But, if that's true you wouldn't be able to get it in any normal way. That's about all I know about it."
"NPC: Ok, Mr. Know-it-all, ex-SOLDIER! Let me revenge...I mean, review!"
Cloud: What do you want to review?
"Cloud: ATB means Active Time Battle. It's a system in which time continuously runs during battle. If the ATB is changed to [WAIT] in the Config Menu... Time stops during battle while you select magic or an item. That lets you select your commands carefully. It's geared especially for beginners like you. In config, if you change from ATB to [Recommended]... Time will stop while magic or item effects are displayed. This lets you watch the effects carefully. Letting you fight at your own pace... this is the way to go. I always use ACTIVE mode, but choose what you want. That's all."
"Cloud: During a battle, white numbers that appear on the screen indicate damage, and green numbers indicate recovery points. Remember that, if you don't want to be wiped out."
"Cloud: Change will change your fighting position to either the front or back row. If you select the back row, the amount of damage you receive is reduced, but so is your attacking power. [Change] can be selected from the battle menu by pushing the [left Directional button]. You can also select [Defend] from battle menu by pushing the Directional button to the right. Defend will reduce your damage by half until your next turn. It's better to use Defend for strong enemies. Of course, I don't need anything like that."
"Cloud: I don't know too much about Escape during battles since I never do it, but...someone like you might need it. You can escape by holding down the"
"Cloud: It might be hard to understand this next one since you can't check it right now, but just listen. I'm talking about the Gauges displayed during battle. Time Gauge shows the time remaining until your next turn during battle. You can enter a command once the Gauge is full, but if you don't want to enter a command, press the"
"Cloud: Status simply means the status of the characters. I don't want to repeat myself too much, so I'll mention the main points."
"Cloud: Phew...I'm tired. Changed Status can be changed with magic and items, so always double check it when you buy things."
"Cloud: Elementals are special Elementals that come with magic and weapons. You have to use this to your advantage in battle. Only once you start thinking in terms of Elementals can you truly be called an intermediate player. Here are some examples. Remember, they're just examples. You don't have to memorize them."
"Cloud: Using opposite Elementals often is effective in battle. Using the same Elementals usually increases Defense. But, the reverse is also true. Watch out for it. To find out what Elementals an enemy has, you need Sense Materia. Once you get it, try it out."
"Cloud: If you don't understand what I just told you, I guess you just have a limited capacity for information. But, relax. Push the [SELECT] Button during battle. A Help Message should explain the different commands to you. It'll tell you things like the monsters' names, even I look at it, sometimes... So don't be ashamed to use it."
"NPC: This is the Beginner's Hall (Intermediate)! Your explanations were so complicated I couldn't return to the Planet. So, I have a right to ask you again."
Cloud: What do you want to know?
"Cloud: For my explanation, I'll need a Potion."
"NPC: Man, ex-SOLDIER's sure are cheap. OK, I'll GIVE you a Potion..."
NPC: I don't seem to have any on me. Why don't you go buy one?
"Cloud: I think you know the basics, but just in case... Do not open the PlayStation or change discs until instructed. If you open the Disc Cover, I can't guarantee anything. That is all."
NPC: How 'bout a ship taxi? Only in Junon! Free to Air Force personnel!
NPC: Roger!! Hey! Taxi!!
NPC: Where to?
NPC: Right! The next town it is!!
NPC: Thanks!!
NPC: Then outside Junon it is! Take care!!
"NPC: Just holler whenever you want a ride! If you get sick easily, maybe you'd better not go."
NPC: Hey!! Stay out of the way!
NPC: Enjoy your stay.
NPC: Good morning! You still seem a little sleepy. Looking forward to seeing you again.
"NPC: Aw, knock it off already! You don't have enough moolah! No, you 'forget it'!"
NPC: Come again.
NPC: Please! Come in...
NPC: Welcome!
NPC: I won't charge you for a smile...
"NPC: Buy a lot, cutie!"
NPC: Please go to the counter.
NPC: Thank you very much!
NPC: ...gulp... Going do---wn.
"NPC: This floor is the Submarine Dock... Those of you visiting the Underwater Reactor, please proceed through the connecting tunnel."
NPC: ...gulp... Going u---p.
NPC: Returning to Junon.
NPC: ...gulp... We're here...
"NPC: A new version of submarine. I'll be sailing on it. Man, I can't wait!"
NPC: Man...... It's so boring keeping watch at the Underwater Reactor.
NPC: All I wanted was to become a pilot! It used to leave me speechless watching the Highwind in the sunset!
"NPC 1: Ever since I was late to that parade, they've been on my back everyday with basic training. I can't handle it anymore!"
NPC 2: Hey! Stop yappin'!
"NPC: Hmm? A know-it-all, huh? All right!! Come in!!"
"NPC: Ugh...My eyes are tired... No, this is the time for me to really buckle down! Until I become SOLDIER First Class."
"NPC: Oh, welcome!"
NPC: I've got nothing to sell to you! Come back later!
NPC: Hey! Yo! You want weapons?
NPC: Hey! Yo! Our weapons are the best!
NPC: Hey! Yo! Would you like to buy the whole store?
NPC: I'm sorry! It's all rented out today!
"NPC: Looks like something's going on outside, but we're too smashed to do anything..."
"NPC: Ooh, oohh... Oh man, my head's burning up..."
NPC: Seems like you're all a little too young to be in here.
NPC: Seaweed... Seaweed...
NPC: It just isn't a party without Rude!
NPC: Welcome! I was just starting to get worried... You see our sales were pretty bad today.
NPC: Only authorized personnel are allowed past this point!
"NPC: You know too, right? About Junon Navy's important classified information. A new submarine has almost been completed using Shinra's top technology."
NPC: Oh! Welcome! We don't have anything special now. I kind of messed up the last time I ordered but feel free to look around!
"NPC: Welcome to 'Inn'd of the line' in Junon. Wait, I shouldn't be sayin' stuff like that. Wanna spend the night?"
NPC: These barracks are for soldiers. This is no place for civilians.
Shinra manager: It's so shameful! ...and they told me that I would be staying at five star hotels on these trips...
Shinra manager: How can you guys sleep in a place like this?
"NPC: There're lots of stores in Junon. If we don't do this...we can't compete. But, what bothers me is that the girls make more than me."
"NPC: I used to be in SOLDIER... Once I left, I opened up this shop... But to tell you the truth, I'd rather be at the shop downstairs."
NPC: Mommy... My mommy...
NPC: I'm a good lookin' man once I take my uniform off.
"NPC: Booze, booze! Ain't nothing like booze during working hours."
NPC: I'm sorry. The bar is only for Shinra employees.
"NPC: Lately it seems like the economy's been better. Must be the 'Rufus' effect. Cargo ships are always coming and going from Costa del Sol. Now I'll overlook the fact that you're a stowaway, but you better at least help with the cargo."
"NPC: It's kinda lonely at the airport without the Highwind, isn't it? I miss that bikini girl on the side of the plane."
"NPC: Right now the Shinra's using it to gather the Huge Materia from the Corel Reactor and from the Fort Condor Reactor. The Gelnika's flying all over the place! The only one that's not busy, is probably me!"
"NPC: The Shinra's collecting Huge Materia at the Junon Undersea Reactor! When they're done, they'll bring it to this airport. Get out of here before you get in the way!"
"NPC: What...me? I'm gonna be watching from here, so that I don't get in their way either!"
"NPC: Finished loading the Huge Materia! All we have to do now is to ready the cargo ship, 'Gelnika', for departure and we're done!"
NPC: I'm glad we got Gelnika to the Rocket Town safely. But they sure think big. Looks like they're going to use the Huge Materia's to break up Meteor...
NPC: The Shinra Army's gathered at Midgar. Now it's just a matter of time Sephiroth's dead.
NPC:What...me? I don't mind. I'll just wait here. My life is important to me.
NPC: I finally got orders to join the Great Sephiroth Plan. I even get to go on the Gelnika too...
"NPC: But, I'm just gonna ignore them. I wanna live to see the end of the world. If I'm lucky... There'll be a good place for me in the New World."
"NPC: Doesn't it bother you? Flying around knowing that you could die at any moment? If that's the case, might as well live on the edge, I say. But before I can do that, I gotta get a license first."
NPC 1: I sure was frightened when Weapon attacked. It gives me the chills knowing there's still two of them left.
"NPC 2: Oh yeah? Well, I'm ready to fight the worst enemy mankind's ever had like a real warrior. It's not everyday you get to fight in an inter-planetary war."
NPC 1: The President is gathering up all the Huge Materia on the planet. He wants to shoot it at Meteor in the rocket.
NPC 2: President Rufus is different from the older generation. He'll protect the planet with all of the technology Shinra currently has.
"NPC 1: Protect? No, I don't think so. The President isn't the type to do anything so heroic. It's all just a game--a question of winning or losing--to him..."
"NPC 1: After they get it, they'll take it to the airport and will transport it to Rocket Town by Gelnika. Don't let your guard down!"
NPC 2: They've finally started collecting the Huge Materia from the Junon Underwater Reactor.
"NPC 1: Whew...I hope everything goes all right until we get to Rocket Town. Then, our mission is nearly complete."
NPC 2: Not so fast. We still have one major task... we still have to transport the stuff...
NPC 1: The stuff...
NPC: Come on in!
"NPC: Our forces are in the process of gathering the Huge Materia from the Corel and the Fort Condor Reactors! Once these two missions are completed, the Underwater Reactor will be our next target! Till then, we do nothing but train, train, train!"
"NPC 1: I'm starting to feel like I can't stop anymore. I've been had!! I want to get in a real battle, too!"
NPC 2: Hey! Stop yappin'!
NPC: Hmmm? You have no right to enter!
"NPC: Hmmm? Back again, Mr. Know-it-all!? All right! You can enter!!"
"NPC: I lost most of my rivals in the attack on Weapon. Oh, of course, I was here, studying. And the coveted green officer's uniform is almost in my reach."
"NPC: After that, I'll get on the newspapers as a plain clothed First Class officer in SOLDIER... A triumphant return to my homeland!! Tons of fan letters... My future's peachy!"
"NPC: Everyday there's no ship coming in, I always come here to watch the sun go down. The sun disappears almost like it's swallowed up in the big horizon. And somewhere out there is a big unknown continent with another port city. Twilight always gets me misty... I'm so glad I became a seaman."
NPC: Well...I wouldn't have time for one now anyway because of that Weapon thing...
NPC: I haven't had a girl friend in 18 years. And I'm a romantic!......phew.
"NPC: They're not going to get me down! Not me!! Weapon, Meteor, even bad customers, aren't going to get me!"
NPC: This machine hasn't been working right ever since Weapon got to it!
"NPC: I'd like to close down this shop, but we got the regulars to think about... I don't know what to do......"
"NPC: Weapon and Meteor scared everyone else off, but I'm sittin' here soused as usual."
NPC: Welcome!! I just can't believe it. I never thought a monster like Weapon really existed.
"NPC: Weapon was really something. Nothing can compare with his strength, but with a selection like this, our weapons'll win."
NPC: Our rates are the same as the 1st class hotels. Would you like to stay?
NPC: All the real soldiers were killed fighting Weapon. It may seem ironic that losers like me are still alive. But that's the reality of it.
NPC: I'm learning to be a delinquent soldier!! I just can't seem to get the hang of it! It just isn't going right!!
"Shinra manager: I only came to help with the transporting of Junon's Huge Cannon, Sister Ray, but... Now the company tells me not to bother coming back... What's being a Shinra employee all about...?"
Shinra manager: Yeeeeee...... If Weapon killed all the upper management... then I'll be President...!!
"NPC: Look, why not forget about Meteor and Weapon for now and do a little impulse shopping!?"
NPC: Why don't you surround yourself with young girls and have some fun...maybe for the last time.
"NPC: I hired more girls after hearing that the world's coming to an end, but I wonder if I made a mistake. I keep getting more and more in debt. I've got to get out from under it somehow. Maybe I'll have Weapon help me."
"NPC: I used to be in SOLDIER. Recently, I've felt like dressing up like this... I don't know why, it's out of season, but..."
"NPC: I'm sorry. I've decided to close this place down. All my regular customers were killed by Weapon. Everyone was pretty weird, but I got a lot of memories of them."
NPC: Welcome to Bar del Sol! Here's to tropical nights!
NPC: Hmm... Is this some kind of joke?
"NPC: 'Praise the Lord,' it's a miracle!! Who'd ever think someone with some real money would ever come here......"
"NPC: I probably shouldn't even ask, but Are you really going to buy it?"
"On-screen: Bought ""Villa Cloud""!"
"NPC: Hmm, good-bye!! Good-bye fluffy bed!!"
NPC: Oh well I'm kind of glad!
Cloud: This is MY villa.
On-screen: Rest up in your new villa?
NPC: ...SNORE...SNORE...
NPC: Geez my lower back's killing me!
"NPC: Y, yes...sir!! How do you do! I'm the Manager. Nice to meet you. Well, if you'll pardon me, I'll be leaving. Good-night."
NPC: ...SNORE...SNORE...
"(Upon taking the items on the ground.)NPC: Y, yes...sir!!"
"NPC: Oh, those items are free, so please help yourself."
"NPC: You're stowaways, right? It's okay. I'm used to them. The truth is, before I worked here, I was one of the best."
NPC: Costa del Sol...a harbor paradise where the sun always shines and it's summer all year round! Hmm......Things aren't going well...... You can go sightseeing in the city.
NPC: Damn. I'm soaking wet down to my underwear.
NPC: Oops! You must be those AVALANCHE guys! Quick! Let's get outta here! Heidegger's in charge of the transport ship. That's tough for both of us.
NPC: The transport ship won't be sailing for a quite a while. Heidegger's orders.
"NPC: Thinking of being stowaways? It's 100 gil to Junon. Give it to me, and I'll put in a good word with the captain. What'll we do?"
NPC: Okay. Come on. This way.
NPC: It's not the most pleasant ride but make the best of it.
NPC: Hey! No money? And you're trying to stowaway? Don't make me laugh!
NPC: Thank you. Come back any time you want to stowaway on our ship.
"NPC: Don't bug me. This is Rufus's first official visit since becoming President. It seems like he's here on business this time. I'm so jealous of him, I could spit. We're both about the same age, but, he's President."
NPC: Rufus complimented me on my job! Wow!! I guess it pays to do good work.
"NPC: Oh crap... The manager of Shinra won't come down. Even though the President's here on business. All he does is play, forgetting everything to do with work."
"NPC: But a bunch of hardworking deckhands like you wouldn't understand. On the marine blue sea, Gazing at the eternal skies that seem to go on forever... Gives you the feeling like you're taking a nap on the wing of a Cessna. It's the ultimate high!"
"NPC: He's quite handsome, isn't he?...... Oh, don't worry, I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about President Rufus. Charming, rich, blond... He even looks good in a double-breasted suit."
NPC: Today's a great day for a nap in the sun. It always puts me in a good mood!
"NPC: Heh, heh... I hear the Shinra brass are arriving soon. Heh, heh...! Got nothing to do with us, does it?"
"NPC: Hey! Spread out, all of you, out!! Put any fingerprints, scratches, or dents on that plane and I'll put one in your head!"
"NPC: Da plane, da plane!! This's something you'll never be able to do in your lifetime. So you just watch from a distance... and wish."
"NPC: Hey, who're you?. You look like you've been around the world twice. I don't know what your story is, but hang in there."
"Shinra manager: Oh, oh, oh!!! I'm gonna quit this company!! I mean it, I'm really gonna quit!!"
"Shinra manager: Heidegger's such an idiot!! And Rufus, acting all big!!"
"Shinra manager: God, that sure felt good..."
"NPC: Say, aren't you bored?"
"NPC: Oh, really? I'm a little bored. Come on, back to work now!"
NPC: Isn't that good? You're just expecting too much.
NPC: Here you are! The Costa del Sol tourist information guide. What do you want to know?
NPC: Let's see. I recommend a resort located on the outskirts of the city.
"NPC: If you're looking for souvenirs, we recommend Butch's."
"NPC: Wait a minute. I'm going to look at my guidebook. It says, Costa del Sol is the gateway to the West. And has a prominent world renown resort, which has been around for ages."
"NPC: Come on! I don't care about that! If you want a good time, come to the beach! There are lots of beautiful women. You wouldn't happen to be...rich?"
"NPC: You're kidding! You can't tell just by looking. But I'll tell you just in case. After relaxing at Costa del Sol, stop by the Gold Saucer. It's a rich and exciting place to play!"
NPC: I thought so. Are you interested? This is the road to Gold Saucer.
"NPC: Head south to the Gold Saucer, and you'll find casinos and an amusement park. But if you're planning to walk, you'll have to cross mountains and valleys. I wouldn't recommend it. But if you're on a vacation, you should go there at least once."
"NPC: 1, 2, 3, here we go!"
NPC: I heard. That big dog talks like a human. That's cool ...but it's weird.
NPC: It's the ocean. A creepy man was signaling for us to come. I was scared to come here!
NPC: It hurts when you kick me with your bare feet!
NPC 1: Shall we play our hand around here?
"NPC 2: Not yet. Remember, no compromises."
"NPC 1: You're right. After all, this trip was expensive."
NPC 2: But only your average Joes are trying to pick us up.
"NPC 1: Well, that's because we're just too beautiful and hard to approach."
"NPC 2: I guess so. Well, I envy the plain Janes."
NPC 1: Why don't we compromise? We'll make do with what we have.
NPC 1: Why's that!?
NPC 2: Not yet!!
NPC 1: Eaghhh!
NPC 2: It's your fault!
NPC 1: What's wrong with you!?
NPC 2: You wanna go!?
NPC 1: Whew!!!
NPC 1: A man......
NPC 2: A good-looking man......
NPC 1: Where......
NPC 2: Ho! Ho! Ho......
NPC 1: Yipes!!
NPC 2: Grrrr......
NPC 1: ...pant...wheeze!......
NPC: How about a 'Soft' as a memento of this wonderful trip? Made especially in Costa del Sol!
"Butch: Yeah, I'd like to hire a gorgeous chick and have a great time."
"Butch: Well, we're lucky to have that cutie working for us part-time."
"Butch: You got me there...... We just hired her part-time. She ran off with our money and Materia. I guess a situation that's too good to be true, usually is."
"Butch: Well, please feel free to browse around. Just don't mind looking at what's left."
"NPC: Yeah, snowboarding's what's happening this year. I'm sick of surfing."
NPC: We look like great surfers... Only because we don't have any clothes other than these swim trunks.
NPC: We're all headin' over to Gold Saucer now. We're gonna make a ton of money at the Chocobo races. Then we're gonna take a trip to Icicle Inn and snowboard.
"NPC: I traveled around a long time... And this town has the most beautiful ocean I've ever seen. Sometimes you can't realize it when it's right in front of you. I guess I took it for granted because it's so close, and I was so used to seeing it all the time. That's the reason I found my way back here."
NPC: Come on...please. If you don't buy from me... I can't make ends meet.
"Mukki: I really like this town. You could walk around nearly naked, and no one'd look twice at you."
NPC: ......HIC... Mm? Wanna order? We're outta that now.
NPC: ...huff...puff... I can't stand hot places...
NPC: You want drink? Iz ok. You take time.
"NPC: Hey! I thought you'd drop by. (That's 1, 2...4 fishes all together...... not bad.)"
"Johnny: mumble...mumble... (Tifa, promise me you're gonna be happy.)"
"Johnny: Heh, heh, heh!...... My woman and me are getting along pretty good. But I'm such a pitiful waste......"
Johnny: ...sigh......I'm not good enough for her. What I should do?
NPC: What a fluffy bed...... feels so great......
NPC: Mmm... Just a little longer......
NPC: Oh!!
"NPC: Oh, I'm sorry...... I didn't know you were here. This is embarrassing. Take your time and look around."
"NPC: By the way, are you seriously considering buying?"
Cloud: What are you selling?
NPC: That's pretty low. Are you pulling my leg?
"NPC: I'm talking about this house. This villa used to belong to President Shinra. It only recently came back on the market. How do you like it? It has a large lot, comes fully furnished with this goose-down bed, and there's even a basement to boot. The villagers call it the Shinra Villa. Of course, we're not giving it away..."
NPC: Wha? How do you plan to buy it without a dime on you?
"NPC: Well, I'll tell the price just for your information. It's a steal at 300,000 gil. Out of your range? Out! Go on, out!"
"NPC: Yes, you're right. I'm sorry, please continue."
"NPC: Yes, you're right. I'm sorry, please continue."
"NPC: Well, what do you think? Isn't it a fabulous villa? The feeling you get with owning a villa is simply...how should I say? ...indescribable. Well, let's wait for the captain."
NPC: Welcome!! What's it going to be? 200 gil a night.
"NPC: You must be tired. Tomorrow in the Costa del Sol area the weather is going to be......sunny, again."
On-screen: Cradled by the sound of the ocean waves...... Sweet dreams...
NPC: Good morning. Be careful traveling.
NPC: Good morning!!
NPC: Wait a minute! There's not enough money here.
NPC: You sure? I'll just be playing around here so drop by whenever you feel like it.
"NPC: If you're headed for Mt. Corel, then you'd better buy some ""Soft"". At least that's what they always say, don't they? Be prepared, and you'll never fear."
"NPC: Hey, I'm no idiot. I NEVER count my chickens before they hatch! Pretty good, huh?"
"NPC: Hey...... heh heh......don't forget to talk to me, too."
NPC: Always the same story... Women never pay any attention to me...
NPC: Yipes!! Help!!
"NPC: ...breath...breath...! Kind of takes your breath away, don't it!?"
NPC: Eeeew!! Leave me alone!
NPC: Ublk! Glug...glug...... You're gonna drown... I'm
"NPC: I'd be happy to be a guinea pig, if it's for Professor Hojo!"
NPC: Professor Hojo is so sweet. He's going to experiment on me.
NPC: That's right!! It totally skipped my mind! There was something I was supposed to tell you.
"NPC: That's right! It's about that! It was yesterday. A man wearing a black cloak came up from the ocean. I think he had tickets for the Gold Saucer... no, that wasn't it... I wonder if it was all just an illusion?"
NPC: If this is your idea of flirting...forget it. I do fine as it is.
NPC: He never takes off his lab coat even in this heat. I guess that's the mark of an intellectual.
NPC: Hey! President Rufus came here yesterday. He used to be the President's little boy. We nicknamed him the little Prez! He didn't look much different than the surfers on the beach.
"NPC: The sea, the wind and the sun. Don't you just love the outdoors? It always puts me back on track."
"NPC: I'll interpret Professor Hojo's whispers. Head west, past Mt. Corel and keep going......"
"NPC: Did you get that? I didn't understand it well, myself."
"NPC: Yes, Professor Hojo. Where...?"
"NPC: It looks like the Professor discovered or found a solution to something. You know, I wonder...... if they headed west for Mt. Corel?"
NPC: I'm getting a little sad. Professor Hojo looks happy like a child when he discovers something. He gets this big smile and then laughs......
NPC: I guess we should chase after him. A vacation for two from Mt. Corel to Gold Saucer.
"NPC: Hey, good timing. Would you mind putting lotion on me?"
NPC: Uhhhnn...
NPC: Than--kyu!
"NPC: Hey, loosen up a bit."
"NPC: There's no ship to Junon. Recently, there's been a hoard on materials. Everything's topsy-turvy."
"NPC: Everyone's in a rush to get one last vacation in before the Meteor strikes, That's why it's so busy here."
"NPC: Not gonna be able to nap like this for much longer. When you put it that way, I feel kind of sad."
"NPC: Well, I'm not worried. When it all comes down, I'm heading for the skies. The only problem is...... will there be anywhere left to land?"
NPC: I don't feel like sightseeing around town. What I really want to do is... Looks like Gold Saucer is temporarily closed.
"NPC: Oh wow!! Man, that's huge!!"
NPC: The stars!! They're in flames!!
NPC: They're burning. Someday they'll burn out. The stars are just like our youth.
NPC: Ho! Ho! Ho!...... It's the end of the world.
NPC: Wanna buy a souvenir to remember participating in the Meteor tour?
Butch: Good or bad everything's gotta go! It's the end of the world sale!!
"NPC: I don't care if it's the Meteor or not, I'm not giving up yet! I still haven't surfed the best waves of Costa del Sol! I hope the Meteor doesn't strike before I do."
NPC: It's weird seeing the reflection of the Meteor on the sea in the evening! It gives you the creeps.
NPC: Come on...please. If you don't buy from me... I can't make ends meet. No one else will either.
Mukki: I'm just sitting here havin' a quiet drink.
NPC: I don't understand what my boss is thinking! I'm gonna yell at him! I'm gonna scream my head off till it gets ugly! Isn't that what life's all about? What do you think?
NPC: ...huff...wheeze... Heat and cold are just memories of the Planet......
NPC: I wan' learn how speak beddah. But don' wan' have stars fall down. You think...same?
"NPC: When you're in here, forget about all those awful things going on outside, and... just enjoy yourself."
Johnny: I proposed to her in the middle of all that Meteor stuff! I don't care even if the world were to end right now! I can't think of anything else!
"Johnny: No, no, NO!! Meteor's getting bigger by the minute!! I wanna live on the edge right now!! I want to build a home with my woman and grow old together! If you can't do it, I will! And that's that! I'm gonna do my best, so you hang in there, too!"
NPC: I don't feel like doing anything. I just want to spend the rest of my life sleeping. Will you be staying together?
NPC: Good night.
NPC: Stop looking like a hunted animal! Whatever happens...happens. Just go with it.
NPC: Sitting around waiting for Meteor to come...... Why's it gotta fall on us?
NPC: Eaaggh!! Leave me alone! I'm trying to learn how to swim before the end of the world.
"NPC: It's getting closer and closer. Someone will do something, don't you think?"
"NPC: The sea breeze, sun and Meteor. Isn't nature strange?"
"NPC: I don't care even if it is the end of the world, I just want to sit here and drink cocktails!"
NPC: Ooooh......I think I drank too much.
NPC: Please buy something! Anything will do!
NPC: What do you want?
NPC: Take that road on the left to the Ropeway station! The Ropeway'll take you to the Gold Saucer. It don't mean much to us poor folks though...
"NPC: If you want to survive, then you're gonna need some of my weapons. (Upon talking to the man in the tent on the left.)"
"NPC: I want to leave this garbage dump of a town behind me, and start a new life. If I had a buggy, I'd cross the southern desert, and go to that town across the river..."
NPC: Welcome. It's 50 gil a night. Would you like a room?
NPC: Enjoy your stay.
"NPC: Hmm, you don't quite have enough."
NPC: Please come again.
NPC: Isn't anyone brave enough to stick it to Shinra?
NPC: YOU know who's responsible for North Corel winding up like this!
NPC: I'll never understand the rich. I heard some guy named Dio at the Gold Saucer is collectin' rocks!
NPC: Get out of the way!! The only way we can make ends meet around here now is by collecting junk!
"NPC: A buncha guys called Turks came here sayin' they'd pay 10000 gil for some rock called a 'Keystone'. When I asked how much they'd pay for a regular rock just layin' around here, they slapped me upside my damn head!!"
NPC: I hear it's a big fad now in the city to get tattoos. Is that right?
NPC: Really...? I saw a big '1' on the arm of a young guy heading towards the Ropeway. That Black Cape he had on was really cool.
"NPC: I guess I should get a '0' tattoo! For a poor man like me, '0' oughtta be perfect."
NPC: Grandpa used to be a Coal Train engineer. He still can't kick his old habits from then.
NPC: The next train's coming in soon.
NPC: Everyone knows that accident couldn't have been avoided. But no one will be satisfied until someone takes the blame.
"NPC: There was something glowing in that well over there. If I can get my hands on it, I'm gonna sell it and go to the Gold Saucer!"
NPC: How am I supposed to continue living in a town that's lost everything...? To hell with the Mako reactor!
NPC: Because of them......ugh my husband got into that accident... He used to be such a strong man...
NPC: Yaaay!! What do you wanna play?
"NPC: The Ropeway takes you to the 'Gold Saucer'. It's free, so don't worry about it."
NPC: Look down... nuthin' but junk. Look up...Meteor. Am I gonna be stuck between these two for the rest of my life?
NPC: Some Shinra soldiers went up to Mt. Corel. They said they're collecting Huge Materia to blow up Meteor! Ya think they can really do it...? I'll bet the reactor destroys everything even before Meteor hits!
"NPC: I figure if I stay alive long enough, something good's bound to happen."
"NPC: Staring up at Meteor won't put food in my stomach. But if I look down, sometimes I find somethin' to eat."
"NPC: Shinra soldiers came around sayin' they were gathering up all the Huge Materia. I think they're gonna bring it here by coal train, from the Corel Reactor."
"NPC: Whenever I look up in the sky, I see Meteor staring me right in the face...... If you're comin' down, then hurry up do it!! 'Cause I'm gonna kick the $#@& outta ya!"
"NPC: Hey, what's gonna happen to the world...? I guess no one wants to have fun anymore now that the Gold Saucer is closing..."
"NPC: Hey, the Gold Saucer reopened! We've got to play hard to get our minds off Meteor."
"NPC: As long as we're here, Grandpa's not going to be able to forget about trains. Maybe we'll start anew, moving to Southern Isle of Mideel."
"NPC: With Meteor coming, I guess it won't make any difference..."
NPC: Seeing that train got Grandpa more excited than I've seen him for some time.
NPC: The next train's coming in soon.
NPC: What the? Don't get hit by the train!
NPC: Everyone knows that accident couldn't have been avoided. But no one will be satisfied until someone takes the blame.
NPC: You saved my life. Not that I have much longer to live anyway...
"NPC: There was something glowing in that well over there. If I can get my hands on it, I'm gonna sell it and go to the Gold Saucer!"
NPC: I got it out of the well. It must be a special rock!!
"On-screen: Received ""Ultima"" Materia!"
NPC: Hey? You can't hold anymore. I'll keep it in my pocket for you. You can come by and pick it up later!
"NPC: When I grow up, I'm gonna travel the world collecting glowing stones!"
NPC: How am I supposed to continue living in a town that's lost everything...? To hell with the Mako reactor!
NPC: The town is in shambles...... and Meteor is falling our way... All we have left is our love for each other.
"NPC: I don't want to die, but who can stop Meteor?"
NPC: Because of them......ugh my husband got into that accident... He used to be such a strong man...
NPC: Is Meteor really going to crash down on us......? I'm still young...... I'll never marry again.
NPC: This memento is all I have left of my husband... I'll give it to you if you'll please stop Meteor...
"On-screen: Received ""Catastrophe""!"
NPC: Yaaay!! What do you wanna play?
"NPC: Hey, what's a Meteor?"
"NPC: The Gold Saucer is currently closed. The Ropeway's up and runnin', but there's no point in goin' there."
NPC: The Gold Saucer reopened. Why don't you go play hard and clear your heads as well as your pockets?
NPC 1: I'm gonna use all my life savings before Meteor hits!
"NPC 2: I know how you feel, but what if Meteor doesn't hit us? What are you gonna do then?"
NPC: I got a glowing rock from the well. I'll sell it to you for 50000 gil!
"On-screen: Received ""Ultima"" Materia!"
NPC: You don't have enough money! Don't try to take advantage of me just because I'm a kid!!
NPC: Huh? You have lots of 'em! You can't carry all of 'em. So I'm gonna keep it in my pocket...
NPC: I wish someone would buy this rock off of me...
(Upon talking to the child after purchasing Ultima Materia.)NPC: Yay! My house is finished!!
NPC: My store was all right!
NPC: Um... where was the next train station?
"NPC: We've lost everything... Now we have to start again from ' 1' ...no, from ' 0'."
"NPC: Hey, what's this world coming to ...? Even the Gold Saucer is closing. So does that mean there's no time to be playing around?"
"NPC: Hey, the Golden Saucer reopened! I guess that means we should play hard to forget about Meteor."
NPC: Welcome to the Gold Saucer.

NPC: You can become one if you own a Chocobo ...and have some connections. But Chocobo's are pretty hard to catch and I don't have any connections.
"NPC: You can only buy up to 3 tickets Think before you buy. For example, you could select half of the Chocobos and buy 3 boxes."
"NPC: A box is buying 3 combinations of 2 Chocobos. For example, if you select Chocobo 1, 3, and 5, you can purchase combinations, such as 1 - 3, 1 - 5, 3 - 5. You can also play the limited wheel by selecting a Chocobo."
"NPC: Playing a 'Limited wheel' means you select a Chocobo and use it in all of your combinations. For example, if you have Chocobo 1, then you buy 1 - 2, 1 - 3, 1 - 4. No matter how you make your bet, you win some and you lose some. It all comes down to insight and luck."
"NPC 1: Hey, what's that Chocobo on the odds sheet?"
NPC 2: That's how you can find out a Chocobo's condition and strengths.
"NPC 1: Hmm, If you can tell which ones are the strongest, then it's easy..."
"NPC 2: Well, not as easy as you think. It's not just a matter of the Chocobo's strength, but it also depends on the jockey and the Chocobo's personality. If these are bad, they may use too much stamina, and affect other things."
NPC: Welcome. Thank you for coming to the Ghost Hotel.
NPC: Uuuuuuuuuugh......
NPC: Sorry but there's no show now.
"NPC: Geez, you're a real bummer. Why don't you just leave us alone?"
"NPC: We put on a really unusual show here. It's not on today, but come back again sometime and see it."
NPC: What's your problem? Can't you see we wanna be alone?
"NPC: Come now, no running!"
NPC: Let's get lotsa GP at Wonder Square and have some fun!
NPC: Let's get lotsa GP at Wonder Square and have a blast!
"NPC: They probably told you at the entrance, but most of the attractions at Gold Saucer only take 'GP'. They don't sell GP. You can only get 'em from the Wonder Square games or at the Chocobo Races."
NPC: Please......don't...... talk to me......right now.
NPC: You sure do need a lot of money here.
NPC: Back there...
NPC: I get so caught up in these......
"NPC: Hey, how 'bout it, change your gil into GP?"
"NPC: Hey, thanks 1 GP is 100 gil."
On-screen: XXXX gil
On-screen: XXX GP
"NPC: No, no. It's suspicious if you have more than 10000 GP."
"NPC: Is gil, okay?"
"NPC: Hey, you don't have enough."
"NPC: If you want some more later, I'll be around now and then."
Dio: This way.
"Dio: I'm sorry, I'm gonna close this for awhile. I'm just debating if I should be in business at a time like this."
"Dio: I thought about it, but there was only one conclusion. I believed that because of the way things are, there's a need for a place like this. Enjoy yourselves... Ha ha ha ha..."
"NPC: Hey, since the prizes changed, I got 5000 points again."
NPC: Be careful of the Meteor.
"NPC: Those two over there eloped, saying stuff like 'Our last moments together---' I can't bear it.v I don't have anyone like that in my life so, if something happens, it happens. ...that's why I'm working now. Oh, sorry for going off like that..."
"NPC: You know, I've been thinking about it for a while now, but you must be pretty strong? Probably strong enough to take on the top 1 or 2 fighters? Maybe you'll be good enough for the big match......"
NPC: How 'bout it? There's a private battle only for the strongest. Wanna try?
NPC: Register for battle? The entrance fee is 10 GP.
"NPC: Hmm... What, you too? With the way things are in the world, It makes you wonder what we're doin' here? Well, it's a little late for me to run around now, so I do what I love, it works best for me."
"NPC: Oh, by the way, did you know? I heard that there's going to be a battle and only the strongest will be allowed to participate. But what do they mean by 'strongest'? If ya ask me I'll say it's 'weapons.' But, there's gotta be a way to measure this too. Mmm, we need another way to measure strength. After Meteor is summoned"
NPC: I'll give that Meteor my ultra kick...... ...or......maybe not.
"NPC: Um, I'm sorry, that's only for registered participants. You won't be able to go in through there until you come and register."
"Ester: Hey, long time no see... How have you been? There's a lot going on in the world outside. It got a little lonely around here, but you can't keep a jockey from doing what he loves."
"Ester: How 'bout it, you want to ride again? You have your own Chocobo, right?"
Ester: Do you want to ride?
Cloud: Which one?
Ester: Then I'll register this X rank Chocobo.
"Ester: Which do you want, the long course or the short one?"
"Tifa: Hey, Cloud. Let me ride once in a while."
"Cid: Hey, Cloud. Let me hop on sometime."
Ester: Good Luck! Take care!
"Ester: Hmm, seems like there aren't any Chocobos that can be registered..."
"Ester: Oh, you forgot? It's all right. Ahem! First use the"
Cloud: I won!!

On-screen: Received XXX GP!!
"On-screen: Received ""XXXX""!"
Ester: Congratulations! You came in first!
"Ester: And your Chocobo moved up a rank. From the next race on, that Chocobo will be in B rank."
"Ester: And your Chocobo moved up a rank. From the next race on, that Chocobo will be in A rank."
"Ester: Wow that's great. Looks like you don't have any rivals in the A rank anymore. But you know, there's a rank that's full of those Chocobos."
"Ester: Ahem!! From the next race on, that Chocobo is... S rank! Joe's usually in that group, too. So good luck."
"Ester: Wow From the next race on, that Chocobo will be in S rank."
Ester: Amazing... It's the first time since Joe that any jockey has won so much in the S rank. Good job. Here's a little something from me!
"On-screen: Received ""Sprint Shoes""!"

NPC: Uuuuuuuuuugh......
"NPC: Now, be careful of Meteor."
"NPC: I'll hang in there, even if I'm alone!"
"NPC: I can't stop, no matter what's happening outside..."
NPC: I'm just gonna spend all my money and play until I drop!!
NPC: We got new prizes. But what's in them is a secret.

"NPC: You sure are an unusual one. Staying here with all that's happening outside......guess that makes, uh, two of us...huh?"
Party leader: A ruined reactor.
NPC: Huh......did you want something?
"NPC: We voted to outlaw the use of Mako energy and live with nature, ever since the explosion."
NPC: People can live without the Shinra's Mako Reactors.
NPC: They sell the weapons on the second floor. Climb up the pole to get there.
NPC: ...You want something?
"NPC: Shinra built the reactor, without even thinking about the town's safety. And, this is the result."
"NPC: One day, there was a huge explosion. Many townspeople died in it..."
"NPC: It's been a while since the explosion, but you can still find pieces of it left all over town."
NPC: Uh...need somethin'?
NPC: It's 80 Gil a night.
NPC: It's 300 Gil a night.
NPC: ...You don't have enough money. Come back when you get some.
"NPC: Shinra built the reactor, without even thinking about the town's safety. And, this is the result."
"NPC: One day, there was a huge explosion. Many townspeople died in it..."
"NPC: It's been a while since the explosion, but you can still find pieces of it left all over town."
NPC: This is Gongaga Village. Many people died here in a Mako reactor explosion.
"NPC: The Shinra people told us that everyone would be happy once the Reactor was built. But, all it brought us was sadness......"
"NPC: Tell me, young man. Can't we be happy without having to sacrifice anything? Can't time pass without unhappiness...?"
NPC: Oh...you here to shop?
"NPC: Shinra built the reactor, without even thinking about the town's safety. And, this is the result."
"NPC: One day, there was a huge explosion. Many townspeople died in it..."
"NPC: It's been a while since the explosion, but you can still find pieces of it left all over town."
"NPC: Three years ago when the reactor exploded, my husband..."
NPC: Do people really need reactors to live? Aren't there more important things in life...?
NPC: ............
"NPC: No matter how much I pray, it won't bring our grandson back..."
NPC: Life Stream? Never heard of it. The Planet's structure? ...Who cares about that? Why don't you go ask Bugenhagen of Cosmo Canyon hard questions like that?
NPC': Seems like the Shinra is planning something big to destroy Meteor... I heard they're going to do something with all that big materia they've been gathering... After what happened with the reactor you can't trust Shinra.
NPC: ...Everyone's going to die. Everything's coming to an end.
NPC: You lost? When that happens the only ones you can count on are your friends. The first thing you gotta do is find your best friend.
"NPC: This reactor's useless, but I hear there's still big materia at the Corel, Fort Condor, and the Junon reactors. Shinra's working to get the materia from all those places...... But for what...?"
"NPC: Shinra's tried a lot of things, but it's only HUMAN. It's fate that Meteor will kill the people."
"On-screen: Tasty Cocktails! Pub ""Starlet"""

"NPC: Were you able to hear the stars whispers? Well then, please come again."
"NPC: I'm sorry, but you don't seem to have enough for a room..."
"NPC: Well then, please come again."
On-screen: [Turtle Paradise Newsletter] Number 4
Bugenhagen: Ho Ho Hoooo. That's a machine only I can use.
NPC: Welcome to Cosmo Canyon. Make yourselves at home.
"NPC: Since you're here, why don't you listen to Bugenhagen's story?"
"NPC: Did you get to see Bugenhagen's contraption? If you haven't yet, you must!"
NPC: Leaving already? But it appears your friends still want to learn more about the planet...
"NPC: Hm? If you're looking for Bugenhagen, he went to the Sealed Door. Remember, there's a steel door on the way to Bugenhagen's room. What's that door there for anyhow? It's been closed forever..."
"NPC: Oh, Nanaki's with you. Make yourselves at home."
"NPC: Yaaay! Nanaki! Nanaki's back! It's all thanks to this flame! This fire is called 'Cosmo Candle'. It has burned for generations. It is a holy flame that protects this canyon. I heard once, it only went out once, long ago. The elders said something horrifying occurred, but I really don't know much about it."
"NPC: Nanaki, are you leaving again? We want you to stay here forever..."
NPC: So this is Cosmo Canyon... Quite a mysterious place. Have you come to seek the 'Study of Planet Life'?
NPC:Yeah? I heard there's an awesome observatory here. I'd like to see it if I have a chance.
"NPC: Oh yeah? What? The car broka down!? Why don't you look around Cosmo Canyon, while I fix the car?"
"NPC: Oh, really? There really isn't much else to see here."
"NPC: Why don't you look around Cosmo Canyon, while I fix the car?"
NPC: The repair on your car is completed. Now you should be able to go where ever you want.
"NPC: No charge! You'd do the same for me, right?"
"NPC: Are you sure...? Well, all right. Thank you."
NPC: Oh yeah. Did you stay at the inn already? There was a bottle on the sofa there a couple of days ago...was it yours?
"NPC: ...You don't even have that much. Don't tease me, okay?"
NPC: Mmm...... I think the teachings of the 'Study of Planet Life' are true. But can people used to Mako energy ever go back...?
"NPC: Welcome. How 'bout our original cocktail, 'Cosmo Candle?' A drink now and then is good for you. It'll relax you a bit. ...If you know when to stop."
"Elder Bugah: Is that so? You brought Nanaki back here? Yeah, thanks."
Elder Bugah: Mmm... What is it?
"Elder Bugah: You can't talk of the Ancients, without mentioning Professor Gast. He used to come here sometimes. He was a Shinra scholar who spent his life studying the Ancients. He was a serious person, never would have figured he'd be with the Shinra. Must've been about 30 years ago, when he found the corpse of an Ancient. He was elated! If I recall...he named it 'Jenova' and was doing a lot of research..."
"Elder Bugah: One day, he showed up here, looking real distressed. He was mumbling something about Jenova not being an Ancient and that he'd done a terrible thing... He's been missing since then. I heard that he never went back to Shinra"
"Elder Bugah: So, if you ever see Professor Gast, I want you to tell him... That the old man that likes to drink in Cosmo Canyon, wanted to hear about the Ancients. Well, there's lots to talk about, but most things about the Ancients are all legend and folk tales, and no one knows the truth."
Elder Bugah: ...hmm. That's no fun... I wanna tell a story.
"Elder Bugah: By the way, your friends are all in front of the 'Cosmo Candle' Are you all leaving now?"
Elder Bugah: Mmm. I'm starting to feel good now. That bartender's cocktails always hit the spot.
NPC: Welcome to 'Shildra Inn'. It'll be 100 gil a night. Would you like to stay?
NPC: Hello. Looking for anything in particular?
"Bugenhagen: Ho Ho Hoooo. I'm glad you're back, Nanaki."
"Bugenhagen: I hate to ask you but, please look after Nanaki from now on."
Bugenhagen: Ho Ho Hoooo. You people.
Bugenhagen: Where is Nanaki? I hope he's not bothering you.
"NPC: Oh, it's you. This is terrible. The color of that unlucky star... The children are all so scared that they won't even go outside. I'd rather not see it either..."
NPC: Bugenhagen is what keeps our hearts strong...
"NPC: Nanaki, it's really bad. Ever since Bugenhagen returned from that last trip, he doesn't seem well. Why don't you hurry and see Bugenhagen?"
NPC: Bugenhagen seems rather down ever since he returned from that trip. I'm worried something might happen to Bugenhagen now of all times...
NPC: Mmm...... I can't be standing here talking about the 'Study of Planet Life'. I think I'll be heading back to my homeland now...
"NPC: How about our original cocktail, 'Lifestream'? You should forget your troubles with a drink. We humans sure are weak creatures..."
NPC: That reminds me. I heard that someone here in Cosmo Canyon is selling some Healing Materia.
"Elder Bugah: Live with the planet, die with the planet. Maybe this is the way it should be. Who knows? I'm full of booze... It's when I think about the children. I wonder if we could just save our own children."
Elder Bugah: Where is the Promised Land...? Maybe Bugenhagen knows. Isn't Nanaki starting to notice? The reason why Bugenhagen sent him away from the canyon...
"NPC: Welcome to 'Shindra Inn'. It's times like this a nice, soft bed will do you good. It's 100 Gil a night. Would you like to stay?"
"NPC: Welcome to 'Shildra Inn' As long as there are guests, our lights will always be on. It will be 100 Gil a night, Like a room?"
"NPC: Welcome to 'Shildra Inn' At times like this, when a nice, soft bed will do you good. It will be 100 Gil a night. Would you like a room?"
"NPC: It's not that I'm afraid of that big star. It's just that, uh, I have a stomach ache... That's why I'm not moving. That's the truth!"
"NPC: That Nanaki's slick! He said, 'I'll protect this canyon'! But he didn't. I don't care about Nanaki anymore..."
"Red XIII: Sorry...I'm really sorry. But now, I have......"
NPC: Both Nanaki and Mr.Bugenhagen are gone... I feel so lonely...
"NPC: He's finally come home, but Mr.Bugenhagen doesn't seem well... I want to hear Mr.Bugenhagen's talk with Nanaki like we used to do..."
"NPC: Nanaki, is it true that Mr.Bugenhagen left on a journey? Then that means he's better, right? He IS going to come back soon, right?"
"Red XIII: ...... ...Don't worry. Grandpa will come back floating, saying 'Ho Ho Hoooo' again..."
"NPC: Yea, that's right! 'Ho Ho Hoooo'!"
NPC: It's Ho Ho Hoooo! Ho Ho Hoooo!
"NPC: Hi. Of course, our store's open. No need to fear. I have the 'Study of Planet Life' right here. No, maybe I AM a bit afraid. But, whenever I'm reading 'Study of Planet Life,' I can forget all my fears."
Bugenhagen: Ho Ho Hoooo.
Bugenhagen: ...no time to be humming now. The planet is nearing imminent death. Where is Cloud? Wasn't he with you?
Tifa: That's why we're here... Cloud... Cloud has...
Bugenhagen: I see... Cloud has......
Bugenhagen: It's true that there are several places on the planet where Lifestream is gathered. But most of those places are below the surface where humans cannot reach them. There's only one place An island floating in the Southern Sea...
Bugenhagen: What did you say? I haven't left here in years... No good. I can't remember.
"Bugenhagen: In the Southern Seas I think there was an island where Lifestream is. But even if you find Cloud there... Life's dream is a mass of spiritual energy, and one person alone probably couldn't stand against such an incredible spiritual current..."
Bugenhagen: Ho Ho Hoooo.
"Bugenhagen:...no time to be humming now. The planet is nearing imminent death. But is this perhaps, what the planet wanted? The planet actually wanted to end like this? I don't believe so. Were it not so, you people would still have much to do. And myself too. Come back whenever you are in need of my knowledge."
Bugenhagen: Listening to you and Nanaki speak has made me feel young again. Ho Ho Hoooo. Might sound a little sarcastic.
"Bugenhagen: You are using Shinra materia, as a weapon? Materia is highly dense spiritual energy. A shred of the planet's life. It should not be used as a weapon. We must stop using it... or the planet will become weakened."
Bugenhagen: Ho Ho.......Hoooo. You......? It's been a while...since I've been out. I think I must have...tired myself out a bit.
Bugenhagen: Ahh......don't tell Nanaki. He'll only worry...
Cloud: Huge Materia... It is glowing strangely...
On-screen: The Huge Materia emitted a quiet glow.
Cloud: This color...it's the same color as command Materia.
On-screen: Command Materia Blend
"On-screen: Received ""Master Command"" Materia!"
On-screen: The Huge Materia emitted a gentle glow.
Cloud: This color...it's the same color as magic Materia.
On-screen: Magic Materia Blend
"On-screen: Received ""Master Magic"" Materia!"
On-screen: The Huge Materia emitted a fiery glow.
Cloud: This color...it's the same color as summoned Materia.
On-screen: Summoned Materia Blend
"On-screen: Received ""Master Summon"" Materia!"
On-screen: The Huge Materia emitted a cold glow.
Cloud: Is that... Bahamut...?
"On-screen: ""Bahamut"", ""Neo Bahamut"" Materia glows brightly."
"Elder Hargo: I hope great Bugenhagen will take care and not overexert himself. 'Ho Ho Hoooo.' I may be light, But I'm not as young as Nanaki."
Elder Hargo: Oops. That will only get you angry. You're just like me. Ho ho ho.
"(Upon entering Bugenhagen's house with Red XIII in the party, after defeating Hojo.)Red XIII: Grandfather!!"
Bugenhagen: ...Nanaki...? ...you're still......here?
"Red XIII: I can't leave you like this, grandfather...! It's the duty of my... Seto's son, to guard this canyon and her people..."
"Bugenhagen: ...listen, Nanaki. I think you may already know. If you have any mission in life, it is not to defend this valley. Look at the withering mountain grass. Listen to the warble of the new born chocobo's. Look always to the eternal flow of time which is far greater than the span of a human life. It will teach you more, than staying here in the valley..."
"Bugenhagen: What you will see will eventually become a part of life's dream. For my children...... And for your children...... So please, Nanaki... Go with Cloud... And with your eyes...your ears..."
Red XIII: .........
"Bugenhagen: Ho Ho.......Hoooo. Now, now. Don't look like that. I'm all right. It's a wide world and you must go out and see it... You may even find your life's mate. You never know."
Red XIII: Grandfather......
Bugenhagen: Oh yes...take this along. I think it will look good on you now. Ho Ho......
Cloud: Red XIII... Is Bugenhagen...?
Red XIII: ......
Red XIII: Grandpa told me that he's going away again!
Cloud: Away...?
"Red XIII: It seems like he really liked that Airship. He told me he couldn't stay still and just zipped out of here! He even gave me a gift, look!"
"On-screen: Received ""Limited Moon""!"
Red XIII: Wait a minute. Aren't you supposed to give gifts AFTER you come back? Ha ha......Grandpa sure is strange! Haa...ha ha......ha......
Cloud: Hmm... So maybe we'll run into him again somewhere.
"Red XIII: Yeah... maybe... Thanks, Cloud......"
Cloud: Play the piano......?
"Cloud: ...Now, how did this go?"
Cloud: I've heard this melody somewhere before. Managed to play well...
Cloud: I wonder what...this is...

"NPC: Well then, maybe next time..."
Cloud: This town was supposed to have been burnt down five years ago. What the hell is going on?
"NPC: Sir, don't say such awful things. I was born and raised in this town. What you say never happened."
Tifa: You're lying...
"NPC: EXCUSE ME......That's so rude... If you're going to talk like that to me, I'm going to have to ask you to leave."
"NPC: Oh, I'm so sorry. I've got lots to do..."

"NPC: Nice town, huh? We've been in business here for a long time..."
Cloud: ...You're lying.
NPC: Do you have anything to do with this town?
Cloud: I was here until I was 14 and I don't remember you.

Tifa: I have the sheet music for that song.
Tifa: Huh? Wait a minute! There's something inside the music sheet.
"On-screen: Tifa, what's happened to our town? Was it all an illusion, or just a dream? No, it was neither. I remember trying to get people out of the flames, but not having the strength... Burning with anger, I went to the reactor to kill Sephiroth."
"On-screen: Received ""Final Heaven"""
NPC: How can you shop at a time like this?
"NPC: What? 'Me, in business'? Don't worry, it's all right. I get paid by the company. My real job is to protect the secret of Nibelheim."

Tifa: How bad was your dream?
Aeris: You'll dream about bad things if you sleep in a place like THIS.
Red XIII: ...You don't look good.
"Yuffie: Man, you really WERE having a bad dream! Even I feel bad!"
Cait Sith: Aren't you glad you woke up?
Cid: The air's pretty heavy here. How can you sleep in a place like this?
Vincent: Hmph...a nightmare...? My long sleep has given me time to atone.
Cloud: What are you saying?
Tifa: What's he talking about...?
Cid: What the hell are you saying?
Vincent: I have nothing to say to strangers. Get out.
Vincent: This mansion is the beginning of your nightmare.
Cloud: ...you can say that again.

"Vincent: I see. Then, I'll return to my nightmare..."
Vincent: ...What? More?
"Cloud: Like you said, this mansion is the beginning of a nightmare. No, it's not a dream, it's for real. Sephiroth has lost his mind. He found the secrets hidden in this mansion..."
"Tifa: Just like you said, this mansion is the start of a nightmare... No, not a dream...it's reality. Sephiroth has lost his mind. He found the secrets hidden in this mansion..."
"Cid: It's like you said, this mansion's the beginning of a nightmare. No, it's not a dream, it's the truth. Sephiroth's gone nuts. He found a ton of secrets hidden in this mansion..."
Vincent: Sephiroth!?
Vincent: You know Sephiroth?
Party: You know Sephiroth?
Vincent: You start first.
Cloud: ...That's how it was.
Tifa: ...That's how it was.
Cid: ......That's how it was.
Vincent: So Sephiroth knows he was created five years ago? And about the Jenova Project?
"Vincent: ...He was missing, but has just recently reappeared. He has taken many lives and is seeking the Promised Land."
Party leader: Now it's your turn.
Vincent: Sorry...I cannot speak.
Barret: Hey! You lyin' white-faced!
Tifa: Hmm...I'm disappointed.
Aeris: That's dirty!
Red XIII: What...you're serious?
"Yuffie: Oh, that's okay. It was probably depressing anyway."
"Cait Sith: Hey, that's not right---"
Cid: Good! I'm not in the mood to hear long stories. Let's get the hell outta here!
"Vincent: Hearing your stories, has added upon me yet another sin. More nightmares shall come to me now, more than I previously had. Now...please leave."
Vincent: ...You're still here.
Cloud: At least tell us your name.
Tifa: At least tell us your name.
Cid: At least say your name.
"Vincent: I was with...the Shinra Manufacturing Department in Administrative Research, otherwise known as--the Turks..."
Vincent: Vincent.
Cloud: The Turks!?
Tifa: The Turks!?
Cid: Turks!?
Vincent: Formerly of the Turks. I have no affiliation with Shinra now.
Vincent: ...And you?
"Cloud: Cloud, formerly of SOLDIER."
"Cloud: Former Shinra soldier, Cloud."
Vincent: You were also with Shinra...? Then do you know Lucrecia?
Cloud: Who?
Vincent: .......Lucrecia.
"Tifa: Tifa, formerly of the AVALANCHE."
Vincent: Ex-AVALANCHE...... Then you wouldn't know Lucrecia...
Tifa: Who?
Vincent: .......Lucrecia.
"Cid: Cid, formerly of the Space Program Department."
Vincent: You were also with Shinra...? Then do you know Lucrecia?
Cid: Who?
Vincent: .......Lucrecia.
Cid: No idea.
Vincent: The woman who gave birth to Sephiroth.
Cloud: ...gave birth...? Wasn't Jenova Sephiroth's mother?
Tifa: ...gave birth...? Isn't Jenova Sephiroth's mother?
Cid: ...gave birth...? Isn't Jenova Sephiroth's mother?
"Vincent: That isn't completely wrong, but just a theory. He was born from a beautiful lady. That lady was Lucrecia. She was an assistant to Professor Gast of the Jenova Project. Beautiful...Lucrecia."
Party leader: ...A human experiment?
"Vincent: There was no way to cancel the experiment. I couldn't stop her. That was my sin. I let the one I loved, the one I respected most, face the worst."
Barret: That why you started sleepin' in a box? Gimme a break!
Tifa: So the punishment was sleep? That's weird.
Aeris: So your punishment was to sleep? That's ...kinda weird.
Red XIII: So you slept as punishment? Isn't that strange? That thinking...
Yuffie: OK. Boring story no.1.
Cait Sith: You think that's punishing yourself? You're just sleeping.
Cid: You shouldn't sleep just because of that. Sleep?
Vincent: Let me sleep...
Vincent: Wait! If I go with you will I meet Hojo?
"Cloud: Dunno. But we're after him and Sephiroth. So, I guess sooner or later..."
"Tifa: Hmm, I don't know. But we're going after Hojo and Sephiroth. So, we might......"
Cid: I dunno. But we're going after him and Sephiroth. So there's a good chance...
"Cloud: Yeah, probably..."
Vincent: Lucrecia...
Vincent: All right. I've decided to go with you.
"Barret: W, what?"
Tifa: What? You're coming with us?
Aeris: Sure is a quick change of heart. Huh?
Red XIII: What?
Yuffie: Huh? Oh great just what I needed...
Cait Sith: What?
"Cid: Hey, hold on sleepy. You're pretty damn pushy!"
"Vincent: Being a former Turks, I may be of help to you..."
"Cloud: All right, then."
"Tifa: All right, I understand."
Cid: Alright then.
"NPC: Sorry to get you into this. For me, it's a kinda hobby. But, out of appreciation, let me give you this."
"On-screen: Received ""Yoshiyuki""!"
NPC: I wish you'd take care of it and use it...
NPC: Yes sir. Thank you!
NPC: Excuse me... You don't have enough money.
"NPC: Well then, come by again sometime."
NPC: ...I'm in here.
NPC: There're tons of what look like antique guns. ...I bet the owner of this store was a real gun fanatic.
"NPC: Mmm, I'm so bored. Isn't there anything that can get me excited?"
"NPC: Geeeeez, it's boring! Isn't anything exciting going to happen here?"
NPC: Welcome! This is the Item Shop.
NPC: All gramps does is gaze at that rocket all day long.
NPC: Well he's a man that really loves machinery...
"NPC: This used to be a Shinra base where they used to launch rockets. You saw the leaning rocket, right? That's Shinra No. 26. It never got off the ground though."
"NPC: Because those Shinra creeps locked us up in our houses, we couldn't even watch the rocket lift off. I never thought that my only hobby would be destroyed by that arrogant young Rufus...!"
NPC: It just looms there. That's how the town got its name... 'Shinra No. 26'. Want to look at the rocket with me?
NPC: I get so impressed every time I look at it.
"NPC: Oh, how boring..."
NPC: Better ask the Captain about this town. He's the one in charge of it.
Cloud: Who's the 'Captain'?
"NPC: The Captain was a pilot when Shinra was still interested in their Space Program. He was going to be the world's first astronaut, but there was an accident... Ever since then, he's been wasting his life away here dreaming about going into outer space."
Cloud: Did you see a man in a Black Cape?
NPC: A man in a Black Cape? Nope...don't know a thing about it.
Cloud: Did you see a man in a Black Cape?
NPC: A man in a Black Cape? Nope...don't know a thing about it.
Cloud: Who's the 'Captain'?
"NPC: The Captain was a pilot when Shinra was still interested in their Space Program. He was going to be the world's first astronaut, but there was an accident... Ever since then, he's been wasting his life away here dreaming about going into outer space."
NPC: That rusted out rocket is all that remains of the Shinra's Space Program.
"NPC: Oh, it's you? I heard you and the Captain really made a BANG! I also heard that Rufus was so pissed off he went on a rampage and that no one's been able to get near him!"
NPC: Everyone in this town was a mechanic back when they were planning to launch the rocket.
"NPC: I heard Tiny Bronco broke... That sucks. I was secretly eyeing that thing. Broke, huh? What a drag."
NPC: Welcome to the Shanghai Inn! It's 100 gil a night. Would you like to spend the night?
"NPC: Excuse me. Please don't come in here. Our books and the room keys are in here, so I'll have to ask you to please stay out."
Cloud: The books... Maybe we could find out who's been here?
"NPC: A man with a Black Cape? No, no one like that has ever stayed here."
"NPC: Look, we're all adults here, So I'd appreciate it if you used some discretion."
NPC: Would you like something to drink?
"NPC: Did you meet the Captain already? He's really the town's representative, so you should really talk with him."
"NPC: Cid's had some bad breaks. It's really no one's fault he couldn't go into space. Just bad luck, I guess..."
"NPC: Y'know, I heard Rufus rushed back to headquarters in Midgar..."
NPC: Better ask the Captain about this town. He's the one in charge of it.
Cloud: Who's the 'Captain'?
"NPC: The Captain was a pilot when Shinra was still interested in their Space Program. He was going to be the world's first astronaut, but there was an accident... Ever since then, he's been wasting his life away here dreaming about going into outer space."
Cloud: Did you see a man in a Black Cape?
NPC: A man in a Black Cape? Nope...don't know a thing about it.
Cloud: Did you see a man in a Black Cape?
NPC: A man in a Black Cape? Nope...don't know a thing about it.
Cloud: Who's the 'Captain'?
"NPC: The Captain was a pilot when Shinra was still interested in their Space Program. He was going to be the world's first astronaut, but there was an accident... Ever since then, he's been wasting his life away here dreaming about going into outer space."
NPC: A drink will ease your heart...
NPC: How long's that guy gonna be in the bathroom? I need to go too...
NPC: Hmm. Is it real or fake?
Shera: I'll take care of everything at home. But please take care of the Captain.
"NPC: Shinra's trying to gather the Huge Materia from Corel and Fort Condor. There are four left, and they're transporting them here. I can't stand the thought of them using my rocket for something like this."
"NPC: Shinra's trying to gather the Huge Materia from the Junon Underwater Reactor. There are four left, and they're transporting them here. I can't stand them using my precious rocket for a thing like this."
NPC: There's a bunch of Shinra people here messin' with the rocket... Is my rocket...all right?
"NPC: My, my precious rocket... It's gone."
"NPC: Hmph, I know. No matter how much I look, the rocket's still gone. But I just can't stop it. Just call it an old man's folly if you will."
"NPC: Sorry to get you into this. For me, it's a kinda hobby. But, out of appreciation, let me give you this."
"On-screen: Received ""Venus Gospel""!"
NPC: I wish you'd take care of it and use it...
NPC: Maybe it's time for me to get a new hobby...
NPC: Mmm. You know that Shinra sports car at Cid's house? It might be fun to try and restore that thing...
NPC: Anyways. How 'bout it? Want to look at the rocket with me?
"NPC: It seems like there's a lot happenin' in the outside world, but as long as I got this rocket... I'm satisfied."
"NPC: Oh, how boring..."
"NPC: If things go on like this, then Meteor's just going to smash right into us and kill us all, right? ......I guess that's life?"
NPC: The Shinra serious 'bout launching that piece of crap rocket? But why now...?
"NPC: I get so restless now that the rocket's gone. And now that we can see Meteor clearly, ...I can't stand it."
"NPC: Look up at the sky. The bigger Meteor gets, the less time we have to live."
NPC: What's young President Rufus doing by getting all those mechanics together?
NPC: I still can't believe that piece of crap rocket actually made it into space... I guess the mechanic was a genius.
"NPC: Welcome to the Shanghai Inn! Only 300 gil a night, stay?"
NPC: Would you like a drink?
"NPC: You don't feel comfortable here? Then, every time you look in the sky you see Meteor."
NPC: Would you like something to drink?
"NPC: You don't feel comfortable here? Then, every time you look in the sky you see Meteor."
"NPC: Seems like Palmer of Shinra, Inc. ordered soldiers to restore the rocket..."
"NPC: Even though they failed to blow up Meteor with the rocket, the Shinra haven't given up yet... Looks like they're gathering all the weapons from all their bases and are preparing for a final showdown."
NPC: I heard a rumor that a Shinra airship carrying a secret weapon was attacked by a monster and sunk to the bottom of the sea...
NPC: Meteor's coming toward us!? And I can't even go to the bathroom...!?
"NPC: Even with all this goin' on outside, that guy still won't come out of the bathroom? He must be a damn water tank!?"
"NPC: OK, which is it gonna be? Meteor hits us first, or that guy comes out of the bathroom? I'm not movin' from this spot till I see it with my own eyes."
NPC: Mmmm... I'm starting to see it now...
NPC: Even the rocket launch wasn't all THAT great.
"NPC: Now that one of Shinra's greatest events is over, I guess it's back to the same old boring everyday life again..."
NPC: Is Gramps gonna stay like that even though rocket's gone?
Shera: ...What's going to happen?
"Shera: Now all we have to take care of is Meteor, right? You should be able..."
Shera: Excuse me... ...Please take care of the Captain.
On-screen: Pub[Turtle's Paradise] Publicity Flyers! Notice
"NPC 1: Oh, how exciting. You a friend of my grandson's?"
"NPC 2: No, Gramps! These guy's are creepy! They're runnin' all over the place!"
On-screen: [Turtle's Paradise] No. 6
"NPC: Congrats! You have just found all six flyers for the ""Turtles Paradise""! How wonderful! Now here is your prize, just as we promised!!"
"On-screen: Received ""Power Source""!"
"NPC: Please come again to ""Turtles Paradise""! We're looking forward to seeing you!"
Cloud: ............
Tifa: Phew......
Cid: Well......
Cloud: Whoa!!
Cloud: Can't go through here... That flame would make crispy critters of us in an instant.
Tifa: Eyaaaah!
Tifa: There is no way past this!
"Cid: Damn, that's hot!"
"Cid: I like hot baths, but this is TOO hot!"
"On-screen: ""The Scale of the Sea God"" shines!"
"NPC: Life is just like the flowing of a river. It flows from the large ocean of life, and eventually it returns back to it. Wutai is a historical place. There are some very unusual things here you should see."
"NPC: Materia is like Life. They both come from the large ocean of life, and both must return to it."
"NPC: Alright, alright, alright! I know! On the side of the mountain, right there in your face is Da-chao! I hear you can climb to the top, but since it's dangerous I'd be mighty careful if I were you!"
"NPC: Why Da-chao? Alright, alright, alright! I don't know!"
"NPC: Lord Godo is in this house. He used to be quite strong, but now,all he does is sleep......"
"NPC: She's always getting into fights But in that, she takes after Godo to a tee. Like father like daughter..."
"NPC: That five-storied pagoda over there is called the Pagoda of the Five Mighty Gods... The Five Gods are Power, Speed, Magic, War and Omni, who has the best characteristics of everything. Since ancient times, we in Wutai, have worshipped Da-chao and the Water God. Legend has it that the village has been protected by Da-chao, the Water God, and the Five Mighty Gods. But in the last battle, we didn't fare so well... I guess our beliefs were based on nothing more than legends."
"NPC 1: Well, well. Long time no see. What have you been up to? Let's see...what was your name?"
"NPC 2: No, Gramps! This isn't anyone you know! This is just some stranger who barged into our house!"
"NPC: Hey yo! Welcome! Strike while the iron's hot, I say! We got some of the best blades right out of the furnace!"
"NPC: Listen, I'm sorry about last time. Yuffie told me not to sell anything to you."
"NPC: Hey, hey, welcome! You on a trip? Well, just relax and make yourself at home. Nowadays, thanks to tourism, Wutai's able to get by."
NPC: Seems like the town got really boisterous since you arrived. Did anything happen?
"NPC: Hey. Did you hear? There used to be a Water God here in Wutai. They say the Water God was a huge snake! Now we live in a world filled with Mako. Not many people would believe in something like that now. But some in the world, and here in Wutai, still believe. Believe in the scales of the Water God and in materia that has its power in it."
NPC: We got a lot of different stuff here. Take what you want.
"NPC: I'm sorry. The sign outside says ""Materia"", but there's almost no materia left anywhere in Wutai. Listen, this is just a backwoods town. We don't have much to do with Shinra, and besides... If we had a lot of materia, Wutai would be a much more exciting town, but we don't..."
(Upon talking to the woman walking on the right side of the town.)NPC: Life is like the dew on the leaves of the trees. Whether that planet falls or not is no more than a fleeting glimmer.
"NPC: When that big star bashes into us, both Wutai and Da-chao are going to be dust! Can't we do something?"
NPC: The end is right in front of us... But what can you do about it? Just go on living your life day in and day out...
NPC: Have you ever heard the story of the scales of the Water God? They're not just regular scales. They have special hidden powers. And are impervious to the strongest flames. But of course I don't think they'd stand up to the fire that huge eerie-lookin' Planet's gonna make when it crashes into us...
"NPC 1: Oh, you know lately things have been like that. You can even see the moon in afternoon. Everyone's celebrating."
"NPC 2: No, Gramps! That's a big red planet in the sky! Everyone's scared of it!!"
NPC: Hey yo! Welcome! You aren't tired of my babbling? Great! Then come on in and start buying!
"NPC: This is a weapons store of the hard cores, by the hard cores, and for the hard cores! Come on and take a look, why doncha!?"
"NPC: First the ground started shaking, then that large star...... Yy, you think... It's all over?"
"NPC: Hey. Things look pretty sad around here. With things the way they are in the world I guess there's nothing I can do about it. Running around like a fool won't help matters any. So, we all might as well sit back and have a beer..."
NPC: You're still gonna sit here and buy stuff at a time like this? You're an odd one...
"NPC: And now it's too late to be worrying about materia at this stage of the game... If you see anything you need, buy it."
"NPC: Help me. Help me. Help me...... He's in the pagoda next to Lord Godo. Lord Godo says we're stuck... num, num...... I hope the planet doesn't fall anywhere around here......"
Zack: Hey! This is your food.
"Zack: Oh,here!! Put on this. It smells a little though don't complain."
Zack: You look pretty good with that.
Zack: Well......
Zack: Yo! Old guy! We at Midgar yet?
NPC: Shaddap! You're lucky I even gave you a ride!
Zack: What're you gonna do once we get to Midgar?
Cloud: .........
Zack: I know what I'm gonna do. I got a place I can crash for a while...
"Zack: No wait, the mother lives there, too... Guess that's out..."
Cloud: .........
Zack: Yep...gotta change my plans!
"Zack: Hmm...... No matter what I do, I need some money first..."
"Zack: ...Hey, wanna start a business? But what could we do?"
"Zack: Hey, Cloud. Think there's anything I'd be good at?"
Zack: Hey old guy! What do you think I'd be good at?
NPC: What're you yappin' about? You're still young ain't ya? Young folks should try everything! You gotta pay your dues while you're young. Go out and look for what you really want.
Zack: Try everything... That's easy for him to say...
Zack: HEY! Of course! I got a lot of brains and skill that other guys don't! That settles it! I'm gonna become a mercenary!
NPC: Hey...didn't you even hear a word I said?
Zack: Yeah! Thanks pops!
"Zack: Listen, I'm gonna become a mercenary and that's that. Boring stuff, dangerous stuff, anything for money. I'm gonna be rich!"
"NPC: No, wait...you got it all wrong."
"Zack: So, Cloud? What are YOU gonna do?"
Cloud: u...uhhh......
Zack: Just kidding... I won't leave you hanging like that.
"Zack: ...We're friends, right? Mercenaries, Cloud. That's what you an' me are gonna be. Understand, Cloud?"
Shinra Soldier: What do you want to do with him?
Cloud: ...Ah...ughhhh......
Commander: ...Forget it. Just leave him.
Lunafreya Nox Fleuret:(narrating)For centuries the sacred magic of theDivine Crystalblessed our world and its people.
"Lunafreya:(narrating)But, in time, the promise of its power brought war to our lands."
"Lunafreya:(narrating)Amid the escalating war, Prince Noctis of Lucis had come to Tenebrae to seek healing for a grievous injury. He made the long journey together with his father, King Regis."
"Lunafreya:(narrating)Mother, brother, and I, the royalty of Tenebrae, had all welcomed their visit."
"Lunafreya:(narrating)It was then that the fires came, everywhere and all at once."
"Lunafreya:(narrating)In a mere instant, the whole of Tenebrae was ablaze."
Ravus Nox Fleuret:Mother!
Regis Lucis Caelum:General Glauca.
Luna:(narrating)The Niflheim attack was an attempt on the lives of the visiting Lucian royalty.
"Ravus:Please, help us! King Regis!"
Noctis Lucis Caelum:Luna!
"Lunafreya:(narrating)From that day until this day, Tenebrae has been gripped in the iron fist of Niflheim, sworn enemy of Lucis."
"Libertus Ostium:What's the hold-up, Crowe?"
Crowe:(into earpiece)Almost there...
Pelna Khara:Lucis isn't paying us refugees enough for this!
Pelna:How is this fair?
"Pelna:Nyx, I owe you one."
Nyx:You and everyone else.
"Nyx:I'm on my way. Pelna, fall back and regroup with the others."
"Pelna:Go easy on the magic, hero. You got people waiting for you back home."
Nyx:I'm worth the wait.
"Luche:(over radio)Watch your back, Libertus. We got more incoming."
Libertus:We ain't gonna last much longer. Crowe!
"Luche:(over radio)All Glaives, fall back. Repeat, all Glaives fall back!"
Niflheim Man:Release the daemon.
Captain Drautos:(over radio)We can't take down that daemon. I'm ordering a full retreat. Get back here alive. That's an order. For hearth and home.
"Glaive:(over radio)All units, fall back to the extraction point. Support is inbound."
Luche:Nyx! We have to get out of here. Nyx! We have orders!
Girl's Voice:(memory)Help!
"Nyx:Oh, that idiot."
"Pelna:Crowe, we gotta move."
Libertus:You gotta be kidding me.
"Libertus:Whoa, whoa, whoa! You know I ain't got the stomach for this crap."
"Captain Drautos:Luche, report."
"Luche:The imperial forces look to be withdrawing, sir."
Libertus:Guess I owe you another one.
"Nyx:I'll put it on your tab. You just try and get some rest, alright?"
Captain Drautos:You disobeyed a direct order to retreat.
"Nyx:""For hearth and home,"" right, sir? As long as I got strength in my body, I obeythatorder."
"Captain Drautos:Don't fool yourself, Nyx Ulric. Whatever strength you have is on loan from the king. You are nothing without him. Await details of your reassignment."
"Captain Drautos:Yes, Your Majesty. Despite their victory all but assured."
King Regis:A sudden and inexplicable retreat.
"Clarus Amicitia:We are at risk nonetheless, Your Majesty. We cannot know when they will strike again."
"Man:Your Majesty, word from the West Gate. A man claiming to be an envoy of the Empire requests an audience."
"Man:(voice over)The envoy from Niflheim awaits without, Your Majesty."
"???:Hello there. Hello! Good day to you...and you. Well met, my dear Lucians."
"King Regis:Has Niflheim grown so bold that they send the chancellor himself as envoy? And under no guard, at that?"
"Chancellor Izunia:It is an honor to be recognized by the great King Regis! Yet, permit me to stand on ceremony and introduce myself nonetheless."
"Chancellor Izunia:Ardyn Izunia, chancellor of Niflheim, at your humble service. And I come to you on this most auspicious of days to offer terms of peace."
"Chancellor Izunia:As you no doubt surmised, that recent maneuver of ours was no strategic retreat. Call it..."
"Chancellor Izunia:A gesture of imperial goodwill. Like you, we wish nothing more than to bring a swift end to this senseless war."
King Regis:Is that so?
"Chancellor Izunia:It is, indeed. And we require but a singular compliance: save your grand Insomnia here, Lucis must forfeit all territories to Niflheim rule."
"Chancellor Izunia:Ah, Insomnia! The jewel in the crown of the Lucian kingdom. How foolish of me to forget. There is just one more trivial thing. It concerns your son. The fetching Prince Noctis of Lucis and the fair Princess Lunafreya of Tenebrae...they are to be wed. You seem vexed, Your Highness. I assure you, the princess still holds you in the highest regard as she has done all these twelve long years."
"Petra:Do yourself a favor, take a look around. This is what a hundred years of peace looks like. It's a lasting peace made by the Wall and the Wall alone."
"Petra:See, we don't need any of you immigrants jumping around, playing war hero."
"Libertus:Hey! Rough day on the gate, huh, Glaive?"
Crowe:You jerk! It's your fault he got stuck there!
Nyx:Not a very nice welcome for a big hero.
"Crowe:Not a very nice outfit for one, either."
Nyx:I think it brings out my eyes.
"Crowe:Hey, Libertus. You thank Nyx for saving your life yet?"
"Libertus:Oh, come on, Crowe. Nyx and I are too close for that. He helps me, I help him. That's the way it's always been."
"Nyx:Looks like you got a little help from something else, huh?"
Libertus:I need all I can get.
Pelna:For hearth!
Glaives:(together)And home.
"Pelna:So, Nyx the Gatekeeper. How's the new post treating you?"
"Nyx:Oh, it's amazing. You guys would love it. The gate watch are real sweethearts."
"Pelna:Ha-ha-ha. Yeah, right. We all know they hate us outsiders more than anything. So bored they got nothing better to do."
"Nyx:Boredom's not so bad. Means there's peace, at least. I'd fight a hundred more wars for Galahdans to know boredom."
Pelna:Fight all you want. Just don't go dying yet. I still owe you. Alot.
Libertus:Where would the Glaive be without its hero?
"Crowe:Can you not talk like this while we're drinking, please? Besides, we just sent the Niffs running with their tails between their legs, right?"
"Luche:They weren't running from us. No, they were toying with us."
"Nyx:Stop being such a buzzkill, Luche. We all know what happened."
"Luche:Well, did you know they sent an envoy to the Citadel after that?"
Libertus:What for? To offer their surrender?
Luche:More like demand ours.
"Libertus:""Demand?"" My ass!"
Luche:No? Think about it. The Empire's got Lucis on its last legs. It's the perfect time to make demands.
"Council Member 1:We are losing this war, Your Majesty. Lucis cannot rely on the Kingsglaive alone. Accepting the truce may be our best course of action."
"Council Member 2:You speak of matters beyond the New Wall. We have no need of a truce here, so long as it stands. And, if our position worsens, we still have the Old Wall."
"Council Member 3:Yes, but this truce will end the fighting altogether. If only we could compromise--"
"Clarus:Compromise is unwise. We know nothing of Niflheim's true intentions. Do not fool yourselves, The Walls are far from impenetrable."
"Clarus:Then let the choice be made, Your Majesty. What are we to protect?"
"Girl's Voice:(memory)Help, mother!"
"Libertus:How come you never lose your lunch like that? Just doesn't add up. Here's this ancient art, secret of the royal family and all that."
"Crowe:Libertus! Nyx! Come here, guys, you gotta see this."
"News Anchor:(on TV)Things were hectic in the capital today as the Lucian government announced full acceptance of what some are criticizing as the unilateral peace terms proposed by Chancellor Izunia of Niflheim. The signing of the truce will see governing power over all Lucian territories transferred to the Empire, with the sole exception of Insomnia. In return, Niflheim guarantees the continued safety of Insomnia and its citizenry, as well as a cessation to all hostilities, bringing a decisive end to this long and bitter war."
Crowe:All that fighting we did. All for nothing.
Captain Drautos:Glaives. Assemble in the briefing room.Now.
"Captain Drautos:The king has spoken, and you have heard. All lands beyond the Wall are to be relinquished to the Empire."
Luche:Will no regions be spared?
"Libertus:But your home's out there, too!"
Captain Drautos:It is.
Libertus:Why would the king do this?
Captain Drautos:Because it'll end this damn war. Crowe.
Captain Drautos:Prepare to deploy. You're being sent to infiltrate Tenebrae.
"Crowe:Tenebrae, sir?"
"Captain Drautos:Mission details are classified. Report to my office for briefing in thirty minutes. And, Nyx: you're off the West Gate. You've been reassigned to the castle guard. That is all."
"Libertus:So, this is what you were talking about, Luche?"
Luche:You heard the captain. This wasn't our decision to make.
Libertus:Not ours to make? Those are our homes out there! Our people! And you're just gonna go along with this and abandon them?
"Luche:If we don't go along with them, the Empire will unleash all hell on Insomnia."
Libertus:We'll unleash it right back at them!
"Nyx:Easy, easy. He's not the enemy."
"Tredd:Don't you get it? We're nothing to them. Rats, snuck in from beyond the Wall. Sure, they had a use for us when they realized we could work their magic. So they handpicked us out from all the other rats out there and just let us nibble away at His Royal Majesty's precious power. But, as soon as this war's all over, it's back to the sewers for all of us. That means you too, hero. You missing home so much, Libertus, why don't you and Nyx head on back? I'm sure Niflheim will welcome you with open arms."
"Nyx:You've got a home out there, too! Or did you forget?"
Libertus:Ugh! Damn it! I'm not gonna let it end like this!
"Council Member 1:It is said sentiment amongst the people is favorable, Your Majesty. Most all will welcome this peace."
"King Regis:If you yourself have not heard their voices, how can you claim to know their hearts?"
"Council Member 2:What of the mission to Tenebrae, Your Majesty? Is such clandestine action wise? If discovered, it will only serve to provoke the Empire."
"Clarus:The Empire remains our enemy until the treaty is signed. So long as we are at war, His Majesty intends to remain one step ahead of them."
Council Member 2:Of course.
Nyx:A hairpin? I didn't think you were into that kind of thing.
"Crowe:It's not for me, it's a gift for the princess. But keep that quiet, nobody's supposed to know."
"Crowe:Well, that's me."
Nyx:Watch your back out there.
"Libertus:I know you're sick of hearing it, but you're like a little--"
"Crowe:(interrupting)Little sister to you. Yeah, I am sick of hearing it."
"Libertus:Just make sure you come back in one piece, all right?"
Crowe:Says the guy in two pieces.
"Maria:Lady Lunafreya, I have left the rear gate open."
Lunafreya:Thank you.
Maria:Must you go?
Maria:Then go quickly!
"Ravus:I do not recall granting you permission to leave your quarters, Lunafreya."
Ravus:You are not to leave this room again until the journey to Lucis. It is for your own good.
Lunafreya:My own good? What is truly going on here? What cause does the Empire have to see me wed to Noctis?
"Ravus:They have offered a peace, and your marriage is the olive branch."
Lunafreya:You expect me to believe that?
Ravus:What you believe does not concern me. What does concern me is you sneaking off to go and tell our mother's killer about some plot you've dreamt up.
"Lunafreya:You are wrong to hate King Regis. Niflheim killed mother, not him. They murdered her and made you their lapdog."
Driver:It's done.
"News Anchor:(on TV)An air of jubilation has swept the city in anticipation of the coming armistice. With only three days remaining until the peace is officially signed into effect, throngs of citizens have taken to the streets to show..."
"King Regis:(memory)Lucis needs your strength, young warriors."
Petra:(memory)We don't need any of you immigrants.
Captain Drautos:(memory)Whatever strength you have is on loan from the king. You are nothing without him.
"Girl's Voice:(memory)Nyx, help mother!"
"Young Nyx:(memory)Selena, get down!"
News Anchor:(on TV)...And the waves of Imperial diplomats entering the city.
King Regis:The princess? Are you certain?
"Messenger:Yes, Your Majesty. She was amongst the last of the Imperial contingent to enter the city."
Captain Drautos:Get in.
"Nyx:I'm reporting to my post now though, sir."
"Captain Drautos:New orders. Come on, we've got a princess to pick up."
"Nyx:Nice ride, sir."
Captain Drautos:It belongs to the prince. We've taken him outside the city.
"Nyx:Doesn't he have a wedding to plan, sir?"
"Captain Drautos:Cut the ""sir"" crap. The king has a plan of his own. Prince Noctis and Princess Lunafreya are to meet far from Insomnia."
"Nyx:What's she doing here, then?"
Captain Drautos:Complicating things. We sent Crowe to find the princess and escort her out of Tenebrae. We're still trying to figure out what went wrong.
"Captain Drautos:So, I know what you think about this war, but what do you think about this peace? You happy giving up your home?"
Nyx:It's the king's decision. I owe him for taking me in. I was lucky. There are people in Galahd who weren't. And they need me.
"Captain Drautos:So you're going back? What good will you be without the king's magic? Yeah, always wanting to save somebody. I get it, believe me. But it doesn't win wars."
Nyx:It's not just wanting. It's not just me. Libertus is the one you need to worry about. He'll go back if things get worse.
Captain Drautos:The worst is yet to come.
"Escort:Do you have any idea who you're stopping? Open this gate now, and maybe you'll have a job tomorrow."
Petra:King's orders.
"Escort:Are you sure you want to risk a diplomatic issue now, of all times? I am the personal escort of Lady Lunafreya Nox Fleuret, Princess of the former Tenebrae and the Or--"
"Captain Drautos:(interrupting)And our kingdom's beloved bride-to-be. Welcome to sovereign jurisdiction, Ambassador. We'll take care of things from here."
"Diplomat:Forgive me, Captain Drautos."
"Captain Drautos:(crosstalk, to Nyx)See Her Highness to the castle."
Diplomat:(crosstalk)I had no idea that you-- I wasn't made aware of any--
Nyx:Excuse me. Thank you.
"Diplomat:(crosstalk)No, you-- I must-- I must-- no, I have to clear it with my superiors first."
Nyx:(to Lunafreya)Your Highness.
"Messenger:Her Royal Highness, Princess Lunafreya of Tenebrae."
"Lunafreya:It has been a long time, Your Majesty."
King Regis:Yes. Far too long.
"Lunafreya:Prince Noctis isn't here, is he?"
"King Regis:No, my dear. He is not. I am too old to fight this war. I have no choice but to receive the Empire and accept their treaty. Even so...I had hoped to hold the wedding elsewhere, somewhere safe. I sent one of my Glaive to see you there, but--"
"King Regis:It is not too late. I can ready an escort. Please, go to my son."
"Lunafreya:No. Wherever I go, the Empire will follow. It would only place the prince in greater danger. It is my duty to protect the prince and see his destiny fulfilled. These twelve years have not changed that."
King Regis:And what of your destiny?
"Lunafreya:My duty is my destiny, Your Majesty. I'm prepared to accept whatever may come to pass."
"Man 1:So, what do you think? All these lands will be imperial soon. Reckon things will get better when them Niffs start calling the shots?"
"Man 2:Not one damn bit. Don't matter who's calling the shots: as long as they're calling them from behind the Wall, ain't nothing gonna change around here."
Man 2:(off-screen)Get over here!
Man 2:That's a hand!
Captain Drautos:I trust the reunion was a happy one?
Nyx:Has she been a hostage of Niflheim all this time?
"Captain Drautos:She's a symbol of the peace, that's all I'm told."
Nyx:Doesn't sound like it. Sounds like she's here for something much bigger than that.
Captain Drautos:Your orders are to protect her.
"Captain Drautos:Not to look, not to listen, not to think. Understood?(answering)Drautos. Yes, report."
"Libertus:Get the hell out of my way! That's my friend you got in there, damn it!"
"Medic:Sir, you can't go in until the examination has ended."
Libertus:What examination? What the hell's going on?
"Nyx:Hey! Hey, take it easy, big guy."
Libertus:These bastards rushed Crowe in there the moment she got back. And now they won't let me in to see her.
Captain Drautos:Crowe's personal effects. Do with them as you see fit.
"Libertus:So, what kind of mission did you really send her on? No Glaive winds up dead on a standard escort."
"Captain Drautos:I'll see the armistice does not interfere with a full investigation. She was a good soldier, her death will not go unanswered."
"Libertus:What a life, huh? She was brought up an orphan. Run out of her village. I still remember the first time I saw her. Scrawny little thing, all covered in dirt. Not a friend in the world. But those eyes...damn. There was something about those eyes. She deserved better. And I would've done anything to give it to--"
"Nyx:Libertus, wait. Crowe died a Glaive. You can still honor her by fighting as one."
"Libertus:You're dumber than me sometimes, you know that? Don't you get it? Lucis killed Crowe. Go back to the castle! Tell the king there's no peace to be had from throwing the weak to the wolves. I'll fight my own fight from here on out. See you around, hero."
Nyx:(memory)A hairpin? I didn't think you were into that kind of thing.
Crowe:(memory)It's not for me. It's a gift for the princess.
"Emperor Aldercapt:A most grand reception, King Regis. You honor all of Niflheim."
"King Regis:Oh, the honor is ours, Emperor Aldercapt. You have ventured far to grace us with your presence."
Emperor Aldercapt:It was the very least I could do. Tomorrow will be an historic day for both our nations. And your Insomnia is truly a marvel. My own cities pale in comparison. I pray we are able to take away much...from this visit.
Lunafreya:Hello. I'm afraid we were never properly introduced yesterday.
"Nyx:I'm afraid it's going to have to wait, Your Highness. I'm on guard duty."
Lunafreya:Then surely there's no safer place for me to be. May I ask your name?
"Nyx:Uh, Nyx. Nyx Ulric."
"Lunafreya:There is something else I wish to ask you, Nyx Ulric. King Regis said he sent one of your order to come find me. I should like to offer my thanks in person. Where might I find this brave soldier?"
"Lunafreya:Oh. Oh, I did not--I am so sorry."
Nyx:Don't be.
Nyx:Here. She was carrying this. It was meant for you.
Lunafreya:For me?
Nyx:Keep it. She would've wanted you to have it.
Lunafreya:I will carry it with me always. Thank you.
Pruvia:Do you have any idea what this peace means? It means our homes are gone. All of them. Forever.
Libertus:Heard I could find some treaty haters here. I come to the right place?
Pruvia:You certainly have. Everyone say hello to a man who spends his days in the loyal service of our good king.
"Libertus:""Spent."" Those days are over. I'm done listening to that bastard's lies. He may sit on a throne, but he ain't no king, least not of mine."
"Pruvia:Well, then. Welcome to the resistance, brother. I hope you're here to talk."
Libertus:What do you wanna know?
"Lunafreya:Please, wherever Noctis is, keep him safe. That's all I ask."
"General Glauca:To what god do you pray? You, the slave of fate and destiny. Abandon your prayers - the gods do not listen."
Lunafreya:General Glauca. Why are you here?
General Glauca:You are far too clever to have ever believed in this peace. Pity you couldn't see your beloved Noctis. You have another purpose.
Lunafreya:I'm not here for Niflheim.
General Glauca:No. You are here for me.
Lunafreya:You? I do not understand.
"General Glauca:Come tomorrow, you will."
Man:(over intercom)Niflheim contingent has left the hotel. Less than three hours until the ceremony. Bolster the Citadel guard.
"Pelna:(over radio)Nyx, is the princess with you?"
"Nyx:No, I'm on duty at the Citadel."
"Pelna:(over radio)Well, the Niffs just left for the ceremony, and she wasn't with them."
Pelna:(over radio)A homing beacon?
"Nyx:Yeah, I'll send the coordinates now. Can you pinpoint a location for me?"
"Pelna:(over radio)Sure, but it sounds like a wild-goose chase. Guess you got some free time on your hands, huh?"
"Nyx:Guess I do, for better or worse."
Pelna:(over radio)Those coordinates are about twenty miles south of Insomnia.
Nyx:Outside the Wall.
Pelna:(over radio)What the hell was Crowe doing all the way out there?
"Nyx:No, no. They sent her to-- I need another favor, Pelna. Pull those coordinates up on the radar and let me know what you find."
"Pelna:(over radio)On it. You're thinking this is all a big deal now, huh?"
"Nyx:Yeah, too big to ignore."
"Guard 1:(cross-talk)Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Excuse me, sir. Excuse me!"
"Guard 2:(cross-talk)Hey, hey, hey!"
"Guard 3:(cross-talk)Whoa, wait a minute! Stop right there!"
"Petra:Listen up. This is not the gate watch. This is the heart of our city, the home of our king. The ceremony must not be disturbed. Neutralize any threat quickly and quietly. Is that understood?"
"Crownsguard:(together)Yes, sir!"
"Nyx:Glaive to command. Are you there, captain? Urgent. Damn it, Drautos!"
"Pelna:(over radio)Jackpot, Nyx. There's a whole fleet of airships sitting at that spot."
"Pelna:(over radio)Yup, and, from the looks of it, I'd say they're headed to war."
Nyx:Where's the captain?
Pelna:(over radio)Should be at the Citadel.
Nyx:There's no answer on his frequency.
"Pelna:(over radio)I don't know, must have his hands full with the escort detail."
"Nyx:Pelna, one last favor. I need you to prep the Glaive for action."
Pelna:(over radio)What- what are you talking about? You wanna deploy without the captain's order?
Nyx:Trust me. Just get it done.
"Pelna:(over radio)Wait, what am I supposed to tell--?"
"Crownsguard:Stand down, Glaive."
Clarus:The ceremony is in less than two hours. We must make ready.
King Regis:Very well.
"Messenger:Your Majesty. A man of the Kingsglaive is here, sire. He demands an audience."
"Nyx:Your Majesty, please."
Nyx:Give the order to deploy the Glaive.
Nyx:A Niflheim fleet makes ready for war twenty miles to the south.
Clarus:An imperial fleet.
Nyx:And they have the princess.
"King Regis:Clarus, post guards outside the treaty room."
Clarus:It will be seen as a lack of faith in the peace.
King Regis:Which we all harbor. See it done. We may well have to take Emperor Aldercapt into custody.
Clarus:Detain him? That would go beyond a new declaration of war.
"King Regis:We are still at war, Clarus. And you, Nyx Ulric. How soon can the Kingsglaive deploy?"
"Nyx:On your word, at once."
"King Regis:Go, then! Save Luna."
Glaive:What if this is a diversion?
"Nyx:Not likely. Tenebrae's princess is on board. We've got two jobs: save her, and stop those Niff ships from flying on Insomnia."
"Luche:We go in teams. Standard infiltrate and extract. Nyx, you command. We'll follow. The Glaive stands together, captain or no. For hearth."
Kingsglaive:(together)And home!
News Anchor:(on TV)We are less than twenty minutes away from the signing of this historic treaty.
"Captain Drautos:(over radio)I received word of the king's order to deploy. I'll see to matters in the city. You have your mission, and it won't be easy. The objective is two-fold: secure the hostage, and stay the enemy advance. Just be careful. One Glaive already died for this princess. Niflheim won't give her up easily."
Nyx:(over radio)Team two.
"Pelna:(over radio)Oh, man. Hurry up, Nyx!"
Pelna:Over here!
Nyx:(into earpiece)Preparing to head below deck.
Captain Drautos:(over radio)Do not engage the enemy until instructed. The ceremony is underway. Let's wait and see how Niflheim plays this.
"Man:The Kingsglaive have infiltrated the ships, so everything's going according to plan."
Nyx:Ulric reporting. Six Niflheim airships confirmed inbound for Insomnia.
"Pelna:(into earpiece)Nyx, this doesn't feel like a war fleet."
Pelna:(into earpiece)I think I might've found her. I got a guarded door here. Two Niff MTs. What's the plan?
Nyx:(into earpiece)Hold position.(to Drautos)Arrived at destination. High possibility of target in the vicinity.
Captain Drautos:(over radio)Proceed to secure.
Nyx:(into earpiece)It's going to mean a fight.
Captain Drautos:(over radio)Keep it quiet and keep it confined.
"Nyx:(into earpiece)Pelna, you're clear to engage, but keep it quiet. I'm on my way."
King Regis:Forgive my delay. A bit of unforeseen trouble.
"Emperor Aldercapt:Nothing too vexing, I hope."
"King Regis:A simple theft, nothing more."
"Emperor Aldercapt:A daring thief, to steal from the king. Perhaps magical walls and castle gates do not keep all things safe."
King Regis:Perhaps. But no matter. That which was taken will soon be returned.
Emperor Aldercapt:Impressive. You are a paragon of kingly composure. But I must ask: how can you be so sure?
King Regis:Because this thing is no mere trinket. It possesses a will all its own. Enough to break any thief's grasp.
Emperor Aldercapt:Hm. That sounds a very fine prize indeed...
"Pelna:Not now, damn it."
"Pelna:For me? Aw, you shouldn't have.(into earpiece)Target confirmed. She's unharmed."
"Clarus:The Glaives have recovered the princess, Your Majesty."
Emperor Aldercapt:Have you found your thief?
King Regis:We have. And what was stolen remains intact.
Emperor Aldercapt:Joyous news. I am relieved to hear it.
"King Regis:Tell me, how heavy a sentence does the crime of theft carry in your Empire?"
Emperor Aldercapt:Among the heaviest. Although there is one exception.
Luche:Things are about to get ugly over here.
"Nyx:Pelna, get out of there! It's a trap!"
King Regis:What is that?
Emperor Aldercapt:A curious old law I still permit in the outlands: a thief who escapes his captor can no longer be held to account for his crime.
"King Regis:A warning to the victim? ""Never show weakness, lest you forgo the hand of justice."""
"Emperor Aldercapt:Oh, no, good king. Far from it."
News Anchor:(on TV)The treaty is now on the table. The countdown begins to this historical moment.
Emperor Aldercapt:It is a warning to the hand of justice itself never to loose its grip.
"Petra:Unit one, secure the perimeter. Unit two, stand your ground!"
"Pelna:One Tenebrae princess, safe and--"
Nyx:Come on!
Petra: The Crystal! They're after the Crystal!
Glaive:There's something going on below deck. The ship's not going to make it to Insom--
Nyx:What's going on?
Captain Drautos:(over radio)Insomnia is under attack.
Nyx:Who brought you here?
Lunafreya:General Glauca.
Nyx:You were bait. Us coming here was all part of their plan.
Nyx:Target secured. Request permission to withdraw.
Captain Drautos:(over radio)Granted. Get to--
King Regis:The Crystal will not serve you.
Emperor Aldercapt:Nor you once I take it from this accursed city.
Ravus:(to himself)It's not the Crystal I'm here for.
Lunafreya:The Wall. It's gone.
"Nyx:Fall back, it's a trap!"
Nyx:What the hell is going on?
Glaive 2:What's got into you?
"Clarus:Come, we must escape while we can."
"King Regis:No, Clarus. I fear escape is no longer an option."
King Regis:General Glauca.
Nyx:Can you make it up? Can you stand?
Nyx:What are you doing? You gotta be kidding me.
Nyx:They teach piloting back at the royal academy? Give me that.
"Clarus:It's been a long time since I fought at your side, old friend."
"King Regis:Yes, but this time it is not your fight. If you wish to leave, go now."
"Clarus:And abandon my king? I think not. Besides, our magic is bound to you. If you fall, Lucis falls."
"King Regis:Then let us once more into the fray, old friend."
Lunafreya:You must take me back to King Regis.
Nyx:Are you out of your mind? Insomnia's a war zone.
Lunafreya:I have a duty. I cannot neglect it.
"Nyx:Yeah, I heard all that before."
Lunafreya:Then you know we must hurry.
Nyx:Hurry to do what? Get yourself killed?
Lunafreya:I do not fear death.
"Nyx:Oh, enough with all this brave princess act! Just pray this thing will make the trip."
"Chancellor Izunia:Well, I daresay everything has proceeded according to plan. No?"
Emperor Aldercapt:So it has. We have broken the Wall. All that remains is to break the city.
"Chancellor Izunia:Shall we take our leave, then? The sun will soon set. We need not be here to witness the terrors of the night."
Lunafreya:The Crystal.(to Nyx)You're going too fast. We have to land.
"Nyx:Yeah, you're gonna have to give me a minute on that."
Lunafreya:There is no time. I will go on my own.
Nyx:What? You got wings underneath that dress? You can't use magic.
Lunafreya:Not all miracles are made by magic. I do not fear death. What I fear is doing nothing and losing everything.
"Nyx:Oh, come on!"
"Nyx:You can thank magic for that miracle, Your Highness."
Pruvia:The reckoning is at hand. Dawn of a new age.
King Regis:You have the Crystal. What more would you take from me?
"Ravus:The Ring of the Lucii. I lost my mother, my country, my birthright. Niflheim was the only life left to me. But all of that was for this. The Ring belongs to me now."
"Ravus:Hear me, Lucian kings of old, for I am Ravus Nox Fleuret, and none is more worthy of your power than I!"
Lunafreya:Look out!
"King Regis:Quickly, through here."
Lunafreya:Your Majesty.
Nyx:You knew this was coming--
Lunafreya:Yes. But it was the only way to draw their wrath from Noctis.
Nyx:Is that the way of our king? Sacrifice Lucian sons to save his own?
Lunafreya:To save the world.
"King Regis:See Luna safely to Altissia. This is not an order from a king to his Glaive. This is a plea from one man to another. Please, Nyx Ulric, keep her safe. For the future of all."
Nyx:The future?
"King Regis:Here, take this. It is time it passed to another's keeping."
"Lunafreya:No, please. Stop!"
Nyx:Get back!
"Lunafreya:Please, don't leave us!"
King Regis:I know your mother would wish the same as me. That you and Noctis live happily. All those years captive because I failed you. Not again. Locked doors will seal your fate no longer.
Lunafreya:King Regis...
"King Regis:Our hope goes with you now, Nyx Ulric. Godspeed."
"General Glauca:Behold, the king of Lucis, who hoarded tranquility within his precious Walls. Where is your tranquility now, king? Here is your peace, by steel's swift descent."
Lunafreya:No! We must get away from here. It is what your king wanted.
"General Glauca:(over radio, as narration)Lady Lunafreya has escaped with the Ring. Find her at once. She is not to leave the city."
"Nyx:(into earpiece)Ulric to command. Come in, captain."
"News Anchor:(on TV)Footage of the perpetrators was captured by a nearby surveillance camera. Here are images of the six suspects. One has been identified as Galahdian refugee, Libertus Ostium, a former member of the Lucian Kingsglaive."
"Libertus:Hey, come here. Come here. I got you, I got you. You're all right. You're okay."
Pruvia:It's fine. We're free. We're free now.
"Libertus:We're free? What do you mean, ""we're free?"""
Pruvia:The Empire. They promised. This district is ours. All the refugees. It's our new home.
Libertus:The Empire? You went in with Niflheim?
"Pruvia:Here. Take this. Meet up with the others. You're the hero of our revolution, brother."
Nyx:Damn it!
Tredd:This guy just doesn't know when he's beat.
Nyx:Can you drive?
Nyx:I'll be right back!
"Tredd:No warping for you this time, hero."
Nyx:Give me the wheel. Go!
Lunafreya:You are without your magic.
"Nyx:You noticed that, huh? It must have died with the king."
"Petra:(over intercom)You're making a mess of my city, Glaive. I thought I told you not to go playing hero. Leave the ship to me. Looks like you got a royal fare to see to."
Nyx:Move it!
Nyx:Maybe not all miracles are made by magic.
"Nyx:Oh, great."
Nyx:What the hell did you do to piss these things off?
Lunafreya:It's not me they're after. It's the Ring.
Nyx:What's so special about this Ring? Don't tell me the future's really riding on it.
Lunafreya:He who wears the Ring communes with the Lucii and commands great power.
Nyx:What kind of power?
Lunafreya:A forbidden one. Sealed within the Ring long ago.
Nyx:The Old Wall. I thought that was just a bedtime story.
Lunafreya:I can assure you it is not. But the Lucii grant their power only to those they deem worthy.
"Nyx:So, that guy who tried it on back there, I guess he wasn't deemed worthy."
Lunafreya:That was my brother. These twelve years have changed Ravus. He is bound by the past and lost in his lust for power.
Nyx:How the hell did they find us?
"Nyx:Your hairpin, they're tracking it. Give it to me."
Nyx:I had a little sister once. She was killed when the Empire came. I couldn't save her. I was as helpless then as I am now. I couldn't show her the future she wanted.
Lunafreya:True power is not something that is found by those who seek it. It is something that comes to those who deserve it. Your sister wanted you to see a future as well. Anyone would wish the same for family they love.
"Nyx:You don't pull any punches, do you?"
Nyx:I'm over here!
"Captain Drautos:(over radio)Do you hear me? Repeat, this is Drautos. Can you hear me? Over."
"Nyx:Your timing's impeccable, captain. If the Lucii are real, they sure don't seem to mind their city getting torn apart."
Captain Drautos:(over radio)You're to rendezvous and regroup. Understood?
"Nyx:That might not be so easy, captain. My wings have been clipped, in case you didn't know."
Captain Drautos:(over radio)Ulric. Are you all right?
"Nyx:I'm not dead, if that's what you mean, sir."
Captain Drautos:(over radio)Head for Section D as soon as you can. I'll have an evacuation team ready.
Nyx:Don't suppose you could meet me at the gate. I'd kind of like to get the hell out of this city.
"Captain Drautos:(over radio)Imperials hold all exits, there's no way through. I'll meet you at Section D. Cut all radio contact until then. And make sure you get there."
"Nyx:It's a date, sir."
Libertus:Ain't no turning back now.
Man 1:(over radio)Status report.
Man 2:(over radio)Ulric killed some good men.
Man 1:(over radio)What about the Ring?
Man 2:(over radio)We don't have it yet.
General Glauca:(over radio)This is Glauca. King Regis is dead. The Ring is on its way to Section D. We must recover the Ring to realize our goal.
"General Glauca:(over radio)If Ulric or the princess get in the way, take them out. Reclaim our hearth and home."
"Libertus:""Hearth and home?"""
"Man 3:(over walkie-talkie frequency)Libertus, come in. Where are you? Are you all right?"
Libertus:I'm fine. On the way back to base now.
"Man 3:(over radio)We need you to head to the junction in Section D. We're gonna join up with another unit and make a clean sweep of the place. We're one step away from realizing this revolution. Let's not let Pruvia's death be in vain. We'll be waiting for you, hero."
"Nyx:Don't move until I say it's safe, all right?"
Lunafreya:I won't.
"Nyx:Ulric, reporting! I have the princess! She's alive and well!"
Nyx:Get out of here!
"Luche:You've got some fight in you, Nyx, I'll give you that."
Nyx:Run! Now!
Luche:I can't believe you're still moving with that hollow point in you. All Crowe could do was scream when one tore her insides apart.
Nyx:Why'd you do it?
Luche:Because the Kingsglaive is nothing! An old man's battle fodder sent to die in Insomnia's war while our homes are bound and shackled.
Nyx:Niflheim took your home. Took all our homes! Nothing will ever change that.
Luche:You never were too smart. You could've had a new future with the Empire.
"Luche:There's nowhere to run, princess. The Ring, give it to me."
Luche:So many dead over so simple a thing. But why? For what?
"Lunafreya:Power. Untold power, beyond the control of someone like you."
Nyx:Captain.
"Drautos/Glauca:It's over. The daemons are unleashed, Lucis is fallen. Surrender the Ring."
"Nyx:Plan on giving those kings a piece of your mind, princess? You got a destiny to take care of here, remember? Besides, didn't anyone tell you? I'm the hero around here."
"Nyx:Show yourselves, kings of Lucis!"
"Nyx:How long will you do nothing whilst Insomnia burns? Old or New, or whatever it is. Summon your Wall!"
"The Mystic:It does not fall to us to guard your city. Man is a fool creature, clinging to his past and cowering from his future. Wasting his strength on bygone days."
Nyx:And what future are you wards of?
Oracle King:So short-sighted and cursed never to rise above it.
"King Regis:Wait. I have seen what this brave soul is prepared to do. He, too, seeks to safeguard the future."
Nyx:Your Majesty...
"The Mystic:Very well, young king. We will weigh your warrior's worth. But our boon does not come cheap. The cost is a life."
The Mystic: His...or hers.
Nyx:No. To hell with your power! I'm not here for it. I only came to tell you: you are no kings!
The Mystic:Your worth has been weighed and found wanting. Now burn!
Nyx:You're going to lose your precious Ring! But it's not too late to save it.
The Oracle:You mean to barter for your life?
"Nyx:No, no. My life is nothing. Giving a future to those who want to see it...is everything."
"The Oracle:Hmm. You do not fear, even if that future is doomed."
The Mystic:And the price for it will be your life.
Nyx:You guys drive a hard bargain. Where do I sign?
Nyx:I could get used to this.
Libertus:Nyx...I'm sorry.
"Nyx:Don't be. You saved me, now I owe you."
Libertus:For a change.
"Nyx:I'm gonna need another favor. Meet Lunafreya Nox Fleuret, our prince's beloved bride-to-be. She has the future of the world in her hands. Keep her safe, get her out of Insomnia. Oh, I almost forgot. You'll need this."
"Nyx:Give Prince Noctis my regards. Libertus will take care of you from here. Have a safe journey, Your Highness."
Lunafreya:What will come of you?
Libertus:What the hell are you doing?
Nyx:Following the kings's orders.
"Lunafreya:I will see the Ring to Noctis. The future will be safe, I swear it."
Nyx:Planning on punching your way out of the city? Keep it. Now we're even.
Libertus:No. We'll settle up once you're back in Galahd. Me and everyone else will be waiting for you. I'm counting on you...hero.
"Libertus:Buckle up, princess."
Lunafreya:My life is in your hands.
"Drautos/Glauca:So, the power of the Lucii returns. No matter. You are out of time."
"Nyx:For you, I'll make some."
Drautos/Glauca:What can you hope to do? One man against an empire. Against the daemons. How will you save Insomnia with no Wall to protect you?
Nyx:You've got it all wrong. I'm not fighting to save Insomnia.
Chancellor Izunia:So this is the might of the Old Wall. Marvelous. Truly marvelous.
Nyx:Why'd you do it?
"Drautos/Glauca:Lucis. Niflheim. It isn'twhowe fight for that matters, only what. We fight for our homes. That is where our allegiance lies."
Libertus:That's not something you see every day.
"Chancellor Izunia:Oh, such a pitiable waste. All those beautiful city streets, all laid to unsightly ruin."
Emperor Aldercapt:I will return to Niflheim.
Chancellor Izunia:So soon?
"Emperor Aldercapt:The Crystal is ours. Finish this, and see the daemons disposed of."
Chancellor Izunia:As you command. Such a pitiable waste...
Nyx:How could you serve the Empire? After everything they did!
"Drautos/Glauca:I do not fault them for taking what was given. I fault the man who gave it. The man who cowered behind his Wall and abandoned us to save his throne and his son. Give me the Ring, and our homes will be free again. The Empire has promised it."
Nyx:I don't see much of a future on the other side of that promise.
"Drautos/Glauca:Don't be a fool. Save your friends. Give your dead sister peace. What do you fight for, if not that?"
Libertus:Hang on. This could get bumpy.
"Libertus:Here, take the wheel."
Libertus:Floor it!
Libertus:Just keep your foot on the gas.
Libertus:You're alright?
"Libertus:I'll be waiting for you, hero."
Drautos/Glauca:What of your kings's power now? They've given you a burden you cannot hope to bear. I told you before :just wanting doesn't win wars.
"Drautos/Glauca:For the honor of my home, I fought and killed under a king I loathed. And still, he betrayed me. He betrayed usall."
"Nyx:We fought for the same thing. All of us. But you've looked too long on the past, you're blind to the future."
"Drautos/Glauca:Predictable. Unlike you, I learn from history."
Nyx:But you're a slave to the past.
Drautos/Glauca:A man's past is his pride.
Nyx:No. My pride is shaping the future.
Nyx:Looks like I'm gonna owe him big.
Lunafreya:We're almost there.
"Nyx:King Regis did what he did for the future. Because of him, there's still hope for our homes."
"Nyx:Not the worst way to go. Rule well, young king."
"Libertus:We should move. It ain't safe here either. Hey, don't worry about Nyx. He can take care of himself. Come on."
Lunafreya:No. We must part ways here.
"Lunafreya:I can hardly travel in secrecy alongside so great a hero. And I, too, have a promise to keep to Nyx. I pray you two see each other again soon."
"Libertus:Yeah. Me, too."
"Lunafreya:Thank you, Libertus."
"Libertus:Hey, queen! You and the king are always welcome in Galahd! Me and Nyx will be waiting for you!"
Ignis Scientia:It's been some while. Do you remember the last time you saw Lady Lunafreya?
Noctis:About twelve years ago.
Prompto Argentum:That would make you eight? You were kids!
Gladiolus Amicitia:Hope she hasn't gotten her hopes up.
"Noctis:Why not?(to Prompto, who laughs)Calm yourself."
Gladiolus:Try and keep it together when you meet her.
Ignis:She'll expect to see a fine young prince.
Noctis:Tell me something I don't know.
"Ignis:We don't have time for all that. But this is your wedding we're talking about, Noct."
"Noctis:Knew that, too.(to Prompto, who laughs again)You really gotta calm down."
"Gladiolus:What do you mean, ""uh-oh?"""
Noctis:I think I know.
???:Prologue - Awake at Last
"???:Tick, tock, tick, tock..."
???:Time to wake up.
???:*Yawn* What a nap...
"???:Oh, right. I gotta get to work."
???:Am I gonna make it? The boss hates when I'm late.
"???:Then again, it's not like business has picked up any."
???:Maybe we should start selling sandwiches along with the coffee.
???:*Yawn*... The streets sure are quiet today.
"???:Hey, I'm here!"
???:Huh? How'd she get in if no one's here yet?
???:Good morning! I'm real sorry. I hope you haven't been waiting long.
"???:Oh, right! She needs some water."
"??? (2):Oh, no thanks. A pint I mean, a cup of coffee, please."
"???:Right, that's one cuppa joe. And I'll get you one of the big jars."
"???:Ugh. Has nobody made the coffee yet? Come on, get it together, guys."
"???:I'm sorry, miss. This might take a while."
"??? (2):Hey, no hurry! Time's not an issue."
???:Here you go.
??? (2):Thank you.
??? (3):There you are! Lann!
"Lann:Keep it down, Reynn. How 'bout acting your age, huh?"
"Reynn:Hey, don't talk down to me. Listen, last time I checked, little bro, I've been around a few minutes longer than you."
"Lann:Okay, okay! I get it already! Very sorry!"
"Lann:So, what's up? I'mallears."
Reynn:Well you don't have to get all sarcas Uh...
"Lann:Uh, what?"
"Reynn:Forget it. So Lann, have you seen anybody this morning?"
"Lann:Well, yeah. I'm looking right at you, aren't I? And there's that customer."
Lann:You didn't even see her? Dude.
"Reynn:Yeah, but... Ugh, look. Come with me right now."
Lann:Wha Easy!
Reynn:There's nobody here!
Lann:So it's a quiet morning. Maybe they just...
Reynn:I. Mean. No one!
"Reynn:Lann, have you bumped into anyone today? Besides her?"
"Lann:Uh...now that you mention it, I guess not."
Reynn:And this isn't setting off any alarms?
Lann:Should it?
???:You two really don't remember a thing.
Reynn:Huh? What was that?
"Lann:Reynn, manners."
???:You two really don't remember a thing.
Reynn:Would you please just answer my question?
Enna Kros:You can call me Enna...Kros. Enna Kros will work.
"Reynn:Okay, well...we woke up to a ghost town this morning. Maybe you know why?"
"Enna Kros:Yes, you're quite alone. But you always have been."
"Enna Kros:This world, it's always been the two of you. A world without time, one that ended when it began."
Lann:Wha? That's the weirdest thing I've heard.
"Enna Kros:But don't worry. Just because the world ended, doesn't mean that it's going anywhere."
Reynn:Okay...now you're kind of scaring me.
"Enna Kros:So! Now that you're awake, we've got a story to tell."
Tama:Right the-here!
Lann:Aaah! Who the honk putthisthing on my head?!
"Reynn:Yeah, I did try to mention it before."
Enna Kros:You take it from here. I'll go on ahead and link up a path.
Tama:You the-got it!
"Reynn:Huh? H-hey, you can't just leave!"
Tama:Salu-the-tations! My name is Tama and I'm the-here to help out. Does anyone the-have any questions?
"Lann:Hmm... Wait, I've gottonsof questions!"
Tama:That's the-seriously the first thing on your mind?
Lann:We're not allowed to be confused?!
"Reynn:Hey whoa, take it easy there, Lann."
Lann:I thoughtyouwere upset too!
Tama:Let's start the-over. I'll make us some the-coffee.
"Reynn:Oh, yes please!"
"Lann:But...I already made some coffee before you got here. How can you just roll with this, Reynn?!"
Tama:Chill the-ouuut. You'll live the-much longer.
"Reynn:Yeah, Lann. You shouldn't start out your morning with so much stress."
Tama:Oh! Would you the-like some sugar?
"Reynn:Three cubes for you, right, Lann? I'm good with just one."
Tama:Okay! I'll the-go and put the coffee on.
"Lann:But I justsaidI... Ugh. You know what, just give me my dang cup of coffee."
"Lann:""Mirage Keepers""? Me and Reynn?"
Tama:That's the-correct!
Lann:Dude...
"Reynn:So...we could have ruled the world? Because, what, we controlled these ""Mirages""?"
"Tama:Well, that's what I the-heard."
Lann:From who?
"Tama:What do you mean? Enna Kros the-told me, of course!"
Lann:What? How's that?
Lann:So what does it do?
"Tama:With this prismarium, the Mirage inside becomes yours, and you can the-make it do the-anything and the-everything you command."
"Lann:Wait, what? Huh?"
"Tama:Okay, go ahead and the-throw some attacks out there."
"Tama:Yeah, that's the way to the-do it!"
Tama:I the-knew that you had talent!
"Tama:All right, all right, I think I've seen enough for one the-tussle."
Tama:The-figure it out yet? The two of you were un-the-surpassed. No the-Mirage could stand up to you!
Lann:Dude. Seriously?
"Tama:Dude, the-seriously."
Reynn:It's hard to believe.
"Enna Kros:I'm sure it is. As far as I can tell, you two have lost everythingall the memories and experience you've ever accumulated."
"Tama:So not only did they the-lose the Mirages they had, they've been the-stripped of all their memories of the Mirages too?"
Enna Kros:Listen. Let me show you something.
Lann:You mean they're all inside this gate?
Enna Kros:You got it. Are you ready to conquer them again?
"Reynn:So, um, if we do manage to find all the lost Mirages... does that mean we'll be able to remember the things we forgot?"
"Enna Kros:Well, I don't know about that. After all, youlostyour memories. It's not the same thing as forgetting them."
"Enna Kros:But, even if you don't remember Grymoire, Grymoire still knows a lot about you."
"Lann:Okay...so, like..."
"Reynn:You're saying, whether we remember anything about ourselves or not, we can still find clues about our past and the things we've done?"
"Enna Kros:Correct. And if you keep on gathering Mirages, I think you might even meet your family in due time."
Reynn:Our family?
"Lann:Huh? Well I guess, it does make sense that we'd have parents."
Enna Kros:Oh yes. So then... You going? You going? Will you journey to Grymoire?
"Lann:So, this must be Grymoire."
"Reynn:Ha ha ha! Lann, you look like such a little dweeb!"
"Lann:I know, we look ridiculous!"
"Tama:Oh, don't the-worry. I'm sure that's how every-the-body in this world must look."
Lann:That is awesomely weird.
"Reynn:Well, this kind of works out. We won't have anybody gawking at our arms."
Lann:Way to find the silver lining.
Lann:I guess we should head straight down this path?
"Reynn:It's the only direction we can go. Think you can manage to not get lost? You know, just this once?"
Lann:What? I'm not gonna get lost! ...Yet.
"Lann:Oh, hello! I spy another Mirage."
Reynn:So what now?
"Tama:First, you're the-going to need this!"
Reynn:It looks sort of like a prismarium. What is it?
Lann:Whoa! Does it even have pictures?!
"Tama:You the-betcha! And the-whenever you add a new Mirage to the manual, you receive one of its prisms! But only the first time, the-mind you."
"Tama:There! A prismtunity! Use the ""Imprism"" command to the-claim that Mirage for your own!"
"Tama:Hey the-look, you did it! Now that the chocochick is inside the prismarium, it's yours to the-keep!"
Reynn:Cool! I can see the chocochick running around in the prismarium!
"Tama:Yup, that's the-right! While I'm up the-here, I get to take it nice and the-easy."
"Lann:Uh, is that stacking or slacking?"
"Tama:Better the-yet, your magic and other abilities have the potential to change, too. It all depends on how your stack is the-configured!"
"Lann:Huh? Oh, I don't need any action figures when I get to blast out super-attacks like a super-robot!"
"Tama:Well, just be the-careful. Stacking doesn't the-make you invincible. Some the-enemy attacks have the power tounstack you."
"Reynn:In other words: bye-bye, super-robot, so to speak."
Lann:Yowzers. Thatdoessound like bad news.
"Tama:It's true that we are individually the-weaker when we're unstacked, but look on the bright the-side. Since we each get our own the-turn in battle,"
"Tama:By the way, you two can the-switch between Jiant size and Lilikin size."
Reynn:Huh? A dead-end?
Lann:But there's nowhere else to go. What are we gonna do?
Tama:Never the-fear!
"Reynn:Is this a Mirage, too?"
"Tama:Not in the traditional the-sense of the word. But you'll see these pests all over Grymoire,"
Lann:So what is it they want?
"Tama:It really the-depends on the Gimme Golem, so the first thing you'll have to the-do is examine it."
Gimme Golem:Gimme gimme...
Lann:So where do we find that?
Tama:That chocochick you just imprismed ought to be able to track the-down what we need.
"Reynn:Hey, the chocochick's come along for a stroll."
Lann:Huh? It found something.
"Tama:Yay! You the-found it! Now, try examining the Gimme Golem one more the-time."
Lann:Whoa! It vanished!
Reynn:That's so cool! I guess the chocochick found us just the item we needed.
"Reynn:So...Tama, I noticed Mirages disappear when we defeat them. Why is that?"
Tama:Most of the Mirages you see in Grymoire don't actually the-technically belong in this world.
Lann:Now what'sthis?
"Lann:Mirages? Oh man, let's go catch 'em!"
Reynn:Lann! Why did youNowwhat do we do?
"Tama:I tried to the-tell you. Inside murkrifts, you're likely to find Mirages that are the-strong and dangerous."
"Lann:You ""tried to the-tell"" us? Try a little harder, please!"
Reynn:Unnh... Ooh ooh ooh ow.
Enna Kros:Oh no! Did you two die already?
Lann:What?! I died? But that's... No way.
Reynn:Maybe it's true... That Mirage in the murkrift did kinda...
"Lann:Well,I'mstill alive."
"Enna Kros:Yes. That's because someone intervened right at the moment of your demise, and made it so the battle never happened."
"Reynn:Wow, you can really do that?"
Enna Kros:Of course! Although Tama's the one who does it.
"Tama:That's the-right! I have the power to rewind time a little, and then the-whisk you to safety."
"Reynn:A ""life""?"
"Tama:You might not the-believe it, but I've actually got multiple lives. Back there, I had to sacrifice one of those lives to turn back time and the-save you."
"Lann:That makes zero sense and kind of freaks me out, but Tama, I'mimpressed!"
Lann:Dude! You got it. Say no more! Rest yourself silly.
Tama:Yes the-sir!
"Reynn:Thanks, Tama. We really owe you one."
Lann:Hey. Who's that?
"Enna Kros:Oh! If you mean our new guest, she claims to have gotten herself lost."
"Lann:Uh, okay!"
Enna Kros:The real question is how she got here from the outside world when it's no easy trick.
Reynn:So...she's over at North Promenade.
Reynn:Oh wow. She's so tiny! Is she a... What's the word again? Lilikin?
???:Choco-boco-lina! ...Oh!
"Lann:Uh, good. More or less."
"???:You know, what a nice, quiet place."
"Reynn:Oh, uh..."
Tama:So who are the-you?
Chocolatte:Oh! You can call me Chocolatte.
Chocolatte:I seem to have washed up here like a soggy yellow feather in a storm.
Chocolatte:I do have this funny knack for winding up in strange places.
"Reynn:Uh, cool..."
"Chocolatte:Oh, right!"
"Lann:Whoa, slow down! What kind of operation is this?"
"Chocolatte:It's called a shop, dear."
"Reynn:So hey, are you ready to head back to Grymoire?"
"Serafie:Well, you had it coming."
"Tama:Well, I don't remember you the-raising me at all!"
Reynn:Who's this?
"Serafie:Oh, hi. I'm just your adorable local wind pixie, aka Serafie."
Serafie:Hoarding. Why do you think I'm here?
Reynn:Well...we're still working on it.
Serafie:Uh-huh. You'll have scads of them before long. You're gonna need a place to unload.
"Lann:Yeah, they are kind of bulky."
"Serafie:Well, who's got you covered? This pixie right here."
"Reynn:I'm not sure I caught every single word, but I guess...""I Agree""?"
"Tama:Serafie's kind of a ""special"" the-case."
"Enna Kros:Anyway, I think you should be able to manage on your own from here."
Tama:You mean you're the-leaving us?
Enna Kros:Yes. You handle things now.
"Tama:Oh! Okay, I the-will!"
Reynn:Huh? B-but where are you going now?
"Enna Kros:Oh, well... Somewhere else, of course."
"Reynn:Yeah, that's not exactly very helpful. Look, we really need to ask you so many things!"
"Enna Kros:No no, you'll figure it out. I can't do everything for you now."
Reynn:Everything? But you've barely done anything.
"Enna Kros:Besides, every world has its own rules. Like water dousing fire, and light banishing darkness."
"Lann:Uhh, I think that's just called ""science""?"
"Enna Kros:Well, I design mine to be so completely unbreakable that even I can't undo them."
Lann:Undo what?
Enna Kros:The rules.
Lann:Ugh... You're bad at explaining.
Reynn:You're saying you can't help because that violates the rules of the world or something?
"Lann:But whyisthat? I mean, come on. Just who do you think you are?"
"Enna Kros:Me? Oh, well..."
Lann:Dude.
Reynn:I guess we can'tnecessarilyrule it out. But for somebody calling the cosmic shots...
"Serafie:Well, that's Enna Kros for you, so get used to it."
Lann:So...she really is god?
"Serafie:Beats me. Enna Kros is Enna Kros, wouldn't you say?"
Tama:Pretty the-much.
"Reynn:Uh, thanks for clearing it up."
"Lann:Well, that certainly cost us a chunk of time."
Reynn:And whose fault is that?
"Lann:Oh, uh...yeah! I want names!"
Reynn:Lann! Don't touch it this time.
"Lann:I know, I know. But...could we see all this stuff before?"
"Tama:Now that you've fought that thing the-once, you can see all its information."
Reynn:Got it.
"Tama:Yup!Verygood thing to keep in the-mind,Lann."
"Lann:Uh, why are you repeating it? And just for my sake?"
???:Chapter 2 - Foretold by Prophecy
"Lann:Hey Sis, is that a town over there at the end of the bridge?"
"Reynn:Yeah. And I don't know why, but something about it ""takes me back""..."
"Reynn:So, uh...you think we're supposed to get on?"
Tama:Abso-the-lutely! All the-aboard!
"Lann:Oh, dude!"
"Lann:Oh. Hey Sis, let's park it here."
"Lann:Uh, hi..."
Lann:They're so tiny.
"???:Whoa, pluck my needles! I don't knowhowlong it's been since we've had new passengers."
"Cactuar Conductor:Right. Tickets, please!"
Lann:Ohhh!
Reynn:A Mirage?
Lann:What? It talks?!
"Cactuar Conductor:Oh, I indeedily needilyama Mirage, but I'm also the train conductor, sooo... tickets, please!"
"Lann:The conductor? Well, all right... If Tama can talk, then why not?"
"Reynn:But, the train tickets that we need"
Tama:Are right the-here!
Lann:Right the-how?
"Cactuar Conductor:Wow! Semi-lifetime passes, eh? Haven't feasted my eyes on one of these in a swell spell."
Reynn:Where did those tickets come from?
Tama:Enna Kros made sure I was provided with everything we could ever the-need. Yup-the-yup!
"Reynn:Uh, okay then..."
"Lann:So why a ""semi""-lifetime pass? And not a lifetime one?"
Lann:Wow... This place rules!
"Reynn:Yeah, it's like something right out of a fantasy."
"Lann:Hey, Tama. Why don't you hitch a ride?"
Tama:Roger the-dodger!
"Reynn:Oh, us? We're, uh..."
Frightened Man:Ah! Mirages from the Bahamutian Army!
Lann:Baha-moo? What's...a Bahamoo?
"Passerby:Well, the Bahamutian Federation has a whole army of Mirages in their employ."
Reynn:Huh? Someone's made a whole army out of them?
"Lann:Sounds just fine by me. Line 'em up nice and neat for us, so we can round 'em up!"
"Lann:All right you Baha-moos, what's your beef? Huh?!"
Tama:You the-make it sound like they'remadeof beef.
"Reynn:Ugh... Yeah, Lann. Don't you know what's at ""steak""?"
Lann:Whoa! What the... What just happened? Why wasn't I able to imprism that Mirage?
Tama:Didn't you see the light the-surrounding it? That means it's the-beholden to another keeper.
Lann:Be-what? B.O.? They smell?
"Tama:UGH! No! What I mean is, the Mirage already has another the-master."
Lann:Ugh! Fire whoever wrotethatlittle hook in.
Reynn:Lann! Ix-nay on the fourth wall stuff!
Lann:Oh! Whoops...
Distrustful Man:Are they Bahamutian soldiers?
Grateful Woman:But they drove the Mirages off for us.
"Amazed Woman:It's just like the prophecy, word for word!"
Confused Man:But...which one?
"Fretful Woman:Well, weknowhow it ends..."
Passerby:Please. May I speak with you?
"Reynn:Oh, sure."
Passerby:The two of youyou've traveled here from another world.
"Reynn:Oh, well... I wouldn't... I mean..."
"Lann:Actually, I think you're pretty much spot-on. And we're Mirage Keepers, too!"
"Reynn:ButLann, don't tell her!"
"Lann:Why not? Face it, we're too awesome to try and hide it."
"Reynn:Lann, you don't even know what ""exude"" means."
Passerby:There is...someone who would like to have a word with you. Could you possibly stop by Castle Cornelia?
Lann:So let's find this Casa Cornelius place.
"Tama:Well, you've the-got the direction correct, even if the rest of that wascompletelyoff the-base."
Reynn:That woman must be important if she's inviting us to the castle...
Tama:Castle Cornelia is up the-near the top of the town.
Lann:Oh. Right! We should stop by.
"Lann:Wassup, guys! Nice armor."
"Reynn:Leave them alone, please."
Princess Sarah:Thank you for coming. Welcome to the kingdom of Cornelia. I am Princess Sarah.
"Lann:Wait, you're like, a princess?"
Reynn:We had no idea!
Lann:I'm not royal!
"Reynn:Oh, and I'm his older sister, Reynn. It's an honor."
"Princess Sarah:Please forgive the ruse. At first, I suspected that you might be agents sent here by Bahamut."
"Lann:Oh, I wouldn't say we werethatbrave. Really."
"Reynn:Stop, you're so modest."
"Lann:Yeah, we're more the ""instanding"" types."
"Tama:Hwah? I'm pretty the-sure that ""instanding"" isn't an actual the-word."
Princess Sarah:Tee hee... Ha ha ha!
"Reynn:Prophecies? Oh, that's right... I think I heard the townsfolk going on about some kind of prophecy too."
"Princess Sarah:Oh, I am sorry. If you will permit me, I will explain it from the beginning."
"Reynn:You mean like, that Mirage attack before?"
"Reynn:So where does this ""prophecy"" factor in?"
Princess Sarah:The Azure Prophecy speaks of a divergence.
Reynn:The Jiants may...wreak two futures?
"Lann:""Reek"", huh?"
Tama:Wh-wh-what are you the-talking about? There's nothing the-wrong with the way I smell! You big the-dummy!
"Lann:Well, at least I'm dumber thanyou!"
"Reynn:I'm sorry, Your Highness. I'm afraid there's just no hope for them."
Princess Sarah:Oh. Uhh...
"Reynn:So, ""the Jiants from the Hills""... As in Nine Wood Hills?"
"Reynn:Um, do you mind if I ask you a slightly awkward question?"
"Princess Sarah:Most of the Mirages in Grymoirenot all, but certainly most of themare now firmly under the Federation's control."
"Lann:Dude, they controlthatmany Mirages? Seriously?!"
"Princess Sarah:Y-yes! Uh, ""dude."""
"Princess Sarah:King Brandelis's Herald lieutenants, known asSegwaridesandPellinore,"
Reynn:So there was a Queen of the Keepers? Sounds like she was pretty powerful.
"Princess Sarah:Yes, but that was more than a century ago."
"Reynn:So...sorry for the string of dumb questions, but,"
"Princess Sarah:It mayseemwise... But you see, membership in the Federation involves following their laws, and adoption...of a heinous creed."
Reynn:That bad?
"Princess Sarah:Yes. I beg you, see for yourselves. Once you have done so, well...you will understand."
"Reynn:All right, then."
Princess Sarah:Now then. May I ask what the two of you intend to do next?
"Lann:Well, whatever's going on out there, the only thing we can do right now is just keep rounding up more Mirages, am I right?"
"Reynn:Apparently, at one time we commanded a whole legion of them. But somehow, we lost them, along with our memories."
"Lann:That's right. So if Mirages like those goblins are bugging you, we can lay down the smack."
Princess Sarah:Lay down...the what?
"Reynn:Uh, I think what he's trying to say is we'll help you out. Or at least, in the best way we know how."
"Princess Sarah:Oh, wonderful! You have my thanks. Mine and all Cornelia's."
"Reynn:Still, if we're going to be any help, don't you think we need to beef up our arsenal first?"
"Lann:Good point. Princess, do you know of any nearby places where strong Mirages live?"
Lann:Ooh! Nice.
Princess Sarah:Not at all. Savage Mirages have been sighted in the Nebula. You may well end up dead.
Lann:Th-that's cool.
"Princess Sarah:If you insist upon going, then please take the utmost caution."
"Reynn:He will, Your Highness. Otherwise he's gonna beextremelysorry."
Lann:Wait a minute. Why just me? What'd I do?!
Reynn:It looks like we'll need to wind our way down to reach the exit.
Lann:Seems that way. What a funny way to build a town.
"Tama:Oh, it's not that the-strange to the people of Grymoire. Hey, while we're here, why don't we ask around town and the-see what we can find out?"
Lann:Huh? What's this thing?
Tama:Oh! I was hoping a path might link the-up here.
Lann:Hey! Tama!
Reynn:W-wait up!
Reynn:Hm? We're back in Nine Wood Hills?
"Tama:You see, the Gate here doesn't connect to just one the-area."
Lann:And how exactly do we do that?
"Tama:You already the-saw. Just walk up to the right place, and that's all it the-takes."
Reynn:Butsurelya means of transportation that handy must come with a catch?
Tama:No the-catch! You can use the Gate as the-little or much as you like.
Lann:Wow! It's like magic!
Reynn:Yeah... Really irresponsible magic.
Lann:Just imagine. Revisiting any place we've been!
Tama:Are you the-kidding? That name definitely the-gets an F.
Reynn:He deserves an H.
Lann:An H?! But grades only go down to F!
"Serafie:Extra, extra. Read aaall about it."
"Tama:Wh-what doyouthe-want here, Serafie?"
"Serafie:In case you're wondering, you can use the Prism Case anywhere you find one of these Gates."
"Tama:Oh, I think I the-get it now. Gates are the-what you meant when you talked about a ""strong connection."""
"Serafie:Heh? Oh, right, right. That's the gist of it."
Reynn:Okay. To the Nether Nebula!
"Tama:If the-one of your Mirages has learned the ""Stroll"" ability,"
"Serafie:That face! ""Aww, I hate walking everywhere."" I can read you like a book!"
Lann:Huh? Me?
Serafie:Yeah. I know a lazy slacker when I see one.
Reynn:What's up?
"Serafie:Oh, just some news you may find of interest."
Reynn:Huh?
"Serafie:All throughout Nine Wood Hills, I have staked out some windways!"
"Lann:Steak! Now that you mention it, I'm starving! Have you got anything else tasty on the menu?"
"Serafie:Oh, sure. Here you are. Might I recommend today's special, the sahagin soup..."
Reynn:Stop that! We'll never get to the point if you egg him on like that!
Serafie:Huh? You want eggs?
Lann:Oh! Fried? Sunny-side up?!
Serafie:Hmmm... All we've got is scrambled.
Reynn:Just tell us about the windways!
"Serafie:Oh, those? They're basically just shortcuts."
"Reynn:Uh, I don't think you're allowed to go there."
Lann:So what if the food's a little gooey! I'll still eat it!
Reynn:We are not talking about food!
"Serafie:Ohhh, wait, I get it! All that business about steakthat was a pun! Nice one, Lann."
Lann:Oh. Thank you!
Reynn:Don't tell me you thought he was serious!
"Serafie:Heh heh, heh heh heh!"
"Lann:Heh heh, heh heh heh!"
Tama:I've realized something just the-now. We can never the-leave Lann and Serafie alone together.
Reynn:Nothing good could come of it...
???:Chapter 3 - Old Acquaintances
"Reynn:She said the Nether Nebula is somewhere northeast of Cornelia, right?"
Lann:Time to go hustle and rustle a little Mirage muscle.
"Reynn:Just don't go hustle so much that you get yourself lost, okay? I might just leave you there."
Lann:Aha ha ha! When's the last time I got
Reynn:Don't push it.
"Lann:Wow, the air here is so clean!"
"Reynn:Yeah, right?"
Reynn:You'rea yahoo!
"Lann:No, no, Reynn, you need toshoutfor it to work. Ya-hoooooo!"
Tama:Be the-careful. The Mirages here are a lot the-stronger than any you've faced the-before.
"Lann:Yeah, let's not mess around in the Nether Nebba...thinga...nabob."
"Reynn:""Nether Nebula."" Do you think you can do something about that habit of forgetting the name of virtually everything?"
Lann:Oh. Here's another Gate.
Tama:That's the-right. Gates the-usually turn up in towns or at the start of most Mirage-infested areas.
"Lann:A ""shortcut,"" huh?"
"Reynn:So like, if we wanted to go back to Cornelia right this instant,"
Lann:Yeah! If it were hair...
"Lann:Man, I love a good adventure!"
"Reynn:Yeah, fine. Just behave yourself."
Lann:This dungeon is way more dungeony than I thought.
"Reynn:Did you know that originally, ""dungeon"" referred to the biggest tower in a castle? It's what they called the castle ""keep."""
"Lann:Ugh, how long has it been since I've heard Reynn go off on one of her educational rants? She must be pretty upset."
Tama:The-why is that?
"Lann:The more upset she gets, the more she tries to cover it up by spouting random trivia."
"Reynn:You know where the word ""trivia"" comes from?"
"Lann:Sis, I think we're good."
Lann:Are you kidding me?! Mirages can stack too?
Tama:Yup. You're not the only ones who get way the-stronger when you're piled up.
"Reynn:Do their abilities change when they're stacked too, then?"
Tama:Afraid the-so! Which meanssomebodyneeds to stop underestimating the enemy before he the-finds himself up to his neck in some
Reynn:At least he knows the warning's meant for him.
Reynn:What's this for?
Tama:It's a strange switch that the-responds to Mirages.
Lann:A new path! Check outthatswitchcraft!
"Tama:Yup! Now we know ""switch"" way to the-go!"
Reynn:Switchever one of you thinks you're being clever is about to get a knuckle sand-switch.
Lann:Guh! Did...did I just get owned?
Tama:I'm the-raising the white flag here too...
"Tama:Oh, that? I guess Enna Kros's the-trying to give you some tips!"
"Lann:Dude, really? And here I thought I was some kind of super genius coming up with all the answers on my own."
"Tama:I hate to the-break it to you, but you will never the-be that person."
Reynn:I know... It's so sad.
"Lann:Whoa! Hey now, c'mon. You don't have to lookthatbrokenhearted when you say it..."
"Reynn:Uh, what's this?"
"Tama:Oh, that's not the-good."
"Lann:No extra-cation? Guess we'd better be ""extra"" careful, then! Duh ha ha ha!"
"Reynn:Ugh... Anyway, it sounds like if we're going in, we'd better go in fully prepared."
"Tama:That's the-for sure. And don't the-forget to save your progress, too."
Lann:What thehonk?!
Reynn:Ah! Be careful!
Ramuh:Ohhh... I expected some foolhardy adventurer with a terminal case of curiosity.
Ifrit:What's this?
"Shiva:Well, look who's back."
Ifrit:Ah! The half-pints. Hail and well met!
Lann:Wha Hale and Welmet? That's not our names!
"Reynn:I think he just means ""hello."""
Shiva:Ha ha ha!
Ifrit:Ha ha ha ha! You haven't changed a bit!
Lann:Huh? What's so funny?
"Reynn:Oh, you're having a ""Lann moment."" Guess I'll just add this one to the pile."
"Lann:Wait, what pile? There's a pile?"
"Reynn:Apparently, we've met the three of you before. Although, we don't remember it."
Ramuh:You do not remember us?
Shiva:Reeeally? No wonder they haven't summoned us.
Ifrit:Then our course of action is clear. We must ensure the pecking order is pecking in the right order.
Ramuh:Hold now! Why must you two always let the blood rush to your head?
Ifrit:Wha...what do you mean?
Ramuh:Would you just look at them? These are not the Mirage Keepers we knew.
Lann:Hi...
Shiva:You're right. They do look rather... How do I put it?
Lann:Put what?
Reynn:Lann does set the bar low.
Tama:Like limbo the-bar low.
Ifrit:Hm? ...Ahh. I see...
Lann:See what?
Shiva:Very well. What say we pit them against just one of us...to keep things nice and fair?
"Ramuh:Hmm, agreed then. Go on. Choose from among us, and choose wisely."
Lann:Choose for what?
Ramuh:Time certainly has not made you any more clever.
"Shiva:What we're trying to say is, the two of you are no match for all three of us at once. Which means..."
"Reynn:Right, I get it, thanks. Now let's see..."
"Lann:Huh? Wait, get what?"
On-screen:Who will you be tested by?
Shiva:Care to play? I'll send chills up your spine and right through your heart with my Diamond Dust.
Ramuh:'Twould be foolhardy to challenge me. My Judgment Bolt strikes with such force it would shatter your very soul.
Ifrit:Choose me! I know you've missed it. Step now into the searing embrace of my Hellfire!
On-screen:Begin the fight with XX?
Tama:She looks the-ready to knock us cold!
Lann:Knock us cold forwhat?Help me out here!
Reynn:I hope this doesn't traumatize you.
"Reynn:Watch it. For an old guy, he looks pretty tough."
"Lann:Dude, ""tough"" doesn't even begin to describe it."
"Tama:Be the-careful! Remember, we're still the-inside their threshold!"
Tama:Careful! He the-looks like he's all muscle!
Lann:All right! Let's turn up the heat!
"Reynn:Uh, I think he's got that part covered..."
Ramuh:Enough. I have seen my fill for one day.
"Shiva:That was fun, for what it was."
Ifrit:A shame the two of you have so much growing up to do.
"Lann:Quiet, you! I'm a hulk waiting to happen."
Ramuh:So long. We shall meet again.
"Ifrit:Well, our paths may cross before you know it."
Shiva:Bye-bye for now.
Reynn:Huh? What's this?
Lann:A prismarium! Duuuuuuh.
"Reynn:I know it's a prismarium, dummy."
"Tama:You didn't manage to imprism those tough Mirages, but it looks the-like they gave you this prismarium from the same tribe as a consolation prize."
"Reynn:I see. I guess we made the grade, then."
Masked Woman:The Mirages of the Nebula have been set free...
"Reynn:Well, we'd batter make our way back to Cornelia, before the Bahamutians get any funny ideas."
Lann:We gotta go all the way back?
Tama:You can head to Nine Wood Hills right the-now if you want to!
"Tama:Now that the boss has been the-bested, I can make you an Exit Gate right the-here and now!"
"Tama:It'll take you the-back to Nine Wood Hills, and from there Cornelia's easy."
Lann:Thanks to the buzzcut! I remember.
Tama:You don't get shortcuts much the-shorter than a buzzcut!
"Reynn:Uh, I think at that point, you call it a ""bald-cut."""
Tama:Just head the-back to your room in Nine Wood Hills whenever you want to rest up and the-recover HP.
"Reynn:While we're there, we should stop by Chocolatte's and stock up on items."
"Lann:Hey, you got it."
Tama:Oh! Those are the-called mirajewels.
"Reynn:Hey, Serafie...um, you seem to have something sitting on your head there. What's the deal with that?"
Reynn:You didn't even notice?!
"Lann:Ha ha ha! Oh boy, what a doofus!"
"Reynn:Uh, have you checkedyourhead?"
Lann:Guh! How did that get there?!
"Serafie:Ha ha ha! Oh boy, what a doofus."
Reynn:Both of you are doofuses!
"Serafie:Hey! The word is ""doofi."" Here. I'm giving you this so let's just move on."
"Reynn:Uh, thank you... But, what is this for?"
Serafie:The truth is...
???:Chapter 4 - A Legendary Warrior
Reynn:Okay then. Let's check in with Princess Sarah.
Sentry:It's the Bahamutian Army!
Lann:What? They're here already?
"Sentry:They're setting up camp, right outside of town!"
Princess Sarah:Reynn! Lann!
"Reynn:Oh, perfect timing. We were actually just on our way to see you."
"Princess Sarah:If they've established a camp near our gates, then clearly they must intend to finish us once and for all."
Reynn:So what now?
Lann:Seems to me...we're going to have to nip this little problem in the butt.
Reynn:Hm? What do you propose we do?
Lann:Weshould take the fight tothem.
"Princess Sarah:Uh, well said, but as things stand, Cornelia simply does not have the manpower."
"Lann:If you can just buy us some time, we'll do the rest."
Lann:Me and Reynn'll sneak up on their boss and take him out!
Reynn:Hmm...
Princess Sarah:I-is it really that simple?
"Reynn:Well, he may not exactly look it, but Lann's pretty good in a fight."
Lann:Please! As if you were ever any taller than me.
"Reynn:Well, I might have made up the ""pip-squeak"" part, but, he definitely did get picked on."
Princess Sarah:......
"Reynn:Still, we were always kind of proud that we looked like this. Because it meant we were just like our mom, right?"
Lann:...I guess.
"Reynn:So! Let's talk more about Lann getting picked on! Boy, did they make him cry."
Princess Sarah:H-how wonderful!
Reynn:But that's not 'cause he turned into some kind of bully-destroying machine.
Lann:Hey! Watch it.
Reynn:So Lann... How 'bout it? Do you think we can beat those guys?
"Lann:Piece of cake! Well, not apieceof cake. More like...a very large sliver of cake."
"Reynn:Well, there you have it. So, are you willing to trust us?"
Princess Sarah:Very well then.
Reynn:Huh... What a weird thing to remember. I know someone bullied Lann. But why can't I remember who?
Brigade Captain:Hello there. Are you the Keepers from the prophecy?
Brigade Captain:We have been informed of the particulars. We'll time our feint to when the two of you storm the field.
Lann:Where's the goblin camp?
Reynn:Up on that hill. C'mon!
Tama:Cornelia's soldiers are the-fighting as hard as they can.
Lann:Let's hurry up andWSHHH...circle around andBOOOSH...knock the goblins' boss senseless!
Tama:The-WHSHHHandBOOOSH!
Lann:Aw yeah!
"Soldier (1):According to the vanguard's reports, many of the enemy forces are capable of inflicting blindness."
Soldier (1):Good luck out there! We're counting on you.
Soldier (2):Good luck.
Reynn:Huh? This thing seems awfully familiar.
Lann:What're those chain things?
Reynn:Whoever the Mirages are beholden to must be close!
Lann:What? B.O.?
Reynn:Stop it.
"Soldier (3):I should have known that wasn't the last of them... Thank you. I owe you my life. I know this isn't much, but here. I want you to have this."
Soldier (4):The enemy commander has taken position further up the plains. Be very careful.
Soldier (5):How humiliating!
Soldier (5):You didn't have to help me! I had those freaks right where I wanted them!
"Soldier (6):All injured soldiers have been ordered to fall back at this point and wait for further orders. Please, finish this fight for us!"
Soldier (7):If I hadn't gotten injured...
"Soldier (8):Oh, help, Captain! I'm just not cut out for battle!"
Reynn:Are you okay?
Lann:We got this!
Brigade Captain:Good timing.
Reynn:Princess Sarah was here?
Lann:What? No way. That can't be right.
"Brigade Captain:I'd like to think so, but knowing her, it's possible."
Lann:Cool. Let's do this.
Soldier (9):That's odd. I could have sworn I saw Princess Sarah on the front lines...
"Soldier (10):Thanks for the help just now. You two are going up against the enemy commander, is that right?"
Soldier (11):Keep the pressure on those Federation scum!
Soldier (12):We won't let Cornelia fail!
Soldier (13):It's time to show them what Cornelia's 1st Brigade is capable of!
"Lann:The princess? Dude, sheishere!"
Reynn:Heh heh... I guess she's the hands-on type.
Reynn:Your Highness! Behind you!
Reynn:Look out!
Brigade Captain:Hyah!
"Brigade Captain:Are you all right, Highness?"
"Princess Sarah:Uh, yes, thank you."
"Lann:Oh shmup! We gotta find a way down there, now!"
"Reynn:We can go around. If we're fast enough, we"
Lann:No! There's no time!
Lann:No!
Reynn:Princess Sarah! You okay?
"Lann:Dude, that move was awesome!"
Warrior of Light:I...I don't know what just happened.
Princess Sarah:I think I do. That light would explain it.
Warrior of Light:Me? Are you sure?
Princess Sarah:Yes. The legends of Cornelia tell of others like you.
Princess Sarah:You are a Medium. One with the potential to become this realm's Champion.
"Reynn:Wait, a Medium? ...A Champion?"
"Princess Sarah:Champions arise at critical points in time, where they awaken unexpectedly to their miraculous power."
Warrior of Light:Incredible. So I'm really one of them?
Princess Sarah:Yes. There is no mistake.
Warrior of Light:I think...the light Lann and Reynn sent me was a sort of reveille. Like I'd been sleeping my whole life and finally...woke up.
Princess Sarah:...Do you have that power? Do you have the ability to awaken Mediums as Champions?
"Reynn:I wish we knew. Like I said, we don't remember all that much about who we are."
"Reynn:Please, stand back, Princess Sarah."
Lann:This guy must be their boss.
"Reynn:Lann, it looks like the soldier's human. Don't get carried away."
"Lann:Reynn, I'm shocked. I don't pick on people weaker than me."
"Reynn:Ha ha! I just had to make sure. Let's go, Lann!"
Tama:This thing is the-massive!
Lann:Seriously! What do they feed him anyway?!
"Reynn:Uh... Maybe we can stew over that some other time, whaddaya think?"
"Lann:Whew, see? Total piece of cake."
Reynn:Wait... This soldier's not human at all. Was he a Mirage?
Princess Sarah:What? No... The soldiers are human beings vying to become Architects and join the Federation elite.
Woman in the Cage:Yes. That's right. They're here.
Knight in the Black Armor:How many years have passed?
Woman in the Cage:Some. How many is a difficult thing to gauge from in here. But...
Knight in the Black Armor:Time for us has resumed its march.
"Knight in the Golden Mask:Yes, what is it?"
Knight in the Black Armor:You may begin. I trust you have worked out each detail?
"Knight in the Golden Mask:Ohhh, I can assure you, every word."
Knight in the Black Armor:Then away with you.
Woman in the Cage:And you? You aren't going to waver?
Plumed Knight:We have a prophecy to fulfill.
Knight in the Black Armor:Yes. Let us usher in a new age of history.
Reynn:Now would be a good time to stock up on items.
"Lann:Good call. We've racked up a ton of gil, now that you mention it."
Reynn:You have to wonder why a bunch of Mirages are carrying so much cash.
Tama:Let's just the-say that Enna Kros
"Reynn:Never mind, I figured it was her."
"Reynn:So, why don't we go back to Cornelia and see Princess Sarah?"
Lann:What is this place?
Reynn:Lann! Are you all right?
"Lann:Uh, yeah... Did you just see that?"
???:Should you two be here?
Reynn:A tonberry?
Tonberry:Quite so. A tonberry through and through. Now should you children be this far afield?
Lann:Far a-what now?
Reynn:He's asking if we're lost. I guess he's got a point. I have no ideawherewe are.
Tonberry:As I thought. Then you should both come with me at once. It's not safe here.
Tonberry:I give you...the Coliseum.
???:Chapter 5 - The Champion Who Saved Grymoire
"Tama:From the looks of the-it, the Bahamutian encampment is going to stay a goblin the-hangout for good."
"Reynn:At least they'll leave Cornelia alone for a while, now that we've gotten rid of the soldier controlling them."
"Warrior of Light:Once Mirages are scattered and separated from their keeper, they revert to their wild state."
Princess Sarah:And wild Mirages are something you just...learn to get used to in Grymoire.
Lann:That's why you've got Mr. Warrior here.
"Princess Sarah:Yes, indeed."
"Princess Sarah:However, we cannot rule out the possibility of another Bahamut attack."
"Warrior of Light:Actually, word has been spreading of such an organization: an anti-Federation group as large as a nation."
"Princess Sarah:""League of S""? Do you know of any way to reach them?"
"Princess Sarah:Saronia, yes. Theyhavebeen resisting Federation annexation."
"Warrior of Light:Yes. Highness, allow me to journey there, and learn what I can about the League of S."
"Princess Sarah:Alone? To get to Saronia, you must pass through all manner of places teeming with dangerous Mirages. And I..."
"Lann:Hey, maybe we could go instead."
"Reynn:Yeah! Mr. Warrior here, he and the brigade should stick around and keep the goblins in line."
Lann:That's right. Cornelia's legendary Champion belongs right here in Cornelia.
Princess Sarah:What a kind offer. You would really do that?
Reynn:Sure! You're doing us a favor by pointing me and Lann in a new direction.
Princess Sarah:I thank you. We are in your debt.
"Lann:Well, there's no sense in hanging around. So long! Take care!"
"Reynn:Okay, then let's get going to this Saronia place."
Tama:Just hop on the train and take that choo-choo the-north!
"Cactuar Conductor:Right. Tickets, please!"
On-screen:Board the train?
"Cactuar Conductor:Go on then, all aboard."
Lann:Holy amaze. I could stare for days...at this place.
Reynn:Looks like we're gonna have to find a way through.
"Tama:If things get the-dangerous or you need a break, don't forget that you can use the Gates to return to Nine Wood Hills and take a time out."
Lann:Whoa! How are we supposed to get past these vines?
Reynn:What's this symbol?
Tama:That's one of Enna Kros's the-patented Sizzle symbols!
Reynn:She got it patented?
Reynn:Nice!
"Reynn:Grymoire sure has no shortage of wonders, does it?"
Lann:I know. How high uparewe? I wonder what would happen if we jumped.
"Reynn:Hey, why don't you find out?"
"Tama:Go on, we're the-waiting."
"Lann:Uhhh, I'll pass."
Reynn:Huh? What's that light?
"Lann:Reynn, my legs are about to fall off."
"Reynn:Talking about it only makes it worse. But, you do have a point... I guess this is wearing me down."
Lann:Wouldn't it be great if the Mirages in our stacks could just carry us around?
"Reynn:Oh come on, it's not that simple"
"Tama:Youcanthe-hitch a ride on your Mirages, as long as they've learned the Joyride ability."
Reynn:We can?!
"Lann:Dude, YESSS!"
Tama:That's the-beee-yoootiful!
Reynn:Wait a sec. I know I've seen that before... But where? I can't remember.
???:Jiants traveling with a Mirage? It seems clear the two of you are not from Grymoire.
Tama:Ah! I the-totally forgot about hiding!
"Lann:Yeah, we kinda forgot to shrink down too."
"Reynn:What's your name? You know, that staff"
Yuna:My name is Yuna.
Yuna:Are you Heralds? Have more of you been sent to plague us? Your kind have brought enough chaos into this world already.
Yuna:Begone now from Grymoire! You have no place here!
Tama:Maybe we should get the-going while the getting's still good!
Lann:I don't understand it. Why is she so mad at us?
"Reynn:Yeah, Lann! What did you do to her anyway?"
"Lann:""What did I do""? Why is itmyfault?!"
"Lann:Huh? ""Lusse Farna,"" you said? But that's our...mother."
"Reynn:Hey, you're right! Thatwasher name!"
Yuna:Let me show you something.
Reynn:That's the earringthe same one Mom used to wear.
"Lann:What? Then, it's her?"
Reynn:Right. IknewI recognized it. The ornament on Yuna's staff.
"Yuna:Roughly one hundred years ago, a Champion from another world saved Grymoire. Her name was Lusse Farna."
"Reynn:Huh? Mom did that? But, a hundred years..."
Lann:It doesn't make sense. Mom's a Champion? And this is some kind of monument to her?
"Yuna:So, you keep saying that Lady Lusse was your mother. Again, may I ask who you are?"
"Reynn:Well, uh..."
Yuna:No memory? Thatisstrange.
Reynn:Do you think you might be able to tell us a little more about Lady Lusse? We'd appreciate anything at all.
"Yuna:I'm sorry, I only know the common legends. The ones Grymoire's people have grown up with."
Reynn:Fine. We'll take anything.
"Yuna:Sometime around a century ago, the world of Grymoire was nearly destroyed by a being that has come to be known as the Demon Dyad."
Lann:That definitely sounds like something out of mythology.
Tama:Bridging the gap between worlds is a serious the-accomplishment. She must have been the-amazing!
"Yuna:That she was. But sadly, even though she managed to save the world from the Demon Dyad..."
"Yuna:The Heralds... All three of them chose to remain here in Grymoire. And one of them is now Brandelis, king of Bahamut."
Reynn:Huh? But Bahamut... That's the federation that attacked Cornelia!
"Yuna:Yes. After they finished ""saving"" the world, Brandelis and the others harnessed a legion of new Mirages,"
"Reynn:""Legion of new Mirages""... Lann, you don't think there's any connection to the ones we lost...do you?"
Lann:What? That's not possible. We're talking about a hundred years ago.
"Reynn:But where have we been? Nine Wood Hills, which Enna Kros told us was a world without time. Right, Tama?"
"Tama:Right the-you are. Compared to other the-worlds, the concept of timethereis, let's say...more than a little bit the-unusual."
"Lann:Dude, what?"
"Reynn:Umm... If you don't mind my asking, what ever happened to Lady Lusse? After the Heralds came?"
"Yuna:Unfortunately, we don't know for sure."
"Lann:What?! Well, then where can we find this castle?!"
"Yuna:I wish I could help, but I don'tknowwhere to find it."
Lann:Huh? How do you hide a big honking castle?!
"Reynn:Hey, take it easy!"
"Lann:Well...yeah, maybe not. But you can't try and tell me this is just a coincidence."
Reynn:Would you listen?
Lann:What is it already?
"Reynn:Oh, just forget it."
"Yuna:If it's Bahamut that you're after, you should start in one of the Federation's member states, and do your asking around there."
"Lann:Dude, what? But I thought Saronia was the place we're going to!"
Reynn:Then Princess Sarah must not have known...
Lann:Ugh... Oh well. We've already made it this far.
Reynn:Yeah. We wouldn't be very good emissaries if we turned back now. And we did promise to ask about the League of S.
"Lann:I'm real sorry I raised my voice at you. I know you were trying to help us out, so thanks."
"Yuna:No, I should be sorry for attacking you. It was wrong to accuse you of being something you're clearly not."
"Yuna:To get to Saronia, you will need to pass through a frigid place called Icicle Ridge."
"Yuna:""Again, it shall be Ragnarok"
???:You're beyond salvation.
???:An illusion? Hmph.
"Plumed Knight:Well, no matter. A chase is more to my liking. I tire of simply waiting."
"Lann:What's up, Sis?"
"Reynn:Oh, it's probably nothing."
Tama:Hweh? My senses are the-telling me some kind of door has appeared in Nine Wood Hills.
Lann:What's this thing?
Reynn:It sure looks like a door. But does it even go anywhere?
Lann:Hellooo! ...Let's check it out.
Reynn:Wh-wha Hey!
Reynn:Where are we now?
???:Visitors? What an unusual surprise!
"Reynn:Um, who are you? And...wherearewe?"
"Girl Who Forgot Her Name:My name is... Huh? It was right there on the tip of my tongue. Use it or lose it, I suppose."
"Girl Who Forgot Her Name:Oh, but this is my tearoom. So who are you? Will you join me for tea?"
"Lann:Uh, well, you might say that we're sort of passing through. But I'm Lann, and this is..."
Reynn:It's Reynn. And my brother and I are from Nine Wood Hills.
Girl Who Forgot Her Name:Lann and Reynn from Nine Wood Hills...
"Girl Who Forgot Her Name:Right, I think I might know why you've come here. Shall we get started?"
"Lann:Uh... Sorry, come again? You know what me and Reynn are doing here, even thoughwedon't have the slightest clue?"
"Girl Who Forgot Her Name:Mm-hm. You're Keepers looking for new Mirages. You've come here to touch the souls of your friendstheir past, present, and future."
"Reynn:Uh, I...don't know?"
"Lann:Whoa dude! That was a lot of words. Hey Reynn, you follow that?"
Reynn:Uh-uh... Nope. I'm officially lost.
"Girl Who Forgot Her Name:So, whose soul will you touch?"
"Reynn:Hey, what are these arma gem things?"
Girl Who Forgot Her Name:Hm? You've found some arma gems?
"Lann:We're not exactly sure what they're for, but we did turn up a few."
Girl Who Forgot Her Name:That's good. They have great value here. You can think of those gems as a kind of token.
"Girl Who Forgot Her Name:Yes. In order to touch another's soul, or to tamper with time, first, you must offer compensation."
"Lann:Ohhh! So the more we find, the more stuff we can do here."
"Reynn:But isn't that kind of dodging the question? Okay, they're tokens, but where do they come from?"
Girl Who Forgot Her Name:You needn't wonder about every little thing.
Girl Who Forgot Her Name:The world has some secrets you're simply better off not knowing.
"Lann:What's this stuff about ""invoking"" Champions?"
"Girl Who Forgot Her Name:With invocation, you can call upon the Mediums you've met for help, and then they will fight alongside you in the field of battle."
"Lann:Dude, what? Really?"
"Reynn:Pop, fwoosh. Got it."
"Reynn:All the same, the fact that we can invoke them at allit sounds pretty useful."
"Lann:Yeah, it'll make collecting Mirages way easier."
"Girl Who Forgot Her Name:All right, but there are restrictions."
Lann:Uhh... Yeah!
"Girl Who Forgot Her Name:And invoking isn't free. You have to bend all kinds of divine rules to pull it off, which means more compensation."
Reynn:And I guess we can't pay in arma gems?
"Girl Who Forgot Her Name:Not the gems. Use those here toawakenChampions. Toinvoke, you'll have to store up a different kind of tender."
"Lann:Oh! That's super easy to understand. So, how do we go about storing Champion Points then?"
Girl Who Forgot Her Name:Wear down your souls.
"Girl Who Forgot Her Name:To put it simply, the gauge fills when you're hurt, and when you defeat Mirages."
"Lann:Umm... Right! Okay. So basically, all we have to do is keep fighting."
Reynn:......
"Girl Who Forgot Her Name:Oh, one thing."
"Lann:But, why?"
"Girl Who Forgot Her Name:It takes a lot of connecting the dots to make sure they can reach you. Unfortunately, three is the most that I can handle."
"Reynn:I...am pretty sure there's no way that can be good, so...we'll pass."
???:Chapter 6 - Solace from the Ice
Lann:D'ahh! I'm freezing my butt off out here!
"Reynn:Brrr, n-no kidding. Hey, let's take shelter at that inn there."
Sherlotta:Ohhh! Our first guests in a while. Welcome to Sherlotta's Solace.
Lann:Ahh! So much warminess!
"Reynn:Oh! Um, hello there. Would it be okay if we rest here for a little bit?"
Sherlotta:Sure! The Solace wouldn't be much of an inn if we turned away freezing travelers.
Lann:Thank goodness.
Sherlotta:Oh! We don't see very many Jiants these days.
"Reynn:Wha Lann, what are you"
Lann:Whoops! ...Oh. She doesn't really seem all that shocked.
"Sherlotta:Hm? Oh, well, I'm sure some folks would make a fuss. But I remember a time when Jiants wouldn't warrant a second look."
"Reynn:Well, now that you mention it, I guess not."
"Sherlotta:Eh, don't give it a second thought. Everyone is welcome under my roof."
Reynn:Good idea. I wonder if she's got anything to keep us warm. That would help.
Reynn:Ooooh! Is this for warming up?
"Lann:Oh, this looks nice and toasty."
Reynn:Excuse me. How much do you want for this?
Sherlotta:Hmm? Wait a sec. Tell me you're not planning to cross the ice fields.
Lann:We kind of have to get to Saronia.
"Sherlotta:Ugh... Forget it, don't even bother."
Lann:Oh yeah? We can handle some Mirages. You can just point us right at those suckas. Ha ha ha ha!
"Reynn:Oh, you see, we're Mirage Keepers."
Tama:Yes the-sirree!
"Sherlotta:Oh wow! We have had a lot of guests over the years, but you two are definitely my first ever Mirage Keepers!"
"???:Uh, excuse me?"
Refia:Um... Sorry to intrude. My name is Refia.
"Refia:You see, I've been stuck here in the inn for a while now because of all the Mirages in Icicle Ridge."
Refia:Yes. I've made up my mind.
Lann:Huh?
"Sherlotta:You did say you're on your way to Saronia, right?"
Lann:That's right.
"Reynn:In fact, you might say that we're on a mission of sorts for Cornelia,"
Sherlotta:Good grief. I must be the only one around here with a lick of sense.
"Lann:Hey, no skin off my nose."
"Reynn:Or mine. Besides, if she can use white magic, she'd really be doingusa favor."
Refia:Great! Everybody wins.
"Sherlotta:So! If that's settled, why not rest up before you go?"
"Sherlotta:Normally, I would've charged you through the roof for that warlock's warmer. Just so you know."
"Refia:If you have any Mirages that use fire magic, they should make the trip through the ridge a little easier."
"Lann:Oooh! The cold doesn't seem half as bad now! Thank you, magic warmer thingy!"
Reynn:You're right. I think we'll be able to cross the ice now.
"Tama:Saronia, here we the-come!"
Lann:Whoa. Is that the ridge they were talking about?
Reynn:It looks like the icicles have formed a bridge across the ravine.
"Tama:There's only one the-way to Saronia, and that's through this ridge."
Lann:Is that the Mirages she mentioned?
"Reynn:Stay close to us, Refia. Okay?"
Refia:
"Lann:Whoa, it melted! Thanks, Sizzle!"
Reynn:Thanks indeed. Let's keep going.
Reynn:Aaah!
Lann:What the?!
Reynn:Look out!
Reynn:That must have been those nasty Mirages Sherlotta warned us about.
Lann:We can't seem to imprism them. This'll be tricky...
"Tama:If you're not sure which the-way to go, don't be afraid to look at the map and-the get your bearings."
Reynn:All these wolves...
Refia:Must be a pack. They're not going to leave us alone unless we show their leader who's boss.
Lann:Right. Let's go find that scruffball and turn him into a nice scruffy prismarium!
Lann:Wha? Hey! Stop running!
Reynn:They certainly like giving us a hard time.
Lann:He's huge!
Reynn:Is that the Mirages' leader?
Lann:Good! Let's go after him!
"Lann:We've got you now, furface!"
"Reynn:Lann, wait!"
Tama:I don't wanna get wolfed the-dowwwn!
Refia:I-I don't believe it. Did the wolves lure us here?
Reynn:No way...
"Lann:What is it, Sis?"
Reynn:Could it be...
"Lann:Where didthatcome from? That's cold, pointing atmeevery time something goes wrong!"
"Reynn:Yeah, well in Icicle Ridge, do as the icicles do."
Tama:And icicles the-point!
"Refia:Um, guys, maybe you should save it."
"Lann:Okay, that does it! I'll show you which one of us has more brains!"
Reynn:That's what I'm scared of.
Tama:We already know who's the-smarter.
Lann:I... Hey!
"Lann:Oh-kay, that was fun."
"Tama:Well, that's the-oneway to do it..."
"Reynn:Refia, are you okay?"
"Refia:Yes, I'm fine. Thank you."
???:Chapter 7 - The Thane and the Knave
Refia:Welcome to Saronia.
Reynn:What is it?
Tama:I just the-noticed... The whole the-town seems to have a threshold around it.
"Reynn:Huh? Then, does that mean there's a powerful Mirage here in Saronia?"
Tama:Very the-close. Keep an eye the-open.
Reynn:Hey. What's the matter? I thought you'd gotten kind of quiet.
Lann:It's so cold! I thought it would be warmer in this town but it isn't! Not ata-a-a-all!
Lann:Ah! What'd I step on?!
"Reynn:Ha ha, you're such a weirdo. Why are you apologizing to a cat?"
"Lann:But, you should have seen the look on its face! Scared the honk out of me."
"Reynn:Since it's our first time here, why don't we ask around and try to learn more about the place?"
"Blonde Lilikin:Can you believe it? If we raise our civic rank, we can spend the rest of our lives in a castle, wanting for nothing!"
"Male Lilikin:Ugh, I hate worrying about my civic rank."
"Lann:Whoa, what happened tothisplace?"
Reynn:I know... How can it be so different from the next road over?
"Male Lilikin:The moment Saronia joined the Federation, things around here took a turn for the worse."
"Lann:You know, from the sound of it, they must have joined up with the Federation pretty recently."
Reynn:I think now I'm starting to see what Princess Sarah meant.
"Lann:Well, for now, why don't we see if we can go talk to that thane guy about the League of S?"
"Reynn:I'm probably wasting my breath, but try to watch what you say around here."
"Lann:Uh, sure."
Tama:Looks like the thane's manor is at the very tippity the-top of the town. Let's moooove...it the-out!
"Soldier (1):I said for ya to scram, kid!"
Refia:Will you just listen to what I have to say?
Reynn:Is that...Refia?
Refia:Oh! You caught up.
Lann:What's going on here? They giving you trouble?
Refia:I already told them that the thane is my uncle. I'm not allowed to talk to my own flesh and blood now?
"Soldier (1):I don't care who y'er supposed to be, 'cause y'ain't seein' him!"
"Lann:Dude, what?"
"Reynn:Well, you see, sir, we are here to meet the thane, on behalf of Princess Sarah of Cornelia."
Soldier (1):What now?
"Reynn:I expected better from you, considering you're practically our neighbors."
"Lann:Yeah! You tell him, Reynn!"
Soldier (2):Cornelia's got Jiants for emissaries?
Soldier (1):They got some kinda royal Cornelia thing with 'em.
Soldier (2):What? You sure?
Soldier (1):Beats me. You gonna send 'em packin' and take the risk?
Soldier (2):Wait here. I'll go check with His Thaneship.
Soldier (2):The thane says he'll see you.
"Reynn:Let's go, Refia."
Soldier (2):Hey! The girl stays here.
Lann:Refia's part of our antourage.
"Reynn:That's right. She just ""ant""-eceded us."
Reynn:Toodle-oo.
"Refia:Thank you, guys! You're always there for me."
Reynn:No big deal.
"Lann:Yeah, I mean, it wasn't a lie. Wewereall heading in more of less the same direction."
Thane of Saronia:You must be the Jiant emissaries from Cornelia.
"Reynn:Oh, uh, yes. We're here to"
Thane of Saronia:I hear the Federation finally gave up and just invaded them.
"Reynn:Yes, they did try to invade, but for the moment"
Refia:Who are you?
"Thane of Saronia:Hm? Why, Refia. Is that you?"
Refia:Who are you?!
"Thane of Saronia:My dear, please. It's me, your uncle"
Refia:No! You arenotUncle Takka!
Lann:Wait. Sorry. What?
"Thane of Saronia:Ha ha ha ha! Then I was right. If you've managed to see through this facade, then there's no mistake: youarea Medium."
Refia:Where's Uncle Takka?
"Thane of Saronia:Why, he's standing right in front of you. Make no mistake, little girl. This is your uncle."
Refia:What are you...
Thane of Saronia:How intriguing. This must be an act of fate.
Thane of Saronia:Ha ha ha! It's more than fate. It has to be destiny! How can I not rise to it!
Reynn:That answers that.He'sthe one who put up the threshold here.
Tama:He just the-changed sizes the way that you two do!
Lann:So is he a Bahamutian soldier?
"Reynn:Well, he's nothing like the ones we've fought so far. Be careful!"
Lann:Aw yeah!
Bahamutian Soldier:Heh heh heh heh... Ha ha ha ha ha!
Bahamutian Soldier:Why are you stopping? Show me more! Does fate bind us? Has destiny aligned us?
Bahamutian Soldier:Sir Segwarides... Wh-why are you...
Knight in the Golden Mask:You are a fool! To so much as inquire.
Reynn:That's not good...
"Knight in the Golden Mask:Awayfrom death,awayfrom life they stay! Contain them or you'll Graaah!"
"???:Quick, this way!"
Lann:Huh? Isn't that the same
"Cat:Well, are you guys coming or not?"
Lann:O-okay!
Tama:The-run for your lives!
Knight in the Golden Mask:Heh heh heh. The gods would caution us. Is this a sign that we'll not go unchallenged? That there's no way to know the pieces are aligned?
Lann:Whew! That was too close.
"Refia:Sherlotta, thank you."
"Sherlotta:I just knew you would get yourselves in trouble, and boy did you prove me right."
Lann:Agh! What do you call that creepy trick?
Sherlotta:You're the creepy one here!
Lann:Ah! What the honk...
Reynn:Huh? Is that coming out of the sky?
Tama:Let the-me! I wanna have a the-turn!
Lann:How do you explain this?
Sherlotta:Don't expect any help from me on that one.
"Sherlotta:Okay, guess we'll file that one under ""no one knows."""
"Reynn:So, what do we do? We came here to ask about the League of S, but all we found was a lot more questions."
Sherlotta:Sorry. Did you say the League of S?
Reynn:That's right.
"Sherlotta:Oh! If that's all it is, then maybe I can help you out."
Reynn:You can?!
"Sherlotta:Oh, sure. I know a few people right here in Saronia who should be able to get in touch with the League. I'll ask them to pass on your message."
Reynn:Do you mean it? Thank you!
"Refia:Sherlotta's been around a lot longer than she looks, so she knows tons of people. Isn't that great?"
Sherlotta:Don't you talk about my age.
Reynn:Eh heh heh...
"Lann:So like, what's with you and the cat-o-morphosis?"
Sherlotta:That...is a very long story that I don't feel like telling.
Sherlotta:Yup.
"Lann:Oh, uh, that's cool."
"Reynn:We've still got a lot to puzzle over. But now that the League of S thing is settled,"
"Reynn:Plus we've got that castle and Mom to track down along the way, too."
Lann:Sounds pretty good to me.
"Refia:From here, the best place to go next would have to be the Low Seas."
Reynn:I guess thisisthe last town on the continent. Okay then. We'll figure something out.
Lann:So what about you two?
"Sherlotta:Are you coming back to the Solace, Refia?"
Refia:Sure. I need some time to digest this business with Uncle Takka. The Solace sounds great...if you'll have me.
Sherlotta:Of course I will.
"Refia:Well you two, thank you so much for everything. Best of luck in all your adventures."
Reynn:Thanks! Take care!
"Lann:Hey Sherlotta, thanks for stepping in to help."
Sherlotta:Speaking of stepping in... I don't suppose you were planning to make it up to me? For trouncing on my tail?
"Lann:Oh! So, that reallywasyou! Gosh, I was kinda hoping you'd forget..."
???:Chapter 8 - Buccaneer Blues
Lann:So let's see... Refia said to borrow a boat at the docks and head to the Low Seas.
"Reynn:Well then, why don't we try asking around town and see if anyone's renting them out?"
"Male Lilikin (1):Hey, did you hear? There's a real pirate ship in the harbor! It's so cool!"
"Male Lilikin (2):You're headin' for the Low Seas? That's completely insane! I can't lend you a boat, but I'm rootin' for ya!"
"Male Lilikin (3):What's that? You want me to lend you my boat? But if I did that, I wouldn't be able to go fishing!"
"Lann:Ugh... At this rate, we might as wellswimto the Low Seas."
"Reynn:Well, you can't really blame them. They probably need every boat they've got to make ends meet."
Lann:Wait! Hold your chocobos. Didn't somebody mention a pirate ship was parked at the pier?
"Reynn:Yeah, something like that. Why, what's your point?"
Lann:Heh heh heh. I've got an idea. What if we beat up all the pirates and then...commodore their ship?
Reynn:What? There's nowayit'll be that easy.
"Lann:Well, we don't have to go in with Mirages blazing. We might just be able to sneak off with it."
"Reynn:I guess... It's definitely risky, but if we don't get our butts in gear,"
"Lann:Lesser of two evils it is! Docks, here we come!"
Tama:Not exactly the most cheerful the-place.
"Lann:Yeah, and it looks like Mirages are roaming around too."
Reynn:These docks need to get docked a few points. Let's watch our step...
Lann:What've we got?
Reynn:A cannon? What's it doing here?
Lann:Hmmm... Aha!
Lann:Nice. It's a perfect FIIIIIIIIIT!
Lann:Dah! What just happened?
"Tama:Naturally, this must the-be how the locals get around."
Reynn:Uh-huh. Naturally...
"Lann:Wow, that creeped me out."
Reynn:What do you mean?
Lann:That chime sounded like it could wake the dead.
Reynn:You don't mean a gh-gh-gh AAAH!
"Lann:Hey, I didn't say it!"
Lann:I think this might be a rare Mirage!
"Reynn:What? ...Oh, that's nothing."
Lann:Since when is it nothing?!
"Lann:Ooogh, I'm really starting to get sick of all this cold..."
Tama:Maybe you should have thought of that the-beforeyou came up with this plan.
"Reynn:Yeah, Lann! Nobody ever said anything about having to fight past all these stupid Mirages."
"Lann:Ahhh! Man, do I justlovethe cold! Well, come on, come on! No time like the present!"
Lann:Oh! This must be it: the pirate ship.
Reynn:Yeah. I don't think there's any debate about that.
Tama:Let's be the-sneaky.
Lann:I think we've got this one in the bag.
"Moogle:Avast ye, kupo!"
"Moogle:Not so fast ye, kupo!"
"Moogle:Thieving pirates, kupo!"
Lann:Huh? The piratesdid they just calluspirates?
"Reynn:Well, I'd say the pot knows a kettle when it sees it."
"Moogle:Kupo! All paws on deck, kupo!"
"Tama:We're out-the-numbered, kupo!"
"Lann:Now what, kupo?"
"Reynn:Stop saying ""kupo!"" and fight, kupo!"
"Lann:There's only one thing to do now, kupo!"
"Tama:Get 'em, the-kupo!"
"Reynn:Guys, we're not here to have fun."
Tama:Aaand?
"Reynn:...We're not here to have fun, kupo."
Tama:Muchthe-better.
"Moogle:You got us, kupo..."
???:Scurvy swabs! For shame!
"Moogle:It's Cap'n Faris, kupo!"
Reynn:It's created a threshold!
Tama:Th-that Mirage must be mega the-powerful!
Faris:How kind of you gents to whip my crew into shape.
"Lann:Oh, you're welcome! But I thought we just beat them up."
"Reynn:That's what she's saying, you doofus."
"Faris:Hmph. What are you, comedians?"
Lann:Clowns? Where?
"Reynn:""Clowns""? Why is it ""clowns,"" plural?"
Tama:Yikes! Just the-look at the size of that Mirage!
"Lann:Tama, it's time! Make yourself big!"
Tama:Yes the-sir!
Reynn:You can do that?!
Tama:Hrrrah! ...Heh heh. Guess the-not.
"Reynn:Ugh, I should have known better than to even ask."
"Tama:Don't the-give up! If we kick the bucket inside a threshold, we're all but the-done for!"
Reynn:But they're...they're too strong!
"???:I have you now. Hide Refia all you want, but you can't play hide-and-seek with destiny. Fate has chosen us!"
Faris:The thane of Saronia? Why is he here?
Reynn:Hefollowedus here?!
Tama:Aaaaaah!
Faris:Wh...what the...
"Tama:Out of the hydra, and into the crack-the-pot! What are we gonna the-do?"
"Bahamutian Soldier:Doesn't this make you just want to kiss kismet? These divine designs... Isn't fate great? Now that it's brought us together, anything could happen."
Reynn:Rrgh...
Faris:You scoundrel! Find another ship to spew your bilge on!
Bahamutian Soldier:So this is how...the dice have rolled...
Faris:Hey. Clowns.
"Reynn:Y-yes, ma'am!"
Faris:Perhaps you'd care to explain.
"Faris:So, the Federation replaced Thane Takka with one of their soldiers?"
"Reynn:Actually, we're not too sure about that ourselves."
Lann:But everything we've told you is true.
Tama:Honest to the-goodness!
"Faris:Well, believe me, I'd not put anything past those Federation dogs,"
"Reynn:Hey, um..."
"Reynn:Captain Faris, you wouldn't happen to know where they're headquartered? The Federation, I mean."
"Faris:Bahamut's citadel? No one knows a lick about that, lass."
Reynn:It was worth a shot...
Faris:Why? Was that your reason for trying to steal my ship? To go off on some wild goose chase?
Reynn:Uhh... The whole idea was Lann's!
Faris:You don't say.
"Lann:What? Me? Oh, I would never everI mean I don't evenlikeships, not that there's anything wrong with yourOh, please don't hurt me."
"Faris:Ha ha. Belay there, lad."
Faris:You see...
Reynn:Huh? You mean there's more to it?
"Faris:Ahoy, Mog! You've read the prophecy, haven't you?"
"Moogle:Aye, I have, kupo!"
"Lann:Four keys, huh?"
"Reynn:Wait, the Crystal Tower?"
"Lann:Hmm... So Mog, I don't suppose you know where the four keys might be?"
"Moogle:I'm afraid I know of only the first one, kupo."
Lann:That's one more than I do!
"Moogle:Kupo! The first key is said to lie in a... Oh, 'twas a valley of fire, kupo!"
Lann:Where's that?
"Faris:I can think of one place. The fire valleys in Babil, down to the south of the Low Seas."
"Reynn:Ugh, there's those Low Seas again."
"Knight in the Golden Mask:What labor, all these twists and little turns. But fate must be allowed to run its course..."
???:Chapter 9 - The Low Seas
"Lann:Okay, so like, all we gotta do is cross the Low Seas and find that valley of fire."
Lann:Huh? What?
"Reynn:Captain Faris, can you tell us how to get to the Low Seas?"
Faris:Hmm... Perhaps. But I'll not be lending youthisship.
"Moogle:Guest, kupo?"
Faris:You know who. Oi. The lass in glasses.
"Moogle:Oh, from the League, kupo! She might be, kupo. I'll go look, kupo."
???:You need something?
Faris:Sorry to detain you.
Quistis:I thought we were done with our transaction. Did you find some sort of problem with the cargo?
"Faris:No, the goods were sound. I've another quandary...if you'll hear me out."
Quistis:What's that?
Faris:These gents here have business in the Low Seas.
Quistis:Who are they?
Faris:The Jiants from the Hills. In the flesh.
Lann:Ta-daaah!
Reynn:Cut thatout!
Quistis:Very intriguing.
"Faris:So, they need a boat. And as I recall, you've got one."
Quistis:Well...if it's true about the Thanethat he's some kind of monstrous Bahamutian doppelgnger
"Reynn:Wait, ""up for grabs""? What do you mean?"
"Quistis:Oh, my group had some business to attend to in Saronia, so we presented the thane with a boat."
Tama:You don't need to wheel and the-deal with a bunch of no-good monsters like that.
Reynn:You're not even listening.
Quistis:So you're absolutely certain? You saw the thane undergo a transformation?
"Faris:Aye, and then Syldra let him have it!"
"Quistis:Okay. Well, don't get me wrong. I can see that they're Jiants..."
Faris:Ha. One splash in the Low Seas can't stop a prophecy.
"Quistis:...Well, I guess you win. You can take the fastcraft down to the Low Seas."
"Lann:Oh, sweet!"
Reynn:Thank you so much!
"Quistis:Okay, come see me when you're ready. I'll take you to the boat."
Faris:So long.
On-screen:Ready to go?
"Quistis:Okay, right this way."
"Faris:Godspeed, gents."
"Lann:Thanks! Oh, right..."
Reynn:We really didn't mean to cause you trouble.
Faris:You can make it up to me. Perhaps...
Quistis:Come on! This way.
"Reynn:Wait, where doesthatroad go?"
"Quistis:It's the way back to town. I mean, isn't that how you got here?"
"Lann:Dude! Oh, I so wish we knew about that coming in."
"Reynn:Well, that figures. Ithoughtsomething about these docks smelled fishy."
"Tama:But at least we found some good the-Mirages! No worries, the-right?"
Lann:Yeah! No worries at all! *whimper*
Quistis:Here she is.
"Quistis:I set the helm to autopilot, so it'll take you right to the Low Seas."
"Lann:Wow, you're just as nice as a peach."
Reynn:Thank you for everything!
Quistis:Bye now! Don't come back and haunt me!
Reynn:What?!
"Lann:Well, at least it's starting to warm up."
Reynn:Oh yeah. The breeze is really nice.
Tama:I can't the-believe they loaned us this great boat! We really lucked the-out this time.
"Lann:Dude, I know, right? We don't even have to steer it. I love the easy life."
Reynn:But Lann...
Reynn:Aren't you just a little worried about what Faris and Quistis said?
Lann:What did they say?
"Tama:Now that you mention it, they did kind of make it the-sound like we weren't gonna live out the day."
Reynn:Pretty much.
Lann:Wonder why.
Reynn:Hmm... What's so bad about the Low Seas?
"Tama:What if they're called ""low""...because of all the lowlifes living the-there?"
Reynn:That could be it.
"Lann:Hey, uh, Reynn?"
"Lann:Is it just me, or is the river getting more whooshy?"
Reynn:Y-you think so?
"Lann:Reynn, all of a sudden, I am suddenly getting this really bad sudden feeling."
"Reynn:Yeah, me too."
Tama:Bad feeling? About the-what?
Lann:Ohhh wooow...
Reynn:Note to self: the Low Seas are not south.
Lann:What the honking HAWWWNK!
Reynn:They are literally straight DOOOWN!
"Lann:Aah! Gravity, NOOOOOO!"
Reynn:Gaaah!
"Lann:Agh, jelly sandwich!"
Reynn:H-how are we alive?
"Lann:Tama, you still with us?"
Tama:Never been the-betterer...
Lann:Hey! Don't do that on my head!
"Lann:Now that our boat's busted, how are we supposed to get where we're going?"
Reynn:Ugh. Don't ask me.
Tama:Those Mirage the-bullies have flipped that poor little minimantoise over! How the-mean can you get?
Reynn:Hey! Cut it out! Nobody likes a bully!
Lann:Looks like you snakes need to be taught a lesson!
"Lann:Huh, looks like even Mirages have to put up with mean old bullies."
Reynn:Take care!
"Lann:Reynn, c'mon!"
Reynn:Huh? What?
"Lann:We're Mirage Keepers! If you're gonna let 'em just swim away, then"
Lann:Then you are...you're...doing exactly the right thing!
Minimantoise:Meeewww!
Adamantoise:Young Mirage Keepers. My minimantoise here tells me that you saved his life. I thank you.
Lann:It...it talked! With words!
Tama:Hwooow... A talking the-Mirage!
"Adamantoise:Now, tell me what a pair of Keepers like you are doing all the way out here?"
"Reynn:Uh, well..."
"Adamantoise:Hmm... Then, I shall help you find this ""Babil."" You are free to ride on my back."
Reynn:Are you sure?
"Adamantoise:Ohhh yes. I'll be your ""fastcraft."" Or my best approximation of what a fastcraft is."
"Adamantoise:Now, off we go."
Reynn:Something's swimming around over there.
Tama:I don't like the look of it one the-bit.
Lann:Why not?
"Reynn:Lann, does this remind you ofanything?"
Lann:Hey! Let's try touching it!
"Reynn:Oh, please don't."
Lann:What now?!
Reynn:It's hostile!
Tama:And really the-strong!
Lann:That was close.
Reynn:We'd better steer clear of them.
"Reynn:Lann, what are you doing?!"
Tama:Aaah!
Lann:Whoa! What was that?
???:Oooh! Real actual people! I thought I might've been seeing things.
"Reynn:Uh, who are you?"
Rikku:Oh! My bad. My name's Rikku!
"Rikku:Man, I wish that Mirage hadn't come along and trashed my boat, 'cause I was having agreatday of treasure hunting."
Adamantoise:The more the merrier. Enjoy the cruise.
Rikku:Thank you!
"Reynn:Honestly, I think we just happened to bump into a really nice one."
"Rikku:Hmm. Oh! So you're trying to get to the Babil region, right? You need to set a course thataway!"
"Adamantoise:So, shall we be on our way?"
Lann:Off we go!
Reynn:Take it away!
Tama:Let's the-go!
Adamantoise:Which way do we go from here?
Reynn:Well...
Tama:The-what is it?
???:Chapter 10 - Too Warm a Welcome
Reynn:Hup...
Lann:Thanks for all the help!
Adamantoise:Nonsense. No trouble at all.
"Reynn:Thanks for showing us the way, Rikku!"
Rikku:No problem! I needed a little breather anyway.
Reynn:So! Where are you headed from here?
Adamantoise:Sure. I must head back myself. Not a problem.
Rikku:Thanks a bunch!
Reynn:Good luck! And be careful.
Rikku:See ya!
"Lann:Bye, Adamantoise! I'll come back and imprism you one day, don't you worry!"
"Lann:Right, so...uh, what's next?"
"Reynn:Well first, why don't we look for a town?"
"Tama:Be the-careful. Whatever's up ahead, it's causing my Mirage-dar to go the-bonkers."
Tama:You don't want to take a spill down these the-cliffs.
"Lann:Oh come on, how old do you think me and Reynn"
"Reynn:Hey Lann, slapstick's less funny if you die from it."
Reynn:The paths here are treacherous.
"Lann:Yeah, watch your step or yo"
"Reynn:Wow, it's even funnier the second time."
"Lann:Man, I wish I was as strong as a dragon. I'd be all like ""mrrrooow!"""
"Reynn:Which would make you onestrangedragon, but I agree. The Mirages we're facing have been getting tougher and tougher."
Tama:You the-need to learn to exploit your Mirages' elemental resistances.
Lann:You want us to blow them up?
"Reynn:Um, that's ""explode,"" and while I'd love to give you credit for the first four letters, you clearly weren't listening."
Lann:I was listening! They're mental resistors.
Reynn:Ugh! That's clearly whatyou'vegot.
"Reynn:So Tama, could you tell us more about exploiting resistances?"
Reynn:Would you stop?
"Tama:Right, where the-was I... Oh! You may have noticed the Mirages here like to the-fight with fire."
Reynn:But if you put Mirages with high fire resistance in your stacks...
Tama:You can the-reduce the damage you take from flames.
"Lann:Dude, it all makes sense now."
Reynn:What? The elemental resistance stuff? You actually followed that?
"Lann:Sure! Basically, we need to imprism as many of the Mirages around here as we can."
Reynn:Whoa!
Tama:You're the-right!
"Reynn:Somehow, you understoodwhatto do even if you didn't understand the whys."
"Lann:Ha ha ha! I'm a man of action! I don't believe in ""whys""!"
Tama:That much is the-obvious.
"Reynn:No one in her right mind would put ""Lann"" and ""wise"" in the same sentence."
Lann:Whoa whoa whoa! What's it doing?!
Tama:It the-knows how to play defense!
Reynn:I guess we'll have to give it what it wants...
Lann:Uh...Reynn? Do you hear something?
"Lann:Gosh, who knew the winds of Babil could be so toasty."
"Reynn:Lann! Shrink, now!"
Lann:Aieee! Holy Mom bombs!
Reynn:Get ready!
Lann:Please don't eat me! I taste awful!
Reynn:Yeah! We all taste bad! But especially Lann!
Tama:He'll make you the-want to barf!
Lann:You don't have to be mean about it!
Lann:Yay for miracles.
Tama:Now's our chance to run the-past them!
"Lann:Yeah, good i"
"Tama:It's...behind the-me, isn't it."
Tifa:Whoa! It finally worked!
"Tifa:Oh! I can celebrate later. Come on, this way! Hurry!"
Masked Woman:The two of them have started something. Mediums have been awakening one after the next.
Plumed Knight:Then you mean the Azure Prophecy...is coming true.
Masked Woman:The only force that can change those laws is the almighty power of a true king.
Plumed Knight:We must fulfill the Crimson Prophecy. And swiftly. Are we agreed?
Tama:Thanks again! You really saved our biscuits the-back there!
Reynn:Who knew they came in sets?
Tifa:I'm just glad you're all right. Huge dragons live in the Scars. You're lucky you only ran into the two.
"Lann:It's a good thing you did. Gotta say, though, you pack quite a punch!"
Tifa:Oh. Well...I might've gotten lucky.
Tifa:That's actually one of my master's moves. That was the first time I ever managed to pull it off.
Reynn:I guess she's a Champion too.
Lann:I'll say! She sure punches like one!
Tama:Makes you wonder what her master must be the-like!
"Lann:She said her town was north of here, didn't she?"
Reynn:Yeah. Wait... I think I can actually see it from here.
"Tama:Brrr! S-something about that place makes my fur the-crawl! I don't know what it is, but it gives me the heebie-the-jeebies!"
Lann:Are you guys seeing this town?
Reynn:Yeah... That's where Tifa lives?
Tama:It makes Nine Wood Hills look the-humble!
"Lann:Well, this is a charming little town. But something feels kind of...I dunno, ""off"" about it."
Reynn:Hmmm... I think it might be a good idea for us to keep a low profile around here.
Lann:Why's that?
"Reynn:Because... Oh, just do it!"
"Lann:Uh, okay. Low profile, Tama."
Tama:Okay. Roger the-wilco...
"Lann:Hey, you know that really big Mirage we have? Why is it so huge?"
"Tama:It's more than the-hugeit's mega! A ""Mega Mirage""!"
Reynn:Can we even use something that big in our stacks?
"Tama:Well, I wouldn't the-recommend stacking it on top of you. Not unless you want to get squished the-flat."
"Reynn:Ooh, ouch, we don't want that. Butwecould stack on top ofthem, right?"
Tama:You sure the-can! But you'll need to use the-both your powers in battle if you want to summon forth a Mega Mirage.
Lann:Sounds good! I'm the kind of guy that learns best in the heat of the moment.
"Reynn:In other words, you hate studying and you won't practice."
???:Chapter 11 - Crimson and Azure
Lann:Hold on a sec.
Lann:Hmm... I don't see any chain on the place.
"Reynn:Well, maybe they're like Cornelia, and they haven't been annexed by the Federation."
Tifa:Huh? It can't be.
"Tifa:Hey there, guys! Itisyou, right?"
Lann:Hey! Super punchy girl!
"Reynn:Hi! How are you doing, Tifa?"
Tama:It's the-good to see you!
Tifa:Same here!
"Reynn:Oh, yeah. I guess we never told you, did we?"
"Tifa:Oh, good! I was starting to worry."
Lann:It's weird. Why does everybody keep thinking that we're Bahamutian soldiers?
"Reynn:I don't know. I guess they don't see many Mirage Keepers anymore, unless they're working for the bad guys."
"Tifa:Yeah... And not just Keepers. Jiants, too."
"Tifa:Still, the prophecy's a hot topic around Nibelheim. Everyone in town has heard of the Jiants from the Hills."
Reynn:Ugh... I'm not sure I like being a celebrity.
Tifa:Anyway. So you're looking for the valley of fire?
"Reynn:Unfortunately, that's the only real clue that we've got."
Tifa:The valley of fire... Everyone knows that bit. But no one knows which valley is the right one.
Lann:What do you mean?
"Tifa:If you're looking for fiery valleys, this region is full of them."
Tifa:Let me introduce the Jiants from the Hills.
Lann:Aha ha ha...heh.
"Reynn:Yeah, that's us."
Rydia:Hello there. I am the summoner Rydia.
Rydia:Hm? Something here is not right. Something about you...
"Lann:Hey, you know...the way that Mirage follows you..."
Rydia:Huh? You mean you know Lady Yuna?
"Reynn:Yeah, we met her. Back on the upper continent. She was really a lot of help to us."
Tama:We might not even be the-here if Yuna hadn't pointed us in the right direction.
Rydia:Oh... Well then... I suppose you can't beallthat bad.
Rydia:There now. You hear that? These two say they're friends with Lady Yuna.
Rydia:So let me get this straight. You're searching for the four keys recorded in the prophecy?
"Lann:Yeah. We came to Babil because we heard one of the keys was hidden here, in a valley of fire."
"Rydia:Right, but you know, the keys are part of theCrimsonProphecy."
"Reynn:Crimson Prophecy? So wait, you mean there's more than one version?"
Rydia:Yes. There used to be a single prophecy: theAzureProphecy.
Fanatical Man:The Azure Prophecy is heresy!
"Rydia:Ugh, this is no business of yours."
Fanatical Woman:Lies! Only the Crimson Prophecy is gospel!
Fanatical Man:Are you a summoner or not? You should pray that fate guides you to the Crystal Tower.
"Fanatical Woman:The Crimson Prophecy is clear. Flanked by Mirages, the chosen ones shall acquire four keys."
"Fanatical Man:From the Crystal Tower they shall mount the heavens, where god will grant them the gift of eternity!"
"Fanatical Woman:So long as you know to look for the signs, the keys shall be found."
"Fanatical Man:So do as the Crimson Prophecy commands of you, hmm?"
Rydia:Ugh. All you hear these days is that nonsense!
"Tifa:Yeah, no kidding. At least they're not breaking any laws or getting violent, but it's still creepy."
"Rydia:What do those fools know, anyway? The Azure Prophecy was written by the First Summoner!"
"Tifa:Still, that sham seems to be the prophecy folks believe in."
Rydia:Unfortunately so. That's why I came here to sort the truth out myself.
Reynn:You see...
Rydia:So you're telling me that your mother shares the same name as Lady Lusse Farna?
"Tifa:I get it! If you really are the Jiants from the Hills, all you have to do is follow the prophecy, and you might wind up there anyway."
Reynn:Right. There's actually more to it.
"Rydia:Hmm... Well, whatever the case, it seems the only way to prove which prophecy is true..."
Lann:What do you mean?
"Rydia:Oh! Never you mind! So, are we ready?"
"Reynn:Uh, ""are we ready""? We don't even know which valley to go to."
"Lann:All right, Placey Place! Here we come!"
Reynn:Now you're forgetting entire names?
"Tifa:A while back, there used to be a town called Mist here. But then a big disaster left the town in ruin."
"Reynn:So Rydia, what's the difference between a summoner like you and a Mirage Keeper?"
"Rydia:You know, I should be asking you the same thing."
Reynn:Huh? Well...I guess I've never really thought about it that much.
Tama:Hwah? Hmm... Good the-question. I never the-really thought about it as some kind of the-bond before.
Rydia:Huh? Then Tama's not your familiar?
Rydia:Yes. Mine is this dragon here.
"Tama:Oh, I'm under no the-obligation to protect Lann and Reynn. It's the-optional!"
Reynn:Gee thanks.
"Rydia:As far as I can tell, there must be a big difference indeed."
Rydia:Let's head down to Valley Seven.
Tama:Valley Seven is east of the-here.
Tama:Ooogh... I think my fur is the-melting...
"Reynn:Valley of fire, you are way,waytoo fiery..."
Reynn:Hmm? You okay?
Rydia:Oh! I'm all right. Shall we?
"Lann:Dude, I'm burning up..."
Tama:Me the-too...
Reynn:Just think about cold things! ...And then think about them melting.
Reynn:One wrong step and we're finished.
Reynn:Aaah! Why are you sneezing?! It's like five hundred degrees in here!
Reynn:What's going on? We'll never be able to put out a firethisbig. Not with the Mirages that we've got!
Rydia:I can't TAKE IT!
Lann:Oh...right! We gotta go after her!
Tama:Wh-what he the-said!
"Reynn:I think she went back this way, right?"
Lann:We're coming!
Reynn:Watch out! These things could explode at any moment!
Tama:Everyone! The-use Lann as a shield!
"Reynn:Right. Good idea. You ready, Lann?"
"Lann:Right. Wait, you're gonna use me as a WHAT?!"
Rydia:No! Stay away!
Reynn:Rydia! Are you okay?
Lann:Then why'd you come to a place like this?
"Rydia:You needed someone to help you, didn't you? I wanted to conquer my fears!"
"Lann:Well, I'd say you did pretty great!"
"Reynn:Yeah, I mean, that fire Mirage? You doused it in one fell swoop!"
Lann:Right? You've gotnothingto be scared of.
"Reynn:""Blow it out, baby""? That's your sage advice? She's not struggling with a fear of birthday cakes."
Lann:She's not?
"Reynn:No, dude."
Lann:Then... Oh! How 'bout this? Maybe she needs a party to cheer her up!
Reynn:What aboutanythingthat you're doing right now could possibly cheer her up?
Tama:It's the-cooler thanyou.
Rydia:Hee hee! Ha ha ha!
Lann:Huh? I am not!
"Reynn:Yeah, you're way past weird."
Tama:Completely beyond the-redemption.
"Rydia:Ha ha! So, shall we?"
Reynn:Wh-what? But Rydia!
Lann:Go home. You've got nothing to prove. We'll let you know if we find anything.
Rydia:Really? How will you get past that wall of fire?
"Reynn:Oh, uh..."
Rydia:Look. I'll return to NibelheimafterI put the fire out for you.
Lann:Yeah! Reasonlicious.
Reynn:You're sure?
Rydia:Yes. Come on.
"Lann:Uh, hey. You okay?"
Rydia:.....!
"Lann:Aw, yeah!"
Rydia:...I'm fine. I just got a little worked up...and I couldn't keep my balance.
Rydia:All right then. I should return to town. I hate to leave...
"Lann:Nah, you've done plenty for us."
Tama:See you the-next tama!
"Lann:Hey, wait! When's the next tama, Tama?"
Tama:Oh! Maybe it's the-sometime tama-rah!
"Reynn:Okay, I think their brains are fried. Safe travels, Rydia."
"Rydia:No, thank you. Well, so long!"
"Reynn:Okay, let's press on, Lann."
Lann:Right. We've got a key to find.
Tama:Best of the-luck on your adventure!
"Reynn:Ha ha. You're coming too, Tama. Nice try."
Lann:I reeeally don't know about this place.
Reynn:I do. I know that it's really bad.
Tama:We can't the-give up now!
"Reynn:Technically we can, but let's get this over with."
Lann:Whoa! Is that the key?
Tama:What do you the-know? Now that was a piece of the-cake!
"Lann:Hey! Give us back that key, right now!"
"Reynn:So much for a piece of cake, I guess..."
Lann:Maybe he'll cough it up if we thump him on the back!
Reynn:Give it a shot.
"Tama:Yeah, the-do it, do it!"
"Lann:Okay! Wait, whereisits back?"
Lann:Check it out! Dude! It's just like the prophecy said!
Reynn:I guess...
Lann:What's up? You don't seem very happy.
"Reynn:No, it's not that at all, I just..."
Reynn:Why'd it...get so quiet all of a sudden?
Tama:Is it 'cause we gave that bomb the old heave-the-ho?
Lann:Ah! What now? An earthquake?!
Reynn:Whoa! It must be a big one!
Lann:Wh...what the honking HAWWWWWWNK!
Reynn:Oh no. Anything but another FLOOD!
Tama:Oh! Mayday! The-mayday!
???:Chapter 12 - Ribbit Jiggle Panic
Lann:Make that adoublejelly sandwich!
Tama:We're...gonna need the-therapy after this.
"Reynn:Ugh, please... No more cosmic flushing."
Lann:...Where are we now?
Reynn:I don't think we're in Nibelheim anymore. Not by a long shot.
"Reynn:For starters, why don't we take a took around?"
Lann:Mom bombs! That is one deep swamp.
Reynn:Maybe we shouldn't go this way after all...
Toad:Ribbit! Ribby ra-rib! Ribba-ribbit!
Reynn:What's with this toad?
Lann:Is it a Mirage? 'Cause it doesn't act like one.
Toad:Ribbit! Ribbit. Ribbity ribbity ribbit!
Tama:Ribbit? Ribbity-ribbit? The-rib?
Toad:Ribbit? Ribbit! Ribba ribba ribbit.
Tama:Ribbee! The-bib.
Lann:What? You speak toadese?
"Tama:Of the-course I do. Listen, you can tell from his accent that he's been the-toad-cursed."
Reynn:He's a GUY?
Lann:They haveaccents?
Toad:Ribbit! Ribbi-rit. Ribbit!
Reynn:What'd he say?
"Tama:From what I gather, it sounds the-like that golden toad over there is the 'phibian that put the curse on him."
"Lann:Oh, so all we have to do is defeat it."
"Tama:That's the-correct. First off, you need to the-imprism it the same as always."
Lann:Okay. We got this.
Reynn:Carefulyoudon't get toad-cursed.
Lann:Huh? You mean you're not coming?
"Reynn:Well, it's game over if webothgo full toad, right?"
Reynn:Are you gonna nab that toad or what?
"Lann:Ribbit, ribbity-ribbit, ribbiiit, ribbit!"
Tama:Lann! Where did you the-learn to talk like that? You need to go the-wash your mouth out with a bar of soap!
"Lann:What?! Dude, what did I say?!"
"Snow:Awww, ha! Look who's back, baby!"
Reynn:I guessyouare.
"Snow:You guys seriously just saved my life. Oh, the name's Snow."
"Lann:Dude, I have no idea what's wrong with you, but as long as you're happy."
Tama:Did Lann just find someone he can talk the-down to? Never the-thought I'd see the day.
"Snow:So, what's your deal? Where ya from?"
Snow:You say you got swept here all the way from Nibelheim?
"Lann:I know, it's crazy! I guess...we're getting kinda pro at it?"
Reynn:I don'twantto be a pro at it...
"Tama:Anyway, it seems we're the-stuck here. All the goop around here makes it the-hard to look for a way out."
"Snow:Oh yeah. Well, you've got that right. One false step andwhsssht,you're history."
"Lann:Okay, then how didyouget out here, Snow?"
"Snow:Heh. Just, like, THIS!"
Lann:Whoa! Cool idea!
Reynn:Wait a minute. Are you a summoner?!
Snow:Wish I could say I was...but no.
Snow:But...that's not important.
"Reynn:How about you? Are you still gonna...""butt-kick the Big Jiggle"" or whatever it was?"
Snow:You know it! It shouldn't be too far from where we are now.
Lann:So it's like a Mirage?
Snow:Yup! Me and Jiggles have got some history.
Lann:I gotcha. Then maybe we can help you out.
"Snow:Uh, really?"
Reynn:We're sort of on a journey to round up Mirages anyway.
"Snow:Ahh, I gotcha now. Well, let's team up then. That stupid Big Jiggle will never know what hit it!"
Lann:Why do all the Mirages here like popping out at us?
Tama:It must be the-part of their disposition.
Lann:Too bad. I got here first!
"Tama:Uh, yeah. You the-tell 'em."
"Reynn:Mirages, be warned. Dis-position is Lann's position."
Snow:Okay! Today you're gonna wish you never started jiggling!
"Tama:Ah, aaaaaah!"
Lann:It's huge!
"Reynn:Aha ha ha... Snow, which part of this thing is the butt?"
"Snow:Oh, it'sallbutt!"
"Lann:This mountain is so majestic, and...jiggly!"
Reynn:Do you realize we're not fighting a mountain...?
Tama:My the-eyes! It's so the-shiny!
"Lann:Well, we beat it but, yeah... I don't feel like we actuallyreallybeat it."
"Reynn:I know. It's like we're right back to square one, except...nothing about that thing was square."
Snow:I guess we just didn't kick it hard enough.
"Reynn:Snow, what exactly do you have against it again?"
"Snow:If I don't keep it in line, it just grows and grows."
"Lann:Sounds like a big, big, BIG nuisance to me."
"Snow:Well, thanks to you, I was able to smack it around a lot more than usual today."
"Lann:You know, even for a a guy who slings around ice magic, he was surprisingly chill."
"Reynn:Yeah, I'll say. So, you ready to kiss this place good-bye?"
Tama:I hope that the rest is the-easy going.
???:Chapter 13 - Castle in the Desert
Reynn:Yeah? What?
"Lann:This whole ""adventuring"" thing is hard."
"Reynn:Well, the word ""adventure"""
Lann:Thanks for that uplifting bit of trivia.
Tama:Wait! I the-hear some activity over thata-the-way. I think we're not far from a place to the-rest!
"Lann:Finally, a town."
Reynn:We can't go in.
Lann:What? Why not?
Reynn:It's another Federation town. We'd better steer clear.
Tama:We don't want to run the-into those creeps.
Reynn:Excuse me. Would you mind if we rested here a bit?
Caravan Member:Sure! You can stay just as long as you like.
Caravan Member:Here. Some sunscreen. Help yourself.
"Reynn:Oh, you don't mind?"
Caravan Member:Please! Go crazy!
Lann:Sunscreen force fields...applied and activated!
Reynn:Thank you so much!
"Lann:Now I'm all lathered up, I can smell 'em."
Reynn:Smell what?
Lann:Mirages! Over there!
Tama:Over the-where? To the north?
"Lann:Despite the harsh desert climate, Mirages here are full of life."
Reynn:When did we step into a documentary?
Lann:Uh...a docu-what?
Tama:A Bahamutian the-soldier!
Reynn:But why here?!
"Lann:Um, Reynn? That creepy noise that we've been hearingI think it's getting the opposite of not less quieter."
Reynn:'Scuse me? I'm not even going to attempt to untangle that statement...
"Tama:In other the-words, this isn't going to end the-well..."
Lann:Huh? The sky's gone all orangey.
Reynn:It's getting late. We're taking too long.
Tama:We'd better get the-clear of here before the sun goes down.
Lann:Oh my gosh... How many of them are wriggling around down there?
"Reynn:Well, whatever the answer is...DON'T TELL ME!"
Lann:These things have been under us the whole time?
Tama:More than you can possibly the-imagine.
Reynn:Aaah! I said don't tell me about it!
???:Are you trying to get killed?!
Lightning:I won't make it...!
"Lightning:What just Whatever, I'll take it!"
"Reynn:I don't know what you did, but thanks."
"Lightning:Save it for later. The longer we all stay out here, the shorter we'll live."
"Lann:Dude, what?"
Lightning:Come on!
"Reynn:Uh, right!"
Lann:Got it!
Tama:The-run like the wind!
Caravan Member:I just want to forget those sand worms ever existed...
Caravan Member:The moon is a thing of beauty tonight.
Caravan Member:You can always find refuge from the desert here. Make sure you rest up before attempting to cross.
Lightning:Surprising. I never thought the Jiants from the Hills would have so much trouble crossing a desert.
Lann:Oh! So then you've heard of us.
"Reynn:Why are you so happy about that? Trust me, we donotwant fame."
Hospitable Woman:This'll warm you right up.
Lann:Oh. Thanks!
Lightning:The keys from the prophecy? Interesting... That explains some things.
Reynn:So you've heard of them? I don't suppose you can tell us more?
"Lightning:...There are four: earth, fire, water, and shadow, if I remember correctly."
Lann:You wouldn't also happen to know where the keys are hidden?
Reynn:Is something wrong?
Lightning:Oh... Sorry. I've never heard exactly where the keys might be hidden.
Hospitable Woman:I might know something about that.
"Hospitable Woman:The Key of Earth...lies in the ""cradle of mako's light."""
Lann:Ohhh! That sounds nice and specific.
Lightning:Wait. Is that from the Crimson Prophecy's missing verse?
"Hospitable Woman:Yes. You know much, traveler."
"Reynn:Time out. What is this ""missing verse""?"
Lightning:They say that part of the original prophecy was omitted from subsequent copies.
"Hospitable Woman:Oh, I haven't read it myself. I heard it from someone who has."
"Lann:And Bahamut's castle? You, uh...probably don't know that much."
Reynn:How would she know wherethatis?
Hospitable Woman:I don'tknow...but therearewhispers.
Lann:Seriously?!
"Hospitable Woman:This is merely a rumor, but..."
"Reynn:Heralds... So then, the king who founded Bahamut."
"Lann:Cool! So, all we have to do is get those four keys, and then haul hiney over to the Crystal Tower, am I right?"
"Reynn:Yeah, from the sound of it..."
Lann:*Yaaawwwn* All this reassuring info is making me sleepy.
"Reynn:*Yaaawwwn* Don't yawn, Lann. You're making me yawn too."
Lann:What do you say we just...turn in here for the day...
"Reynn:Yeah, okay..."
"Lann:Good night, Reynn..."
Reynn:Good night...
Reynn:Wh...what is...that noise?
Lann:Nnn... Now what...
Lightning:Agh?!
Reynn:That chain...
Lann:The Federation... What aretheydoing here?
Lightning:We were careless... The drinks...last night...
Reynn:What? They were
"Lann:Dude, my body... I can barely..."
"???:No heroics, please."
Edgar:Hey now. That is certainly no way for us to treat a lady.
Plumed Knight:Heh. Rubbish.
Lann:Who's the knight?
Reynn:The Federation. Who else could it be?
Edgar:I believe our arrangement...said the Jiants were mine to attend to.
"Reynn:""Attend to""? That sounds...awfully churlish to me...!"
"Edgar:Ah, but no. See, you may be a Jiant, but my attention...I save forrealgrown-ups."
Lann:That's it! Nobody talks to her like that!
Reynn:Lann!
"Edgar:Let's try to keep things civil, if you don't mind. Please don't struggle."
Lann:Wh-what is going on?
Reynn:I...I don't know...
???:Chapter 14 - Lost Powers
"Lann:Sis, are you okay?"
Reynn:I think so... Areyouokay?
Lann:Yeah... Except...
Lann:What did they do? ...Ow!
Male Lilikin (2):......
Reynn:Excuse me. Do you know where we are?
"Man in Rags:Huh? Jiants, eh? Heh. Now what did you do to get thrown intothissorry place?"
"Lann:Dude,prison?For real?"
"Man in Rags:Well, they call it prison, but it's more like a death sentence."
Reynn:That can't be! Theremustbe a way out of here!
"Man in Rags:Oh, wouldn't that be nice? But you can forget about it."
Lann:Sentient machines?
Reynn:They're not Mirages?
Man in Rags:How's a lowly prisoner like me to know? But I suppose that they must not be.
Man in Rags:Are you two heading out? Then you'd better watch your back.
Lann:What'n the...
Man in Rags:That would be the castle submerging.
"Reynn:Now that I think of it, the castledidseem to appear out of nowhere."
"Man in Rags:I heard the first time they poked around here, the castle plowed forward, and they ended up having to redraw all the maps. Least that's the story."
Lann:Nngh... Aaah!
Reynn:Huh? She's not answering?
"Lann:No way, dude. You don't think..."
Reynn:Did we lose our powers? As Keepers?
"Lann:Oh, come on. That's just...crazy."
Reynn:Any ideas?
"Lann:""Any ideas""? I don't see a Gate."
Reynn:That's for sure.
"Reynn:Still, without Tama, we might just...die here."
Lann:What? We're not gonna
Reynn:How do we do this without any Mirages?
Lann:I don't know. But we've got to try!
Lann:No... I won't
Reynn:I can't believe...this is it...
???:You the Jiants from the Hills?
Squall:Hmm? Are you okay?
Reynn:Oh! Yes. I'm fine. Thank you.
"Lann:Uh, I'm okay too. Talk about close calls."
Squall:A littletooclose. I'm Squall.
Lann:What's this?
Reynn:A box?
"Squall:Sort of. It's an eldbox, a kind of artifact...with some modern improvements."
Reynn:Huh? You mean prismariums?
Squall:Aha. Isthatwhat you call 'em?
Reynn:Capture them?
Squall:Give it a try.
Lann:Whoa! Too cool!
"Reynn:Squall, whose side are you on? I don't get why you'd help us."
"Squall:I'll tell you on the way, but we need to go."
"Squall:Me, I'm with SeeD, a mercenary group in the League of S. We fight against the Federation."
Reynn:Quistis...was... Oh! She gave us the fastcraft!
"Lann:Ohhh, so she's in the League of S! The lass in glasses."
"Squall:Heh. That's right. She's an officer, in fact."
Lann:Wow! I didn't know she was a big shot.
Reynn:So why are you here helping us out like this? I don't suppose it's to...make up for the waterfall.
"Squall:Hm? Sorry, but I don't think she ever mentioned a waterfall."
Lann:What? That creep? Why?
Squall:You've seen the anchor that's latched on to the desert castle. Edgar's kingdom?
"Squall:In order to break loose of it, we'll need the mako energy which lies dormant beneath this facility."
"Reynn:Are you sure that this ""mako"" energy is that strong?"
Squall:Yeah. Trust me.
"Reynn:So wait, you mean..."
Squall:Yep. This isn't a coincidence.
"Lann:Whoa whoa whoa whoa. So then, why didn't he justaskus?"
Squall:Figaro didn't join the Federation willingly. It's under constant watch.
Reynn:Life and death? Sounds like what that freak in the golden mask said back in Saronia.
"Lann:So like, what's this job we're supposed to do?"
"Reynn:Oh. Well, that makes sense, then."
Squall:Right. We were hoping that you two would be able to keep the Mirages at bay.
"Reynn:Well, um...we don't really know. I mean, they've never been suppressed before..."
"Lann:Oops. So does that mean we, like, broke the master plan?"
"Squall:If we have to do this without any Keepers, then yes. The master plan is toast."
Reynn:Heh heh...
"Squall:But, the operation's in motion."
"Squall:It's possible, but I can't promise you. Now, enough talking. Let's press on."
Lann:Aaah! This one looks a lot nastier than the others!
"Reynn:Lann, be careful!"
Reynn:Why are there so many?
"Lann:Hey, you can't take them all on!"
Reynn:We'll stay!
Squall:No. This ismyjob.
"Lann:Uh, wait!"
Reynn:Come on.
Lann:Are you serious?
Reynn:We can't help him. We'd only get in the way. Let's just...do what he says.
Lann:...All right.
???:Chapter 15 - The Mako Reactor and the Black Mages
Lann:That must be the agent up there.
Reynn:Wait. Something's not right.
Reynn:Aaah!
Lann:Hey! Why's she attacking us?
Shelke:Should I assume I've won?
"Lann:Nngh... If I look dead to you, then guess again!"
Reynn:Lann!
Reynn:Agh!
Shelke:Good. That's more like it.
Shelke:Countertek deployed. There is no method they can utilize...that I can't neutralize.
Tama:Wakey the-wakey wakey!
Lann:Huh? Tama!
"Tama:That's the-me! Boy, am I ever the-glad to see you!"
Lann:Dude. Finally!
Reynn:What a relief. We're all fixed!
"Tama:When I realized I couldn't the-reach you, I was so the-upset!"
"Shelke:If your powers have recovered, we need to keep going."
"Tama:Oh! Isn't Shelke here the-completely amazing? She's the-with the, uh... Oh, that's the-right, the League of S!"
Reynn:I knew it! Sheisthe other agent!
Shelke:So. Are you done? Because we need to keep
"Tama:That thing she did, I think that it's called Counter-the-tek?"
Shelke:Yes... That's right.
Lann:Whoa. That's so cool!
Tama:And that's the-what she used to remove your suppressors!
Shelke:What? Th-that is not true at all! I was...completely in control.
"Tama:If you ask the-me, she's a Champion! Woo! How can you not the-love her! Am I the-right?"
Reynn:You sure are. Thank you for the help.
Lann:Yeah! You're the bestest!
Shelke:I...I don't have time for this.
Shelke:C-can we go? This job won't take care of itself.
Shelke:Watch your step here. This area is full of Mirages.
"Lann:Hey, wegotthis."
Reynn:Oh yeah. This right here is our time to shine.
Tama:This the-one is called a Zap symbol.
Lann:Huh? Why didn't it do anything?
Tama:That device had numbers the-written on it. Surely it must mean the-something?
"Reynn:Hmm, numbers, huh? ...Maybe it has something to do with the order we're supposed to zap things in?"
Tama:Only one way to find the-out!
Reynn:There's something strange about these Mirages...
Tama:I think some of them are unimprismable unless you use eldboxes like the one Squall the-gave you.
Lann:Huh? Say that again?
"Reynn:You mean they're machines, not Mirages?"
"Tama:Maybe machines, or the-maybe..."
Lann:Okay! It's forgotten!
"Reynn:...Well, at least we know how to imprism them. For now."
Tama:I've got a bad the-feeling about this.
"Lann:Uh, Reynn, what do all those numbers floating above us mean?"
"Reynn:Hey! I said no fourth-wall stuff! Whatever it is, it's not good."
Tama:Let's get the-out of here!
Lann:Huh? Isn't this the entrance?
"Reynn:Keep going! Trust me, this is the right way!"
"Lann:Okay! Roger that, full speed ahead!"
Tama:I guess we're the-doing this again!
Lann:Wh...what the honk?
Tama:You don't...think they're all the-gonna...
"Reynn:Heh heh... Looks like a MAGE-er problem... Get it? ""Mage""?"
Reynn:Do you think they're Mirages?
Tama:I can definitely the-sense a similarity!
Lann:Then we know exactly what to do with them.
"Reynn:Whoa, what?"
Vivi:*Cough cough* Hey! Who made all this smoke?
Shelke:Hm? So it can talk.
Tama:I the-heard it speak too!
Vivi:Whoa! A Mirage that cantalk?!
Shelke:Hm? So she can. That is odd.
Reynn:Heh heh... Youjustnoticed?
"Lann:So, kid. Your name is Vivi?"
Reynn:So your friends thereare all of them able to talk just like you do?
Vivi:Friends? Where?
Vivi:Whoa! It's a bunch of me's!
Lann:Wha Hey!
Tama:Don't you the-realize they're dangerous?
Vivi:They are?
Vivi:Hey! You guys know better than to act mean!
"Vivi:See, I knew they'd be reasonable. They even said they'll help us!"
Reynn:Color me impressed.
"Shelke:Yes, bravo."
"Vivi:Okay, so what can me and my friends do for you?"
Shelke:Oh. Actually...
Lann:Whoa! Something's happening!
Reynn:Does this mean the reactor's working?
Tama:Figaro Castle can break the-free now!
"Lann:Oh, hey! We don't wanna miss this! Come on!"
Reynn:Yeah. Let's head outside!
"Edgar:It's time. Now, full speed ahead!"
Reynn:We did it!
Tama:Yeah the-baby!
Tama:Whew... What an ordeal allthatthe-was.
"Lann:Yeah, no kidding."
"Reynn:By the way, couldn't this be that ""cradle of mako's light"" that has the Key of Earth?"
Vivi:You mean this key here?
Lann:Dude! It's the second key! Ask and youshallreceive.
Shelke:It appears that Vivi had it all along.
Tama:Lucky the-us!
"Reynn:Again, it all seems just a little too lucky... But there's no point in dwelling on it right now."
"Shelke:So Vivi, where will you go now?"
Edgar:How's this: stay in Figaro!
Lann:Hey! It's you!
"Edgar:Ah, my favorite Jiants. Your help has been most invalua...ble?"
Edgar:Um... Uh... D-didn't Squall relay my intentions?
Lann:GRRRRRR...
"Edgar:Well...listen... I-I am sorry. The Federation was watching me like a hawk, so I..."
Reynn:Ugh... What about Lightning? Is she okay?
Edgar:Oh. Yes! I made certain she escaped.
Lann:Huh? Seriously?
Reynn:She was part of this?
"Lann:Yeah, I guess...we're even now?"
Reynn:Guess so.
"Lann:Uh, what was that?"
Shelke:Where did it come from?
"Edgar:Has it always been there, lurking beneath Figaro?"
Tama:Incredible. That Mirage the-possessed power beyond the-belief.
"Edgar:After all that I've put you through, this hardly suffices, but I have some information."
"Edgar:One of the keys is in the ""land of naught but night,"" correct? Well, I may know where."
Reynn:Where is it?
"Edgar:To the west of here, you'll find Big Bridge: a colossal crossing that will take you to another continent."
???:Chapter 16 - Clash on Big Bridge
"Reynn:So, Big Bridge... It's off to the west, right?"
Lann:My first colossal crossing! This is gonna be colossa-crawsome!
Tama:NowI'mgetting the-hyped!
Lann:Whoa! That thing over there has gotta be it!
Tama:Nowthatis onebigthe-bridge!
"Reynn:Well, you sure can't say it doesn't live up to its name!"
Lann:Getting to the top is...
Reynn:Not gonna be fun.
Tama:I'll the-say.
"Reynn:Still, you have to admire it. Who could have built something like this?"
???:Nobody everbuiltit. A Jiant summoned it here in ages past.
Eiko:The name is Eiko. My job is to look after the bridge.
"Eiko:First, the bridge has a real name. It's Alexander, in fact."
"Eiko:The great Mirage, Big Bridge Alexander!"
Tama:Ah! It's...it's the-true! How did I the-miss it? I can sense the bridge's the-presence!
Lann:Dude... This thing isalive?Holy schlep!
Eiko:Andthat'swhy a summoner like me has to look after him.
"Reynn:Oh wow! So you're a summoner, then!"
"Eiko:Yeah, but it's not likeI'mthe one that summoned him..."
Eiko:Are you them? The one and only Jiants from the Hills?
Lann:You bet!
"Reynn:Yeah, that's...the word."
Eiko:Sooo...I guess that means it's true.
Eiko:Nobody remembers 'cause they're so caught up in the Crimson Prophecy.
"Reynn:Oh, that's right. Princess Sarahdidtell us about the divergence."
"Lann:Wait, the what?"
Tama:You the-mean you forgot?
Eiko:I'm starting to worry... Maybe I shouldn't let you use the bridge.
"Lann:Oh, no. We're cool! Me and Reynn are totally going to reek the right future."
Reynn:Sure are...
"Eiko:Well, it's not like I can stop you. The prophecy's about you, not me, right?"
Reynn:Duly noted.
Tama:So is there some special the-trick to getting to the tippity-top of Alexander?
Eiko:Just get on. I'll handle the wake-up call.
Lann:The what?
Eiko:Alexander's kind of a sound sleeper. So it's my job to step in and sort of get things going.
"Eiko:Now, off you go!"
Warrior of Light:I never believed it to be more than a legend... A bedtime story someone concocted to fill the dreams of children.
Warrior of Light:You won't find her.
Lann:Huh? How did we get ourselves dragged into battle?
"Girl Who Forgot Her Name:From this room, you can take control of your friends' destinies and redirect the course of their lives by fighting their most crucial battles."
Reynn:So it's like we're helping them in secret?
"Girl Who Forgot Her Name:You can think of it like that. Hey, get ready."
Warrior of Light:Whew... I'm glad that Her Highness is absent. The last thing I want is for her to be abducted again.
Lann:Dah! What just happened?
"Reynn:When we do that, what does the other person experience?"
Girl Who Forgot Her Name:Even time must bend to the whims of fantasy.
"Lann:Uh, that is totally confusing, but wow! So, we get to help a bunch of people out"
"Reynn:But in a way, there is a downside. With that much power, we could do just as much harm as we do good."
Girl Who Forgot Her Name:I wouldn't say I'm a god in the sense you're thinking of.
"Girl Who Forgot Her Name:But if you misuse this power, you might not like the consequences."
"Girl Who Forgot Her Name:Me and...him?is it ""her""?well, our fates have entwined. So now that the two of you have made it to this place,"
"Reynn:We uh, won't mess around. I promise."
Soldier:Ugh... What am I gonna do...
Soldier:Oh! You really brought me an earth hammer! I can't tell you how much I appreciate this!
Male Lilikin:Oh! If it isn't the Jiants! I've heard you've been putting up a good fight against the Bahamutian Army.
"Male Lilikin:This is great! Thanks to you, we were able to gather the data we need."
"Male Lilikin:It seems that as long as we keep our distance from the plains, the goblins will keep their distance from us."
"Male Lilikin:Hey, hey, did you know about the nimble Mirages in the desert? They're really fast!"
Male Lilikin:Whoa! You defeated some?! How are they?
Male Lilikin:Just wait! I'm gonna be the fastest runner that ever lived!
"Male Lilikin:Hey...you're the Jiants from the Hills, aren't you? Is there any way you could lend me a hand?"
Male Lilikin:Really? Thanks so much!
Male Lilikin:Are you telling me the Mirages are gone? All right! Thank you!
Male Lilikin:Now they'll know to stay far away from our town!
"Female Lilikin:Excuse me. I'm sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if I could ask you a favor."
"Female Lilikin:You would? Oh, thank you... That's very kind of you."
"Female Lilikin:Oh, thank you! My grandson's going to be thrilled when he opens his present!"
"Female Lilikin:Oh, thank you! My grandson's going to be thrilled when he opens his present!"
"Blonde Lilikin:Say, you're the proud owners of a flan too, aren't you! No need to hide it! My flan-sense never lies to me!"
"Blonde Lilikin:Eee! It's really her! Those adorable eyes! That majestic presence! Oh, she's too wonderful for words!"
"Blonde Lilikin:If you want to talk flan again, you know where to find me!"
"Merchant Lilikin:You there, Jiant pair! Listen-disten, you're heardy at just the right time-ity-time! I've got a problem, so lend me a hiddy-hand?"
Merchant Lilikin:Yahooody-hoody-hoo! I'm so giddy-glad I asked you for help! We merchants are too busy-tizzy to do everything. Good luckedy-duckedy with the search-ity search.
"Merchant Lilikin:Well, hello-dee-lo there! Did you bringity-bring me what I asked you for? Wonder-under-ful!"
"Merchant Lilikin:Heydie-hey-hey. Just who I was lookit-ing for! Sorry to be a bother-other, but I've got another jobbity-job."
Merchant Lilikin:This is what I needy-need! Thanks a bunchy-bunch for doing this.
"Merchant Lilikin:What do we got heredy-here? Why, it's every-da-thing I needed! I'm giddy-glad I asked you for help!"
"Merchant Lilikin:Heydie-hey-hey! So there you are! Things may be dire around these heredy parts, but I've still got a jobbity-job for you."
Merchant Lilikin:I can see that I'm in excellent handy-hands! How very reassuring.
"Merchant Lilikin:Well, hello-dee-lo there! Did you bringity-bring me what I asked you for? Wonder-under-ful!"
"Merchant Lilikin:Heydie-hey-hey. Just who I was lookit-ing for! Sorry to be a bother-other, but I've got another jobbity-job."
Merchant Lilikin:This is what I needy-need! Thanks a bunchy-bunch for doing this.
"Merchant Lilikin:What do we got heredy-here? Why, it's every-da-thing I needed! I'm giddy-glad I asked you for help!"
"Merchant Lilikin:Heydie-hey-hey! So there you are! Things may be dire around these heredy parts, but I've still got a jobbity-job for you."
Merchant Lilikin:I can see that I'm in excellent handy-hands! How very reassuring.
Merchant Lilikin:You really came through-dee-through for me. I am truly in your debty-debt!
"Merchant Lilikin:You Jiants have been a great big helpity-help to me. Thanks to you, business is boomy-booming better than ever before!"
"Female Lilikin:I can't stand it, I can't stand it, I can't stand it! Oh, I can't stand it. Why do those Mirages insist on causing me trouble?"
Female Lilikin:Hurry up and take care of those Mirages for me!
"Female Lilikin:Bravo, bravo! You two are even more competent than I anticipated. Now I can finally enjoy my afternoon tea."
"Female Lilikin:There you are. I've been waiting for you. There's another batch of Mirages standing between me and my tea. You'll take care of these for me too, won't you?"
"Female Lilikin:Get rid of them for me, and I'll make sure you're well rewarded."
Female Lilikin:This means that the tea leaves I ordered will finally get here. Splendid!
"Female Lilikin:There you are. I've been waiting for you. There's another batch of Mirages standing between me and my tea. You'll take care of these for me too, won't you?"
"Female Lilikin:Take care of this quickly, please. Tea leaves lose their flavor if they sit for too long..."
Female Lilikin:Ha ha ha ha! This is what happens to those who stand between me and my tea!
Female Lilikin:Now there's nothing stopping me from enjoying a nice hot cup of tea. Thank you. Your help has been invaluable.
"Soldier:Ugh... What a pain... Huh? Say, you wouldn't happen to be the Jiants from the Hills, would you?"
Soldier:Good luck out there!
"Soldier:Hey, you're back! Thanks for doing my job for me... I mean, boy, does my arm hurt like the dickens!"
"Soldier:Ehh... Man, I don't want to work..."
