"BOUNTY!
The Sturmbeorn raiders are a threat to the Estherian people and to the brave settlers of the Empire. Commander Vale is authorized to pay a reward to anyone who assists the Vanquisher Corps in ridding the Temple Steppes of these savage brutes.
This bounty shall be paid to anyone who slays 10 or more Sturmbeorn in the Temple Steppes.";intro
The Sturmbeorn have been conducting raids in northeastern Vilderan for generations. However, their current leader, General Grell, has brought them together in unprecedented numbers. So long as Grell and his Sturmbeorn are able to roam the area freely, the Temple Steppes will not be safe for either the Estherians or the Empire's subjects settling in Vilderan.;return

Commander Vale of the Vanquisher Corps is offering a reward to anyone who can help thin out the packs of Warbeasts hampering colonization and defense efforts in Estheria.

Packs of Warbeasts infest certain key areas of the Temple Steppes. The invading Sturmbeorn armies use the Warbeasts as shock troops in their war against the Estherian people, hindering efforts to settle the area. The Empire needs capable adventurers to dispatch these beasts and pave the way for colonization efforts.;return

"Greetings!  I am the great bard Trill.  You've heard of me of course, my talent is known throughout all of Veras.  From Torchlight to Redhaven they sing of my.. songs.
Torchlight... did something happen there?  I feel a bit...  Ah, nevermind.  I recognize this place!
The spiders called, the Sisters three, the old trunk yawning wide,
Through ancient halls, dark ancestry, they met their fates inside.
An apt verse, you'll agree.  I wrote it myself of course.";intro
"The spiders called, the Sisters three, the old trunk yawning wide,
Through ancient halls, dark ancestry, they met their fates inside.
The rest of the song eludes me... Leniency please!  Of course such a lapse is unforgivable in a great bard such as myself, but I feel a bit.. off.
Still, even that bare fragment of verse can lead you to glory.  Go forth, brave warrior, and slay the mighty beasts!  Whatever they may be...";return

If I'm really lucky, we didn't lose too much hydraulic pressure on the purge line.;passive
There's a rumor that the Ezrohir have defeated the Guardian of Mana.  Is this true?;passive
Keep your eyes open for the Manticore, particularly around the Stygian Approach.  It likes to hunt the Wastes from the air.;passive
Any sign of Ezrohir troop movement out there?  Are they mobilizing yet?;passive
I'm starting to make evacuation plans ... just in case.;passive
I will lay down my life for my people ... if only to buy them time to flee.;passive
If the Guardian of Mana returns here, we might have a chance against the Alchemist.;passive
You've spoken to the Guardian of Air, about the Ossean Wastes?  You know the risks, then?  Alright.  Good luck out there.;passive
The Guardian of Air has ordered the gate to the Empty Quarter sealed.  If the Guardian gives you leave, then I can allow you to pass.;passive
It seems I have not yet earned my eternal rest.  Your part in my story is done, though, and, if my gratitude means anything to you, you have it.;passive
Just because this mana rift didn't pan out, that doesn't mean there's not another one on my surveys that might work much, much better!  It's just going to take a while to determine which mana rift is the best bet.;passive
Thank you again, my friend.  When we've recovered from our injuries, we'll retrieve our companions from the Undercurrents and return to help defend Zeryphesh.;passive
You've given us a fighting chance, hero.  Thank you.;passive
Now that you have defeated the Ezrohir sorcerer in the tower, Zeryphesh is a great deal safer.  We still have to prepare ourselves for the coming siege ... but you've made that task a lot easier!;passive
We lost serious pressure in the primary Ember feed.  We've got an auxiliary line ... but that's no way to get around!;passive
Are the crew of the Embercraft safe out there, while they work on their vehicle?;passive
You're actually going after the Manticore?  Best of luck, my friend.  That beast is said to be indestructible.;passive
There's definitely Ezrohir activity in both the Forsaken Vaults and the Salt Barrens.;passive
The Guardian of Air warns us that, should you fail to rescue the Guardian of Mana, we might wish to consider evacuating the city.;passive
Have you investigated the Cursed Cave of Fear?  The Ezrohir used it as a base of operations during the Ember Wars, and parts of it are still intact.;passive
The Alchemist's goal all along may have been to capture the Guardian of Mana.  But that does not explain why he has yet to mobilize the Ezrohir against me.;passive
I heard the Sphinx sent you to kill the Manticore in the Stygian Aerie.  I'm guessing you were successful?;passive
"The Empty Quarter sealed is still closed off; we're expecting the Ezrohir to attack from that direction.  If the Guardian gives you leave, then I can allow you to pass.";passive
It seems I have not yet earned my eternal rest.  Your part in my story is done, though, and, if my gratitude means anything to you, you have it.;passive

Thank you again, my friend.  When we've recovered from our injuries, we'll retrieve our companions from the Undercurrents and return to help defend Zeryphesh.;passive
You've given us a fighting chance, hero.  Thank you.;passive
When the siege begins, will you be here to help defend the city?;passive
Repairs are going a lot faster now ... but it's still going to take time.;passive
Is Fazeer Shah insane, or he is deliberately delaying you?  Is this some petty vengeance for Malik Vosh imprisoning him, so long ago?;passive
The djinn aren't like humans, or Zeraphi, or even the Guardians.  Theirs is an ancient magic, that doesn't follow any understood rules of alchemy or elementalism.;passive
The Salt Barrens used to be a harbor town, until Fazeer Shah and Ezrek Khan started fighting.  Remember that, if you ever start thinking that either of those djinn are on your side.;passive
You've been out there.  You've faced the Ezrohir ... seen the strength of their army.  Do you think we have a chance?;passive
Did you investigate the Ancient Vaults of Chaos?  Did you find anything there that might help you rescue the Guardian ... or help us hold off the Ezrohir?;passive
If the Alchemist is doing all of the planning for the Ezrohir, he may be stalling until I leave the city ... whereupon he will surely arrange to ambush me.;passive
"What a strange set of tasks for the djinni to assign you.  He's up to something; he's got ulterior motives in all of this.";passive
There have been strange lights coming from the direction of the Salt Barrens.  Did the djinni have something to do with that?;passive
It seems I have not yet earned my eternal rest.  Your part in my story is done, though, and, if my gratitude means anything to you, you have it.;passive
Just because this mana rift didn't pan out, that doesn't mean there's not another one on my surveys that might work much, much better!  It's just going to take a while to determine which mana rift is the best bet.;passive
Thank you again, my friend.  When we've recovered from our injuries, we'll retrieve our companions from the Undercurrents and return to help defend Zeryphesh.;passive
You've given us a fighting chance, hero.  Thank you.;passive
The siege will begin soon.  I hope we're ready for it.;passive
Now that you have defeated the Ezrohir sorcerer in the tower, Zeryphesh is a great deal safer.  We still have to prepare ourselves for the coming siege ... but you've made that task a lot easier!;passive
Now that the Crab King is gone, the crabs should disperse, as well.  The Zeraphi will recover the weapons the Crab King gathered, and dispose of them safely.  At the very least, the Ezrohir won't be using them against Zeryphesh.;passive
I knew that boiler was dodgy!  I can fix it, but it'll take time ...;passive
I am confident that, should it come to war, the Guardians will be more than able to defend the city.;passive
I've heard that the Ezrohir are massing by the Forsaken Gate.  I wonder how they got past the Sphinx?;passive
The Guardian of Air will be able to provide us some support, but only inside the city walls.  If it should fall while flying outside, we won't be able to reach it for a rescue.;passive
Zeryphesh is my home.  If it's destroyed by the Alchemist and the Ezrohir, I will die with it.;passive
I'm actually rather surprised the Ezrohir have been able to move about the Ossean Wastes at all, with the Manticore making its lair out there, in the Stygian Aerie.;passive
Now that you have defeated the Ezrohir sorcerer in the tower, Zeryphesh is a great deal safer.  We still have to prepare ourselves for the coming siege ... but you've made that task a lot easier!;passive
The Guardian of Air has ordered the gate to the Empty Quarter sealed.  If the Guardian gives you leave, then I can allow you to pass.;passive
If you haven't yet spoken to the Guardian of Air, I must caution you:  The Ossean Wastes are not safe during this siege.  If you get into trouble, we cannot send a rescue party.;passive
It seems I have not yet earned my eternal rest.  Your part in my story is done, though, and, if my gratitude means anything to you, you have it.;passive
Just because this mana rift didn't pan out, that doesn't mean there's not another one on my surveys that might work much, much better!  It's just going to take a while to determine which mana rift is the best bet.;passive
Thank you again, my friend.  When we've recovered from our injuries, we'll retrieve our companions from the Undercurrents and return to help defend Zeryphesh.;passive
You've given us a fighting chance, hero.  Thank you.;passive
Do you think there's a connection between that business with the Guardians in Estheria and the Ezrohir suddenly deciding to attack us again?;passive
I'd heard you were headed down to Zeryphesh, to look for the Alchemist.  What are you doing back here?;passive
Weren't you going to Zeryphesh?  Is the Alchemist not there?;passive
I am deeply troubled by those notes you found in the Icedeep Caverns.  I have notified the Enclave that I will remain here, to guard the caves, and prevent any of the Alchemist's notes and paraphernalia from being lost.;passive
I contacted the Commander, and she's sending a team to secure the caverns until we can do a more thorough sweep of the place.  If we find anything that might help with the Alchemist, we'll send word.;passive
I can help, but I need more time to finish repairs.  Can you buy me half a day?  Maybe a little more?;passive
Why can't Fazeer Shah just open a portal into the heart of Riftkeep?  You could rescue the Guardian of Mana and be out before the Ezrohir knew you were there!;passive
The djinn aren't like humans, or Zeraphi, or even the Guardians.  Theirs is an ancient magic, that doesn't follow any understood rules of alchemy or elementalism.;passive
The Salt Barrens used to be a harbor town, until Fazeer Shah and Ezrek Khan started fighting.  Remember that, if you ever start thinking that either of those djinn are on your side.;passive
It's very brave of you to face the challenges of the djinni, on our behalf.;passive
Did you investigate the Ancient Vaults of Chaos?  Did you find anything there that might help you rescue the Guardian ... or help us hold off the Ezrohir?;passive
Enslaved to the Ezrohir, the Guardian of Mana is a potent weapon.  We must do whatever it takes to release her from their control.;passive
Fazeer Shah sent you to wipe out the Tu'tara?  I don't understand.  Why would he do that?;passive
You were in some sort of Nether-version of the Empty Quarter?  That's … unsettling, because there was a strange, cold wind blowing out of the Empty Quarter while you were gone.;passive
It seems I have not yet earned my eternal rest.  Your part in my story is done, though, and, if my gratitude means anything to you, you have it.;passive
Just because this mana rift didn't pan out, that doesn't mean there's not another one on my surveys that might work much, much better!  It's just going to take a while to determine which mana rift is the best bet.;passive

Repairing the boiler's the easy part ... but if any of those valves are damaged, we might be stuck here.;passive
The story of the Guardian's disappearance is spreading.  Just what did happen out there?;passive
Keep your eyes open for the Manticore, particularly around the Stygian Approach.  It likes to hunt the Wastes from the air.;passive
Any sign of Ezrohir troop movement out there?  Are they mobilizing yet?;passive
Zeryphesh is my home ... and I'm going to fight to keep it that way.;passive
There's a rumor that the Guardian of Mana has fallen in battle.  Is this true?;passive
Without the Guardian of Mana, the coming battle will play out very differently.;passive
We're seeing a few troops coming back in from out of the Ossean Wastes.  They say you're doing good work out there.  Keep it up!;passive
The Guardian of Air has ordered the gate to the Empty Quarter sealed.  If the Guardian gives you leave, then I can allow you to pass.;passive
It seems I have not yet earned my eternal rest.  Your part in my story is done, though, and, if my gratitude means anything to you, you have it.;passive

Thank you again, my friend.  When we've recovered from our injuries, we'll retrieve our companions from the Undercurrents and return to help defend Zeryphesh.;passive
You've given us a fighting chance, hero.  Thank you.;passive
The Ezrohir must be involved somehow in the disappearance of the Guardian.  It's the only explanation that makes sense.;passive
Now that you have defeated the Ezrohir sorcerer in the tower, Zeryphesh is a great deal safer.  We still have to prepare ourselves for the coming siege ... but you've made that task a lot easier!;passive
I wish I could help, but this Embercraft is my only real weapon ... and it's not going anywhere, anytime soon.;passive
Getting into Riftkeep to rescue the Guardian of Mana won't be easy.  You'll almost certainly have to use the Witherways, which means fighting your way through a host of Ezrohir warriors.;passive
If you can't find anything of value in the shipwrecks of the Sand Shoals, it could be that something else out there has already been there, looting.  The Ezrohir, perhaps?;passive
How's it look in the Salt Barrens?  Any sign of the Ezrohir advancing toward the city?;passive
If you defeat the Ezrohir at Riftkeep, and free the Guardian of Mana, this war will basically be over.  Do you think you can do it?;passive
The Ancient Vaults of Chaos are full of old artifacts ... things we Zeraphi sealed away, lest they fall into the wrong hands.  The Ezrohir are almost certainly there, looting the place, as we speak.;passive
Without the Artificer, the Ezrohir may have to rely on the Alchemist to do their planning, and he seems like he has an agenda very different from theirs.;passive
How are things going with Fazeer Shah?;passive
Is Fazeer Shah as mad as they say?;passive
It seems I have not yet earned my eternal rest.  Your part in my story is done, though, and, if my gratitude means anything to you, you have it.;passive
Just because this mana rift didn't pan out, that doesn't mean there's not another one on my surveys that might work much, much better!  It's just going to take a while to determine which mana rift is the best bet.;passive

Now that the Crab King is gone, the crabs should disperse, as well.  The Zeraphi will recover the weapons the Crab King gathered, and dispose of them safely.  At the very least, the Ezrohir won't be using them against Zeryphesh.;passive
Of course you have to break down in the desert in the hottest part of the year ...!;passive
Why have the Ezrohir not attacked yet?;passive
What if this is another of the djinni's tests?  What if Fazeer Shah wants the Guardian of Mana to die?;passive
What did you learn from Fazeer Shah?  Can you free the Guardian?;passive
You've been out there.  You've faced the Ezrohir ... seen the strength of their army.  Do you think we have a chance?;passive
Did you investigate the Ancient Vaults of Chaos?  Did you find anything there that might help you rescue the Guardian ... or help us hold off the Ezrohir?;passive
"It cannot be much longer now.  A confrontation of some kind is inevitable; it merely remains to be seen where, exactly.";passive
I have honored my bargain!  To trouble me further is to invoke my wrath!;passive
Is that it, then?  No more crazy djinni errands?  Now you can go rescue the Guardian of Mana?;passive
Sounds like you're in the final stretch.  Good luck.  We know you'll do your best.;passive
It seems I have not yet earned my eternal rest.  Your part in my story is done, though, and, if my gratitude means anything to you, you have it.;passive

This is the burden of immortality:  You live long enough to see the death of your entire civilization ...;passive
Now that you have defeated the Ezrohir sorcerer in the tower, Zeryphesh is a great deal safer.  We still have to prepare ourselves for the coming siege ... but you've made that task a lot easier!;passive

I wish I could help, but this Embercraft is my only real weapon ... and it's not going anywhere, anytime soon.;passive
Have you face Tu'tara before?  They're nasty, savage lizard-men, who attack our caravans and steal our trade goods.;passive
The Zeraphi and Ezrohir were once one people.  But we differed, ideologically, and sought other means of attaining eternal life ...;passive
There's been activity in the Salt Barrens ... perhaps the Ezrohir took the Guardian there?;passive
The timetable for preparing the city's defenses has moved up dramatically in the past few hours.  If you can't actually rescue the Guardian, can you try to buy us some time?;passive
The Ancient Vaults of Chaos are full of old artifacts ... things we Zeraphi sealed away, lest they fall into the wrong hands.  The Ezrohir are almost certainly there, looting the place, as we speak.;passive
"Now we know why the Ezrohir haven't moved earlier;  they were waiting for the Artificer to finish forging the Guardian's bonds.";passive
I hear the Guardian of Air sent you out to the Salt Barrens, to negotiate with the djinni.  I'm glad it's you, and not me.;passive
I think you've pretty well proven yourself against the Artificer.  Still, an Ezrohir, even one as powerful as the Artificer, is a far cry from a djinni.;passive
It seems I have not yet earned my eternal rest.  Your part in my story is done, though, and, if my gratitude means anything to you, you have it.;passive
Just because this mana rift didn't pan out, that doesn't mean there's not another one on my surveys that might work much, much better!  It's just going to take a while to determine which mana rift is the best bet.;passive

I wish I could help, but this Embercraft is my only real weapon ... and it's not going anywhere, anytime soon.;passive
People are starting to say that the Guardian of Mana wasn't actually captured, but that it's in league with the Ezrohir.;passive
You'll be passing through the Sand Shoals, once you reach the Salt Barrens.  That entire area was the harbor for our ships, centuries ago.  Keep an eye open:  We didn't salvage everything, and you might find something useful.;passive
Good luck in the Empty Quarter.  We had to close access to it years ago:  It pretty much belongs to the Tu'tara now ... and a host of Dune Fiends.;passive
Quite a few Zeraphi soldiers have made it back from the Ossean Wastes, and they've got you to thank for that.;passive
Have you investigated the Cursed Cave of Fear?  The Ezrohir used it as a base of operations during the Ember Wars, and parts of it are still intact.;passive
"Now we know why the Ezrohir haven't moved earlier;  they were waiting for the Artificer to finish forging the Guardian's bonds.";passive
"There's been activity in the Salt Barrens; that must be where the rest of the Ezrohir are massing before the final assault.";passive
The siege will begin soon.  I hope we're ready for it.;passive

You killed the Manticore?  You must be more dangerous than you look.;passive
Now that you have defeated the Ezrohir sorcerer in the tower, Zeryphesh is a great deal safer.  We still have to prepare ourselves for the coming siege ... but you've made that task a lot easier!;passive
Now that the Crab King is gone, the crabs should disperse, as well.  The Zeraphi will recover the weapons the Crab King gathered, and dispose of them safely.  At the very least, the Ezrohir won't be using them against Zeryphesh.;passive
The Alchemist just murdered a lot of good people, for no reason at all!  You haven't talked to the Professor, have you?;passive
We've got a lot of injuries, here ... but it could've been a lot worse.  As powerful as the Alchemist is, we got real lucky.;passive
Are you sure you want to go out there?  Maybe you should have a word with Professor Stoker, first.;passive
Unless it's an emergency, I have to keep this gate closed.  If any of the ... things on the other side get in here, they'll finish what the Alchemist started.;passive
Just because this mana rift didn't pan out, that doesn't mean there's not another one on my surveys that might work much, much better!  It's just going to take a while to determine which mana rift is the best bet.;passive
Thank you again, my friend.  When we've recovered from our injuries, we'll retrieve our companions from the Undercurrents and return to help defend Zeryphesh.;passive
You've given us a fighting chance, hero.  Thank you.;passive
The Ezrohir are in flight, and word is getting back from Zeryphesh that their defeat is your doing, and that the Guardian of Mana is safe.  Outstanding work, human!;passive
Is it true?  The Ezrohir are defeated?;passive
I appreciate you coming all the way back here, but shouldn't you be going after the Alchemist?;passive
What in the name of the Guardians are you doing back here?  We've got the Estherian Steppes handled.;passive
Do not worry about us.  Zeryphesh is safe, now that you have rescued the Guardian of Mana from the Ezrohir.  Find the Alchemist.  Stopping him is the key to saving the world.;passive
She'll be ready to go when you are ... I promise!;passive
Why have the Ezrohir not attacked yet?;passive
What if this is another of the djinni's tests?  What if Fazeer Shah wants the Guardian of Mana to die?;passive
Do you think you can free the Guardian?  Or will saving the Zeraphi require destroying her?;passive
You've been out there.  You've faced the Ezrohir ... seen the strength of their army.  Do you think we have a chance?;passive
We will do whatever it takes to buy you the time you need.;passive
The time to strike is now!  The Ezrohir will not be expecting an attack inside their own stronghold!;passive
I have honored my bargain!  To trouble me further is to invoke my wrath!;passive
Do what you have to do, my friend.  Even if you cannot prevent the Ezrohir from attacking the city, you must save the Guardian of Mana.;passive
Sounds like you're in the final stretch.  Good luck.  We know you'll do your best.;passive
It seems I have not yet earned my eternal rest.  Your part in my story is done, though, and, if my gratitude means anything to you, you have it.;passive

Now that you have defeated the Ezrohir sorcerer in the tower, Zeryphesh is a great deal safer.  We still have to prepare ourselves for the coming siege ... but you've made that task a lot easier!;passive
Now that the Crab King is gone, the crabs should disperse, as well.  The Zeraphi will recover the weapons the Crab King gathered, and dispose of them safely.  At the very least, the Ezrohir won't be using them against Zeryphesh.;passive
No ... no ... no!  The welds aren't holding!  Come on, you miserable hunk of scrap!;passive
Zeryphesh is saved!;passive
You have done well, human.  The Zeraphi owe you a tremendous debt.;passive
Zeryphesh is saved!;passive
I am actually quite relieved that I was never called upon to fight ...;passive
The Alchemist must have fled when he saw that the Ezrohir could not further his goals.  He cannot be far ahead of you, now!;passive
I have honored my bargain!  To trouble me further is to invoke my wrath!;passive
My power is drained ... but it is the nature of magic that it will return to me sevenfold.;passive
Praise the day you came to our city!;passive
The people of Zeryphesh will long remember what you did here today.;passive
It seems I have not yet earned my eternal rest.  Your part in my story is done, though, and, if my gratitude means anything to you, you have it.;passive

As you know, the Ezrohir are preparing to assault our city.  Our military leader, Commander Muzaffar, has apparently been captured by the Ezrohir, out in the Ossean Wastes.  They'll have sent for inquisitors to take their prisoners back to their stronghold.

"So!  You retrieved the Lamp of Wonders!  Your pitiful struggles do provide some small entertainment after all.
You can throw that piece of  junk away.  It's just a lamp with a pretentious name. It doesn't actually do anything, although I suppose you could put some oil in it and use it to provide light ...
This second task should prove much more amusing.";complete
"I suppose you're wondering why I need the Lamp of Wonders.  Perhaps you're thinking it has powers that will enable me to help you.  Perhaps you're also thinking that, if it has powers like that, you don't need me ... you just need the lamp?
Allow me to put your mind at rest:  The Lamp of Wonders has no powers.  I simply want to make you retrieve it, to test your resolve to rescue the Guardian ... which I can't help but notice you haven't done yet.";return
"The Artificer and the Alchemist might be formidable, but even their combined powers are nothing more than parlor tricks to one such as me.  I can easily undo anything that they have done to your ""Guardian.""  I will of course require something in return.
My only real enemy in this desert is boredom.  I will make you a bargain:  Perform three tasks for my amusement.  If your struggles provide suitable entertainment, then, and only then, will I free your Guardian.
Your first task: Journey to the Sadwa Mesa, and recover my Lamp of Wonders from the Tu'tara!";intro
The djinni, Fazeer Shah, has agreed to help you free the Guardian of Mana ... but only if you perform a few tasks for his amusement first.  Fazeer Shah doesn't seem to understand the gravity of the situation ... or just doesn't care ... but, if this is the only way to rescue the Guardian, there doesn't seem to be much choice.;moredetails
Every time I stand up, I get maybe ten steps before everything gets all fuzzy and dark.;passive
The Destroyer really can't help you.  It's going to be several more days before he can get around ... let alone fight!;passive
The Destroyer was saying that the Alchemist got here even before we did ... which might explain the devastation we saw, on the way up, and in the pass.;passive
The ratlins and the Sturmbeorn have all but disappeared, though we've noticed quite a few more warbeasts prowling around since you were here last.;passive
Please ... go to the Watchweald Temple.  Bring back the Grand Regent.  Only he can save us now!;passive
Remember us, human.  Remember the Guardian you saved.  Remember the Estherians you could not.;passive
It seems that the illness the Alchemist brought upon us will do what the Sturmbeorn failed to accomplish.;passive
A lot of affected Estherians have set off for the Watchweald Temple, in hopes of receiving some relief from this terrible fever.;passive
Not a lot of foot traffic headed this way anymore.;passive
Let me see your authorization.  Alright ... this looks in order.  Be careful out there.;passive
You have lifted the curse I brought upon myself, and my torment is finally at an end.  I will abide here a while, I think, before I move on to my final reward.  Perhaps, at the very least, I will tell my story to would-be thieves, to save them from a similar fate ...;passive
We will be moving along shortly.  Some of our injured need a bit longer to recover, before they are ready to travel.  Remember, if you should find yourself in Zeryphesh, please seek me out!;passive
It looks like the Alchemist was doing some kind of research in there, but he bugged out, probably right before he went to Torchlight.;passive
I am deeply troubled by those notes you found in the Icedeep Caverns.  I have notified the Enclave that I will remain here, to guard the caves, and prevent any of the Alchemist's notes and paraphernalia from being lost.;passive
Lots of the Estherians are heading out of the city through this pass.  We've got orders not to stop them ... but they don't look well, some of 'em.;passive
I miss my husband so much ... but luckily I still have my little baby-wabies ...;passive
Did you make it up to the Enclave?  Did you speak to Commander Vale?;passive
What brought you back here?  Are the Sturmbeorn heading back this way?;passive
We were supposed to rescue some Estherians from these slavers, but the slavers had reinforcements.  We did find out that their leader, Kidrik, is holed up in a grotto under the lake.;passive
See those burned-out huts in the stockade?  We did that, to smoke the slavers out.  Just smash the lanterns, and the huts'll go up like kindling.  They'll come out right quick ...;passive

Good job you did, getting the Commander out of there!;passive

We're just picking up some cargo and supplies, before we head off down to Zeryphesh.  What brings you here?";passive
You're doing a great job out there.  The Commander's pleased with your results, and the Estherians are calling you a hero.;passive
All quiet here, more or less.  Hey, good work you did, getting the Commander out of the Wellspring!;passive
Things are pretty safe here, now.  How are things out on the Temple Steppes?;passive
I am so sorry.  You did all that work to recover the Scroll of Anom-Irek ... and now the Grand Regent says we will not be needing it!;passive
Seems like the pass and the steppes are a lot safer, since you came through!  Good work out there!;passive
You must do all you can to locate the Grand Regent!  He is far too ill to visit the Watchweald Temple.  He might infect the Guardian!;passive
Ever since the Alchemist's attack, there has been a sickness in the Enclave.  Grand Regent Eldrayn has sent my cousin, Miamin, out into the Path of the Honored Dead to seek a cure.;passive
"The Guardians are not gods, as humans seem to believe.  They are elementals ... the most powerful in the world.  By their very existence they create the elements; by the power of their will, they control the elements.  Without them, the world is chaos.";passive
Before the Sturmbeorn arrived, my brother had gone up into the Path of the Honored Dead to perform the Ceremony of Tranquility.  He has not yet returned.  I fear for his safety!;passive
The Vanquishers came to help us with the Sturmbeorn problem, but when their leader, Commander Vale, learned that it was the Alchemist who had attacked us, she seemed ... sad.  Were they friends once?;passive
We've tangled with the Sturmbeorn a few times since we got here.  Them or the ratlins jump us every time we try to move supplies up the pass, to the Estherian city.  I hope the Commander comes back with some relief soon.;passive
You're a strong one to survive this pass, but there are even greater dangers in the Temple Steppes.  Be sure you're ready before you venture any further from the Enclave.;passive

The statue stares placidly into its pool.;passive
"Keep your eyes open out here.  We know the Sturmbeorn are in the pass; we can hear 'em messing around with the Estherian crypts.";passive
"The pass here is pretty straightforward:  just follow the road, and you'll be fine.
Of course, you'll still want to keep an eye out for the bear-men.";passive
You two are lucky to have made it this far, seeing as how badly wounded the Destroyer is.  But I think you're on your own now, from here to the Enclave.  The Destroyer can barely stand ... let alone fight his way through all those Sturmbeorn in the pass.;passive
The Enclave is this way, up Echo Pass. What with the ratlins and the Sturmbeorn, it can be dangerous.  So if you're not sure you're ready, you should get your bearings here first.;passive
"The pass is infested with ratlins, and there's some Sturmbeorn raiders, too.   They pretty much control the pass right now;  we can't get any troops through.  Every time we try, we end up with more wounded.";passive
I'm sorry, but access to the Path of the Honored Dead is closed, by order of the Estherian Grand Regent.;passive
I'm sorry, but I can't let you through here without authorization from Commander Vale, or the Estherian Grand Regent.;passive
The Commander went to the Wellspring Temple.  She should be back any time.;passive
I thank you for rescuing me.  There are other captives, as well, in a cave below the lake.  There is a hatch, just outside that nearby hut, which leads to the slavers' den.;passive
You have lifted the curse I brought upon myself, and my torment is finally at and end.  I will abide here a while, I think, before I move on to my final reward.  Perhaps, at the very least, I will tell my story to would-be thieves, to save them from a similar fate ...;passive
It was a brutal fight, getting up here through that bear-infested pass.  We lost a lot of good soldiers, and most of who we have left are injured.;passive
You sidle up to the horse.  It sidles away.;passive
I really appreciate you checking on me, but you should probably get on with catching up with the Grand Regent.;passive
The Destroyer really can't help you.  It's going to be several more days before he can get around ... let alone fight!;passive
All clear in the pass?;passive
All's quiet here.  How are things further up the pass?;passive
Hey, if you're heading back to the Enclave, can you check with the Commander?  See if she needs us to pull back to the Enclave?;passive
Listen:  If I you find me dead ... please, bury me somewhere with a view ...;passive
I would very much like to see the Frosted Hills again, before I die.;passive
This is not the first time something like this has happened.  Once before, more than a thousand years ago, a plague like this struck the Retreat, in the Frosted Hills.  In the end, all the Estherians there fled, or died ... twisted in horrible ways ...;passive
I used to live in the Retreat, in the Frosted Hills.  We had to leave, though ... there was a plague.  Heh ... ironic, isn't it, that an illness forced me to leave ... and another illness makes me want to return?;passive
Not a lot of foot traffic headed this way anymore.;passive

Good job you did, getting the Commander out of there!;passive
We should be able to get the Estherians back home.  Thanks for getting them out of there.;passive

A lot more of the Estherians are getting sick.  That's not a good sign.;passive

You must do all you can to stop the Grand Regent!  He is far too ill to visit the Watchweald Temple.  He might infect the Guardian!;passive
Sorry, but I don't think I'm going to be any use to you.  The medic here says that I've got broken ribs ... probably from when the Alchemist swatted me all the way out of Torchlight.;passive
Would you please tell him you're doing just fine?  He keeps trying to head up the pass to go help you ... and I'm the one who has to pick him up and put him back together, every time.;passive
What brought you back here?  Are the Sturmbeorn heading back this way?;passive
If the Alchemist already has Ordrak's Heart, what's he doing attacking Guardians?  I don't see what it gets him.;passive
The ratlins and the Sturmbeorn have all but disappeared, though we've noticed quite a few more warbeasts prowling around since you were here last.;passive
My sister has returned from the Path of the Honored Dead with the Scroll of Anom-Irek.  We must try to hold on until the Grand Regent can return and effect the cure to this sickness.;passive
Grand Regent Eldrayn is the oldest and wisest of the Estherians: a paragon of virtue and compassion, as well as our most accomplished elementalist.  So long as he protects us, the Estherians will endure.;passive
I spoke with Grand Regent Eldrayn before he left for the Watchweald Temple.  He seemed ... tired.;passive
I have always been led to believe that the Guardians could correct any imbalance, cure any ill.  Why have they not come to our aid?  Could the Alchemist have struck at the temples also?;passive
You're already cleared for the pass.  Good luck out there.;passive

Meet me back in the Estherian Enclave, and I can enchant your gear!;passive
It's pretty clear the Alchemist was here, but bugged out, probably right before he went to Torchlight.  The place is still full of monsters, though, so watch your back in there.;passive

Hey, if you're heading back to the Enclave, can you check with the Commander?  See if she needs us to pull back to the Enclave?;passive
It grieves me that the Grand Regent is ... that he is dead.  But now that the Guardian of the Wild is free of Netherim influence, I can feel my own fever abating.;passive
The Estherians owe you a tremendous debt of gratitude.  Thanks to you, we will continue to endure.;passive
It seems that even the Grand Regent was not strong enough to fight off the Netherim corruption.  As I recall, he was one of those who had survived the plague at the Retreat.  Perhaps some small seed of the Nether-Beasts had taken root in his spirit, and left him vulnerable once again ...;passive
I should have known it was a Netherim plague!  The strange thoughts I had, the desire to leave the city ... it was exactly as it was, a thousand years ago, when the Netherim wormed their way into the Retreat.;passive
Word is that you met not one, but two Guardians!  What was that like?;passive
You're all set.  Keep up the good work!;passive
Everything's just about loaded, and my chief engineer is building up the boiler pressure.  You about ready to head out?;passive
"You're headed to the Ossean Wastes now?  Watch yourself down there; they say there's a war brewing, betweent the Zeraphi and the Ezrohir.";passive

Did you make it up to the Enclave?  Did you speak to Commander Vale?;passive
We should be able to get the Estherians back home.  Thanks for getting them out of there.;passive
Nice work you did in there.;passive
Seems like your work here is pretty much done.  Maybe a little bit of mop-up here and there.  Do you know where you're headed next?;passive
I am confident that, should it come to war, the Guardians will be more than able to defend the city.;passive
I've heard that the Ezrohir are massing by the Forsaken Gate.  I wonder how they got past the Sphinx?;passive
The Guardian of Air will be able to provide us some support, but only inside the city walls.  If it should fall while flying outside, we won't be able to reach it for a rescue.;passive
Zeryphesh is my home.  If it's destroyed by the Alchemist and the Ezrohir, I will die with it.;passive
I'm actually rather surprised the Ezrohir have been able to move about the Ossean Wastes at all, with the Manticore making its lair out there, in the Stygian Aerie.;passive
Now that you have defeated the Ezrohir sorcerer in the tower, Zeryphesh is a great deal safer.  We still have to prepare ourselves for the coming siege ... but you've made that task a lot easier!;passive
The Guardian of Air has ordered the gate to the Empty Quarter sealed.  If the Guardian gives you leave, then I can allow you to pass.;passive
If you haven't yet spoken to the Guardian of Air, I must caution you:  The Ossean Wastes are not safe during this siege.  If you get into trouble, we cannot send a rescue party.;passive
It seems I have not yet earned my eternal rest.  Your part in my story is done, though, and, if my gratitude means anything to you, you have it.;passive
Just because this mana rift didn't pan out, that doesn't mean there's not another one on my surveys that might work much, much better!  It's just going to take a while to determine which mana rift is the best bet.;passive
Thank you again, my friend.  When we've recovered from our injuries, we'll retrieve our companions from the Undercurrents and return to help defend Zeryphesh.;passive
You've given us a fighting chance, hero.  Thank you.;passive
Do you think there's a connection between that business with the Guardians in Estheria and the Ezrohir suddenly deciding to attack us again?;passive
Weren't you headed to Zeryphesh?;passive
Seems like the Estherians are recovering nicely, thanks to you!;passive
Well, it seems there is an explanation for the Grand Regent's reticence to make use of the Scroll of Anom-Irek.  Who would have imagined that he would be vulnerable to possession by even the most powerful of Netherim?;passive
Seems like the pass and the steppes are a lot safer, since you came through!  Good work out there!;passive
"The ... Grand Regent was ... possessed?  By a Nether-Beast?
So ... the ""illness"" we thought he was spreading was some form of Netherim corruption?
I am so very, very confused right now.";passive

"The Destroyer, one of the famous ""Heroes of Torchlight,"" asked you to accompany him back to the scene of his greatest triumph:  the small mining town where he, the Vanquisher, and the Alchemist defeated the dragon Ordrak.  When you got there, though, a pitched battle was going on, between soldiers of the Vanquisher Corps, led by Syl the Seer ... and the Alchemist!
The armor-clad Alchemist had retrieved Ordrak's Heart and was laying waste to Torchlight.  When Syl fell in battle, the Destroyer realized that he couldn't stop the Alchemist ... and, instead turned his efforts toward warning the next nearest settlement.  Unfortunately, between the winding trail and the Destroyer's injuries, it took you days to get even this far ... and the Destroyer can't go on ...";moredetails

I think he might have contracted the same sickness affecting the other Estherians.;complete
"Back at the Enclave, you learned that a strange, magical sickness has been spreading among the Estherians ever since the Alchemist's attack.  There is also a strong possibility that Grand Regent Eldrayn is carrying the disease, and he is already en route to the Watchweald Temple, to see to the protection of the Guardian of the Wild.
If the Grand Regent spreads this mystery illness to the Guardian, it could mean the end of all plants and animals, everywhere in the world!";moredetails
"I must be on my way soon.  If the Alchemist is attacking Guardians, he will be after the Guardian, at the Watchweald Temple ... assuming the Vanquisher failed to stop him at the Wellspring.
The Guardians are immensely powerful beings.  They control the elements, and thus provide for life.  But they are not inviolate; a sufficiently powerful attacker could overcome them.  If the Alchemist was able to do so, then the threat he poses is greater than anything the world has faced since the Netherim invasion a millennium ago.";return

Apparently, things have gone from bad to worse while we were at the Wellspring.  Whatever was making the Estherians sick is spreading, and it's moved out into the lands north of here.  That's where the Grand Regent was headed.  If he's already reached the Watchweald, he'll have sealed the gates as a precaution ... which means that the whole temple could be turning into one big plague zone even as we speak.;complete
"The Alchemist must be stopped before he attacks any more Guardians!  Each time he siphons off our energy, the heart becomes more powerful ... and he becomes more dangerous.
You and Commander Vale should return to the Estherian Enclave, and plan your next move.";intro

So the Guardian wants you to head to the Ossean Wastes?  You know what?  I think I can help you with that ...";complete
"I fear the Alchemist is a pawn of the Netherim.  With Ordrak's Heart and the power of the Guardians, a portal to the Nether Realm could be thrown wide,  and the world would be plunged into an age of never-ending torment.
Return to the Enclave immediately.  Commander Vale can help you secure passage to the Ossean Wastes, where two of my fellow Guardians can be found.  Stop the Alchemist before he can drain them as well!";intro
"The Netherim, the Alchemist, and this plague are all connected.  Everywhere the Alchemist goes, Ordrak's Heart taints the nature of magic itself.  It creates a kind of infection ... not too dissimilar from Ember Blight.  These tiny infections grow, and, eventually, develop into a conduit for Netherim.  The victim becomes a host to the Netherim: a ""Nether-Thrall.""
This is what happened to the Estherians.  And, for some reason, the effect was stronger with the Grand Regent.  Perhaps he was exposed more directly when he battled the Alchemist.  In any case, the thing that possessed the Regent, the thing that attempted to possess me, is more powerful than the others:  It is a Nether-Beast ... one of the Netherim Kings who led the invasion of our world an age ago.  I am sure it will return, seeking vengeance.";return
"The mystery plague that was converting Estherians into Nether-Thralls had a much more devastating effect on Grand Regent Eldrayn.  The once-noble Estherian statesman had been completely possessed by one of the dreaded Netherim ... and the thing would have possessed the Guardian of the Wild, if you hadn't stopped it!
Meanwhile, the Alchemist has been attacking Guardians in order to siphon off their elemental energies and empower Ordrak's Heart ... with his ultimate goal apparently to destroy the fabled Clockwork Core and throw wide the gates to the nightmare realm of the Netherim!";moredetails

Someone needs to warn the Estherians.  Head up the pass to their Enclave.  Find my old friend, Commander Vale, and let her know what happened.";return
"I thank you for your warning, but it has arrived too late.  This ""Alchemist"" has already come and gone, and it was all I could do to prevent him from entering the Enclave.  As it was, many Estherians were injured, and, since the confrontation, several more have become ill.  We are not sure what is causing it.

Accordingly, I must construct a suit of Ember-resistant armor, to shield me from the worst of the effects.""";return
